Will the Prime Minister bring to the notice of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the provisions of the Broadcasting Act which stipulate that equal facilities shall be provided for the broadcasting of the views of all political parties, with the object of having an equal period of free broadcasting time made available to the Leader of the Opposition? the final purpose of the honourable gentleman's questions is supposed to be. AmI supposed to ask broadcasting stations to provide free broadcasting time, or is the honourable member genuinely concerned about the establishment of the royal commission to inquire into television? To begin at the end and work back, I am making some broadcasts gentleman has disguised his pleasure extremely well on other occasions. I am not an expert, but I understand that my broadcasts are transmitted from 40 stations. I shall be very happy to have the nam.es of those stations tabled in the House for public information. It may be that one of those stations belongs to what the honorahle member for East Sydney has called the Murdoch estate. I have no knowledge that that is so. It is true that one member of the royal commission on television is the managing editor of the Brisbane Courier-Mail, a man who has taken a great deal of interest in television, a man of ability, and a man who, in the judgment of the Cabinet, can bring a well-informed mind to the problems to be investigated. I have not thought to inquire into the private affairs of other memhers of the commission, or even of that memher. It is a grave mistake to assume that individuals . are appointed to a royal commission as the representatives of special interests, and it is offensive to them to be Government ? told that they represent such interests. The members of this royal commission have been chosen as a panel of persons possessing different experiences who, in combination, are likely to give us a balanced view on the very important [23] matters into which the commission will inquire. sentative of the churches? ing the honourable, member, "" Which church ?"" He knows as well as anybody else in this House knows that nobody can say, "" There is ' A ' . He will represent the churches of this country"", because "" A "" may be admirably satisfactory to some people but completely unsatisfactory to others. The honourable member for Melbourne is just aa familiar as I am with this kind of problem. It is not appropriate to appoint to a royal commission of this kind somebody who will regard himself as the spokesman of a particular point of view. Eather is it appropriate to appoint persons who will regard themselves as the recipients of all points of view. That is what the Government has done. death of the Soviet dictator, and its possible implications, will the Minister for External Affairs afford the House an early opportunity to debate foreign policy and to express its support for those, either within or without the borders of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, who are endeavouring to free themselves from the tyranny of the Soviet system? cuss the honourable member's proposal with the Prime Minister, and, if necessary, with the Cabinet. I appreciate the honourable member's motive in raising this important matter. Br.

Trom speeches made hy honourable members opposite about myself, I had gained the impression that there should be at least one second-class passenger. I accept with great goodwill the assurance of the honourable meniber. Unfortunately, the Minister for Civil Aviation is absent on account of illness, but I shall convey the honourable member's question to him. fact that the price of superphosphate has increased considerably since the subsidy was withdrawn in June, 1950, and is now so high that some farmers hesitate to use it, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture investigate the possibility of re-introducing that subsidy? ber's question concerns a matter of policy to which I cannot give a reply; but I can inform him that I have been examining the possibility of reducing the cost of cornsacks for superphosphate which would have a very very important bearing on the cost of that commodity. Minister for Social Services a question concerning applications to the War Service Homes Division for a loan in order to erect a garage on the applicant's property. Are such applicants granted assistance only if they prove that they own a motor car? If that is so, will the Minister reconsider this position with a view to assisting ex-servicemen to build garages in anticipation of owning a car some day so that they will not be forced to house such equipment as lawnmowers and push-bicycles in a shed? the honourable gentleman's proposal, although it has been considered already on a number of occasions. The reason for the maintenance of the present policy is that the funds available have to be made to go as far as possible. It would seem to be rather illogical to allow one man to have money for the purpose of building a garage for a car that he does not yet own, whilst another man might have to wait for funds to build a home. tion to the Minister for Social Services by saying that I understand that his department will take over, for an ex-serviceman, an existing house to the value of £3,500 and will advance £2,000 towards its purchase. I also understand that if the value of the house exceeds £3,500 the department will not make any advance at all. Will the Minister inform me whether that is correct and, if it is, whether he will consider adjusting such an anomalous position? the honourable member has stated them. The maximum amount of loan is £2,000 if the property is not valued in excess of £3,500. The Government has made record sums available for the purchase of war service homes-thi s year £28,000,000 has been provided for that purpose-bu t applications are coming in at the rate of 2,000 a month and it is impossible to deal with all of them. It is, therefore, considered that the need is greatest in resoect of those ex-servicemen who require to purchase properties valued at £3,500 or less. It is believed that persons who are able to finance the purchase of houses of a greater value than that are much better off than those who cannot do so. However, the proposal of the honourable member will be considered. the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. Is the Minister in a position to give an answer regarding an investigation that was made into the high rate of rentals that are charged for Commonwealth cottages at Dapto, Unanderra and Bulli? Sir PHILIP MoBRIDE I have told the honourable member that when the investigation into the matter is completed, I shall be able to give him an answer.

I understand that a United Nations inspection team is due to arrive in the territory. subsidized by the Commomvealth, availWill the Minister comment on the view expressed by the New Guinea branch of the Returned Servicemen's League, and also on tbe pending visit of the mission from the United Nations? question. I believe that the New Guinea branch of the Returned Servicemen's League is probably under a misapprehension regarding the functions of the visiting United Nations mission. The United Nations is not a super-government. It has no powers of inspection or report in relation to our trust territory in New Guinea, but I believe that it is all to the good for a selection of individuals representing the United Nations to see for themselves the work that we are doing in New Guinea, of which we are rather proud. I am sure that the Minister for Territories is rightly proud of that work. We have nothing to hide in New Guinea. I think we might very well welcome the visit that is to be made by the United Nation's inspection team. I can answer very simply in the negative any suggestion that Australia might propose to resign from the United Nations. I believe I am right in saying that the Government has considerable confidence in the usefulness of that organization as an instrument which is designed to calm the world. We have no intention, that I have ever heard of, to leave it. On the other hand, I believe that we shall do everything possible to strengthen it. Mr J. R.

Will the right honourable gentleman also inform the House of the price received for the ships and the name of the company to which they were sold? question which does not come within the scope of the Prime Minister's Department or, I think, of any department represented by a Minister in this House. question asked by the honourable member, although it contains a good deal of apparent misinformation, refers to the recent sale of certain small vessels engaged in the coastal trade in Papua, formerly owned by the Commonwealth, to Steamships Trading Company. I shall have inquiries made to see whether it is possible to give the honourable member details of the sale. for Health inform me whether the Australian Government makes any direct grant to cancer institutes, or similar institutions,, in the various States? If so, can for Labour and National Service whether the right honourable gentleman advise the House of the amount of such grants or the nature of assistance given? Does the Commonwealth Department of Health promote or conduct direct research into matters, associated with the disease of cancer? If no grant to the States is made, or no direct research conducted by the Commonwealth, will the Minister give consideration to both of these propositions ? fifteen or twenty years ago the Australian, government of the day established a radium bank to be made available for the purposes to which the honourable member has referred. At the present time, the research work of the Commonwealth is set in motion and directed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, which consists of representatives of the Commonwealth, and States. I shall bring to the notice of the council the matters raised by the honourable member. the Treasurer dealing with the recent publication, under his authority, of a booklet entitled Income Tax for Farmers and Graziers. Chapter 10 of that publication, which was no doubt issued under his authority and with the approval of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, contains elaborate praise of provisional tax and self-assessment. Do the contents of that chapter still represent the Treasurer's own views ? Leader of the Opposition should know that that question concerns a matter of policy. tion is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it the intention of the Government to hold a referendum, at the same time as the next Senate election, to deal with the matter of dead-locks in the Senate? it is a fact that since, this Government amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Aet and gave real purpose to the use of the secret ballot in the election of officers of industrial unions, great progress has been made in ridding the unions of Communists?

It was not until this Government gave the power to a minority of the members of a union, indeed, as small a minority as 10 per cent, of the members, to call for the taking of a secret ballot that the provision began to work. Since July, 1951, when this Government's amendments-to the industrial legislation took effect, 36 applications have been made by trade union members for secret ballots to be conducted. The courts have granted 25 of those applications. It is a matter of common knowledge and a fact that all honourable members of the House, I am sure, will applaud, that this action is undoubtedly assisting the rank and file unionist to rid himself of Communist influence and check the growth of communism in trade unions. We have not yet perceived the full effect of the legislation because some industrial unions hold their elections of officers bi-annually, and even tri-annually, and consequently all unions have not yet had an opportunity to put the legislation into effect. However, the legislation has undoubtedly served a very useful purpose already, and we believe that its usefulness will continue. I shall ascertain whether a more detailed statement about this matter can be provided for the information of all honourable members. sible for the Minister for the Army to arrange for the recording of the hours of training of national service trainees specific as to the definition of a patient other than those that have been served in who is entitled to an invalid pension. national service training camps?

Such action has been taken under a measure that was passed during the regime of the Government of which the honourable member was a supporter.

Labour Government was in office, persons within the category to which the honourable member has referred received only the invalid pension, but since the present Government assumed office they receive a special tuberculosis allowance if they are infectious. That improvement was effected in July, 1950, seven months after the Chifley Government went out of office.

Debate resumed from the 6th March (vide page 702), on motion by Mr That the .bill be now read a second time. [3.14] -A t the outset, it is just as well to be clear about the purposes for which this measure has been introduced. In general terms, it has two objectives. First, it is a part of the struggle which has been going on for a considerable time, particularly since 1947, for the preservation of the private banking system in Australia. Is the banking system to be nationalized, or is the private banking system to continue? Members of the Labour party have recently been endeavouring to create the impression that the nationalization of banking as a political issue, is now dead. Undoubtedly, that is not so. No person should be misled by the protestations of the Opposition on that score, or regard them as anything but an attempt to create a front for the approaching Senate elections. The recent statements of members of the Labour party that the socialization of banking, as a policy, is now dead will not convince anybody. In fact, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made the position plain to the House a few days ago when he stated that the nationalization of banking was still a plank of the Labour party's platform. He emphasized that the Labour party had retained that plank, and meant to give effect to it. In those circumstances, it is futile for Opposition members to say to the people, "" The nationalization of banking is not an issue at the forthcoming Senate elections"". It is an issue not only at the forthcoming Senate elections, but at every general election in future. If the nationalization of banking is not an issue, why has the Labour party its platform?

86,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"nationalization of banking is a separate plank of its platform, and is not related to the general socialization objective. The nationalization of banking is a declared specific objective of the Labour party. The utterances of Opposition members have failed to convince any one that it is not an objective of the party, and, indeed, all our experience supports the contrary view. AVe should be well advised to remind ourselves that in 1947, the Ohifley Labour Government made a direct attempt to nationalize the banking system, and that its effort was frustrated only with great difficulty. But that attempt was only a part of the pattern of general socialization. Shortly after the banking legislation of 1947 was declared unconstitutional, the country became engaged in a struggle to prevent the nationalization of medicine, which was only narrowly averted. A t the same time, the nationalization of airlines became an imminent danger. All those attempts were parts of a general programme, designed to achieve the socialization of all the major undertakings and enterprises in thc country. The opposition to this bill is also a part of that programme. Every one believes that in the modern State, a strong and efficient central bank is necessary. I summarize the functions of a central bank as follows:-(1 ) to control the total supply of money; (2) to exercise control over interest rates; (3) to regulate the note issue; (4) in special circumstances, to direct finance into special channels of trade and commerce; (5) to control foreign exchange; (6) to act as a banker for the Commonwealth Government; and (7) in general terms, to control the creditof the Government believe that the special base in the country. We believe that the central bank, in exercising those functions, must use proper techniques, and we also consider that central banking, by itself, is not a panacea for economic ills. Central banking is not the sole method of controlling such movements as inflation or deflation. It is a most important factor in controlling them, but it is not the only factor, nor perhaps is it even the principal factor. As was aptly pointed out by the Minister for A i r ( Mr private banks by direct legislation that McMahon) in this debate last week, other important factors are operating, which are not functions of the central bank, but such things as the total volume of production, and the enormous influence of the arbitration machinery and the control that it exerts over wages and hours on the cost of production. Then there is the powerful influence of overseas trade. I am sure that I do not need to remind honourable members of the enormous influence on the Australian economy that the price of wool has exerted during the last two or three years. There is, too, the influence of external loans, and Australia has gained important benefits and advantages as a result of the overseas borrowings of this Government. None the less, the central bank has an important effect, in conjunction with these other factors. In addition, the Government exercises further control by means of taxation and the control bf capital issues. I have not made a comprehensive review of the weapons that a Government can use to control the economy. I have merely summarized them in order to make it plain to honourable members that although we believe that there is a necessity for a strong central bank, that of itself is not the whole story. Under the existing legislation we believe that the central bank possesses powers especially in relation to special accounts that go far beyond its requirements. As I have already pointed out, the first purpose of the bill before the House is to prevent the socialization of banking. Its second purpose is to place a ceiling on special accounts, in order to prevent a future socialist government from destroying the private banks. While supporters accounts system is necessary, we do not believe that it should be so uncontrolled and so limitless, as it is at present, that it could be employed to put out of business all or any of the private banks. in that way? The previous Labour Government was so completely occupied trying to destroy the it did not have time to try any other method. We on this side of the House",20,Menzies

88,Dr. Donald Cameeon,"No.believe in a free banking system, and we believe that the provisions of the bill will in connection with the special deposits. remove the enormous threat that now hangs over the trading banks. Several honourable members have referred to the people's bank. I point out that it is relatively easy to whip up sentiment by the use of such vague phrases as "" tbe people's bank "" and "" the people's assets "". In point of fact, such phrases have no real meaning, because the Commonwealth Bank is not alone in being the people's bank. No less than £1,300,000,000 of the people's savings are invested in and controlled by the private banks, which in fact are owned by shareholders. Therefore it is just as appropriate to call the private banks the people's banks. I remind honourable members also that the people's savings in the Commonwealth Savings Bank aggregate about £900,000,000. It is time that honourable members opposite ceased their propaganda about the people's bank. All of the banks belong to the people, as do all of the assets of this country. Supporters of the Government believe in free enterprise. The private banks have made a very great contribution to the economy of this country. Were it not for their activities in the past, this country would have been destroyed. neither the great pastoral industry nor the great secondary industries of this country would have expanded so greatly. People throughout Australia entrust their capital to the trading banks. Large companies, large men and little men, pastoralists, industrialists, professional men and all kinds of workers in Australia have faith in the private banking system. businessmen. I am reminded by the honourable member Commonwealth Trading Bank.

The Trading Bank, occupies a privileged and bill will prevent banking nationalization special position to the disadvantage of by the employment of a back-door method The bill is designed, not only to remove' the power of the central bank to destroy the private banks by calling up their liabilities, but also to ensure that the Commonwealth Trading Bank shall function in fair competition with the private banks. Honourable members on this side of the House have stated many times that the Government believes in fair competition. The bill will not in any way injure the Commonwealth Trading Bank. It is designed merely to place the Commonwealth Trading Bank by law on the same footing as the private trading banks, so that it will compete with them not on what, might be described as "" a most-favoured nation"" basis, but on the basis of fairness and equality. I shall not deal with all the provisions of the bill, which have been explained adequately by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). One of its main purposes is to place a ceiling on special deposits which, at October last, amounted to £545,000,000. It is obvious that, had the whole, or even a large proportion of that amount been called up, the private hanking system of T am posing not a theoretical possibility, but a definite possibility under a socialist, government. In simple terms, the bill will place a limit on special deposits. It will apply not only to the private banks but also to the Commonwealth Trading Bank so that there shall be no means of discrimination by which a socialist government in the future may finally destroy private banking. I was amazed by the naivete of the argument used by the that the bill had been designed to ""disAsI have already menindicates his belief that, under present",21,Menzies

90,Dr. Donald Cameron,"Yes, as advantage, prejudice and weaken"" thethe Trading Banks. legislation has been designed to prevent it from retaining that position. To sum up, then, the bill embodies three main provisions. First, it will preserve the essential functions of the the central bank, which I have already discussed. Secondly, and perhaps most important, it will safeguard the private hanks. Thirdly, it will establish a condition of fair competition between the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the private banks. The Government clearly has a mandate for these three proposals, whereas the former Labour Government had no authority to enact its legislation for the nationalization of banking, which was sprung on the people by surprise. The three proposals that I have specified were submitted to the people during the general election campaigns of 1949 and 1951, and on each occasion the people endorsed them by an overwhelming majority. Therefore, there can be no doubt of the validity of the Government's mandate for this bill. Tn conclusion, I return to the point from which I started. This legislation represents one more phase in the struggle between free enterprise and those who favour the nationalization of banking. We, on this side of the House, believe in free enterprise. We stand for freedom and oppose socialism. No protestations by members of the Opposition can convince anybody that anything other than the nationalization of banking in Australia is at the core of their objection to the bank in various forms of government this measure. The leopard has not changed its spots. -The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) said that this bill represented a phase in the struggle between ficant, feature of banking in Australia, is those who favour socialized banking and the trading bank system. We should those who support the private banking examine very closely the functions that system in Austalia. The measure has the trading banks ostensibly perform nothing whatever to do with the nationaliin order to ascertain whether they zation of banking. Its purpose is to determine economic policy or are merely remove the curbs that the former Labour the sympathetic regulators, as it were, of Government was obliged to place on the the activity of banking. A trading bank activities of private banks in Australia. is, primarily, a place where certain people. This Government has a false impression lodge surplus money. The bank lends of the purpose of money in the community these deposits to other people at a higher and, consequently, of the functions that rate of interest than it pays to the depobanks should exercise in distributing sitors. However, there is another aspect Obviously, this funds to different members and sections of the community. The Labour party has always believed, to state our view rather slickly, that money should be the servant of the community and not a determinant of the welfare of the comimunity. We should have a monetary and banking system that will ensure that everything that can be done for the good of the community shall be placed first. That is why the former Labour Government imposed regulations to control the activities of banks in Australia. For the purpose of illustrating Labour's point of view, I shall examine the anatomy of banking in Australia to-day. There are, broadly, three kinds of banking operations in Australia. We have what are called the savings banks, which hold savings amounting to about £1,000,000,000. That money has been deposited by the people with the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the various State savings banks. The latest annual report covering the activities of the Commonwealth Savings Bank shows that there are about 6,000,000 individual accounts in the various savings banks of Australia. This figure indicates that the average level of deposits is not very high. If the total were divided equally between depositors, the amount in each account would be about £160. In fact, statutory limits are placed upon the amount that one individual may lodge with a savings bank. The Commonwealth Savings Bank had a total of about £600,000,000 in depositors' accounts at the 30th June, 1952. Most of that money had been invested by security. In other words, a savings bank is virtually an instrument for the mobilization of the small savings of The next, and perhaps the most signi-",22,Menzies
91,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [3.33]. Individuals.,"of trading bank activity. Tbe banks engage in the buying and selling of certain securities. ""When conditions are favorable, they are willing to invest such money as they have at their command by granting overdrafts, but, at other times, when conditions are not to their liking, they prefer to hold some of their assets for the time being in the form of government securities, treasury-bills or investments. This is not essentially a function of banking, and it has the effect frequently of indirectly and unfairly regulating the economic health of the community. Because of that sort of activity by the trading banks, it was found necessary to establish a third kind of bank, of which there is only one in Australiathe central bank. The Commonwealth Bank, which is the central bank, lays down a policy by which the activities of the various trading banks are regulated. But that in itself is not sufficient to regulate banking in Australia because of certain inherent difficulties in our economy. It has been found necessary to regulate the whole machinery of banking by 'means of legislation of which the banking legislation of 1945 was the culmination. The bill before the House will do a great deal to destroy the safeguards that have been provided for the control of hanking policy in Australia as I shall show in .the time remaining to '.me. In order to make certain matters clear we should examine what might be called the anatomy or structure of the private banking system in .Australia. on iiiis subject may be taken from a number of sources hut I. have taken some from the latest issue of the Statistical Bulletin of the Commonwealth Bank which provides a picture of the whole of the private banking system in Australia. Statistical Bulletin reveals that 'during December, .1952, the total deposits in the seven major private trading banks amounted to £1,147,00Q,000. Because banks are not very difierent other commercial concerns the liabilities on one side of their balance-sheet must be matched with assets on the other. It tion members contend that the private has been mainly on the subject of assets banking system should not have any that this debate has centered. The value power to determine economic policy. The of the 'banks' assets such as coin, bullion, private banking system should simply and notes with the Commonwealth Bank provide facilities i o r people to deposit totalled £7'8,700,.0.0Q. That is what might their money and for other people to Mr Crean. be called their till money. It is virtually only the small change of the banking system. The next asset listed, which has fluctuated considerably, is treasury-bills. In December, 1952, their value was £136,800,000. The next item-amount s held in special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank-totalle d £156,500,000. Government and municipal securities similar totalled £7.9,300,000. The principal other assets of the Banks-advance s to individual customers-amounte d to £637,700,000 It is desirable to examine closely what the banks are in the habit of describing as liquid assets-coin , treasury-bills, special accounts, and government and municipal securities. These are the assets about which the Government has suggested that the banks are very frightened. These assets all depend for their worth on the economic health of the community as a whole. They represent only some kind of authority issued by the Government. The one pound note would have no value if it could be printed by any individual instead of being issued by the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank. The treasury-bill is simply an acknowledgment of an obligation by tbe Government to the banking system. It would have no worth without the Government's acknowledgment. The special accounts about which honourable members opposite are so frightened are only slightly different in degree from treasury-bills. They represent assets that Statistics have been put into a special drawer, so to speak, and locked up for the time being. Again the other securities, government and municipal, would be worthless pieces of paper if it were The not known that -the Government would honour them. Yet the private hanking system has quibbled about the variety of governmental assets which it is to hold, whether it is to be allowed to hold one from kind as against .another, only different in degree. This is the kernel of this bill. Opposiborrow money for a consideration. It is when the banks hold and dispose of governmental securities that they intrude into the economic structure of the country and determine economic policy, not necessarily from the point of view of the community, but from the point of view of tlieir own profit. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr January the holding of treasury-billsMcMahon) suggested that it was hypocrisy to refer to the Commonwealth Bank as. the people's bank and to the private banks in another way. There is an essential difference between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. The general public are the shareholders in the CommonweaJth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank supports our whole economic life, not as a bastion in the interests of profits, of £100,000,000 in treasUry-bills, and but, in theory at any rate, as the guardian of the economic life of the community. The private banks are private banks because they are beholden, in the last analysis, to the shareholders who contributed their original share capital, and a very insignificant amount of that share capital is in relation to the total assets or liabilities of the private trading banks. As long as the private banks are only '' takers in "" ancl "" shellers out"" of money it does not matter a great deal whether they are privately or publicly owned. In many ways the difference is only one of degree. If the private banks are given additional power by this legislation so to determine the manner in which they shall hold the different kinds of government securities, they will have a power which is not their right and whioh can only be exercised to the detriment of the community because it will have been removed from the place where it should properly be .exercised. That is the issue that faces us. The point at issue is not the nationalization of banking; it is whether the Governmenit can justify the changes that it has proposed-in this legislation. I want to point out what is involved in some of these changes. As the Leader of the. Opposition (Di\ Evatt) mentioned in the course of his speech, a great deal of damage has already been done to the banking system in Australia because of thelax way in which the Commonwealth Bank Board has performed its functions during the. last twelve months. The Leader of the Opposition cited figures, which were then the latest available, showing that between June, 1952, andDecember, 1952, the holding of treasury bills by the private trading banks had risen from £35,700,000 to £136,700,000. Since he made that speech new figures have been issued by the CommonwealthStatistician which show that at the end of had risen by a further £21,100,000. It had risen from £136,700,000 to £157,800,000. The holding of government securities at December, 1952, which was £79,200,000, has since risen to £88,700,000. In other words, he said that at that date there had been a disposition of assets from the central bank to the private trading banks to the tune £20,000,000 in government securities, a figure which has risen by another £30,000,000 in the last month. It is easy to see how that is reflected on the reverse side of the picture, which is represented by the holdings of the central bank which is, as it were, the trustee of the public property. These holdings of government and other securities between January, 1952, and January, 1953, contrary to the movement of the holdings held by the private banks, which have risen, have fallen from £615,900,000 to £418,800,000. That represents a decline of almost £200,000,000 of the value of publicly-owned property held by the central bank. That amount was transferred into the hands of the private trading banks, ostensibly because it was necessary to release their holdings under ithe special accounts provision. The, Government, which has been responsiblefor lowering the level of the special, accounts deposits from £570,000,000 to £150,000,0.00 in about twelve months, now talks about a ""gigantic uncalled liability "". As the Leader of the Opposition, rightly pointed out, if that gigantic liability exists-and we query it3 existenceit exists because the Government caused it. The Government allowed Australia's London funds, which are also theoretically heldby tlie central bank for the general welfaa-e of the community, to drop from 1 a. record level ito an insignificant amount. It seems that, here again, a very subtle change is taking place in the determination of economic policy in Australia because, prior to the 1945 legislation and the war-time legislation, each private bank in effect had to look after its own London funds. However, because of the necessity to mobilize foreign currency during and after the war, the Commonwealth Bank now has the power, as any central bank should have, to mobilize the nation's foreign exchange and buy from the various private trading banks the amounts of foreign exchange that they may hold from time to time. The trading banks seem to have noted a subtle distinction here. Whereas before they had to be careful of the level of their London funds in their own interests, they are now inclined to take the view that, because the Commonwealth Bank has control of the nation's London funds, they can get what foreign exchange they want at any time thcy might want it. It seems that there was some form of collusion between the Government and the bankers, because, when the Government encouraged imports on the ground that it would thereby help to abate the effects of inflation, it apparwas asked, in relation to the Commonently took the view that if the banks wanted to buy foreign exchange the special accounts deposits could be released to the corresponding amount, because the London funds fell by about the same amount as the special deposits fell. A study of the changes that have occurred in the distribution of the assets of the private trading banks shows that although the special accounts deposits held by the Commonwealth Bank fell by £400,000,000, the trading banks' disposable assets have increased by £200,000,000 in the process. In fact, they have increased by approximately £250,000,000. That means that that amount of money can be held by the private trading banks, if ' it suits them, simply for the purpose of making profit, and profit earned from it, or it can be sold and used for promoting a policy of expansion and for increasing advances, thereby again earning profits for the private banks. There has occurred over the past twelve months a very serious distribution of initiatory power from the public sysMr Crean. tem of banking, in which the central bank determined, or was supposed to determine, what steps should be taken in the interests of the people as a whole, into the sectional hands of the private trading banks. That is a change which, once having occurred, is difficult to reverse. The Government has suggested that if the Labour party took office to-morrow it would call up 'the £550,000,000 of uncalled liability overnight. As the Leader of the Opposition demonstrated by quoting a well-documented statement about the operation of the special account provision when it was under Labour administration from 1945 to 1949, the system was exercised flexibly by the central bank for the benefit of the community as a whole. No charge can bo levelled at the Labour Government that it was a reckless guardian of the banking system. The private trading banks cannot claim that the greater exercise of power that they now have is likely to be used by them in the interests of the people as a whole. A study of their history would dispose of such a claim. Rather might such power be used in a short-sighted way simply on the criterion of private profit. When the Government wealth Bank Bill, why it was making a change in the relationship between the trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank, it had such a weak cause that it had to fall back on nebulous phrases like "" unfair competition "" and "" equality of sacrifice "". The same charges as were levelled against the Government in connection with that bill can be levelled against it in relation to the changes that will be produced by this legislation. We ask why it is necessary to give private trading banks the right to acquire treasury-bills and government securities which are, in the last analysis, public securities. If they are to be held by banks, not for banking purposes, but why it is necessary to bring that power back after it has been inoperative for ten years? Is there any one reason that can be advanced to show that the change is necessary? When we examine the nature of the power that can be placed in the hands of private banks as a result of this change we can only assume that the banks are to be given that power as some sort of pay-off from tbe Government. When we look at the other important mutilation of the central bank system proposed in the measure, this so-called formula relating to special accounts, we must ask why it is necessary to change the system that has operated from 1941 up to date and which, it is claimed, has become unmanageable, only because of the Government's own mismanagement. was exercised flexibly in the past. Why should it be replaced by a rigid formula ? The Leader of the Opposition cited figures to show that in some years the central bank had called up 45 per cent, of the amount which, theoretically, could have been called up. That implies that, in some years and in some circumstances, it may be necessary to accumulate residues on which the Government may draw if an inflationary condition develops. After all, economic trends become evident over a long period, not just in one or two years. Although the present formula has been exercised fairly from year to year this Government is giving away the power which it confers. The Government proposes to replace a formula, which has proved its value in the past, with one of exceeding rigidity. A great many supposedly expert authorities on central banking in other parts of the world have been quoted in the House recently. I point out to honourable members that the economic circumstances of Australia are different from those of other countries, such as Great Britain honourable member for McMillan( Mr its policy of' nationalization and control Brown) considers that he is a supreme authority on banking. economic circumstances differ from those of Canada? point out that, as far as central banking is concerned, there are no rigid techniques. There may be certain fundamental assumptions, but other than that, banking policy must be worked out by each country according to its circumstances. During the years of World War II . , which were the most critical in our history, and also during the period of post-war reconstruction, Australia evolved a banking policy which enabled it to emerge from .the war in a healthier economic state than any other country of the world. Now, after a few years of Liberal party government, inflation has got out of hand. In Australia more than it has in any other though country. We find that full employment, which was accepted as a basic consideraThat formula tion by tbe previous Labour Government, has been destroyed. Apparently, the Government gains a little comfort from the fact that the number of registered unemployed, which recently was approximately 36,000 has declined by a few hundred. Adermann) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has endeavoured to show, by a technical approach to the subject, that the proposed amendments of the 1945 Banking Act will destroy the safeguards established under the Commonwealth Bank Act. I suggest that the whole substance of his speech represented an endeavour to cloak some of the very great dangers which this bill will overcome. Both this measure and that recently discussed in the House will strengthen the banking legislation of the country in such a way that all banking institutions will be placed on a more equitable trading basis and come within the framework of the present banking legislation. I submit that when this bill is passed, it will be much more difficult for a socialist government to carry out of private trading banks. Admittedly, of course, this legislation will merely make that purpose more difficult of achievement, because, as all honourable members are aware, tbere are two ways in which nationalization of banking may take place. First, it may be done by administrative action, by means of which a slow but strong squeeze is applied to trading banks so that ultimately it becomes impossible for them to trade profitably. carried but?",23,Menzies

98,Mr Joshua,"Has that ever beenmatter to the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) in a few moments. The second method is by means of legislation. We all know that at the present time the banking legislation contains very great dangers which might permit the squeeze which the honourable member for Ballarat says has never been tried in the past. The legislative method of nationalization, which is a much more effective, exacting and precise way, has already been tried out in Australia. I refer to the definite attempt by the Government led by Mr J. B. Chifley. I have no doubt that nationalization will again be tried if the Opposition is ever returned to power. Nothing has been said during this debate to indicate that the policy of the Australian Labour party in this respect is other than that printed and prescribed by the party. However, the banking policy of the Opposition has become a little obscure because of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) throughout the whole of this debate; he has endeavoured to brush off any discussion which might indicate that the subject of nationalization is a live one as far as his parjy is concerned. He endeavoured at all times to give the impression that it is a dead subject. the remark of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), because I wish to show that the subject is not a ""dead korse"". In 1947,' Mr Chifley stated, when introducing the Banking Bill of that year, that its purpose was to empower the Commonwealth Bank to take over the banking business being conducted in Australia by private trading banks. On that occasion, the late right honourable gentleman saidThe Labour party has maintained for many years that, since the influence of money is so great, the entire monetary and banking system should be controlled by public authorities reover twenty years. sponsible .through the Goveriunent ancl ParliaI suggest that every honourable member ment to the nation. Gn this principle the Labour party has held further that since' priof this cliamber knows how Labour has vate banks are conducted primarily for profit . . . their business should be transferred to public ownership. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has endeavoured to show, by means of technicalities, that there is no desire in the minds of the memhers of the Australian Labour party to carry out that objective. However, from 1947, when Mr Chifley made the speech to which I have referred, to the present time, nothing has happened to show that the ideas of the Australian Labour party on this subject have changed one iota. In fact, executive members of the party have reiterated their intention to take over the banks when the party is returned to power. The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition during the recent debates in the House has been, ""Do not show your hand"". He has adopted that attitude in an attempt to divert public attention from the real policy of his party in regard to banking. Yet only a week ago, I am informed, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) said, at a meeting of caucus, ""Let us be honest with the people and say to them that we believe in nationalization of banking institutions"". We should congratulate the honourable member, because he at least wishes to be honest about the matter. He has repeated many times, both in this House and on public platforms outside, his attitude towards taking over private enterprise and privately owned institutions. Yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), while speaking at a Labour Day picnic gathering in Melbourne, saidI f we get nine years of Labour government in the federal {parliament we can change the whole face of Austra liii. Later, during the same address, he said that there would be certain difficulties about remaining in power for so long, except by means of the distribution of the electorates. His actual words wereI will have to suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that we make a trip {o Queensland ancl find out from the Premier, Mr Gair, how Labour has kept in power there for well remained in office in Queensland for so long-it has been clone by a certain amount of gerrymandering.

101,Mr Haworth,"I am grateful forfull intentions of the Labour party. The honourable meniber for Fawkner( Mr Labour government assumed office in W. M . Bourke) introduced the honourable member fbr Melbourne to the meeting as "" the future Treasurer of Australia "". Consequently, honourable members will perceive that 'the so-called future Treasurer of this country believes that if he and his party should ever assume office in this country, they will change the whole face of Australia. I suggest that the easiest Avay in which that may be done is through the banking institutions of this country. It would be very easy for a Federal Treasurer to change the whole face of Australia by giving directions to the Commonwealth Bank about how it is to treat its competitors. Then, as the honourable member for Melbourne said, if the Labour party were long enough in office it could carry tlirough its programme. The honourable member indicated that it would remain in office long enough to carry out its policy even if it had to gerrymander, and alter the electoral boundaries. If the Labour party were in office for nine years, .as the honourable member for Melbourne desires, it could do all that this Government, by legislation, is endeavouring to make difficult. Now let us consider the most important part of the present measure, that, is, the part of the bill that relates to special deposits. I suggest that power over special deposits is the key to the problem of changing the face of Australia. Moreover, by using this key the whole of our systems and' institutions can be changed quite simply and easily. It may be interesting for honourable members to be reminded how the special deposits were initiated so that the whole matter can be put into proper perspective, and to show how the special deposits accounts may be ' used to the advantage of the Commonwealth Bank and to the disadvantage of its trading, competitors. It is quite true, as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, that in 1943. the government of the day passed national security regulations to regulate war-time banking.. Thc regulations affected the surplus investable funds of the associated banks. Those funds had previously been deposited, voluntarily or under a gentleman's agreement, with the central bank. When a 1941 it changed that system and introduced national security regulations which gave the Commonwealth Bank control over the surplus investable funds of the Associated Banks. In 1945 the Labour Government realized, apparently for the first time, that banking was in such a state that the private banking institutions in Australia could be controlled. It also realized that the time was coming when the national security regulations would be no longer valid, and it therefore passed the 1945 Banking Act. By that legislation the Commonwealth Bank was completely re-organized, the special accounts procedure be;ng only one of the innovations. The Commonwealth Bank endeavoured to use the Banking Act of 1945 to force all governmental and semi governmental institutions to deal only with the Commonwealth Bank. Honourable members will remember how the Melbourne City Council challenged that direction, and how the High Court upheld the corporation's appeal. Then we arrive at the stage of the statements of intention made by the Labour Prime Minister in 1947. Past Labour governments have sought to prevent trading banks from doing business with governmental and semi-governmental institutions, but a very dangerous section remains in. the 1945 Banking Act, which provides that certain sums of money must be paid by the trading""'banks into special accounts in the Commonwealth Bank. The amount of money to be paid into those accounts was fixed at the amount of special deposits with the Commonwealth Bank in July, 1945, plus certain additions. It has been explained that the special accounts contain not only the amount of money deposited wibh the Commonwealtli Bank by the trading banks in July, 1945, but also sums representing 100 per cent., the total increase of assets of private banks after July, 1945. It has been said by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) and other honourable members opposite, time anJ time again, that the liabilities of the trading banks to the Commonwealth Bank have not been called up. I suggest that the fact they have not been called up in the past is no guarantee that they will not be called up in the future. We knownothing of what will happen in the future, and we have seen enough of the actions, and heard enough of the statements, of the honourable member for Melbourne to know quite clearly what he would do if Labour should be returned to office. We must take every precaution within our power to ensure that we make the nationalization of banking a difficult matter for any socialistic government that may come to power. The most important aspect of this bill is that it will cancel fche enormous legal liabilities laid down in the 1945 Banking Act, and will allow the trading banks to make a fresh start. Their liabilities will be cancelled from October last year, and an adjusted ceiling will be put on any new liabilities. The Government has inserted they will apply not only to the private trading banks but also to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. The provision will apply with the force of law when the measure has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament. In the past provision has been made for special accounts to apply only to the private banks but not to their competitor, the Commonwealth Bank. The Government believes that this is most unjust, and so that provision is to apply now to the Commonwealth Trading Bank and to all other trading banks. In fact, steps are being taken to institute an equitable system which will cover all the banking institutions of Australia. From this brief summary of those three points, I believe it is apparent that the banking legislation that is now in existence needs substantial amendments such as those that have been outlined in this bill. When these bills are passed, the special deposits will be brought into line with current banking practice, and the neAv legislation will remove undesirable features from the central hank's point of view. It will make ample provision for the Commonwealth Bank to control fche investment of expanding resources and will prevent the use of them for inflationary investment. At the same time, it will remove the liability of the trading banks to provide excessive and impossible amounts. Mr Haworth. It is important to observe that the cancellation of the uncalled liability will do much to restore confidence in the special accounts system and will also strengthen fche hand of the Commonwealth Bank in that at least it will no longer he regarded as a potential instrument of destruction by the banking world. The Commonwealth Bank staff will approve of the proposals which will place them on a better basis. The requirement that the Commonwealth Trading Bank shall also conform to the rules and regulations of the special account fund is a further step towards strengthening the control of the Commonwealth Bank over all significant sections of the economy and is a recognition of the fact that the Commonwealth Trading Bank is, in fact, a bank to be considered. I think it is fair to point out that this legislation does these provisions so that not place minimum limits on the deposits of the trading banks. That could mean that one bank could have less of its deposits called up than the others, and that bank could be the Commonwealth Trading Bank. It may be wise to have some elasticity in regard to this matter in view of the fact that some banks are rather low in liquid funds at some periods of the year for different and longer periods than are others. The legislation that is before the House will not actually tie down the Commonwealth Bank to such an extent that it will be' in a strait-jacket. It has been given a certain amount of elasticity in its workings and we must rely to some extent upon the Commonwealth Bank Board to see that that elasticity is used for the purpose for which it was intended. The measure places the onus of dealing fairly on the Commonwealth Bank Board. This provision, which could be used in a wrong manner, relates to 'the furnishing of detailed statistics by the various trading banks to the Commonwealth Bank. The real protection of this information would require the complete separation of the Commonwealth Trading Department from the Commonwealth Bank. No provision is made for that separation. It has been done only on the executive level and not on the policymaking level. The Government has realized that from the point of view of the Commonwealth, it is desirable that officers should be easily interchangeable between the various institutions. It is left to the integrity of the Governor to ensure that the officers who collect the confidential information from the other banks to-day are not to-morrow in an administrative position in a competitive trading section of the Commonwealth Bank. Honourable member on the Opposition side might take some comfort from the matter to which I shall finally draw attention. I must say that this point does not entirely please me. That is that the Commonwealth Trading Bank still has the advantage of being freed from the obligation to pay taxes. lieve that on that matter, the Government has been extremely lenient. The Government's desire has been to enact certain legislation to protect the private trading bank structure in Australia but it has done nothing that will handicap the Commonwealth Bank in its central banking functions. It has thus permitted elasticity to the Commonwealth Bank in all its actions even to the extent of placing considerable confidence in the Commonwealth Bank to carry out its functions in a fair and equitable manner. The legislation that has been introduced, both now and in the earlier amendments of banking law, by this Government has the virtue of indicating clearly to the Commonwealth Bank that it should deal fairly with its competitors. The responsibility for this is placed upon the shoulders of a board rather than on those of the Governor. upon the integrity of those concerned, this is a most advisable and substantial achievement. This legislation also provides the opportunity for further experiments and may open the way for complete separation of the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank at some future time if it is thought desirable. The two bills that have come before us represent a further step in the evolution of the banking system of Australia. In all our .considerations, it is important to remember that the system is in a state of evolution and that, in fact, banking and currency matters which have been subject to vast changes during the past few decades may well be subject .to further considerable changes in the not so far distant future. The advent of managed currencies has brought with it the occasion for neW technique and, in particular, the necessity for strong and well managed central banking. I believe that in these two bills some real progress has been made towards freeing the trading banks of irksome restrictions that arose from the 1945 legislation. If they were allowed to remain, they would completely smash the private banking system of Australia under a socialist government. The only regrettable thing about this amending legislation is that, after it has I bebeen placed on the statute-book, it may be amended at a future date by a socialist government just as easily as it was drafted by this Government. However, the possibility of the legislation being so amended will depend very largely upon the good sense of the people of Australia. They should make doubly sure that the socialists, who are in Opposition to-day, are never again allowed to take over the reins of government and give effect to the threat uttered only yesterday by the honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Deputy Leader of the .Opposition, that once they get back into power they will change the face of Australia. legislation that affects banking matters must always be given very earnest and serious consideration, by not only the When so much depends members of this House, but also the people of Australia. For that reason I approach the consideration of the bill now before us, as' I did to the one that was passed by the House last week, with a good deal of interest and I subject it to a great deal of critical examination. Bad as was the bill that was passed last week, this bill is regarded by the Opposition as being even worse than the Commonwealth Bank Bill because it seeks to make many sweeping amendments of the vital principles that were embodied in the 1945 banking legislation. In order that these sweeping amendments may be better understood, I shall deal particularly with two revolutionary changes which this bill proposes to make to the Banking Act 1945. The first relates to special accounts.",28,Menzies
102,Mr Claeey (Bendigo) [4.31],"AnyI n brief, the measure proposes that instead of 100 per cent, of the deposits being the maximum amount which may be called up by the central bankI stress the word ""maximum""-for the base period a maximum of £220,000,000 has been fixed. For the first year thereafter the maximum liability of the trading banks in respect of special accounts is to be fixed at 75 per cent, of increased deposits and for following years the most extraordinary provision has been made that the maximum amount that may be called up by the central bank is 10 per cent, of the increased deposits for each year. The Commonwealth Trading Bank is to have its base deposit fixed at £15,750,000. That briefly is what is proposed in regard to special accounts. The second revolutionary proposal is one that has not been mentioned by honourable members opposite during this debate. Indeed, it was almost slurred over by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his second-reading speech. I refer to the total repeal of section 28 pf the Banking Act 1945 the provisions of which are very important from the stand-point of the Australian people, particularly when we remember that the Commonwealth guarantees the deposits of the whole of t.he trading banks. Section 28 reads as follows:A bank specified in PartI . of the First have made provision for their settlement. Schedule That is, the private trading banks^shall not, except with the consent in writing of the Commonwealth Bank, purchase or principles such as those that are contained subscribe to(a) securities of the Commonwealth or the debate would have been commenced of a State, or of any authority of on a high plane, because there is nothing the Commonwealth or of a State; (&,) securities of any local governing the community, and nothing can cause body in Australia, or (c) securities listed on a Stock Exchange application of financial policy.

This bill consolidates posals contained in it were necessary. and finalizes what has been done in the We should have investigated the whole Commonwealth Bank Bill which promatter from the stand-point of what is vides or the establishment of the Combest for the community. Unfortunately, f monwealth Trading Bank as a separate from the commencement of the consideraunit under a separate governor. A good tion of the bill the debate has been on a deal has been said by honourable mem-r political plane. Every attempt has been bers opposite in an attempt to justify that made by honourable members opposite to Mr Clarey. change, but they have completely failed to recognize that there is a very big difference between the trading banks, which are entirely separate and distinct one from the other, with separate incorporations, separate shareholders and separate boards of directors-^eac h a complete autonomous unit and each following its own policy and subject only to tbe limits of its policy-and the Commonwealth Bank. The private baiiks are subject to the provisions of the Banking Act, which lays down certain broad principles relating to the control of their funds so that, as individual units, they will not be able to cause financial upsets in Australia. The Commonwealth Bank, which is now to be known as the Commonwealth Trading Bank, is in an entirely different position. It is a part of the central bank and is subject to the control of the officers of the central bank and to the policy laid down by them. There was not the same necessity for rigid control of a bank which is controlled by the central bank as there is for private banks each of which follows policies of its own and is concerned solely with its own affairs. In future the Commonwealth Trading Bank is to be a separate entity with its own general manager, and because there is a possibility that disputes will arise between the central bank and the Commonwealth Trading Bank, we Such disputes could not possibly have arisen in the past. When we were dealing with very big in this bill, one would expect that as sensitive as the financial structure of disaster more quickly than the wrong debate been kept on a high plane we besmirch, the Opposition and to charge it with low or, perhaps, ulterior motives. As a consequence, the vital principles of the bill have been almost completely overlooked by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth), at the beginning and at the end of his speech, charged the Opposition with ulterior motives because of its criticisms of the bill. One can understand his doing so because the Prime Minister himself adopted a similar attitude. Before the right honourable gentleman even attempted to explain the measure he saidIn .the hands of a Government bent upon dominating the central bank for its own politiLabour did not seek in any way to emcal ends, these excessive powers would be a potent weapon for attacking the independent existence of the banks themselves. Therefore, great political issues are involved in these matters. Thus, from the start, the attitude of the Government has been not that this is a matter of a sound national economic structure, but a matter of political issues. Dealing with the activities of the central bank, the Prime Minister saidI want to say at once, because it is as well only the banks, but also itself in serious that, as far as possible, we should fight this matter out on clear ground, that in my opinion bhere is no cause for believing that the Commonwealth B'ank has used its powers under the Act otherwise than in promoting economic stability and in carrying out its other central community. No government that desired bank responsibilities. That commendation applies equally to the Labour Government's administration of the 1945 legislation until 1949 as it does to this Government's administration of it since it assumed oifice in the latter year. I say with the greatest possible emphasis that the Commonwealth Bank has endeavoured to apply the principles embodied in the Banking Act. It is noteworthy that this Government should pay tribute to that institution for the manner in w.hi'ih it has carried out its responsibilities. Having regard to that fact, the .suggestion made by Government supporters that the Chifley Administration .did not administer the 1945 legislation with justice to tlie private banking institutions or -in the interests of our economic welfare is completely groundless. If honourable members apposite are .suspicious of .Labour in r.espect .of its financial policy, members .of the Opposition have every reason to be suspicious of the purpose for which this measure has been introduced, particularly insofar as it will affect the preservation of the community's assets. We are justified in suspecting that the Government is more concerned with advancing the interest of a banking monopoly and of big business than it is with the preservation of the assets of the people. Much has been said about the special accounts. I emphasize that the Labour Government did not insist upon the private banks lodging with the central bank 100 per cent, of their increases of deposits. barrass the private financial institutions in its exercise of the power for which the 1945 legislation made provision. It refrained from doing so, because no central bank and no government would seek to cause a crisis in the banking industry. I readily admit that nothing could be more calculated to destroy a government than a deliberate act on its part to cause such a crisis. Everybody knows that it would thereby place, not difliculty and, as a consequence, the people as a whole would suffer. Experience in the past has shown that such a crisis would disrupt the whole economic life of the to survive or to see the nation progress would take any .action that would tend to cause a crisis in banking. Therefore, it ds nonsensical for Government supporters to suggest that a future Labour government would take action of that kind. Up to the present, Government supporters have not made a case to justify the alteration of the existing system proposed to be .effected under this measure. Those honourable members cannot point to any event that has -occurred during the last few years that would support bheir contention in that respect. On the contrary, the central bank and the private trading banks have been able to carry <&a -their operations satisfactorily. The central bank has invariably permit-ted the -private trading banks to withdraw the amounts which they sought, and no harm -has been done to the banking life of the community. Therefore, I cannot comprehend why, after a period of seven years since the establishment,of the present system, during which time no difficulty whatever has arisen in the relationship between the private trading banks and the central bank, the Government should now propose to make revolutionary changes of the kind that are embodied in this measure. During that period we have not experienced all thc economic vicissitudes that can befall a community. It is true that prices have risen rapidly and that the present Government has not used its power to prevent prices from rising. For instance, during the last three years, costs have risen by approximately 60 per cent. I assume that Government supporters, who promised the people that they would put value back into the f l , realized what that promise involved. should have utilized to the full the resources at its disposal that would have enabled it to honour that promise. The special accounts were established primarily for the purpose of preventing secondary innation. However, the new formula, for which this measure makes provision in respect of the special accounts, will be bound to encourage secondary inflation during the next two, or three, years. Under the measure, the private banks will be obliged, during the next twelve months, to lodge in the special accounts 75 per cent, of increases of deposits. In view of the fact that the Government believes that that provision can be implemented for a period of twelve months without danger to the community, I should like its supporters to explain why it now proposes that after the lapse of that period the proportion of increases of deposits, which the private banks shall be obliged to lodge in the special accounts, should be reduced to 10 per cent. The private banks are to be permitted to retain 90 per cent, of increases of deposits for use in their ordinary trading activities. As we have not yet had an opportunity to judge accurately the effectiveness of the the special account liabilities of the 1945 legislation during a period when prices rise or fall rapidly, no one can say whether that legislation is actually unsatisfactory or incapable of enabling the central bank to deal with grave economicproblems that may arise from time to time. Consequently, the Government is Mr Clarey. unwise in proposing to make these changes; in the existing system. In fact, it is running from one extreme to the other. Whereas under the 1945 act the private trading banks can be obliged to lodge 100 per cent, of increases of their deposits with the central bank-although , as I have said, they have never been obliged to do so to that degree-it is now proposed to reduce that percentage to 10 per cent. Such a provision must inevitably adversely affect our economy. Perhaps, one reason why the Government now proposes to reduce the maximum lodgement to 10 per cent, of increases of deposits is in order to enable the private banks to take full advantage of opportunities for investment, and, indeed, speculation, in Commonwealth and State bonds, loans for local governTherefore, the Government ment authorities or securities that are listed on the stock exchange. The granting of such powers to the private banks is fraught with great danger to Australia. The trading banks may become active competitors with the people in the purchase of Commonwealth bonds and municipal bonds, and may also become competitors in the purchase of stock exchange securities. Those powers were taken from the private banks in 1945 for excellent reasons. Many honourable members will recall the inflationary effects that resulted from the financing of war loans in World WarI . During that period, the private hanks not only purchased war bonds, but also granted financial accommodation to private individuals who desired to purchase them. Indeed, the private banks in those days were prepared to advance up to 90 per cent, of the cost of the bonds. That policy increased the inflationary pressures. Subsequently, the Banking Act 1945 debarred the trading banks from dealing in that kind of security. The present Government, under .the bill now before the House, proposes to reduce private banks after 1954 to 10 per cent, of their increased deposits. The alteration, together with the additional power to purchase securities will materially increase secondary inflation. I warn the House that the proposals of the Government can have a disastrous eifect. If the export prices of wool, wheat and butter were to fall suddenly and the private banks found themselves short of funds, their immediate reaction would be to unload those securities upon the market. Consequently, our prospects of obtaining loan money for developmental works would be completely destroyed, and interest rates would rise. I foresee that, in periods of financial and economic stress, the powers that may be exercised by the private banks in these matters can become dangerous to the welfare of the people of Australia. The Government is unwise to permit the trading banks to engage, in this kind of investment. One thing is certain. Cheap money is essential to national development, the expansion of private enterprise, and the maintenance of a condition of full employment. The pursuance of any policy that can destroy the availability of cheap money is bound to have grave repercussions on our economic life that will be full of peril to the people. The Government should not permit a condition of affairs in which the private banks could unload bonds upon the market, sell shares on the stock exchange, and indeed, do everything they could to depreciate the price of securities in order to obtain ready money with which to save themselves. I emphasize that these proposals may have a disastrous effect on every phase of our public life. This policy will make it difficult for enterprises to be carried on, and for governments to secure the money that they require for public works. The policy will also force an increase in interest rates, and produce unemployment. Yet the possible effect of this great power, which can be used for evil, was dismissed by the Prime. Minister in his second-reading speech in the following words:When there ist a provision in Section 2S of the Principal Act which prevents the Banks from purchasing Government stocks or securities listed on the stock exchanges and so on without the approval of the Commonwealth Bank. The power to control investments by the Banks was first taken during the war. It may very well have been necessary at the time but we do not think it is any longer justified because we believe, in the matter of investment, co-operation between been introduced on the ground that the the Central Bank and Trading Banks to be a very much better method of achieving the less restricted objectives that are now existing than the rather stern necessities that were iu existence during the war. The description of this sweeping and revolutionary change was accomplished by the Prime Minister in those few lines. He did not say one word to prove the need for the change. He did not indicate why the change should be made. However, the valuable safeguard in the Banking Act 1945 is to be removed, and a new power is to be placed in the hands of the trading banks that may be used for good or ill . In certain circumstances, that power is bound to be used for ill . Yet the community is none the wiser about the reason for the change. I certainly do not regard the brief explanation given by the Prime Minister as a complete justification for this startling proposal. When I find that such changes are proposed, and no substantial reason is advanced for them, I naturally become suspicious of the whole bill, and say to myself, "" U p to the present time the Banking Act 1945 has worked well. It has enabled full control to be exercised over banking activities. It has been used for the purpose of preventing secondary inflation. As far as I am able to see, the act is giving satisfaction to the banking world. Yet, we are asked to agree to changes which cannot be justified on any grounds "". I submit that the proposed alterations, together with the amendment to repeal the section of the act that makes provision for a maximum interest rate, are not in the best interests of the people. I go further than that, and say that they are positively dangerous to the Australian community. This change seems to envisage a period in which interest rates will constantly rise; and to the extent that interest rates constantly rise, our development will be retarded and hampered, and the prospects of the maintenance of full employment will be minimized. We have encountered in our economic life during the last eighteen months a good deal of difficulty which could have been overcome if the Government's financial policy had been more positive and substantial. Now this legislation has Labour party cannot be trusted. Everybody knows, and the honourable member for Isaacs admitted that legislation and confidence in the system.

104,Mr Fuller,"It is as dead as the honorable member for Hume( Mr after VJ Day, which was the 15th August, Fuller) for his interjection, because the Banking Act 1947 was introduced as a result of the 1945 banking legislation being challenged on .a minor premise. I remind honourable members that minor issues in legislation can be altered by legal means. Although the Labour party now has a new leader-.the present Leader of the Opposition-it s platform remains the same as formerly. Every member of the Australian Labour party is pledged, to support the nationalization of banking. I defy any honourable member to refute my contention that, at some stage, every bona fide member of the Australian Labour party, has pledged himself, in writing, to the nationalization of banking. Recently, an attempt has been made by some insincere and politically conscious members of the Labour party to gloss over these notorious facts, but the old revolutionary spirit is still active in the hearts had been successfully challenged by the of the more robust members of the party. Both the honourable member for East Sydney (Ward) and the honourable member for Melbourne have recently indicated beyond all doubt to this House that their objective is the nationalization of banking. Turning to the bill before the House, in fairness we Aould consider whether the result of the application to it of the test of integrity, co-operation and confidence would prove that it will contribute to the establishment of an efiicient banking system in this country. In order to make this test really informative, I shall analyse the provisions of the 1945 act, and explain its evils. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that that legislation has never been attacked. I do not believe that statement to be true, and I shall now proceed to attack it myself. I shall then explain how the bill before the House will rectify the evils inherent in the 1945 legislation. The Chifley Banking Act of 1945 was the nucleus of Labour's plan for the post-war socialization of banking. That act and the Commonwealth Bank Act of the same year were passed before the cessation of hostilities in World War II . , but they were not proclaimed until immediately"" 1945. That the Labour socialists intended these two measures to be the weapons with which they would strangle free enterprise w.as made plain to everybody when the High Court held to be invalid that so-called minor section of the Banking Act which provided that certain banks should not conduct certain business. The Chifley Government immediately showed itself in its true colours. In the grand manner, and with a complete disregard of every inoral principle, the socialist leaders announced their nationalization proj>osals. These are the notorious facts, and the Leader of the Opposition need not waste his breath in telling the jjeople of his temporary and lately acquired views on banking. T f the 1945 banking legislation of the Chifley Goveriunent was not intended to be a means of eliminating the public trading banks, why, after only one minor section Melbourne Oity Council, did the Labour Government enact legislation for the absolute nationalization of banking? The Opposition has stated that the Government has no mandate for the bill that is now before the House, even though the general election campaigns of 1949 and 1951 were fought principally on the issue of banking. Yet in 1947 the Labour Government refused point-blank to take up our challenge to submit to a referendum the proposals that it had embodied in a measure which would have cost the taxpayers £100,000,000 cash in one swoop and, without popular authority, would have transformed Australia into a socialist state. The bill does not apply to the Rural Bank -of New South Wales, which last year handled sums that amounted to about £50,000,000. This is a fact which is worthy of note. That great institution will be completely outside the zone of the vast and intricate plan that the Government has prepared to provide for the complete and sensible control of the nation's credit mechanism. The chairman of the Eural Bank of New South, Wales recently remarked, when reviewing the bank's record, that it had foreclosed on",36,Menzies

Yet here is a government bank which enforced 2,000 foreclosures in one year during the depression! That is a fact worthy of their consideration. Can they produce factual information to support their proposals for the curbing of the public trading banks, which, according to them, rob the poor people in times of depression? I remind them that the Rural Bank of New South Wales is owned, controlled and directed by a State government. This bill will not affect the existing provisions for the licensing of banks in Australia. Under its terms, it will not be necessary to submit an explanation to a bank if its licence is withdrawn. solvent?

Do they believe that he should be omnipotent? They would admit, if they were unprejudiced, that this bill will improve the provisions of the 1945 legislation. Should not the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank be relieved of all responsibility for deciding whether or not a trading bank is alone should not bear such responsibility. Therefore, the Government has decided that he shall have the assistance of the Auditor-General, for whom everybody in Australia has the utmost respect.

I agree with the honourable member for 'Bendigo that the fact that this bill will allow the central bank to continue unchanged, with a Governor in control and with substantially the same powers as it has commanded up to the present, indicates that the Government has faith in its integrity. Therefore, honourable members opposite should accept the Government's proposals at their true value, as I do. They are beyond all doubt. Yet the Labour party blandly objects to the entire bill. The proposed amendment of the provision that the banks shall hold assets to cover their liabilities is unspectacular but is typical of the sound common sense and business acumen of the Government and its supporters. The facts are clear. Had the banks been forced to adhere strictly to the terms of the Chifleywas to be accepted by the Court as prima Evatt provision, they would not have been able to finance our export trade to the same extent as they have done. They have run risks but if they had not ignored that provision, to some degree at least, they would have found themselves in trouble. Proposed new section 22 ( P ) of the measure now before us relates to the information to be provided by the Commonwealth Bank. This new section will provide the opportunity for the trading banks to exchange views on financial trends with the central bank.

The Opposition say that it is not 57 of the Banking Act, which is to be repealed, reads as follows:Where any offence against this Act or the regulations has been committed by any body corporate, the chief executive officer in Australia of the body corporate shall be liable to the penalty provided in respect of that offence, but nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the body corporate. That is an instance of the operation of a terror scheme. Section 59 of the act, which is also to be repealed, readsThe production of any certificate purporting to have been given by the Governor or Department Governor of the Commonwealth Bank certifying to any matter relating to the failure of any person to comply with any of the -provisions of this Act or the regulations shall in all courts he prima facie evidence that those matters are as so certified. In that section the onus of proof was placed completely and absolutely on an individual. A bald statement by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank facie evidence. That provision represented a sinister attack on the rights of the individual. If the board of directors of the Bank of New South ""Wales issued certain instructions to their general manager, and he gave effect to those instructions, should he be personally liable for his actions as the servant of the board? The whole concept is monstrous. If honourable members opposite ever understood what it meant they should be severely criticized for supporting it. I could speak at some length of the members, including the Leader of the Opposition, have endeavoured to persuade loaded. The facts are evident from the ruthless fashion in which the Labour Government gave effect to its policy in 1947 when an attempt was made to establish a government planned and directed economy. On the other hand, there are Opposition members who could be described as more robust mentally if not physically, because they honestly proclaim their beliefs. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is always honest, forthright and direct, 3aid that he still supported the Banking Act of 1947 and believed that its fulfilment would lead to the achievement of the ""aims of the Labour party. Yet the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), who always speak so moderately and learnedly, have never explained their fundamental beliefs, in this House. But the statements of these honourable members can be found in the press reports of the triennial conferences of the Labour party during the last twenty years. At those conferences those honourable members have made their position clear. Because a change of Government must result in another movement towards socialism, it is vital that our banking system should be a clear one. Simplicity leads to ease of understanding. All sorts of trickery and double dealing can take place underneath a cloud of confusion. I hope that I shall live to see the achievedisposal of the banks for use as they ment of a sensible and rational financial system. As people develop their minds and begin to question the soundness of the economy they will demand to know exactly what every government institution is doing, whence it derives its powers of expenditure, how much it expends and whether its expenditure is sound. When that day comes and we have a highly intelligent community, the myth of planned economies and socialism will vanish. bill interlocks with the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which the House passed last week. It is designed to repeal certain provisions and to amend other provisions of the Banking Act 1945, which was passed during the term of office of the Chifley Government. The purpose of that legislation was the protection of tbe nation against the inflation that endai gered it in the immediate post-war period. It was introduced as the result of the Labour party's previous experience during the Scullin Government's term of oflice, when the Country was in a sore financial plight because private banking institutions had cornered the market on government stocks and bonds. The late Mr W. M . Hughes, who, at the time of his death recently, was the right honourable member for Bradfield in this chamber, increased interest rates to 6 per cent, when he was in oflice. The ordinary citizen was at that time unable to buy a bond, because all the available bonds were snapped up by the banking institutions, which subscribed as mucb as £6,000,000 or even £10,000,000 in one loan. That shows what they will do to pick the eyes out of the best security investments in Australia. The Chifley Government's banking legislation was designed to prevent inflation, and made it mandatory for private banking institutions to open special accounts with the Commonwealth Bank, in whicli they had to lodge 100 per cent, of the increase of their deposits that had occurred since July, 1945. It is now proposed to reduce the liability of the private banks so that they will have to deposit only 10 per cent., instead of 100 per cent., of the increased deposits. The remaining 90 per cent, will be at the please, and we shall find them once again cornering the market for Government securities and engaging in other investment operations in which previously they have not been permitted to engage without special authorization. Freedom! They say, ""Let us have freedom"". Freedom of competition! A combination of all the private banking institutions will by virtue of the power conferred by this legislation attempt to smash the people's bank. The Commonwealth Bank, which was established by the Fisher Labour Government in 1911, has rendered yeoman service to this country in two world .wars and during an economic depression. It is tragic that a proposal should now ba made to put the private banks in a position to crirmle the Commonwealth Bank,, as they will certainly do if the present",38,Menzies
108,Mr James (Hunter) [5.30],"ThisGovernment is allowed by tbe people to remain in office for mucb. longer. I do not think the people will have much more of this Government, because the electors realize that Australia is a country worth fighting for and protecting. But that may not be the case if Australia is to be controlled and robbed by the private banking institutions, as it was until 1912. The GommonweaUh Year-Book for 1932 shows that there was at that time a total of £59,454,413 in circulation in paper, notes, gold and coins. The same Year-Book shows that the aggregate deposits in the Oommonwealth Bank, private trading banks and the Commonwealth and State Savings Banks totalled £540,072,000 or £480,617,587 more currency than was in circulation. Since the Commonwealtb Bank alone has the right to create legal tender in the form of currency, then the other banks had obviously, at that time, created almost £481,000,000 worth of credit. How is such a credit created ? ""We know that it is done with the deposits that people lodge in the banks, which the banks lend out at interest. Some people borrow money from the banks and leave the deeds of their property as security. I myself did that, and I have not yet paid off the principal. I borrowed the money from the Commonwealth Bank. Such advances are credit that is created, in effect, by the posed legislation will permit still further bank that makes the loan. All banks do it, although the Commonwealth Bank is supposed to have the sole right to issue legal tender. Before the Commonwealth Bank was in existence I remember that, on a visit to New South Wales from Queensland, where I worked, I received only 19s. 6d. for each Queensland £1 note that I cashed in New South Wales, because the banks in those days issued their own currency, and the New South Wales exchange rate on Queensland £1 notes was 6d. The Government wishes to see a return to that position, and will encourage the banks in that respect. My object in this debate is to direct attention to the dangers inherent in this measure. From time to time attempts have been made to compel governments to assume full sovereignty over insurance and the control of purchasingpower which, all other contentions notwithstanding, is the life-blood of every economic structure. Without exception the present Government refuses to face the facts, yet I believe that an awakened conscience will some day compel it to act. I hope that that day is not far distant, because this measure is a retrograde step. Australia has advanced under its present banking system. The Commonwealth Bank financed the nation in two wars, and prevented it from having to pay a huge rate of interest for its financial accommodation. The following words of William Jennings Bryan may be repeated here with profit:The money power preys upon the nation in time of peace, and conspires against it in time of war. It is more despotic than monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes. It can only be overthrown by the awakened conscience of 'the nation. The late Myer Anselm Rothschild is reported to have said, ""Let me control the credit of a nation and I care not who makes its laws "". That is perfectly true. If a person possesses sufficient financial resources, he may dictate to governments. The private control of credit has brought ruin and disaster wherever it has be^n permitted to operate. Because this proprivate control of credit, the Opposition is attempting to relate again the story of the 'nineties. At that time my own parents lost £150 in the Lambton Bank, or Creer's Bank, as it was known. I was-then a small child, the youngest of twelve, but I know that £150 in 1893 was a large sum of money. My parents never received back one penny of that sum. An impartial analysis should force honourable gentlemen to the conclusion that there is imminent danger of inflation in the proposed interference by the Government with the special deposit accounts system which was established to obviate the threat of inflation, following World War II . Yet this Government is asking us to amend the Banking Act, the purpose of which is to avert inflation, in order to allow private banking institutions to operate in their own way.",40,Menzies

I have had nothing from the private banks, but I have had assistance from the Commonwealth Bank. The circumstances in which we exist today remove banking policy from the field of party politics.

In such circumstances, the important question is not whether private enterprise or socialism should prehonorable members now force me to say vail, but whether we are to survive. It seems, to me that the greatest misown electorate by Mr Holloway because take that Australia made in the past was he clearly foresaw that a terrible depresto adopt the doctrine that what is sound sion was looming.

The fallacy tain action in order to save this country of the doctrine I have just mentioned is apparent when it is appreciated that the Old World has long since reached the zenith of its production. It cannot even support itself but must rely for its food on the under-developed portions of the earth, such as Australia. The immutable laws of private enterprise or capitalism make it imperative for profits to accrue from the production and export of manufactured goods. In that way the purchase of essential foods for Europe is made possible. TJnder the economic doctrines of the London School of Economics, which many Australians seem to have swallowed with such gusto, our position is reversed. Whereas manufacturers in the Old World must borrow money with which to erect factories in which to make goods for export, so that food may be bought, we are told that we must export food so that we may be able to buy ploughs with which to produce more wheat, and so on.

In that period of our history the shrewdness and the cunning of Mr Bruce was outstanding. TJnder the grace of God, and by the courage of our forbears, we have become the possessors of a great heritage. Arc we now to be told that we can use and develop that heritage only so long as it will return dividends to the private banks? Yet that, in essence, is what ths present financial system demands. And this, despite the fact that a royal cominiscompels one to repeat with fervour the sion has declared that our own financial institution, the Commonwealth Bank, can provide all the finance required for the opening up of new lands and the erection of new factories, "" debt and interest free "". That finding ought to be branded in letters of fire on the minds of every member of the Parliament, for upon its implementation the fate of every Australian citizen hangs. We either move onward as free men, walking upright in the sight of God and in fellowship with each other, or we become the debt slaves of a man-made system which brings affluence and luxury to the few at the expense of the energy and toil of the many. Beyond all the facts I here present there is still one more most disturbing aspect of our present financial system. It has been established beyond the shadow of a doubt that 80 per cent, of the purchasing power in existence consists of money loaned to the public by the private banks, and that it has no relationship whatever to the goods and services available for exchange. As the late Mr Chifley pointed out in his minority report as a' member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, the boards of directors responsible for creating this money have one object, and one object only, in view-the return of dividends to their shareholders. Yet the effective exchange of all goods and services is also entirely dependent upon the existence of this loaned money. Such power in the hands of these directors gives them virtual control over the life and death of every citizen, for having the power to create ahd distribute this medium of exchange, they also hold the power to withdraw it. That power was exercised in the days of the great depression, when the private banks of America withdrew 2,300,000,000 dollars in one day in September, 1929. This proposed legislation will not only confirm this power over life and death but will extend it, for it will say to the trading banks, "" Whilst we extend your power to pump money into the community by means of loans and advances, we, as the people's government, have divested ourselves of all power to prevent you from taking it out by the process of calling up those loans and advances"". Such a betrayal of trust immortal lines of WhittierNow, when our land to ruin's brink i» verging, In God's Name let us speak while there is time; Now, when the padlocks for our lips are forging, Silence is Crime. For the Government silence is certainly a crime, but there is a padlock on the lips of every honourable member who supports the Government Many people believe that the banks lend out their deposits. They do not. The banks createnew money whenever they make loans. They issue cheque books, and the credit allowed in the account upon which the cheque book is issued is new money. At the end of 1949 the deposits in the special accounts of"" the trading banks with the central bank amounted to 41.6 per cent, of the total deposits in the trading banks. At the same time their advances, which were merely pen and ink entries in books, had increased to £403,000,000 an increase of 65 per cent, in currency which had been loaned out by medium of the cheque system. Long ago we prevented private banks from issuing their own notes, but we do worse to-day for we allow them to make their own credit. By the overdraft system and the use of cheque forms the banks are still practically creating their own notes. The honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham) has repeated in parrot fashion the statement made by other honourable members on the Government side that the Labour party believes in the nationalization of banking. We on this side of the House are not outlaws. We believe in the law of the land. The High Court has, in effect, laid down that the nationalization of hanking is illegal. However, speaking solely for myself and not for the Labour party, I say that as long as I remain inside the party I shall always advocate the nationalization of banking. I suggest that the nationalization of banking is just as necessary as was the nationalization of postal services. able member's time has expired. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. Treasurer) [8.0] -The arguments raised by the Opposition on this measure are specious in the extreme. One could go further and say that they are so unintelligible that they hardly merit any reply or criticism. If the utterances of honourable members on the opposite side are any criterion, the Opposition's ignorance of matters relating to banking policy can only be described as pitiful. The truth is that, as in the case of the Commonwealth Bank bill, the Opposition speakers have done their best to throw up a smokescreen. Apparently they have an acute dislike to talking about their views on tbe nationalization of banking, and so they have talked about practically everything but the issue that is before the House. Indeed, they have even tried to pretend that they are not longer interested in the bank nationalization issue. If they really believe still leaving an ample reserve power. The that our banking system sliould be maintained in its present form, why do they not come out in the open and say so? All honourable members know the answer. The Opposition, knowing full well that any step towards the socialization of banking in Australia would be anathema to the great majority of the Australian people, has chosen to bide its time. In the meantime, Opposition members are adopting whatever subterfuges they can to evade the question and to camouflage their aims. The only issue in the bill that is before the House is simply whether the Commonwealth Bank should have powers in excess of the legitimate needs of proper central banking controls. Those who answer that question in the affirmative can have an eye only to the destruction of the comnetitive banking system in Australia. We on this side of the House have made our position clear time and time again in unequivocal terms, but we are waiting in vain for a clear statement from the Opposition as to where it stands on this matter. The Opposition has failed to declare whether it desires or is pledged to the competitive banking system, or whether it is pledged to carry out its objective to nationalize banking, which would mean the nationalization of all that we have. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) would have honourable menibers believe that the proposed amendments to the special account provisions of the 1945 banking legislation will seriously weaken the central bank's powers to control inflation Sir ABTH UB FADDEN -That is sheer nonsense, as a few facts and figures will readily show. Opposition members interjecting, able members are not prepared to maintain order in the chamber to-night they will maintain it outside. is that if the special account provisions in the bill had been included in the 1945 legislation, the central bank would have had power to make all the calls to special accounts which were actually made since the passing of that legislation, while figures tell their own story. In September, 1948, which roughly marks the beginning of the period when bank deposits started to increase rapidly, the special account balances of the major private trading banks stood at £267,000,000. If the formula in the bill had been included in the 1945 act, the actual amount the Commonwealth Bank could then have required the banks to hold in their special accounts would have been £308,000,000, or £41,000,000 more than the actual balances. In September, 1949, under the new formula, the banks could have been required to hold a maximum amount of £385,000,000 in their special accounts. The actual balances amounted to £307,000,000, a difference of £78,000,000. In September, 1950, special account balances stood at £459,000,000.

Special account balances rose to a record amount of £583,000,000 in May, 1951. Yet the new formula would have produced a maximum callable amount of £765,000,000 at that date. In other words, even when special accounts were at their highest level, there would still have been a reserve power to call up a further £182,000,000. Special account balances were £521,000,000 in September, 1951. The operation of the new formula would have permitted the calling up of £164,000,000 over and above this figure. In the following month-October, 1951the provision in the new formula for the automatic adjustment of the uncalled liability once a year to 10 per cent, of deposits would have come into effect. This would bave reduced the reserve from £164,000,000 to £119,000,000. The reserve power as modified in this manner would have been quite ample for' the legitimate purposes of credit control. By the end of September, 1952, the special account balances of the major private banks had fallen to £183,000.,Q00. At this date the maximum amount which, under the new formula, the central bank could have required the private banks to hold in special account would have been £542,000,000 or no less than £359,000,000 more than the amounts actually held. The provision for adjustment of the uncalled liability to 10 per cent, of deposits would have come into operation in the following month of October, 1952, when the uncalled liability would have been reduced from the unduly high figure of £359,000,000 to the more reasonable figure of £106,000,000. Once again, the adjusted figure, when taken in conjunction with the power to call up 75 per cent, of any subsequent increase in deposits, would have constituted an ample reserve. At the same time, the banks would have been given a due measure of. relief from the enormous uncalled liability which had accumulated and was hanging over their heads. The figures I have cited show how fantastic are the claims that the central bank is being left with inadequate powers. The fact is that the central bank will still have ample power for the legitimate [24] purposesI emphasize the word ""legitimate ""-of credit control. All that is being done under the bill is to remove the ridiculously high reserve powers that the operation of the 1945 act has produced. In other words, the bill removes the weapon of socialization that has threatened the trading banks. The protestations of Opposition members on this point can only leave the feeling that they want to preserve these ridiculously high reserve powers for their own sinister piir>poses. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his second-reading speech, the private banks could virtually be put out of existence tp-morrow if the central bank decided to exercise to the full its powers under the 1945 act-in other words, if it called up the uncalled liability of the trading banks. Tbat is the position which is being remedied by the bill now before the House. That is .the basic reason for its introduction. Its sole purpose 33 to protect the competitive trading bank system of Australia from thd onslaught, hidden or otherwise, of socialization. The Leader of the Opposition implied that the special accounts system is the creation of his party and that we are attempting to destroy his party's pride and joy. He apparently needs to be reminded of a little history. The special account system was instituted in 1941, during my previous term of office as Treasurer, as a voluntary war-time arrangement with tfye private banks. The Labour party's subsequent banking legislation, which initially took the form of regulations under the National Security Act, merely gave statutory form to the arrangements made before the Labour party assumed office towards the end qf 1941. I emphasize that we believe, as much as does the Opposition, that the special account system, is, under Australian conditions, the best means of controlling the volume of credit released through the banking system. We want to see the system preserved; but we want to remove the possibility that, under the administration of a government with socialistic aims, it could be used as a weapon for unfair attack on the private banks. The Leader of the Opposition made some curious observations about the administration of special accounts. He seemed to tliink that the Government blames tbe provisions of the 1945 act for the economic problems of recent years, whereas, he said, the real trouble has resulted from the administration of special accounts. That is a classic example of the lengths to which the Opposition is prepared to go in an endeavour to sidestep the issue by specious and nonsensical argument. Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues that there need not have been one iota of difference in the administration of special accounts if the provisions in this bill had been written into the 1945 legislation. The right honourable gentleman also referred to the big fall in special is quite wrong. It is obvious that the account balances between May, 1951, and October, 1952. He implied that these releases were made for some hidden motive of help to the private banks, and he went on to say that the problem of the bank's huge uncalled liability to make deposits to special account was brought about by the releases which were made in that period. That is yet another example of specious and ill-informed argument. Even when special accounts were at their peak of £583,000,000 in May, 1951, the uncalled liability of the banks to make further deposits in special account was still of huge proportions. At that date the banks cpuld have been required, under the provisions of the 1945 act, to hold no less than £906,000,000 in special account, or £323,000,000 more than the record level of special account balances. This is a striking illustration of the fact that the 1945 legislation has operated to give the central bank powers over the trading banks that are far in excess of the legitimate requirements of credit control, and has thereby constituted a weapon readily at the hands of those who desire to nationalize the trading banks of Australia. As for the imputation that there was some hidden motive behind the releases that were made between May, 1951, and October, 1952, the simple fact is that, due to the substantial fall in our overseas funds position in that period, the liquidity provisions will unduly weaken the operaof the banking system declined sharply, and it was necessary to make releases in order to preserve the ability of the banks to make loans to their customers. If the Sir Arthur Fadden. releases had not been made, a chaotic situation would assuredly have developed. Thanks to the wise administration of credit controls by the central bank, we emerged from that period with the stability of our economy unimpaired. This afternoon the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) made some I .inform the observations in regard to special accounts which need to be answered. The honourable member said that the central bank's power to make calls to special accounts after the first twelve months would be dramatically reduced to 10 per cent, of the increase in the banks' deposits. That honourable member has completely misunderstood the new provisions relating to special accounts. After the first twelve months-that is, after September, 1953the maximum amount which the central bank may require a bank to hold in its special account at the end of any month during subsequent years shall be as follows:(a) the amount actually held in special account on the preceding 30th September, (6) plus its uncalled liability on the preceding 30th September, or 10 per cent, of the level of its deposits in the previous August, whichever is the less, (c) plus or minus 75 per cent, of the increase or decrease in the level of the bank's deposits since the beginning of the period. The honourable member for Bendigo interpreted the new provisions to mean that the central bank may make additional calls only equivalent to 10 per cent, of an increase in deposits, instead of the 75 per cent, as actually provided in the bill. The difference of 65 per cent, is rather significant. So much for special accounts. The Opposition has not made one valid point of criticism. Opposition speakers have claimed that the new special account tion of vital safeguards against inflation, but they have backed their argument only by vague generalities. I think that I have amply demonstrated the spuriousness of their claims. The only conclusion that can be drawn from their arguments is that they consider that the central bank should be left with power to strangle the private banks. Their real motive is thus revealed. They should have declared unequivocably where they stand on the basic issue in the measure before the House. The issue is simply whether the private banking system should be protected by the removal of the unnecessary reserve power to call up to special account possessed by the central bank, or whether power should. continuously reside in the central bank, as it does under the provisions of the 1945 act, to place the banks in serious jeopardy and make them completely dependent upon the whims of government policy. The Leader of the Opposition made some startling comments about the central bank's control of interest rates and of the advance policy of the private trading banks. He suggested that the bill, in some way which he did not explain, would take away the central bank's control of those matters. That suggestion is absurd. The provisions of the 1945 act relating to the control by the central bank of the policy to be followed by all banks in making advances are not now being altered in any way except to require the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank to follow the policy that the central bank lays down. In other words, the Commonwealth Trading Bank will be required to comply with the law which the private trading banks are obliged to observe. The Leader of the Opposition, apparently, is singularly uninformed about that matter. The relaxation that was made in the central bank's advance policy some time ago has been represented as a form of preferential treatment to the private trading banks. . Such a contention is absurd. The Opposition does not seem to be able to sort out its own thoughts with respect to credit control. With one voice bonorable members opposite talk of the need to make more credit available but with another voice they conjure up a terrirates. fying picture of the need for further measures to control inflation. Clearly, the Opposition does not know its own mind on this subject. Advance policy was relaxed because the more stringent controls had served tbeir purpose. It was evident that with the declining liquidity of the banking system, which was brought about by the drain on our overseas funds, there arose a need to increase the ability of the banks to finance their advance business. This was done in two ways; first, by making releases from the special accounts; and secondly, by easing the purposes for which banks could provide loans to their customers. If such measures had not been taken we should have invited a serious recession in the Australian economy. As it was, we were able not only to weather the storm but also to emerge from it with an economy which, basically, was more stable. Just as the advance policy provisions contained in the 1945 act are not being altered, except to require the proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank as well as the private trading banks to observe any advance policy laid down by the central bank, this measure does not affect the central bank's position with respect to the control of interest rates. It simply provides that the Commonwealth Trading Bank as well as the private trading banks shall observe regulations that are made by the central bank with respect to interest rates. The power to make such regulations remains undisturbed. Members of the Opposition have stated that control of interest rates has been abandoned. That statement is incorrect. The control of interest rates was previously exercised by orders made under National Security Begulations. When those regulations lapsed they were not replaced by permanent legislation because complete agreement was reached between the central bank and the private trading banks regarding rates of interest to be charged on banking transactions. In view of that voluntary understanding, it was considered to be unnecessary to bring down formal regulations. However, the power to make such regulations remains and it will be exercised if any of the banks fails to observe the wishes of the central bank in respect of interest I repeat that members of the Opposition have not advanced one valid argument against the proposals contained in the bill. They have once again revealed their desire to destroy the competitive banking system that now exists in this country. Tbey bave persistently run away from the question of whether they believe in the preservation of our banking system on the basis of fair competition. Once that principle is accepted, no reasonable objection can possibly be raised to tbe reforms which it is proposed to make under this measure. The sole purpose of the bill is to remove .the central bank's excess powers which clearly go far beyond those that it' needs in order to exercise proper central bank control. The Opposition's failure t'o address itself to that simple issue speaks for itself. That failure certainly reinforces the belief that, given the opportunity, the Opposition would not hesitate to use the administrative weapon to injure the private banks) which are their pet hate, and, ultimately, force them out of business. The Government has answered that threat by introducing this measure, which will make it impossible for the private banks to be subjected to malicious attack without the people of Australia knowing all about it. deeply conscious of the honour the electors of Flinders have bestowed upon me by choosing me as their representative in the Parliament. I propose to do all in my power to prove' worthy of that honour. In my endeavour to represent all the electors of Flinders, regardless of their party political affiliations, I shall be doing with the private trading banks. But no more than emulating the example set by my predecessor. The issue in the measure how before the House is not precisely that which the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) stated. The real issue is whether or not the central bank is to' possess adequate power to perform in the future central bank functions which it has already been obliged to relinquish by administrative action. The main purpose of this measure is simply to give legal sanction to certain administrative acts of the present Government during the last three years. Generally, the Australian people now accept the fact that credit and monetary controls are vital to our economic existence and to the welfare of the people and that such matters are finally the responsibility of the Government and of the Parliament. The Australian Labour party recognizes that governments have a special duty to level out the economic inequalities of inflation and deflation. Accordingly, a Labour government made provision in the 1945 act for adequate powers to control both those features. It is significant that one of the earliest acts of this Government, in accordance with its banking policy, served, first, to accentuate inflation and, secondly, to bring about a position in which our banking system is no longer adequately clothed with power to prevent deflation, which may easily occur in the future. It is well to examine the nature of the powers of the central bank. TJnder the 1945 act the central bank has only powers of restraint in order to prevent undue inflation or undue deflation. The central bank does not possess positive power to control the private banks for the purpose of ensuring full employment by having them made advances or refrain from calling up existing advances in a time of deflation. When history is written, the private banks may well realize that their best interests, as well as those of the people, would have been served by thc retention and not by the weakening of necessary central bank powers. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), when introducing the Commonwealth Bank BilT, stated, in effect, that the function of the Commonwealth Bank, in itsgeneral trading division, was merely to compete above all, we have emphasized the fact that the one positive power which previously existed was that the General Banking Division operated, not detached from, but intimately connected with, and part of, the central banking function. The report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systemsacknowledged the responsibility of government for monetary policy. That responsibility, in the present stage of the economic cycle, Government supporters prefer to ignore in this debate. The Government has relinquished, by administrative action, control over the interest rate. The Treasurer has just referred to that matter. We all know that in the past, high interest rates have been associated with an increasing level of unemployment. We also know that under the policy of this Government, interest",44,Government Supporters H E Was
123,Mr Ewert (Flinders) [8.25],"I amrates have risen, and unemployment has increased. Now the Government has chosen to give away, not by legislative action, but by administrative action, control over interest rates. Significantly, too, before the Flinders by-election, this Government saw fit to relinquish administrative control of advance policy. That referred, not only to the amount of advances that, nrivate banks should make, consistent with a full level of employment, but also the direction of investments, whether by essential or non-essential industries. I make no reference at the moment to the independent bank board. As the result of administrative action, and two specific aspects to which I shall refer later, the central banking power has been vitally weakened, and has, in fact,, been passed to the private banks ""to exercise as they see fit. No obligation exists with them for public welfare, or maintenance of full employment. They exercise no responsibility in those matters. So, the first respect in which the central banking power is weakened is by the adoption of the new formula for the special account system. It is well known that, basically, the private banks make money available, or retract their advances, in relation to the amount of liauid reserves that they hold. In otber words, if they hold adequate liauid reserves, they are able to increase advances. If they find that their liquid reserves are receding, it is their practice to reduce the amount of credit available. It, is on the basis of those specific features talks of the high level of uncalled liability, that central bank control must be operated so as to eliminate the excesses of the trade cycle which this country has experienced in the past, and which threaten us again. This Government, during its first bility lies definitely on the shoulders of eighteen months' administration, in the Government itself. creased tbe uncalled liability in respect of the special accounts by £200,000,000. The Treasurer has referred to an amount the subject of decisions by the High Court of £323,000,000 uncalled in May, 1951. of Australia and the Privy Council. A But let us not forset that £200,000,000 government now has no power, by of that uncalled liability arose during administrative action, to overcome the the administration of the present Goillegalities which were found by those two vernment. The position simply was that courts. Therefore, any statement to the from 1945, the Chifley Labour Governcontrary, even if made in the course of a ment recognized that Australia was in a recldess tirade, such as the one Ave have state of development and not of inflation. just heard, is no more than a beating of That Government administered the Bankthe air. ing Act 1945 in a way calculated to make available to the community and business firms an amount of credit adequate for a developing economy, but not suflicient to force along inflation. At the end of 1949, the present Government came into oflice, and, during the first eighteen months of its administration, increased the uncalled liability by £200,000,000. It failed to call up that amount. Let us not forget also that during the first eighteen months of its administration, there was a new surge of inflationary pressure, much of which was fed by none other than the amount of £200,000,000 which had not been called up by this Government to the special accounts. Let me carry the matter a little farther. The Government adopted a special policy of encouraging imports-on e of the mistaken notions that have cost this country so dearly. The theory was that if suflicient imports could be introduced into Australia, the Government would be able to carry out its pre-election promise in 1949 to put value back into the £1. Imports were encouraged; the private banks were encouraged to finance imports; and the central bank was instructed to release sufficient of that special account reserve to make this new policy possible. In the next eighteen months, no less -than £412,000,000 Avas removed from the special account and made available to the private trading banks. The Treasurer will do well to remember that when he the Government of Avhich he is a member contributed to that position, and, indeed, really made it, first by increasing the amount by £200,000,000 in eighteen months, and then releasing £412,000,000 from the special accounts. That responsiBank nationalization has certainly been There is another aspect that we should bear in mind. The nation is experiencing inflationary conditions. The new level set for the special accounts is only 75 per cent, of the level that was determined in 1945. Yet we are to face possibly a further spurt of inflation with such a low starting base. Of course, the Government may argue that, under the formula, as deposits increase, the central bank is competent to call more money into the special accounts. But we should remember that there is no certainty in the future, judging by the movement of deposits during the last six months, that deposits will increase at all. If deposits do not increase, we cannot establish in the special accounts a reserve to counteract dangerous deflation. Plainly, one of the main features of the administration of the Chifley Government is needed now. I shall refer to it briefly. The capacity of the private banks to create credit was limited to the degree that their excess reserves were taken into the special accounts, with the result that inflation was reduced and a buffer was established to prevent dangerous deflation. In other words, at a time when banks would normally feel inclined to call up advances, the central bank, having an adequate reserve, would be able to release money in order that the liquidity of the assets of the private banks might be retained and advances would not be called in. In a time of deflation, when private banks call in advances, increasing numbers of people lose their employment.' unemployment grows in snowball fashion. It has done so in the past, and threatens to do so again. Unfortunately, the safe reserve against deflation, which is now threatening has been removed, and the central bank has lost most of its essential powers to meet any dangerous deflation. A further provision has been included in tbe bill. IfI remember rightly, it was not mentioned by the Treasurer, but it was referred to, in passing only, by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his second-reading speech. I refer to the repeal of section 28 of the principal act, which dealt with the investments of private banks. section appears' full of technicalities. Mr Ewert. The effect of its provisions was that the central bank, by exercising control over the investment policy of the private banks, could supplement the credit policy that was applied through the special accounts system. To avoid the technicalities, it could be said that, if in a time of inflation the private banks choose to buy securities on the open market, they take pieces of paper from the people who previously held the securities, and give to them money-o r purchasing power-in return. Therefore, in a time of inflation, by buying in securities the private banks could aggravate inflation, which the special accounts provisions were intended to control. It is significant that the control over the investment policy of the private banks, which has been exercised under the 1945. act, will be removed by an apparently innocuous amendment. Let us say that in the future the private banks, which now hold treasury-bills and other profit-making securities, instead of adequate special account reserves could, at a time of deflation or at a time of inflation, counter the action taken by the central bank to correct the excess of that trade cycle. It is most significant that that power is to be deleted from the act and no longer, however it may try, will a central bank in this nation be able to employ one of the most potent weapons against the trade cycle, a weapon which is used particularly in the United States of America. The issue is whether or not we are giving to our central bank In that way, adequate power to operate, on behalf of the nation, a credit policy designed to prevent the excesses of inflation and the dangers of deflation. Clearly, the Government's answer to this question is. "" No "". It is very important, as I said earlier, that we should consider legislation in the light of its economic background. The Government has chosen not to do so. Although Australia may have a rosy future,, let us not think that the problems of the future will not be very difficult problems. ""We can see in our economy elements both of inflation and deflation, and Australia is in the process of choosing That which way it will go in the future. Let us remember that although our economy could experience a further hurst of inflation, the central bank will not have adequate power to call sufficient extra liquid reserves into the special accounts in order to check the excesses of the trade cycle, because the new formula is based uot on increase of assets but on increase of deposits, which easily could be reduced. During the last three years Australia has experienced a 52 per cent, increase of prices. This may or may not appear significant. But let us not forget that we are compelled, by the very nature of our economy, to compete in markets overseas. itself out of overseas markets, Australia is finding it very difficult to compete in its home market. Our prices have increased twice as much as have the prices in the United Kingdom and New Zealand; three and a half times as much as prices in Canada; and five times as much as prices in the United States of America. Yet, this Government has seen fit to claim that it has controlled inflation. If inflation has exhausted itself, it has done so only because the Government, by its banking policy and other policies, has given full play to the riot of inflation. Trends of deflation are evident in the economy. The Commonwealth Statistician indicates, month by month, in his Bulletin of Employment Statistics, the number of persons who are employed in this country. ""Within a period of thirteen months the number of persons employed in Australia decreased by 110,000. That figure did not take into account immisrrant workers who havp come to this country, or the number of young people who have come newly onto the employment market. It is very significant that we can only sell our goods in two markets, that is the home market and the overseas market. The market most -important to Australia's employment situation is the home market, over which we can exercise some effective control. We must sustain that market by ensuring a condition of full employment and adeouate incomes. Unemployment depresses our home market. If we fail to sustain the home market at an effective level of purchasing power, this nation could be plunged into a deflationary period, which is alreadv threatening. As I hnve said, the significant part of this legislation is that part which technically recognizes the depletion of those central bank special account reserves, which were intended to prevent dangerous deflation. Tho money which could have been placed in the special accounts was first used by this Government to spur along inflation. By releasing an amount of £412,000,000 from the special reserve, pursuant to the Government's import policy, we lost the main counter or buffer between the people of Australia and a dangerous deflation. Let us not forget that the first effect of that policy was the In addition to pricing loss of employment by thousands of Australian workers. The Government admitted, by its subsequent severe import restrictions, that its import policy was all wrong, that is, that its policy to release £412,000,000 from special accounts was wrong. Australia is at the parting of the economic ways. We must decide now whether or not a new spurt of inflation shall be allowed to continue. This legislation will take away the power of the central bank to prevent it. We must decide, too, whether or not special accounts reserves shall be used as a buffer against dangerous deflation. That buffer has been taken away by the administrative action of the Government, which will be given legal recognition by the enactment of this measure. The central bank powers that are essential to the levelling of the excesses of the economic cycle have been deliberately smashed by administrative action, which will be confirmed by the bill. ""Whereas previously the voice of the people was heard through a banking policy exercised on their behalf by a necessarily powerful central bank, the voice of the people is no longer heard. am sure that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ewert), like a seasick passenger, will feel much better now that lie has delivered his maiden speech in this Parliament. I am reminded of the former honourable member for Flinders, the late Mr Rupert Ryan. His successor will be fortunate indeed if he becomes as rich in friends on both sides of the House as was the late Mr Ryan. In accordance with the practice of this HouseI do not wish to criticize the maiden speech'of the",48,Government Supporters H E Was
124,Mr Wheelee (Mitchell) [8.51],"Ihonorable member, but I am obliged to point out that he strayed slightly from the path of fact. The honourable member will be well advised to take a close interest bill will insert in our banking legislation in the discussions at the next meeting of the Australian Loan Council. He has said that high interest rates and unemployment occur at the same time. It will be interesting to see whether the Australian Loan Council, at which five State Labour treasurers will be able to out-vote one State Liberal treasurer and the Commonwealth Government, will alter interest rates. The honourable member also said that the decisions of the High Court and the Privy Council on the Chifley Government's banking legislation had made it impossible for any government to nationalize banking in Australia by administrative act. The honourable gentleman was under a misapprehension. The Privy Council ruling made it impossible for any government to nationalize banking by act of parliament. ""What Australia has to fear is that a socialist government in the future will endeavour by administrative act, not by act of parliament, to nationalize the trading banks. The honourable member's speech was well received by the Opposition, and no doubt it gave expression to the views of his colleagues on the subject of banking. The whole controversy in relation to the Australian banking system shows how difficult it is for a community to rid itself of the creeping paralysis of socialism once that disease has attacked it. We in Australia are not the only people who have experienced this difficulty. The Churchill Government in Great Britain, for instance, is having trouble in restoring energy, drive and efficiency to industries which were placed under government control and ownership by the former Labour Government of that country. We must be thankful that this bill will weaken substantially the stranglehold of the Chifley special accounts system, which gave to the Commonwealth Bank the power to squeeze the trading banks out of business at any time. The new special accounts system for which this bill provides will allow the bank to retain sweeping powers which could be misused under a socialist administration. some of the peril that has threatened our private banking system will be removed, Mr Wheeler. and this, notwithstanding the clamour of the Opposition, will represent a great gain for the people of Australia. The the only proviso that will afford the nongovernment banks any substantial relief from the oppressive provisions of the Labour Government's acts of 1945. Although the relief will be substantial, it will be only partial. In effect, the bill will wipe out the huge uncalled liability that now hangs over the heads of the private banks, but, from now on, fresh liabilities will continue to accrue as deposits increase. Briefly, the Commonwealth Bank will be empowered to call up 75 per cent, of all increases of deposits. No banking system can function properly under such a load, and it is obvious that, even under the provisions of this legislation, the private banks will be compelled to continue to rely on sympathetic administration of the law by the Commonwealth Bank Board. In these circumstances, it is amusing to hear honourable members opposite talking about an attack by the Government upon the so-called people's bank. The Commonwealth Bank will remain in full control of our banking system and can, in certain circumstances, have the trading banks at its mercy. Honourable members opposite have no justification for opposing the bill if the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has sincerely stated the policy of the Labour party on the issue of bank nationalization. It is obvious, therefore, from their loud howls of protest, that they are still intent on the nationalization of the trading banks as soon as they regain power. No other interpretation can be placed on their attitude towards this bill and the related measure which the House has already passed. For once in his career, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has attained notable distinction, because he has emerged as one honest man in the Labour party who is blunt enough to state his intentions. The honourable gentleman has admitted that he subscribes to the nationalization of the trading banks. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr However, James) this afternoon ranged himself alongside.the honourable member for East Sydney and stated without equivocation that he, too, was pledged to the nationalization of the trading banks. Thus, the threat of nationalization still persists. It is a disturbing fact that the bill will not affect some of the vital features of the banking system that influence the confidence of the business community. Tears arise instinctively because there cannot be any sense of real financial security while the Commonwealth Bank Board, as it is now constituted, holds such wide discretionary powers as it will continue to hold after this bill becomes law. The trading banks will be obliged to depend still on the sympathetic exercise of the board's powers. Having regard to this fact, and to the structure of the board, we have reason for anxiety. Dr. Coombs and his associate from the Commonwealth Bank are the only members of the board who have had any training in the business of banking. Therefore, it is natural that they should dominate the board on highly technical issues which must arise from time to time in the process of controlling and directing a central banking system. Because of this, I believe that the Commonwealth Bank Board cannot hold the scales impartially between the interests of the Commonwealth Bank and those of the trading banks. I have maintained consistently that there should be separate boards for the central bank and for the new Commonwealth Trading Bank. Nevertheless, I consider that it was unfortunate that the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) last week drafted and circulated a proposed amendment, which he later withdrew. The adoption of the amendment would have served only to perpetuate certain dangerous features of our banking system. Such an amendment, apart from considerations of party loyalty, could not command support because it could not achieve its objective. I think that the amendment was prepared without a great deal of thought for the practical side of t.he banking situation. In its essence, it proposed .to leave the present board in cliarge of the central .bank. To my mind, this proposal would leave the situation practically as bad as ever and perpetuate a nuisance. It is necessary to have not only a separate board but also a separate governor for the central bank and the Commonwealth Trading Bank and it is essential that the governors and the members of the boards should be qualified in banking and men who would guarantee impartiality. The Commonwealth Bank Board, as at present, constituted, represents principally the government banks and departments, a fact which has not always made for impartiality in the commercial life of this country. The crux of the situation is that under this bill the Governor of the Commonwealtb Bank, by far the most powerful man in Australia's financial structure, will be left as the governor of the central bank. He will be the controller of thc destinies of his competitors, the private trading banks. It must not be forgotten that this man was appointed by a socialist government as a part of its campaign to make banking a government monopoly. In order further to illustrate the weakness of the present position I invite attention to the fact that it is specially provided in this legislation that information supplied to the central bank will not be revealed to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. In other words, Dr. Coombs, as the governor of the central bank, is not to inform himself, as controller of the Commonwealth Trading Bank, of figures that he will receive from his competitors, the private trading banks. Surely the provisions of this clause add a somewhat Gilbertian touch to the situation. Or are Dr. Coombs and the members of his board to assume the role of the wise monkeys and neither hear nor see any information concerning the trading banks' activities .except insofar as it affects the future or powers of the central ba nk ? It is expecting too much of human nature to expect a person not to tell himself something of his competitor's business, particularly if the competitor is doing better than that person. Such a business as banking can be conducted only in an atmosphere of strict secrecy. The bill does not provide for that atmosphere. Banking can be conducted only in an atmosphere of confidence and trust and it is obvious that in order to preserve tbe secrecy which the Government recognizes is necessary, two institutions of the Commonwealth banking system must have separate governors. The fact that the bill makes provision for the interchange of omcers destroys any hope of secrecy. I do not wish to be unduly critical but I say that if Dr. Coombs were the archangel Gabriel himself he would still find is impossible to administer dual positions of Governor of the central bank and Governor of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. Government, in this bill, has attempted to make the Governor into a split personality. This can only have the usual result. The person who develops a split personality has to decide eventually which master he will serve, and Dr. Coombs will have to decide whether to serve the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the central banking system. TJnder the bill, the same board will be left in charge of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the central bank. As Opposition members have revealed in the course of their remarks on this bill, the Labour party considers that political representatives should be appointed to the board. We should take a realistic view of Labour's intentions in regard to this legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that if the socialists are returned to office either they will repeal this legislation entirely and place the whole of the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank and the banking system under the control of a socialist dictator; or they will arrange a majority loading of socialists on the Commonwealth Bank Board. Such a board would be called upon to arbitrate between the private banks and the government banks. If the board is politically loaded there can be no doubt of the action that will follow its deliberaby the central bank and which will also tions. I now wish to suggest an amendment which might be made to this bill. I believe that it is time that the central bank in Australia had some means of guiding the course of the money market as central banks guide the money market in most other coutnries. The obvious indicator of interest rates in Australia would be the rate of interest charged by the central bank on moneys made available to the trading banks. I think that the banks should announce this rate publicly from time to time, giving proper Sir. Wheeler. information to every one concerning any variation of the rate. This rate, if it is properly calculated in order to accord with conditions of the time, would, I think, serve as a guide for commercial transactions generally and enable the efficiently the central bank to influence tbe money market without using the drastic powers of compulsion that are favoured by the The socialistic type of administration. It should be an invariable rule that the rate charged to all Australian banks by the central bank sliould be the same. It would be immoral, for instance, to charge a lower rate to the Commonwealth Trading Bank than to private banks. The bill provides in proposed new section 22A that the Commonwealth Bank shall pay interest at halfyearly intervals to a bank on the daily balance of that bank's special account at a rate to be determined from time to time by the Commonwealth Bank with the approval of the Treasurer. But there is no provision with regard to moneys which the Commonwealth Bank may make available to the trading banks in certain circumstances. Obviously, under the pressure of a socialist Treasurer, aided by a socialist-minded Governor of the 'Commonwealth Bank, it could be arranged that the private trading banks would pay a high rate of interest which would ruin tbem while money could be made available to the Commonwealth Trading Bank, under some pretext, at a very low rate of interest. I hope, therefore, that the Government will agree to the incorporation of a clause which will provide for the publication of the interest rate charged guard against discrimination in this matter between one bank and another. Unlike honourable members of the Opposition I am endeavouring to make an objective approach to this bill. It has been my lifelong impression and line of argument since I became a member of this House that the banking system should work on a voluntary basis. In other words, if a degree of mutual Irust and confidence can be established between the central bank and the private trading banks, the central bank would be able to iuduce the trading banks voluntarily to adopt policies whicli the central bank might deem best in the interests of the community. Compulsion should be exercised only as a reserve power. The leadership in ensuring cooperation sbould be in the hands of the central bank itself. In other words, it could be achieved in an atmosphere of round-table conferences without the whip being flourished and without the private banks being told that they must do certain things in accordance with the law. It seems extraordinary to me that, since I have been a member of this Parliament, the idea of voluntary co-operation, not only in respect of banking, but in respect of other matters also, has not been fully exploited. I believe that if a basis of mutual trust and confidence could be established it would be to the betterment of our trading conditions and to the general harmony of our banking activities throughout Australia. should be no question of the Commonwealth Bank using compulsion on the trading banks. I sucreest that it might be in the interests of the Government to instruct the central bank to do its best interjectedto introduce a spirit of goodwill and co-operation between it and other banks, and that some system should be devised, such as is used in the Bank of England, where the cash deposits ratios are varied to ensure a more satisfactory system of banking. I turn now to the Opposition's attitude site who do not wish to have the banka to this bill. However the Opposition nationalized, such a process, once started, may try to cloak its arguments, there goes on automatically unless there be emerges the fact that socialization is still in oflice a government determined to the major plank of the Labour party's arrest it. The people of Australia are platform. Despite the strenuous attempts at present fortunate in having in office a now being made by the Leader of the government that believes in the free Opposition (Dr. Evatt) to pass as a conenterprise system and is determined'not verted moderate, the people will not be to see it go. deceived by this masquerade. At heart the right honourable gentleman is a socialist, and he is leading a band of avowed socialists. Let it not be forwhether I am gone politically, but I know gotten that the rieht honourable gentleman some honourable members who are. gone strained every legal nerve in his body to mentallv. The fate of the private bank? have the private banks nationalized by is not the only issue at stake. The whole legal process. His efforts were defeated future of Australia would be imperilled by tbe Privy Council. In his bid to in the event of a socialist government uonvince the people that he is a moderate crainins; oflice, and I believe that, that is he could not be worse served than he is the reason why the people are not willing by the socialistic members of his own to elect such a government .to office. I party. The honourable member for East accept this bill, and the Commonwealth Sydney( Mr Ward) apparently clings to the .Labour party's platform of bank nationalization. The ardent socialists opposite cannot extricate themselves from that position even if they wished to do so. The Leader of the Opposition pursues a very forlorn hope if he aspires to present his band of merry socialists as supporters of tbe free enterprise system. The weight of evidence is against them. I shall cite as a part of that evidence an interjection made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) while I was speaking on the Oil Agreement Bill in this chamber on the 14tb October last. I referred to members of the Labour party who were in Opposition at the time of the formation of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited in 1920, and said, in the course of my remarksAt least members of the Labour party in There those days were more honest on thc subject of socialization than are members of the same party to-day. They were socialists and were not ashamed of the fact.

FULLER (Hume) [9.15] -There is one word, and one word only, in which the Government seems to place its faith. That word is ""nationalization"". The Government parties look to it to win the Senate election for them. I have in my hand an extract from the Melbourne Age of Thursday, the 24th November, 1949, at which time a general election campaign was in full swing. The Melbourne Age report is headedThe report readsAdelaide, Wednesday -The Liberal Party will unhesitatingly nationalise any public u t i l it y not operating for the benefit of the people. The Leader of the Federal Opposition ( Mr Menzies) gave this undertaking to a meeting of 2,000 people at Norwood Town Hall tonight. Mr Menzies said the Prime Minister( Mr its historic name. It has no mandate to Chifley) had stated that the question of socialisation was not dead as an election issue. However, some person had "" shrugged his shoulders "" because Mr Chifley had then qualified his statement by saying the Labour Party believed in socialisation only for those utilities acting against the interest of the people. He himself agreed with this form of nationalisation. "" We stand for freedom and not for exploitation,"" Mr Menzies added. "" If you can show us some public u t i l it y which is operating to the detriment of the people, then I , as Leader of the non-Socialist parties, would nationalise it tomorrow."" There is no difference between what the present Prime Minister advocated then and what the Labour party advocates. I consider that this legislation is the last desperate throw of the most discredited government ever to hold power in this country. This calamitous Government has no mandate for this legislation. It has been censured from one end of Australia to the other. In fact, it knows that it has failed to take a trick. If I am right, then every honourable member opposite has the political death rattle in his throat. The Government will be thrown out of office immediately the people of Australia are given an opportunity to pass judgment on it. I am in full and complete accord with a statement that was issued by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) on the 19.th February last, when he told the people that he opposed the bill now before us. He saidStripped of superfluous words and obvious trappings this legislation of the Menzies Fadden coalition has two main purposes: first, to divide, undermiue and gradually weaken and subvert thc Commonwealth Bank which has been so extremely successful as au instrument of the people; and secondly, to break down wantonly the existing system of special deposits which' was instituted by the Curtin and Chifley Governments to prevent, in the war and immediate postwar years, which it did successfully, rising prices and inflation of the currency which havo recently caused such hardship ami suffering. The legislation which is now to be amended was approved by the people in 1946. The Australian Labour party had a mandate for that legislation. Certainly, the calamitous Menzies Government has no mandate to attack the charter of the Commonwealth Bank or undermine the goodwill of the central bank, the trading bank or the savings apparently bank. The object of this Government is not to ensure fair competition between the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank but to provide excessive and unfair profits for the private banks at the expense of the Commonwealth Bank and its depositors, who comprise a majority of the people. I believe that the people of Australia are opposed to banking monopoly. In fact, in 1949 they returned a verdict against nationalization of the private banks. As a member of the Australian Labour party, I accept that decision. However, the people have also given a verdict in favour of the retention and expansion of the Commonwealth Bank, which is their own property. The present Government is attempting to destroy the Commonwealth Bank, which has been the great financial bastion of the people, both in war and in peace. Money is the greatest moral and social problem which mankind has ever had to consider. It is the root cause of all evil. It affects the lives, fortunes and happiness of every human being in society, and of generations yet unborn. All other problems sink into insignificance compared with it. Money is tlie lifeblood of trade and commerce. Unless tbere is an ample supply witb wbicb. to meet tbe growing demands of trade, enterprise w ill be checked, trade depressed, and tbe public unable to secure -and enjoy tbe abundance of tbe necessaries and good things of l if e which inventors and scientists have provided. The power -of money touches almost every human act and affects almost every human emotion. It is the key to almost everything we do. What is almost as important, it is also the key to everything we want to do. Properly used, it is a power for untold good. It was properly used by the Chifley Government. I know that Australians have not forgotten the suffering and unemployment which prevailed during the depression years, when the bankers declared that money was not available for necessary public works or for the building of home's. The struggling farmers could not sell t'heir produce to the hungry people because of the alleged shortage of money. Home-buyers lost their homes because repayment of advances was demanded before the purchasers were able to pay the last instalment. The businesses of small traders were closed down because of the withdrawals of overdrafts. In Australia alone, 600,000 men-ou r own flesh and blood-walke d the streets in search of work. More than 500,000 men, women and children learned the dreadful lesson of the dole. Let us ask ourselves who should govern -the people or the private banks, with their policy of dividends first and "" hang the consequences"". I know that many supporters of the Government object to a strait-jacket being put on the banking system. I believe that the Australian Government should accept f u l l responsibility and control of the monetary policy, in the interests of the people. I can remember, as though it were only yesterday, the last speech made by the late John Curtin before the 1943 general election, when he saidSever again wiil it be said that money can be found for war and not for peace. I pledge my Government tliat it will find all the money that is necessary to maintain full employment. That pledge was not just an ordinary election promise , it was a challenge to his masters, the banks. It was precisely what the electorate wanted. It was a re-assurance against the fears held by so many that depression would -retur-n. The Commonwealth iBank Act was passed in fulfilment of that pledge. When the Chifley Government introduced the 1945 banking legislation I declared that the bill was amongst the most important that the Parliament had ever been called upon to consider. I then said that I desired the electors of Hume, and the people of Australia generally, to know where I stood on the subject of banking reform. I said that I was convinced beyond a shadow of doubt that the people welcomed the legislation. I 'believe that they still want that legislation to-day and do not want this discredited Government to tamper w i th it . A t that time. I also referred to the report of a conference of the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association, held in March, 1945, in order to prove that the Australian Labour party was not alone in its support of the 1945 banking legislation. The people whom the present Government claims to represent stood foursquare behind that legislation which was introduced by a Labour government. The report statedDelegates to the Victorian Wheat and Woolr growers' Conferenice decided unanimously to support the Federal Government's proposals to establish the Commonwealth Bank on its charter and to abolish the bank board as a necessary measure of post-war rehabilitation. It further urged that a representative of the rural industries should he appointed to the proposed Commonwealth Bank Advisory Council. More than 200 delegates voiced their approval of the 1945 bank bills in their speeches or by applause. That was the first public opinion in relation to that legislation expressed in Australia by an organized body of primary producers. I remember clearly how many supporters of the present Government went into their dugouts when the Victorian farmers had spoken. The report continued"" Control of banking is necessary in the post-war period "", declared Mr F. W. Mitchell of Lalbert. Mr Mitchell said that unless the Commonwealth Bank had continuity of financial policy it could not run the country. If credit were cut off, depression Would follow. The national credit of Australia must be used for the benefit of the people. If the financial policy were not stabilized, then prices of primary products could not be stabilized. Mr A. C. Everett said that he wanted to remind the wheat-growers that when they were offered a stabilized price in 1930 the Commonwealth Bank refused tbe then government the money to pay the growers and the result was that wheat was sold at ls. 6d. a bushel. No stabilization plan was safe, and no government could live up to its promises unless it controlled the banking system. When the war was over, said Mr activities of this great institution. An Everett, the trading banks would follow the policy of deflation to use up their excess deposits which then amounted to £500,000,000. He addedBankers are dealers in debt. No uncontrolled banking system is going to pay good prices for commodities so that we farmers can pay off our debts. If we are to have stabilizacial interests desired, and what they detion we must have a stabilized bank. After World WarI . it was said that nothing was too good for the soldier and Mr Everett said, "" nothing was what he got"". That was due to depression caused by an unstable financial position. Despite the gloomy predictions of those who opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, this bank has served Australia in a capacity that no private bank could or would have done. A former Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Denison Miller, in a speech at a public function in 1922, said that during the 1914-18 war, loans which totalled £250,000,000 were floated in Australia. He pointed out that the private banks then charged £2.7 per £100 as flotation charges, but the Commonwealth Bank did the work for 5s. 9d. per £100 and thus saved Australia £5,170,000. It will also be remembered that during World WarI . the primary producers of Australia went far towards keeping the allied armies in the field. The fact that the primary industries of Australia were able to continue functioning was due to the arrangements made by the Commonwealth Bank for financing them during the war. The total amount paid to the primary producers during that period was more than £437,000,000. . When the late Mr William Morris Hughes purchased fifteen ships overseas Mr Fuller. because of the ruinous freight rates then being charged by shipping companies, the Commonwealth Bank immediately made £3,500,000, available in London to pay for the vessels. The few illustrations that I have given touch only the fringe of the achievements of the Commonwealth Bank in the interests of the nation, and tbey show clearly the absurdity of the criticism of those who opposed its establshment. With Labour out of office it was not long before the anti-Labour forces introduced legislation that drastically curtailed the anti-Labour government prevented the Commonwealth Bank from carrying on general business, and in 1924 the Bruce Page Government gagged a bill through the Parliament to make the Commonwealth Bank a bank for bankers. That was what the bankers and and the finanmanded from the then government. On this matter the Melbourne Sun of 13th October, 1924 reportedThe Bruce-Page Government took the bold step of converting the Commonwealtli Bank into a Bank for the Bankers. And it remained as such until Labour again assumed office. Now we have the same discredited Parliament able member must not refer to the Parliament as "" discredited "". anti-Labour forces are again set upon curbing or destroying the people's bahk. Australia, in common with other countries throughout the world, has suffered acute depression which has brought about untold suffering, misery and bankruptcy. What causes depressions? Cannot they be prevented? Why should the people live in fear of their recurrence? These are questions that concern everybodymen, women, children, manufacturers, primary producers, businessmen and others. Prosperous periods differ in no way from depressed ones so far as natural forces are concerned, but no matter how well supplied a nation may be with materials and labour, it cannot make use of them without money.

129,Mr Fullee,"The same discreditedcontrol the economic life of the country. This is also recognized by many statesmen, economists and financiers throughout the world. If the last depression has Department. The committee submitted shown one thing more clearly than anything else, it is that economic prosperity including the building of workmen's and social security depend more on monetary policy than on any other single factor. There is no argument as to the correctness of this statement, because the ways, the clearing of Crown lands, water depression proved it. In 1929, 1930 and 1931 the banks contracted the credit of the country by calling in overdrafts. That policy of deflation did more to accentuate the depressed condition of the country than anything else could have done. During the depression there were 600,000 men out of work. Counting their wives and children, there were approximately 1,000,000 people living on the dole. The Scullin Government put forward a proposition to place 50,000 men in employment on full-time public works financed by new money. That would have created demands for food, clothing and furniture and thus would have given employment to thousands of others, but the reply of the banks was, "" No money"". It will also be remembered that when it was proposed to issue £18,000,000 to relieve the unembers of carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, ployed and give some assistance to wheat farmers, the proposal was met with cries of "" ruin "", "" inflation "" and statements that Australia would go bankrupt if the proposal was agreed to. The Senate, in which there was then an anti-Labour majority, threw out the legislation designed to implement the proposal. I think, from memory, that the anti-Labour forces had a majority of 33 to 3 in that chamber. Had that proposal been agreed to, thousands of people would have been profitably employed and we could have helped our wheat-farmers by giving them a fair price for their product. The Labour party was prevented from doing that because it did not have control over banking. In September, 1931, the then Australian Labour government called a Premiers conference to give special consideration to unemployment. A committee was set up that consisted of MrH . ""W. Gepp and Mr J. Gunn, representing the Department of Development, Professor Brigden, Professor Giblin and Professor Hytten as economists, and Mr E. J. Mulvaney and Mr J. F. Murphy, of the Commerce a list of works of permanent value, homes, afforestation, road construction, opening up new land for occupation and serving also to feed the railsupply and sewerage for several country towns and outer suburbs, water conservation for stock and irrigation purposes, dams and bores on stock routes, wheat bulk handling and harbour installations. The committee, in its report, advisedin this emergency, the banking resources of thc country must be used to the limit. I believe that the great Snowy Mountains scheme should have been put into operation then so that it would have been an accomplished fact by now. The banks, however, took a different view and tbe comprehensive plan of public works could not be started because money was not available. Meanwhile thousands of workers and their families were living on sustenance. Had. the housing scheme that was then outlined been put into operation, it would have absorbed great numplasterers and labourers and would have provided work for timber workers, brickmakers, and many others, who are engaged in the supply of materials. In addition to absorbing large numbers of the unemployed, that programme would now be proving a great blessing to the many homeless people in Australia. On numerous occasions, the Commonwealth Bank Board at that time refused to accede' to the request of the Australian Loan Council to provide the necessary money for the States. Although there were thousands of people out of work the Government had not the power to force the Commonwealth Bank to make the necessary money available. Thus it will be seen that for years past, the power of the private banks, coupled with the conservative attitude of the Commonwealth Bank Board, prevented money from being found for essential public works which would have ameliorated the unemployed position of that day. Sir Herbert Holden, one of the most eminent hankers in Great Britain, in a lecture to students at Oxford, saidWhat brought about the depression? Everythe amending bill that is before the body knows that the depression was caused by the bankers tlio world over in following up their time old policy of calling up overdrafts bank from the trading banks, and of and advances. Lord D'Aliernon, British financier, statesman and diplomat, speaking on the economic crisis in 1931, saidWhat has really occurred is a hold-up in currency.' The most significant statement relating to t'he power of those who control money of the British Exchequer and chairman of the Midland Bank, who saidThcy who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of tlieir hands the destiny of the after the beginning of the 1945 people. There is no doubt as to the truth of that statement as has been proved over and over again, especially in the years of depression. No wonder this Government bas been discredited and censured from one end of Australia to the other at every State election and every by-election!

I believe that capitalistic democracies. He was conthe two bills eould easily have been amalgamated in one bank bill. There is no fident that oiie of the great depressions need for a bank bill and a banking bill. This measure relates to two important day of the Eed revolution in what we matters. One is the amendment of the now know'as the free world. The special special accounts legislation to bring it accounts system is aimed at flattening out into line with banking policy and to make an attempt to prevent the nationalization of the banks. The other part of House is designed to bring up to date the statistics required by the central course, from the new Commonwealth Trading Bank itself. The 1945 legislation provides that the central bank may call up a very large amount of money from the trading banks, but not from the tradingsection of the Commonwealth Bank called the General Banking Division. But because of current difficulties and economic conditions, there is an uncalled liability of about £500,000,000. That means that under the Banking Act 1945, the central bank, the Governor, and the board could call up all the new assets accruing to the banks legislation. They must, be lodged in the central bank. As I have said, the Uncalled liability at present would represent over £500,000,000, and if the central bank so desired or a Labour government was returned to office, that money could be called up at once. The banks could thus be made bankrupt or their power.? could be seriously disturbed, and that would be the beginning of the nationalizaThe special accounts or special deposits account systems, which is one of the most in the last few years.

Those operations are of the greatest importance. The special accounts system, under the administration of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. and, eventually, under tlie Commonwealth Bank Board, has worked exceedingly well. There may be some grounds for criticism of it, but on the whole the system as it is operated in Australia and, I suppose, in other countries that have adopted the reserve bank system, has had beneficial results. When too much money is available the surplus is skimmed off and placed in special accounts in the central bank. We are no.t sure exactly what is done with the proceeds of the special accounts. Some may be left in London and some may be utilized to discount treasury-bills. At all events, as the central bank pays only 12s. 6d. per cent, interest on special account balances it has probably made a very good profit out of the system. After we had passed through a period of great economic difficulty the proceeds of the special accounts were fed back to the banks and utilized with signal success. During July, August and September last, when the greatest releases from special account were being made, if a Labour government had been in office it would have undoubtedly used the period to support its argument that the private banks should be nationalized. The use of the special account system enabled the Commonwealth Bank to push money out very rapidly into channels of economic activity and thus the country was saved from a very serious depression. Obviously, we could not expect the banks to continue to shoulder their uncalled liability to make deposits to special account. This amending legislation seeks to give a legislative sanction to the practice that has been adopted by the central bank in the administration of the special accounts system. It is a most complicated measure. I do not know enough about it to say whether or not it could have been better drafted. Those who study it have the greatest difficulty in understanding it. member. uncalled liability of the banks will still remain. At present tbe frozen special deposits in the central bank amount to £226,000,000. We have extricated ourselves from the difficult economic position that existed last year when, on the 15th October, special accounts amounted to a total of only £156,000,000. An amount of £70,000,000 has since been added to special accounts. If this legislation under which 75 per cent, of all new deposits are taken into special accounts were brought into force to-day the deposits of the private banks would be £30,000,000 short of the amount which they would be required to pay to special account. During the period from October last, to the present time bank deposits have increased by £130,000,000 making a total of £100,000,000 due to be called up. Thus, they would have an uncalled liability of £30,000,000. At the end of the current banking yeai--that is, on the 30th September-the provisions of this legislation will change the method of computing the amounts which the trading banks are required to deposit to special account. After the 30th September the maximum amount which the central bank may require a bank to hold in its special account at the end of any month during subsequent years will be the amount actually held in special account on the preceding 30th September, plus the bank's uncalled liability on the preceding 30th September, or 10 per cent, of the level of its deposits in the previous August, whichever is the less, plus or minus 75 per cent, of excess or reduced deposits as the case may be. This is a most complicated bill, but I believe that its provisions will be found to be workable. It will bring the system of special accounts into the realm of possibility instead of leaving an enormous uncalled liability to jeopardize the existence of the private banks in the event of the accession to oflice of a government hostile to their interests. The most important question that is exercising the minds of the people, and of bankers in particular, is whether a future Labour government will attempt to nationalize",60,Nationalisatio N Pledge Liberal Swill Curb Exploiters

It is clear is pledged to socialize industry, producthat, notwithstanding the passage of this measure, the central bank may continue to operate in respect to its own trading bank's advantage. The proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank will have every opportunity to gain an advantageous position in relation to the private banks. For instance, it could gain an advantageous position by being allowed to withdraw from special accounts amounts much larger than those which are released to the private banks. It will be useful to have a glance at the history of the special accounts. In 1940, the private banks voluntarily agreed to deposit in the special accounts a certain proportion of their funds in order to help in the fight against war-caused inflation. I believe such an arrangement should be backed by statute in order to prevent any one bank from gaining an unfair advantage over its competitors. If the majority of the private banks decided that they would not overlend and would carefully limit advances, one of the other banks, in the absence of a statutory proorders. vision prohibiting it from taking such action, could lend to an unrestricted degree and thus place itself in an advantageous formed.] The proposed Commonwealth Trading Bank, as I have said, could shelter under such a policy at the expense of the other trading banks. For that reason any bank that followed such a course should be obliged to pay a penalty rate in respect of abnormal withdrawals from special accounts. Mr Deputy Speaker.

I take this opportunity to re-state the fears of the Australian people of the danger of nationalization by a future Labour government. Once a monopoly in banking, particularly a government monopoly, were established, freedom of enterprise would be doomed. A customer expects to receive advice and assistance from his bank manager. If there were only a government-controlled bank, the customer would get, not banker's advice, but banker's instructions. The banker would tell him what he had to do. The customer, if he did not take the banker's instructions, would not be granted financial assistance. He could take it or leave it. Members of the Labour party favour that kind of system, and a customer would be obliged to get in touch with a politician or a Labour Minister before he could obtain any financial accommodation from the bank. The moment banking becomes a government monopoly, a customer receives not banker's advice but banker's I mention, in passing, that the High Court of Australia, in a judgment given position. [Quorum to-day, has upheld an appeal by the New South Wales Government in a matter involving the resumption of land. The High Court has ruled, in effect, that the State Government is not bound, as is the Commonwealth, by the Constitution to resume land on just terms. In other words, the New South Wales Government may resume land, and conscript services without compensation. That situation is as close to slavery as we can get without actually being serfs. If hanking were a government-controlled monopoly, all freedom and enterprise would disappear. East Sydney and his colleagues could point out, decide whether a customer should reneivp financial assistance from tbe institution. A customer who did not have the goodwill of those honourable gentlemen would get "" knocked back "", and he would not be able to obtain financial accommodation elsewhere.

146,Mr Jeff Bate,"The honorabledirection over the personal lives of individuals. The only restriction on ministerial direction would be the number of hours that a Minister could work each day. Government supporters believe that the nationalization of banking would lead to inefficiency in the banking business. During this debate, the Commonwealth Bank has been lauded by Opposition members, and I agree that the institution has made a special contribution to national progress and development that the other banks could not make. One reason why the Commonwealth Bank has been able to render such excellent service is that the officers who constituted its staff at its inception were drawn from the private banking system. Another reason is that the Commonwealth Bank has been obliged at all times to compete with the private banks, and, therefore, has had to be effiown feeling about the matter is that the cient. We believe that competitive private banking has been the basis of the great vigour and enterprise that have been shown in Australia. Earms, improvements, machinery, stock, fencing, and a host of other things associated with the great primary industries have been financed by the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. I do not tbink that any class of people impresses us more than the great majority of bank managers in country districts. They are wise, experienced, well-trained men who have rendered excellent service to this country. Some of us who were privileged to see many of them a few years ago when there was a great outcry in opposition to the proposal to the Chifley Labour Government to nationalize banking are well aware of the great contribution that those men havo made to Australia. I remind the House that section 48 of the Banking Act 1945 provided that, no State instrumentality or local governing body could conduct its banking business with a private bank unless it had the authority of the Treasurer to do so. The Melbourne City Council challenged the validity of that section, and the High Court of Australia upheld the appeal. The honourable member has exhausted his time. Mr Jeff Bate. The honourable member forMacarthur ( Mr Jefl' Bate) has expressed a couple of views with which I am in complete agreement. He has implied that there is no need for the Commonwealth Bank Bill 1953, and I am in accord with that opinion. His subsequent words appear to support my view that there is also no need for the Banking Bill 1953 because he has said that tbe special account system has operated satisfactorily. Consequently, the honourable member has made it clear that the Labour party has been correct from the beginning of this debate. I claim that the Banking Bill 1953 is unnecessary, because the procedures contained in the Banking Act 1945 have worked reasonably well. I do not believe that those procedures provide sufficient power in a time when the banking structure might be under strain. My central bank has insufficient authority to meet an economic crisis. However, the bill now before the House does not strengthen the power of the central bank, or provide proper machinery to enable an economic crisis to be met. Indeed, this legislation weakens the power of the central bank. Honourable, members have the right to expect that the Government will support its legislation with reasons, and state specifically whether it will benefit the people. No Government supporter has even ventured"" to claim that the CommonWealth Bank Bill 1953 or the Banking Bill 1953 will strengthen in any way the central banking system, or safeguard the future of the Australian people. Yet surely those two tests should be applied to any plan submitted by the Government to this Parliament. No honourable member opposite has dared to say that the two bills will strengthen the position of the central bank or safeguard the welfare of the Australian people. Indeed, the House has been told that this legislation is deliberately designed to safeguard comparatively few people, some of whom are not residents of Australia. Therefore, the two bills are quite unnecessary on any test that can be applied to them, and, to a large degree, they are dangerous. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), and all his supporters who have spoken on",63,Nationalisatio N Pledge Liberal Swill Curb Exploiters

148,Mr Tom Bueke (Perth) [10.15],"these two bills, have either stated or implied that they have been introduced in order to protect perhaps 40,000 persons who are the shareholders of the private banks. In my opinion, the bills will not even do that; but at least no other claim has been made in favour of them. The honourable member for Macarthur has said that some members of the Labour party claim that the nationalization of hanking is no longer a political issue but that my friend and colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr stated, ever since the dawn of the inWard), has made it plain that such an objective is still the policy of the Australian Labour party. As a matter of fact, the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney on this subject was correctly reported in the Australian press that I read. In the Parliament, however, his remarks were viciously distorted. I was present when the honourable member stated that the platform of the Australian Labour party provides for the nationalization of banking, as well as for many other things, but that that would be sought only if a mandate had been received from, the people of this country. Clearly, the honourable member implied, as all of Labour's policy implies, that if we are prejudiced in our efforts to safeguard the welfare of this country we shall unhesitatingly seek the approval of the people to put our policy into effect. If , at some future time, the banks of Australia either individually or in consort, endeavour to hold up the Government to ransom, as they did in earlier days, with the dire consequences of which we are all familiar, the Australian Labour party will certainly seek the consent of the people to do their will. I am sure that, at the present moment, the people would prefer any alternative government, no matter what its policy or lack of policy, to the present ill-starred coalition ain two large financial corporations have Government. Clearly, the people reject the policy of the present Government, and they do not approve of the measure that is now before the House. In recent weeks Liberal members of this Parliament and also of the State parliaments, have taken part in State election campaigns. But in Queensland and Western Australia the anti-Labour parties have been rejected, notwithstanding the banking legislation that was recently passed by this House. I shall now address myself to some of the problems with which Australia is at present confronted, and also to problems that may arise in the future. I shall discuss, too, the banking machinery that has existed throughout the years, and the means that should be adopted to develop a sound banking structure in this country. As the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) has dustrial era there have been boom and slump periods. The booms have increased in their intensity and the slumps have deepened. The periods between booms and slumps have increased as the industrial cycle has progressed. That has been evident not only in Australia but also in other countries. Liberal and conservative governments both in Great Britain and in the United States of America have endeavoured to grapple with the problem, but so far no banking machinery has been devised to cope adequately with the boom and slump cycle of a nation's economy. It has been generally accepted that an essential ingredient of a banking system is a strong central bank, and that such a bank should be a government institution, with the necessary power to enforce its will upon the private trading banks. That principle has not yet been fully developed in any country. In the United States of America, wbich has a very elaborate financial structure, there is a federal reserve bank, a federal deposit insurance corporation, and a reconstruction finance corporation. Although the laws that govern them seek to grapple with booms and slumps, except for the reconstruction finance corporation, they have been unable to do so adequately. In Great Britbeen establisbed, but they have not yet been able to devise a system to avert the full effects of a slump. I contend that that can be achieved only by a central bank which is a powerful government institution. In addition to its negative power, the central bank should have the positive power possessed by the trading banks. The mechanism of central banking provides for open market operations. Money is made available to tbe banking system by purchase of securities, thus increasing cash supplies. These constitute the basis of their leading functions. As the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ewert) stated in his excellent speech to-night that is the way that the banks throughout the world function. They work on the basis of a cash reserve which includes, not only cash in hand, but also short-term securities which can be realized either at maturity or by prior sale. Finally, a central bank should have additional liquid resources, such as were provided for by the special accounts procedure that was brought into operation by the Banking Act 19-15. The basis of liquid reserves is cash plus shortterm bills, treasury-bills, or special deposits. As has been pointed out, by this means in some instances the trading banks are able to advance credit of an amount equal to ten times the amount of their liquid reserves. As I have said before, there is no power to dictate the lending policies of the private banks when the money is available for them. It might be said that the profit motive would force them to do so, but that has not been borne out by events down the years. If we are going to counter depressions we must have a general banking section oi the Commonwealth Bank, which can provide a positive means to resolve these situations. That cannot be done by ordinary banking methods. It can only be done by a general banking department of the Commonwealth Bank. This legislation will weaken the Commonwealth Bank by taking away from it a considerable degree of its trading activities. Formerly the Commonwealth Bank could call upon all the resources of the bank, including the Note Issue Department, in an emergency, but the new Commonwealth Trading Bank will now be required to stand upon its own feet and function within the limits of its own capital and the deposits that it can attract. By implication, the Government has admitted that this measure is designed to protect the private banks of Australia. It makes no attempt to protect Australia's credit structure or its economy, or to develop the central bank. Mr Tom Burke. the bill will weaken the system devised by the Labour Government at a time when there may be a serious need for the sort of control that a central bank should be able to exercise. I have before me a commentary upon the Banking Act 1945 written by J. S. G. Wilson, Eeader in Economics at the University of London, and edited by E. S. Sayers, the Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Economics at the University of London. The author, after having discussed the whole banking system of Australia, concluded with these wordsWithout the operation of credit control, the situation must have been much worse. Nevertheless, Australian experience has served to underline the limitation of credit policy in an open economy and must qualify considerably the faith placed in the 1945 legislation. That publication, which appeared only last year, was written as a text book on banking and economics. It points out the severe limitations of the 1945 Banking Act as a means of strengthening the Australian central bank. Yet this Government proposes to weaken the structure of that bank and to limit, instead of to increase, its power. to do so. party is willing to give the Government an early opportunity to apply to the people for a mandate at a general election. The Prime Minister has said that the Commonwealth Bank has used its powers properly. Therefore, the reason for the introduction of this bill is difficult to find. It seems to be clear that the private banks have applied to the Government for the enactment of a measure which will not strengthen the central bank, or increase the power of the private banks to advance money by way of overdraft, but which will enable the private banks to invest their money in interest-bearing securities in order to make greater profits. As the honourable member for Flinders ably pointed out, the banks use a cash base for their operations and, on that base, they expand their deposits virtually at will. They have only a rule of thumb method of placing a limit upon such expansion. Herein is one of the serious weaknesses of the Australian banking Therefore, system. In times of boom, the private",64,Nationalisatio N Pledge Liberal Swill Curb Exploiters
149,Mr Calwell,And it has no mandate,66,Nationalisatio N Pledge Liberal Swill Curb Exploiters
150,Mr Tom Bueke,"The Labourbanks allow tlieir cash ratio to fall. In other words, they hold less than is normal as a security against the deposits lodged with them. In times of depression or near-depression, however, they increase the ratio of cash to deposits because there is a greater likelihood of a call by depositors, and thereby, of course, they perform a function which produces an effect completely the reverse of that which they should try to produce. Obviously, in times of boom the banks ought to limit the overdrafts that they issue and the general investments that they undertake. Nevertheless, unless they are restrained, they pursue an opposite course of a'ction. .Similarly, it is in the public interest that, in time of depression or near-depression, of unemployed resources and of developing crises, the banks ought to expand their overdrafts and take risks with the cash that they have in their possession. The honourable member for Flinders also pointed out clearly that it is in the interests of the banks that they should do so because, if they call in overported in a legal judgment given by the drafts when economic conditions are tightening, they merely accentuate the slump that is developing and hasten the final collapse. But that is not the policy that the private banks pursue at such times, and they cannot pursue it unless the Commonwealth Bank, clothed with full power, stands behind them and they are willing to accept its advice and guidance. Unfortunately, the private banks have consistently resented the leadership and control of the Commonwealth Bank. The decision of the High Court in declaring invalid section 48 of the Banking Act caused the Labour Government at that time less concern about its powers in the event of a future crisis than did the knowledge that the private banks were unwilling to accept, the guidance of the central bank. Section 48 was included in the Banking Act upon the recommendation of the Commonwealth Bank Board of 1935-37. The suggestion was made by thp board in response to a questionnaire that was submitted to it by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. The board stated clearly that a central .bank could not function effectively unless it, had the broader base that the control of governmental accounts entailed and unless it could counteract the expansion and contraction which large payments in and out by State governments and local governing authorities could cause. Although that section was rejected by the High Court, the justices, particularly Mr Justice Owen Dixon, pointed out that the machinery that the section had been designed to establish was vital to central banking functions and was accepted in central banking law throughout the world. Mr Justice Owen Dixon commented that the written Constitution of Australia did not permit of the enforcement of a law which applied differently to government and local government authorities and to the general public. On these facts, it is clearly established that the procedure for which section 48 of the Banking Act provided is requisite for an efficient central banking system. It was advocated by a Commonwealth Bank board that was appointed by a non-Labour government. Its use was suppresent Ohief Justice of the High Court, who said that it was essential to the functions of a central bank. Yet it is resisted by the private .banks of Australia., notwithstanding the fact that the strength of the Commonwealth Bank, as a bank of last resort, is ultimately the only base upon which private banks can rest. They have opposed the Labour party's proposal consistently and have used all the legal aid that tbey have been able to hire in order to force its rejection. This has not been the only indication over the years that the private banks will not accept the judgment, leadership and control of the Commonwealth Bank, organized as a central bank. In these circumstances, it is essential that the Commonwealth Bank be extended, strengthened and given the powei' to force its will upon the private banks. However, this legislation will not strengthen the Commonwealth Bank. It has been designed definitely and deliberately to weaken the central bank structure. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed ont that the private banks wanted the Commonwealth Bank to release their special deposits so that they could use the funds to earn additional income instead of leaving them immobilized in the Commonwealth Bank, liquid though they were, to earn interest at a relatively low rate. The argument of the Leader of the Opposition has been abundantly proved by an item published in the financial columns of the Adelaide Advertiser this morning. That article points out that most of the total amount of £134,000,000 released from special accounts in the last year has been re-invested in treasury-bills and government securities. This fact indicates that the private banks did not require the cash for their ordinary shortthem the money that they have at their term operations and that the Government had no need to arrange for the money to be returned to them. The funds were re-invested almost exclusively in shortterm and long-term government securities. I assume, because even the private banks should have some wisdom, that the long term securities had only a short time to run. We see clearly, therefore, that the private banks have forced the Government, not to secure some safeguard against nationalization, because no safeguard is possible if the people decide to have it, bnt to provide them -with a means of increasing their profits by investing the funds in better interest-bearing securities. The Government's major argument was put forward by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). had learned from conversations with private bankers and the employees of private banks that this power was regarded as a sword over the heads of the private trading banks. Instead of a sword it has been an umbrella over the heads of private bankers for the purpose of protecting them in inclement weather. for them by a government bank and its return to them has been guaranteed. For every £100 that the banks place in the special deposits account they will recover £100, but if they had invested that money in Commonwealth bonds about twelve years ago they would not receive a £100 now for every £100 invested. They would only receive about £86. For those government bonds nearing maturity tbey would receive about £96. From that example it will be realized that this provision has been a real boon to the private banks. In the event of ilr. Tom Burke. depression the special deposits could he the means of enabling the private trading banks to keep their doors open. The argument that the special deposits have prevented the banks from increasing their overdrafts because their money has been immobilized is a fallacy. The Commonwealth Bank can only hold these special deposits temporarily because if depositors should demand a return of their deposits no bank or government could refuse to pay credit. The special deposits have acted as an effective form of guarantee that the banks will be able to have money to pay to the depositors when those depositors want it. During World WarI . , whilst a non-Labour government was in omce, the Commonwealth Bank offered to lend the private banks a considerable sum of money in order to allow them to increase overdrafts. The banks increased their overdrafts very substantially on the basis of that loan offer although they never took a penny of it. They did not need to take it'. They only required to know that if an emergency arose they could have access to that money. There are real weaknesses in the Australian banking system. The worse weakness is the unwillingness of He said that he the private banks to accept the advice or direction of the central bank. Mr Bryson mterjecting, Cameron) Order!

House adjourned at 10.58 p.m. The following answers to questions last, in the ordinary course of duty, to obtain were circulated:honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr conversations with, various trade union Calwell) asked a question concerning reofficials of his acquaintance. He has, however, distribution of seats in the Federal Parstated liament. The last part of the honourable election, any such allegation as suggested by member's question was as.follows:Has the Government decided to undertake a census, and if so, when is it to be conducted ? Further to my promise to find out for the honourable member the time of the taking of the next Commonwealth census I now advise that the Government has decided that the census will be taken in mid-1954. The exact date will be announced later. the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) asked the following question :Can the Prime Minister inform me whether it is a fact that on Tuesday last an officer; of the Commonwealth Investigation Service canvassed trade union officials at the Trades Hall, Sydney, with a view to securing the defeat of certain candidates for office in the Sew South Wales Trades and Labour Council elections which arc to be held on Thursday next? Is it also a fact that this officer falsely accused a candidate, who is a prominent member of the Australian Labour party, of being an undercover Communist and stated tliat the name of tlie candidate appears on a secret Commonwealth list? Was this officer acting under instructions and, if so, since when has it become the function of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to interest itself in the election of officers in the trade union movement? I informed thc honourable member that I would see that the question was conveyed to the Attorney-General, who administers the Commonwealth Investigation Service. I have received froin the Attorney-General the following reply:It is not, and as the honourable member knows has never been, the function of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to take any part whatever in thc election of officers of the trade union movement. No instructions to participate in such matters have been given to officers of the service. On the other hand, no attempt has been made to prevent officers from exercising in a personal capacity any private rights that membership of industrial organizations may give them. A trusted officer of the Commonwealth Investigation Service visited the Trades HaU on. the 17th February some documents. This officer, in his private capacity, has been for nearly 30 years a member of a -trade union, and has held high office in the trade union movement. He states that categorically that he did not make, against any candidate at the then ensuing the honourable member.",69,Papers
