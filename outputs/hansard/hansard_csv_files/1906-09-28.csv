Attention Of The Minister Of Trade And Cus","toms to the following statements published in the Trinity Times of Queensland, on the l 12th inst. :We publish below the f u l l text of a wages agreement made by a Mossman magnate with a new arrival in the country. The unfortunate Williams mentioned therein was led to believe that 12s. was the current rate of wages, and on arriving at Mossman and telling his fellowworkers and hearing what they received, he cleared out and made for Mount Molloy; but a wire having been sent, the Mount Molloy policeman met him and locked him up for two days and two nights until policemen from Mossman arrived on 30th ult., and took him back to be tried before a tribunal of Kanaka-loving J.'sP. Williams is only a recent arrival from the old country, and such conduct as that of "" Gus Hayes, Esq.,"" w ill not tend to encourage immigration. Williams bears an exemplary character, judging from his -testimonials. The following is the agreement under which Williams was arrested :Marsh's Agency, 19-20 TownH a l l , Brisbane. Memorandum of agreement made this 17th day of August, 1906, between Gus Hayes, Esq., Mossman, Port Douglas, of the one part, and William S. Williams of the other part. conditions are that the said W. S. Williams hereby agrees to serve the said G. Hayes, Esq., as general farm hand, and to make himself generally useful on the farm for the term of twelve months; to obey all reasonable commands of the said G. Hayes, his agent, or overseer; to be responsible for all nroncrtv entrusted to his charge; to be of respectful demeanour during the said period of twelve months. In the event of W. S.

Wages to begin from day of arrival at Mossman. In consideration of the above conditions being satisfactorily performed, the said Gus Hayes agrees to pay the said W. S.

Witness-W . H . BRITTEN. Does the Minister know whether Mr Gus. Hayes is registered for the receipt of sugar bounty ? If so, will he see that in future the bounty is not paid to Mr Hayes, supposing that the allegation is correct, and that the rate of wages in the district is more than 12s. a week. Will he further ascertain whether other bounty applicants in the district are paying, that rate of wages, and if so, will he take action accordingly ? not been brought under my notice, but it seems an extraordinary one. I shall institute inquiries in, regard to it at once. If the statements are true, and I have power to take action in the matter, I shall do so.

For instance, a letter-carrier, wishing to go away on the day's leave in every fortnight to which the regulations entitle him, has to find a boy who will relieve lowing telegram from Captain Strachan:him on his round, and casual labour so employed has sometimes to do a week's work for a day's pay.

In that message the Prime Minister of New Zealand stated that, until the Committee of the House of Representatives, to which the matter has been referred, reports, and the feeling of the House is indicated, he will not be competent to express an opinion as* to the probable fate of the agreement. I have kept myself in touch, as far as possible, with the criticisms of the public men and newspapers of New Zealand, and regret to saythat, on the whole, they are quite unfavorable. CASE OF CAPTAIN STRACHAN. ProvidedI take witnesses to Papua, prove my case, will Government compensate for injury done and loss sustained? I wish, therefore, to know from the Prime Minister whether, if Captain Strachan and others who have been aggrieved by the cases before the Commission which has been despatched to the Territory, and that body finds that wrong has been done to them, money compensation will be paid? What responsibilities have the Commonwealth Government in the matter? to, it would be our duty to forward the evidence and the finding of the Commission to the British Government to consider what steps, if any, it would take in regard to the actions of those who were at the time We are endeavouring to get rid of its officials. the Minister of Trade and Cusoms whether, on the revision of the bountv system, he will, if proper data is placed before him, provide for a bounty on the export of poultry ? the honourable member to place the matter before me more definitely.

Home Affairs made arrangements for ai lowing the people in Bass Strait to vote at the coming election? day before yesterday, which will enable them to record their votes. MR. G. F . GARDINER . nesday the honourable member for Fremantle asked the following questions : i . For what reason was Mr G. F. Gardiner retired from the Public Service in Western Australia, while junior officers gazetted as "" excess "" a Bill will probably be submitted on the subject in the classification are still retained? 2. Who recommended his retirement? 3. Did he appeal against compulsory retirement within the time allowed for such appeal; In view of the if so, why was no reply made to his appeal ? 4. Why has he not been granted retiring allowance in accordance with the regulations under which he joined the service? 5. Has he been offered similar employment at a lower salary since his retirement; if so, what is the proposed salary as compared with that previously paid? The Public Service Commissioner has If the honourable memforwarded the following information:1. Mr Gardiner was an Instrument Fitter at Albany, and was retired under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act as an excess officer. The junior officers referred to are being usefully and profitably employed, and are engaged on a different class of work to what Mr Gardiner was. It would be unfair to dispense with the services of one of these in order to make room for Mr Gardiner, who has not nearly earned his salary for some considerable time past. 2. The Public Service Commissioner, acting on the reports of the Public Service Inspector It related to the suggested and the recommendation of the Department. 3. No appeal was lodged within the terms of the Act and regulations. 4. The question whether a retiring allowance I have since received a letter is payable is one lo be determined by the Commonwealth and the Western Australian Government, but no steps in this direction have yet been taken, as it is possible a permanent position may be found for him. 5. He has been offered temporary work since his retirement, with the view that before the expiration of it a permanent position may become vacant, to which he can be appointed. He will receive ^162 per annum in a temporary position. His previous salary was ^200 per annum. the Prime Minister, ufon notice1. When does he propose to take over the light-houses and light-keepers from the State control? 2.

This matter will receive consideration during the recess, but no determination has as yet been arrived at. 2.

CASE OF GUNNER WHITE . presenting the Minister of Defence, upon tralian project, it would be very cheerfully notice1. Is it a fact that on 14th October, 1905, Gunner White, of the Victorian Commonwealth Naval Forces, caused certain articles to be removed and taken on board HMAS. Protector from private property belonging to a citizen of the Commonwealth in Carnarvon (late Port Arthur), Tasmania, and that all the said property was not returned as promised; if so, why is this officer, Gunner White, still retained? 2. Is it a fact that, through the incident mentioned, Mr W. S. Patchett, late Sick Berth Attendant for eight years (with China Medal), was discharged from the service "" for a grave offence against discipline"" without first having that charge laid against him, or even having been tried according to Naval Regulations for having committed' a grave offence. If so, what is the intention of the Minister for Defence with regard to this matter? 3. If fresh evidence is produced, will the Minister have an inquiry on oath? 1. The officer named obtained permission to bring off certain articles from a ruined building for use at the Naval Dep6t, Williamstown, believing them to be public property. They were returned the same day when found to be private property. 2. No. Patchett was discharged by the Naval Commandant under Regulation 61, for bringing charges against a superior officer, and for refusing to withdraw them when an independent Board of Inquiry had found them to be not sustained. 3. An impartial Board of Inquiry heard both sides and gave its decision. To enable Patchett to bring further evidence, the Board was reassembled. Its decision was unaltered. The Naval Board was of opinion that Mr Patchett had been treated with extraordinary consideration. If Mr Patchett can produce any further evidence which, in the opinion of the Minister, has any bearing on the cause of his discharge, due consideration will be given to his request. the Prime Minister, upon noticeWhether, during the coming parliamentary recess, the Government will lake steps (if necessary, with theconsent and co-operation of the States of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales) to get the best expert and engineering advice as to Jocking, or using for navigation and irrigation to the fullest extent, the Murray, non-contract vessels, Darling, and Murrumbidgee Rivers? have been made within the last year or two Poundage by the States named, and an agreement has been arrived at between their Premiers, The in connection with which a measure is being drafted for submission to their respective Parliaments.

It has been used in New South Wales, as well as in Victoria. 3. It was not necessary, as the receiving instruments employed are those in ordinary use.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -On Wednesday last the honourable member for North Sydney asked these questions: 1. The number of Customs officers engaged in gauging casks of imported liquor, and in testing strength thereof, and the salaries of such officers(a) at the port of Sydney; (b) at the port of Melbourne. 2. The number of casks gauged during the six months ending 31st August, 1906(a) at the port of Sydney; (b) at the port of Melbourne. The following are the replies: 1. (a) Gauging, four officers' salaries, £750; testing, four officers' salaries, £695. (b) Gauging, two officers' salaries, £595; testing, two officers' salaries, £$20. 2. (a) 12,245 casks; (*) about 8,200 casks. ference to answer No. 2, furnished on the 26th instant, the Deputy Postmaster General, Brisbane, has furnished the following information:Time worked by all day telegraphists in Brisbane for four weeks ended 22nd September, averages 43 hours 44 minutes per week, or 87 hours 28 minutes per fortnight. One half of day staff allowed off at 1 p.m. Saturday, other half working until they can be spared off, which is usually before 2 p.m., but there are occasions when necessary to keep them on. It will thus be seen that the hours worked are stated to be less than the number laid down by the Public Service Commissioner.

51,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"to pass it. We only make ourselves ridiculous when we enact laws which are subsequently laughed at outside of this House. Nothing can tend to bring out Statutes into greater contempt than the practice of passing them in such a form as to render their provisions absolutely futile. this measure is intended for use, and is not merely designed to satisfy some outside demand for legislation of this character. I am heart and soul with the object of the measure, but I desire to know from the Postmaster-General whether it will be used to the f u l l extent of its possibilities in Personally, I think that the Minister -has already quite enough power to deal with these abuses. While he may not have the power to cut off telephones before securing a conviction, he will recollect that all the telephonic contracts entered into are for six months only. A t the end of that period every such contract is open to revision, and the Postmaster-General may decline to renew it. Consequently, in the absence of this legislation, he could exercise a great deal of power in the direction indicated. I am not quilte sure that, it is necessary to pass this Bill to clothe him with the power that he seeks, and to prevent the Commonwealth Government from providing facilities for the carrying on of unlawful and improper proceedings. In my judgment, the Minister has every power to absolutely control the telephone now, and, therefore, I do not see that any grave necessity exists for a further grant of authority in the direction outlined. harm in giving him additional power, if there be any doubt about it? desire merely to know whether the power is intended to be used.

I have already issued those the direction indicated. instructions in certain cases. But I wish to go further than that. I desire to be able to put an immediate stop to the use of the telephone by persons who are engaged in unlawful practices. I do not wish, to wait until their agreements expire. Otherwise when notice is given of the non-renewal of those agreements the telephones will be transferred to somebody else, and will continue to be used for the same purpose to which they are now being put.

58,Mr Mccay (Corinella) [11.8],"A twere raised by the Prime Minister in his speech last evening anything approaching adequate attention, or to speak with anything like the fullness which the importance of the subject demands. I take it that the Prime Minister's statement was an enunciation of the intended policy of the Government, and had no immediate relation to the Estimates under consideration, Consequently I shall confine my remarks to a very few minutes, reserving to myself the right to deal with the matter after fuller consideration either here or elsewhere. In this connection I would suggest to the Prime Minister that for some years past the great and important problem of defence and the way Australia is to be developed, has been dealt with in a somewhat cavalier way. The practice has been to have a general debate upon the first item on the Estimates of the Defence Department. The time at which these Estimates are considered every year varies.

I propose to state my position by reading one or two extracts from a minute which I wrote on the 10th Mav of last year, after the inauguration of the Council of Defence, and when the general problem of the Australian defence policy was first submitted to' it. I take this step in order to make quite clear what my view was then, in which a defence policy for and is now, and to show, if I may venture to say so, that although the details may not be exactly the same as others that have been considered, the Government proposals contain nothing that has not been previously foreseen as the possible development of an Australian policy. by all parties for years past; there are no proprietary rights in it. times charged with being hostile to certain lines of thought. Mv views are expressed in this, minute in half-a-dozen lines. Given .in insufficient supply of money to carry out all the objects required, the order in which they should be carried out is this :1.

I should strongly deprecate any scheme which involved leaving either branch of our defence system in an incomplete condition. To intermit our efforts in one direction before we had a substitute ready in another would mean an interregnum, during which we should have two bad legs. instead of one to stand upon. One of the remarks made last night by the Prime Minister has caused me a good deal of apprehension in this regard. learned gentleman said that there must be an adjustment between the sums which the Committee, after f u l l deliberation, -will set aside for the purpose of national defence, and those which, it is proposed we shall devote to this purpose. That is to say, he proposed, in effect, that a maximum amount should be fixed for defence purposes, and that we should then consider what proportion should be devoted to the military branch, and how much should be spent on the naval side. That1 proposal, stated as a general proposition, is one that cannot be disputed; but, if carried into practical effect it may result in neither specific proposals by the Government, howthe military nor the naval defences being in a satisfactory condition. might have devoted to it a sum sufficient to enable it to be complete. The suggestion was made last night that a sum of ^-250,000 a year should be transferred from the military to the naval vote. made by the Prime Minister. thumb process of that kind might result did not fully understand was made by the in unmitigated disaster to the soundness Prime Minister.

It is argued^that there are a lot of privates, and that if we take a little off the allowance to each we shall make a big saving. I shall hesitate a long while before concurring in any such proposal. The partially-paid forces in Australia, whether military or naval, certainly do not receive remuneration beyond the services they render. If we regard the matter as a purely business proposition, they are underpaid. As at present advised, The honourable and I should certainly oppose any reduction in the pay of the privates, although for a number of years we have continually taken action in that direction. If this proposal simply means that our military expenditure is to be reduced below the point of efficiency-and I venture to say that the taking of ^200,000 or ^250,000 from the military vote would have that effect-the n we shall enter upon a course fraught with danger, and extremely undesirable. It will mean that we shall have two inefficient means of defence instead of one, which, as faras its efforts can extend, is sufficient. In the absence of any ever, it is difficult to deal with this matter. Neither We must wait until we have the detailed proposals before us.

I have said once before, and -I repeat the statement, that I should like to see an addition to the three traditional R's of our State school curriculum, so that it would embrace reading, ""writing, arithmetic, and rifles. That is a summary way of describing a proposal that, in connection with our schools, instruction should be given in physical drill, in the handling of arms, and in the elementary principles of discipline. is essential. vernment every credit for the extension of the cadet system in which they are now engaged, I would point out that it still has the great defect of being not universal, but selective. WhilstI recognise the alluring value of uniforms to the young mind, it seems to me that universal cadet training does not depend for its success upon uniforms. It should be as much a matter of course for the boy at school to attend to the training allotted to cadets as to devote himself to any other part of the school curriculum. average boy is such that I think he would find the cadet work more interesting than a good many of the other subjects to which his attention is compulsorily directed during school hours. It is impossible at this stage to deal in any reasonable way with the question of the central administration, and the Government policy in connection with our military and naval forces. I am satisfied now, as I was when the system first came into operation, that the principle, of the Council of Defence is a proper one for Australia to adopt, and I understand that I he Ministry does not falter in its adherence to this view. Mr E-WING -No. however, has given the system but a slight chance of succeeding. regard to the Administration, to the individuals composing the Council, and the way in which it has been carried on for the last nine or ten months we must recognise that no system, however good, could, in such circumstances, be successful. Under that system provision is made for a Council of Defence with a. secretary. The secretary of the Council has been in England for manv months. The Board of Administration-and I am sneaking of the military side, because I take that as a tvpe-consists of four members with a secretary, and is assisted in its administration by various directors, who are experts in their particular line. Of the four members of the Administrative Board, one has been in England for many months-and very wisely too. But it is curious that no arrangement has been made for a qualified officer to carry on his work while he is away. It has been conducted anyhow. Of the directors one very valuable officer is also in London, his appointment there being what I may call a temporary permanency. I speak That, it seems to me, of the Director of Stores. Then the system While I give the Gorequired, and still requires, an Inspector General, quite apart from the board; otherwise the whole principle of the system is broken into and contradicted. Yet we now have an acting Inspector-General, who remains a member of the board, and we have proposals made in the Estimates for the appointment of a comparatively junior officer as successor to the Deputy AdjutantGeneral. I do not know who is to succeed the Deputy Adjutant-General on the board, and I do not want to know at present, because I prefer to discuss the matter quite In fact, the spirit of the apart from any individual. is there, but the parts are absent. there, but one after another the parts have been taken away. No wonder the public express surprise that the machine is not working properly. I say also without hesitation that the Minister has been Board, Inspector-General, and everything else, upon various occasions-that he has' been the whole machine, and has arrogated to himself that right. Under such circumstances no system could be a success, and the Ministry which professes its continued belief in this system might at least so carry on the administration as to give it a chance. ister arrogate to himself the powers of the When we have board ? the whole day in discussing the matter.

93,O Mr Mccay,"That is just why I sayof administration by a board has been attacked on the ground that it cannot succeed -that you must have one central mind dominating everything. Perhaps that was the Minister's idea on various occasions. The experience of history and of other nations is in absolute contradiction to such a view. I need mention only one striking instance of the success of the Committee system as contrasted with individual control, and that is afforded by the Japanese army. That army was developed, and went through the Russo-Japanese war, under the council and board system, as contrasted with the Commander-in-Chief system. Practically every nation in the world adopts the same method in connection with its military administration, and that portion of the defensive and offensive equipment of the United Kingdom which has excited the least criticism, namely, the Navy, has been carried on under a similar system for hundreds of years. The fact that the Commander-in-Chief system of control requires that one man shall do indefinitely more than any individual can possibly do-if only because of physical and time limitationsrenders it impossible, and I am glad to know that the Government have no idea of reverting to it . But, unless the necessary qualifications for each position are fully recognised, and men are chosen who possess those qualifications, this or any other sysdone work of the utmost importance to the tem will prove a failure. I must confess that I am not satisfied that the Government, while recognising the correctness of the principle I have described, have always found it convenient to put it into practice. However, I do not wish to dwell upon that point at present, because it is of not much use, in view of the fact that the electors will soon have an opportunity to express their opinions upon all these questions. I would only again express the hope that we -that is, those of us who have the privilege of being in the next Parliamentshall have an opportunity to discuss these matters systematically, and that ample time will be afforded. I do not blame the present Government any more than any other for the fact that in the past we have been called upon to discuss these matters hurriedly at the fag end of a tiring session. I wish to know whether the Government intend to keep the Inspector-General and his duties apart from the Administrative Board? Paragraphs, which have all the appearance of being inspired, have been published in the newspapers, to the effect that the In spector-General is to retain his seat on the Board, and that a junior officer is to be appointed as Assistant Adjutant-General, whilst the position of Deputy AdjutantGeneral is to be abolished. The curious statement has been made that the position of Deputy Adjutant-General is to be abolished because that title is not in harmony with our Australian conditions. Why the title of the Assistant Adjutant-General should be harmonious and that of the Deputy Adjutant-General inharmonious is, to me, perfectly incomprehensible. Then it has been suggested that the Inspector General is to be invested with greater executive power than at .present. I can hardly credit that this is being done upon the advice of the Acting Inspector-General, because he has always taken the view that the duties of the office should be those of an inspector. dent of the.Executive Council) [11.44] I cannot definitely reply to the question of the honourable and learned member as to whether the Inspector-General is to have a seat on the Administrative Board. The matter will be decided at the end of the year, when the term of the present Inspector General expires. Brigadier-Generai Finn maintained-and I presume that there is no secret with regard to it-that , after he had Commonwealth, his reports were set aside by a Board holding different views. you will have to revert to the system of the control by the General Officer Commanding. General Finn's view. At present the Board is placed in a position of control, and the question is whether the Inspector-General should overrule the Board, or vice versa. Common sense suggests that every man should give the best that is in him to the community. When the Government have perfected their arrangements, I am sure that harmony will prevail between the Board and the Inspector-General. The Minister informs me that he is fully conversant with both sides of the question, but that at present he cannot inform the House exactly what the position of the Inspector General will be. The question of the Assistant Adjutant-General will be settled at the same time. vernment do not want to tell us anything.",23,Department Of Defence

97,Mr Mccay,"In other words, the Goand learned member ail I know. wish to direct attention to certain matters which I am sure must be regarded as of the most serious importance. Shortly after the new system of defence was inaugurated by the late Minister, a. proposal involving great changes in the naval policy of the Commonwealth was referred to the Council of Defence. The Naval Director embodied his views in a paper in regard to which strong differences of opinion arose in the Council of Defence-the body responsible under the Act for any changes in defence policy. The Cabinet then decided to refer the whole question to a higher authoritythe Imperial Defence Committee. Naval Director was sent to England to inquire into and study the different processes of naval construction, whilst the Chief Intelligence Officer of the Commonwealth was also sent home to give to the Imperial Defence Committee all the local information that they might require in order to enable them to furnish their report in the full light Council tell me whether they have been reof local conditions. fence Committee practicallv embodies the wisdom of every branch of the Imperial Service. When a naval question arises they refer to the Admiralty; when an engineering question has to be dealt with they seek information from the officers commanding the engineer services : when artillery questions are on the tapis the chief artillery experts are called upon for their advice, and so on. The function of the Imperial Defence Committee is to coordinate the advices received. The Committee has now furnished a report which offers as sweeping a condemnation of the Naval Director as could possibly be conceived. They say that his report has been drawn up without a proper appreciation of naval development. Yet the Commonwealth Government no sooner received the report than they handed it over to the Naval Director, and empowered him, to criticise it. The Naval Director has availed himself of that power. I ask how they can possiblv justify their action? It is not usual to allow an appeal from the High Court of Australia to a bench of stipendiary magistrates, and I challenge Ministers to show me a single instance in which the action of a higher authority has been submitted for review to an individual who has been condemned by it. In view of the attitude which I have taken in regard to this matter, I wish to make it plain that, while the information which I , as a layman, have been able to collect, leads me to endorse the views expressed by the Imperial Defence Committee in reference to the merits of the report of the local Naval Director, I think that he may give manv years of good service to the Commonwealth in some capacity or another. My point is that he should not have been selected to criticise that report, seeing, especially, that it so seriously criticised him. I seriously complain, too, of the action of the Ministry in submitting the purely military side of the defence problem, as presented in the report, to a committee of local officers, in the absence of our Chief Intelligence Officer. The officer who is The responsible under our system for the recommendation of changes was sent to England to place at the disposal of the Imperial Defence Committee all information of a local character which it might need, and I believe took with him plans of our fortifications, and other documents of the kind. Can the Vice-President of the Executive The Imperial Deturned? ligence Officer in Australia he could explain to the local authorities the evidence which the Imperial Defence Committee had before it in framing this report; and, indeed, I should not be surprised to learn that the officers of OUT forces protested against the instruction to criticise a report of whose groundwork they had no knowledge. Their verdict bears out a supposition of the kind. Mv point is that it was an almost indecent thing to submit the report of the supreme Imperial authority on defence, the preparation of which has taken months of anxious thought and care, including the consideration of the evidence of our Chief Intelligence Officer, to a few officers hurriedly called together in Melbourne to furnish a criticism within a few days, and without knowing the facts upon which it had been based. vernment will not come to any final decision until Captain Bridges has returned. valuable officer, and his views will be considered. matter.

Why did they sit independently, when considering a co-ordinated report, in which the views of the Admiralty and of the War Office are reconciled, if reconciliation was necessary ? Why was it considered necessary to dissect, and to make inharmonious, that report, by referring, it in sections to independent naval and military Committees?

Some people are of opinion that Australia should not establish a navy of her own, but that it should be left to the Imperial Navy to protect our shores.

We believe that we are properly interpreting their views when we say that there should be some sort of Australian floating defence. people are in agreement with us, and consequently we have abandoned the naval portion of the recommendations of the Imperial Defence Committee. Accordingly, the Minister consulted his best officers, and asked them to advise us in regard to. the matter. They have done so, and we have now placed their recommendations and the proposed action of this Government before Parliament. do think that honourable members have just cause for complaint against the practice of submitting the Estimates for consideration at such a late stage of the session. They are generally discussed at the eleventh hour, when it is quite impossible to criticise them thoroughly with a view to improving existing conditions. Ever since the Federation was established new schemes have been submitted each year in respect of Australian defence. At no time, however, have we been afforded an opportunity of exhaustively discussing those schemes. I listened with interest to the proposals of the Government, which were outlined in the speech delivered by the Prime Minister last evening. The question of whether we are. going to adopt an elaborate system of coastal defence or to extend our land forces, is an interesting one, and the Minister must admit that since Federation the defence systen, considered as a whole, has not been conducted upon satisfactory lines. While successive Administrations haw been thinking out new schemes, no attempt has been made to deal equitably with the existing system, either from the point of view of the men in the forces, or those of the taxpayer. I have had occasion from time to time to put questions in regard to the administration of the Departpartment, and must say that, in response to these, I have either received evasive replies, or a series of contradictory statements. One can obtain anything but the absolute bald truth in regard to any matter affecting the Department. I propose now to refer to the item relating to the granting of prizes for shooting competitions. Certain associations regulate the distribution of the Government grant/, and from time to time recommend where the competitions shall take place. The Northern Rifle Association of New South Wales receives an annual grant of ^250, and since Federation has been holding its annual competitions at Singleton. The whole of the forces in the northern district, if they wish to take part in these matches, have, therefore, to journey to a town 60 miles north of Newcastle. The number of militiamen and volunteers in the Maitland and Newcastle district is six times greater than is that in the Singleton district, so that under the existing system 800 or 900 men are put to the inconvenience of journeying to Singleton, where there is a force of only about 146. to take part in these competitions. This practice is continued, notwithstanding that in 1904 the officer commanding the forces in New South Wales recommended that for the following reasons the annual rifle matches should take place at Newcastle :There is no rifle range at Singleton, except that at Whittingham, on the property of Messrs. R. and D. Faulkner, which has not been under military supervision since 1901. This range is' about three miles from Singleton. It was said before this that the competitions were held by the association at Singleton for the reason that the most up-todate range in New South Wales was to be found there. Newcastle is a much larger military centre and easier of access to a large number of riflemen ; consequently the number of local competitors will probably be greater, more especially in view of the fact that, owing lo local difficulties chiefly, the units at Singleton have been unable to fire for two years. Better range facilities, especially as regards service matches, and easier access to the range itself. Singleton was chosen in iSqo as being the only place in the north with a suitable range. This situation is now reversed [vide Cop3' of correspondence attached, marked "" A . "" ) . (e) The range used at Singleton costs £20rent-for the meeting, paid to Messrs. Faulkner and Doyle. This is a large item of expenditure that would be saved.

148,Mr Ewing,"Fo r what reason?to know. In view of the opinion expressed by the State Commandant of New South Wales, why should the Department insist upon a large body of men having to travel from Maitland and Newcastle to Singleton to engage in matches on a rifle range 3 miles out of the town, and thus to lose practically three days' work, whereas if the matches were conducted in Maitland or Newcastle they would lose only one day? sent system appears ridiculous. excuse offered by the association, that Singleton possessed the best range in New South Wales, is shown by the report of the State Commandant, which I have read, and the fact that the Committee were recently asked to agree to a large vote for the erection of a new range there. I shall never object to anv legitimate expenditure, and whilst I think that the 146 men at Singleton should have the same facilities to acquire proficiency as marksmen as have any similar number of men in the other districts, I urge that we should pause before sanctioning the expenditure of an enormous sum on a rifle range in that town. A range capable of meeting local requirements should, be sufficient. My experience in these matters is doubtless that of many other honourable members. There is another question to which I desire to refer. "" The regulations provide that men who form guards of honour shall be paid for any loss of time so incurred. I have in my possession a copy of an order to the. effect, but after some men in my district had turned out to form a guard of honour, they were told that they would receive no pay. We cannot expect men to take an interest in the militia or volunteer movement if we treat them in this way. There seems to be a want of business capacity on the part of the military authorities. In New South Wales tenders are called for the supply of rations, at so much per head, to the men in the Permanent Forces, and the same rate is allowed whether the caterer has to supply a large or a small body of men. Every one knows that when a man has to cater for a large body of men, he can afford to provide a more liberal fare than he can give when he has to provide at the same rate for only halfa-dozen. As a matter of fact, however, this point is not recognised by the Department. I hope the Minister will see that men serving on small stations receive the same rations and pay as are secured by others more favourably situated. I have, from time to time, brought before the Department my complaint in regard to the holding of rifle competitions of the Northern Association at Singleton, ancl if there be any attempt to hold the next matches there, I shall demand a full inquiry. [X2.35] I regard these proceedings as positively farcical. We have had experience of three systems of defence within the short space of six years, and we are told by Ministers that nothing is to be done immediately to bring about any reform. I shall follow the proceedings of the Government with the greatest possible interest, because the subject of our defences is of paramount importance. If our defence arrangements are defective we must be in a perilous position. I am somewhat sceptical as to the wisdom of following up a separate Australian naval policy. If I could see any chance of securing efficiency, consistently with economy. I should be perfectly prepared' to establish an, Australian Navy. But as matters stand, there is no prospect before us but utter confusion,. schemes are brought forward. Minister last night eloquently described the last proposed scheme, and concluded by telling us that nothing was to be done by this Parliament in regard to the more important of the propositions, namely, that relating to naval defence. It is necessary that we should consider matters connected with our naval and military defences concurrently. Our land defences would be absolutely ineffective against any raiding force unless the sea were protected. The Prime Minister -told us that a distinct movement forward was to be made in the direction of developing a purely Australian means of defence, and that the greatest! possible deference would be paid to the opinions of our Australian naval authorities, and particularly to those of Captain Creswell. there is no other naval authority to whom 1 the Government look in matters of purely Australian concern.

Where are these lines and delimitations? It is Captain Creswell who In draws arbitrary lines which are supposed to circumscribe the sphere of Imperial defence. The Imperial Defence Committee denounce any such notion as fallacious and dangerous. The Defence Committee make it clear that there is no such delimitation, and ought not to be any-that the Imperial Navy ought to be free to go into every nook and corner of the Empire, and I do not understand Captain Creswell when he speaks of a fleet operating within purely local lines. The Vice-President of the Executive Council indicated that the I m that the Navy is not intended to do anything of the kind.

When he speaks of defending certain places by means of a mosquito fleet, he is following Captain Creswell in assuming that there is a line within which its defence operations would be valuable; in other words, he is manufacturing for his own purposes a definition of naval strategy and Australian defence. It is the easiest thing in the world, having laid down one's own premises, to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, and it seems to me that that is where our experts are going wrong. and repulse the enemy if he would attack according to our directions. can the honourable member for Bland, or Captain Creswell, or any one else, know whence a raiding expedition will come? The success of naval operations depends largely upon the element of surprise, an enemy turning up where least expected. torpedo boats caused the Dogger Bank incident, which shows the importance as an offensive weapon attached by belligerents to such vessels. organized as that of Russia. fensive force is efficient, the enemy, who will know pretty well what the .conditions are, will laugh at it,and, having found our weak spot, will attack it. understood fhe assumption that it is possible to have an efficient local defence except within lines within which the Imperial Navy cannot operate. It is not laid down in the Imperial Defence Committee's report that there are such lines. The recommendation is that the fleet shall be kept mobile, to go wherever there is a foe to meet or interests to protect. The report regards Captain Creswell's assumption as entirely wrong, and criticises him as very few colonial officers have been criticised. It is quite clear, having regard to the delicacy and consideration which it was thought desirable to extend to a colonial proposal, that the Committee had a very distinct opinion on this subject. I understand that since the issue of his report Captain Creswell has modified his views very considerably, or has re-stated them in a form more in accord with the principles of defence laid down by the Committee, showing that the broad features of its criticism were absolutely just[196] for Bland, in speaking of the desirability ofhaving a mosquito fleet, said that such a fleet is thought necessary for the defence of Great Britain; but are the conditions the same? Great Britain is in proximity to European countries, which may at any time be her enemies. The great European Powers are nearer to each other than are many parts of Australia. That is why the coast of France swarms with all kinds of 1 operative destructive forces, lying ready to dash out at any moment to attack the English defences. weapon of the minor Powers. necessary to Great Britain, because of her nearness to possible enemies. buving torpedo vessels. they are near to one another. But there is no foreign country within 20 miles of Melbourne, possessing a fleet bristling with menace and warlike possibilities, readv to attack us at a moment's notice. The position of Great Britain is not analogous to that of Australia, and therefore we cannot slavishly adopt a system -which is thought to be valuable there. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. Committee points out that the protection of the Australian floating trade, whether I cannot on the high seas or in local waters, demands for its effective accomplishment the closely concerted action of powerful sea-going ships.

In other words, they affirm that even if we could successfully organize an Australian Navyi t would not be worthwhile to do so, since it would be immensely more costly for us to operate it than it would be for the Imperial Government to operate the whole of the forces of the Imperial Navy for us. I also point out that these proposals to provide mosquito fleets for purely coastal defence will be of little value, since the most powerful ocean-going fighting ships are necessary in local waters as well as upon the high seas. Apart from all these considerations, what I want from the Government is a definite proposal. During the past six years no less than three defence schemes have been originated, or an average of one for every two years. How it is proposed to formulate a defence scheme, and to test it within two years, passes the comprehension of any mortal. In our six years' experience as a 'Commonwealth we have already entered upon three schemes of defence. those schemes? them has been given a fair trial, and certainly the scheme which was last organized has not been worked out.

221,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honorableof the Prime Minister. ling the small amount of real pabulum from the wonderful speech which he delivered last night, I find that he makes no definite proposals whatever. President of the Executive Council has told us that nothing is to be done in respect of the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister until after Parliament has been consulted. operations. of naval operations. of defence can only be secured by the concurrent development of both arms of our Defence. are being developed in the minds of those who are best able to formulate them, we should endeavour to get the best results that we can from our present system. That seems to me a practical way of dealing with this question. to bring under the notice of 'the' ""Committee two cases which indicate that the administration of the Department of Defence is somewhat at fault. The honourable member for Newcastle this morning protested against certain procedure on the part of the militarv authorities, and I wish to enter my protest against the attitude taken up by them in respect to other matters. In connection with the retrenchment of certain officers, a very mean and shabby practice has been adopted. A member of the Defence Force in Brisbane, on 30th June, 1902, received from the Department a letter containing the following statement:Instructions have been received from the General Officer 'Commanding that the regulations respecting retirement for age will not take effect until ist September, 1902. In the meantime you are granted leave of absence from ist July inclusive until further orders. This was a clear, explicit statement that the services of the man in question were to be discontinued at the expiration of his two months' leave of absence, which was to commence on the day following that on which he received this communication. The leave of absence was granted him, and during that time he received his ordinary pay. was dulv retrenched in September, but out of certain gratuities payable to him in respect of his length of service, the Department actually deducted the pay which he had received during his leave of absence. That, to my mind, was a mean and shabby After disentangthing to do, and the man very naturally objects to the treatment meted out to him. When I brought the matter under the notice of the Department, the only excuse offered To-day the Vicewas the paltry one that all those who had been retrenched had been treated in a similar way. Such a system is most unfair. I now desire to bring under the notice of the Minister the case of a man in the Department, who, whilst on service, met with an accident, which resulted in his losing two or three fingers. An inquiry was held, I am speaking and a recommendation was made that he A complete system should be granted £ 3 0 by way of compensation for the injury he had received. Subsequently it |was recommended that he Therefore, while these schemes should receive £ 8 0 . He was then asked to send in a claim, and in the end he received a letter to the effect that it was not considered that the loss of two or three fingers was a disablement. The unfortunate man has received nothing by way of compensation for his injuries, but I trust that the Minister will give both these cases his favorable consideration. I certainly do not think that these men have been fairly treated. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [2.40] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister a procedure on the part of the Department which I certainly cannot understand. We had in Tasmania a little cadet corps, which had accumulated 125380, contributions having been made to the fund by the bovs themselves. When the cadet corps were taken over by the Commonwealth, the Department decided that this sum should be paid into the Consolidated Revenue, and it made the paltry grant of £ 3 0 , or £ 1 0 each, to three cadet corps in the State. It is felt in Tasmania that this money was practicallv the property of the cadet corps, and should not have been paid into the general revenue. I am certain that the Minister never contemplated that anything of the kind should be done.. If the money were handed over to the cadets, it could be utilized for the purchase of uniforms. We have several flourishing cadet corps in Tasmania; the boys are taking a great interest in the movement, and it also receives great attention at the hands of the head He teachers of the schools, who act as officers. I would also point out that no provision has been made for instructional classes for cadets. been materially increased.",34,Forrest Wa S The Scheme

The Australian Field Artillery are a branch of our Forces which must have the utmost possible training to render them efficient. Only a small number of days are available for drill of all kinds, and only five or six days per annum are devoted to firing practice. At about the date that this exhibition (was arranged, (the field artillery were to have been called out for two days' firing practice, but instead of that they were required to drill at full pay at what was, in some respects, a partisan exhibition. at all. had two days' practice for show purposes. the Australian Natives Association.

The Minister was guilty of something approaching tampering with the true and proper administration of his Department. clays ago I asked for the production of .the papers relating to this case, but could not obtain them; so that if there be any trifling inaccuracy in the facts as I have stated them, the fault is not mine. Apparently, it is difficult to obtain any information from the head-quarters office. dent of the Executive Council) [2.53] The honourable member takes it for granted that his charges are well grounded, and then makes use of a number of acrimonious adjectives.

I was told that there were nopapers here. A wire was sent to Sydney, and it was ascertained that the matter had. been dealt with by the District Commandant, and that no papers were available. The honourable member, charges the Government with having extended to a partisan exhibition certain patronage and support which, probably, would not have been given in another case.

In view of the fact that the Government indicate that next year they must make some substantial reduction on the military side, in order to provide for the expansion of our floating -defences, this is surely an inopportune time to increase the Military Estimates by from £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . With a proper reorganization, we could materially reduce the Military Estimates, and some reconstruction is absolutely essential if we are going lo do anything in the matter of coastal defence. I desire to bring about a reduction of £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; but perhaps it would be more convenient if I moved for a reduction of £ 1 , on the understanding that, if that be agreed to, the Committee will thereby -express their desire that the larger reduction shall be made. penditure on rifle clubs? pansion of the expenditure upon rifle clubs and cadet forces.

The least that might be expected was that the Government, would keep within the total expenditure agreed upon some time ago. It ""is for Ministers to decide how the necessary reduction shall be made. An Honorable MEMBER ^honourable member does not wish to interfere with the vote for the cadet forces? possible to interfere with that, but my deliberate opinion is that the cadet forces were better looked after by the Sfates Governments than they are now. I think that the cadets might very well have been allowed to remain under the control of the States until we had more money to spend, and certainly until after we had made provision for coastal defences of some character. We cannot, however, go back upon the arrangement that we have made with tlie States, and therefore I do not suggest that the expenditure upon the cadet forces should be interfered with. The appropriation for the Australian Light Horse-on e of .the most expensive arms of the servicesive.

I am convinced that our light horse is out of proportion to the other branches of the service. of light horse corps are received every day. assured me that the light horse already provided for is disproportionate to the other branches of the service, and could be reduced without injuring its effectiveness. It is not a question as to the value of one branch or another, but of spending the money of the country to the best advantage. The Government might well reduce expenditure in regard to some branches of the service, while giving encouragement at the present rate to rifle clubs, and even to cadets. I think that a mistake has been made in regard to the cadet force, but I admit that we cannot reverse our policy now.

The Government say that they will consider economies next session, and intend to save on the military side ; but when they come to work out the details, they will find that that is not so easy. Our only defence at present is our land defence, and it will be time enough to talk of dispensing with our land forces when we ifoave that navy which some honourable members think will do such wonders. Until we have some other form of defence, it will be madness not to maintain an efficient land force, unless we are ready to frankly admit that we depend, not on our service, but on the might of the Empire. do that. is proposed without a word of warrant for it bevond the fact that some years ago an amount was decided upon by Parliament as sufficient for our military expenditure.",38,Forrest Wa S The Scheme

The Defence Department is in a worse condition to-day than it has been since the Federation was established. I thoroughly agree with the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that if we are to have a Defence Force, we should have a proper force, and, if not, we should depend upon the Imperial Military and Naval Forces to defend us, and pay them a subsidy for doing so. We should then know exactly what we were doing. It. is idle to denv the fact that we have men at the head of the Defence Department in the different States who are incompetent.

Captain Bailey joined the F Company, Queensland . volunteers, in> February, 1887, and served in the ranksuntil August, 1889. He joined the Darling Downs Mounted Infantry in September, 1889, as a private. He was appointed corporal in 1890, sergeant in 1892, and 1 quartermaster-sergeant in 1893. He received his first commission «n 1895, wasappointed captain in 1898, and served asan officer in the first contingent despatchecf by Queensland to South Africa. He was appointed adjutant of the Queensland Sixth Contingent, and was afterwards appointed chief staff officer of Colonel Gordon's mobile column, which took such, an active part in the Boer drives in the later stages of the war. The column consisted of the following troops:-Tw o companies of the -42nd Regiment-the Black Watch; 600 officers and men of the Imperial Yeomanry, 500 officers and men of the SouthAfrican Light Horse, a field hospital, a supply column, and a section of engineers. This position he held until the end of the war. He then went home to England to attend the British School of Musketry, and qualified as an instructor in musketry, the use and mechanism of the machine gun, and the range finder. He subsequently returned to Australia, only to find that all the good appointments were filled-some of them by officers who had refused to go to South Africa. He then applied to be examined for the rank of major, but, although he held a certificate from. Hythe, England, he was compelled to again take up musketry, and to pass in-it. However, he did pass for major in 1903, and was appointed to that rank in August, 1905. That position he now holds. He is an officer who has proved his capabilities, and \yho has risen from the rarucs, but, notwithstanding that, the authorities will not appoint him to the Permanent Forces. He is unable to find out the reason for their objection, but my own opinion is that it is because he has risen from the ranks-fro m the plebeians.

Favoritism has been shown, and it is time that some of the officers were turned out of the service. Let me refer to a case in which I am not personally interested. A number of the best men have left the Scottish Infantry Regiment in Western, Australia on account of the treatment they have received. A certain lieutenant attached to tlie corps was recently summoned in connection with a share deal on the Stock Exchange, and succeeded in evading his liability by pleading that the transaction was contrary to the provisions of the Gaming Act. I have ihade repeated inquiries with regard to this matter; but, so far, no explanation has been offered of the action of the Department in retaining a man who has been guilty of conduct unworthy of an officer and a gentleman. When a poor sergeant recently retained £ 1 0 which did not belong to him, . ancl was sued for it, and had to pay the money into Court, he was drummed out of the regiment. The officer to whom I have referred is apparently a friend of the Commandant., and, in addition to being a member of the' leading club in South Australia, moves in the highest circles of society. should be allowed to retain his position. I shall not be a party to the granting^ of money to pay officers of his description. There is no doubt as to the necessity for the reorganization of our forces. The Scottish Infantry Regiment in Adelaide, with which I was connected, and assisted to form, never asked the Commonwealth for one penny piece in the shape of pay, for the reason that we had men who could afford to give their services for nothing.. But that is not the case at present, and I think that the Department made a big blunder when they substituted partiallypaidfor volunteer regiments. I trust that, in the case to which I have referred, the Minister will endeavour to see that justice is done, and that he will thus maintain the honour of the forces and insure respect for the Department. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. If it is defeated, I shall hesitate to take the responsibility of making reductions in detail, because that course would probably lead to a further disorganization of our military forces. thoroughly endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa with reference to Captain Bailey. One man mentioned in connection with his case was Major Le Mesurier, with regard to whom I recently asked the Minister of Defence1. Is it a fact that Major and Honorary Colonel Le Mesuriera member of the Military Board of Control-ha s failed in an examination which has been passed by several militia and volunteer officers? 2. What is proposed to be done with this officer ? The reply was as follows1. Major and Honorary Lt. Colonel Le : Mesurier did not pass in an examination of officers of the Permanent Forces for promotion to Lt -Colonel. 2. In the October examination this officer proposes to again submit himself for examination. Major Le Mesurier has been declared to be over age, and also incompetent, and I think it is the duty of the Minister to explain why he is permitted to retain his present position, and also why Captain 'Bailey has been so unfairly treated. I desire the public to know how the officers and gentlemen connected with our Defence Forces look after their own interests and disregard those of the men. If the affairs of the Defence Department were as well managed as are those It is simply scandalous that he of the officers, for their own welfare, it would be very much better for the community. I should like to know whether the statements made by Senator Styles in his minority report as a member of the Hawker Inquiry Board are true. I refer to his assertions that the officers fixed different prices for the goods sold in the canteen at Queenscliff, and took care that they should be obtainable by them at prices considerably lower than those at which they were available to the rank and file. The officers concerned in this arrangement were Major Hawker, who has since been removed to Svdney, Major Dangar, and Lieut. Long-Innes, who has been sent to Canada. It was stated that the differential priceswere fixed for the benefit of the men, because all the profits were spent in promoting games and sports. The officers were asked at the inquiry if they ever engaged in games of cricket or football in which material purchased out of the canteen funds was used, and they had to admit that they did. Furthermore, it transpired that they had made free use of the billiard-table which had been paid for out of the profits derived from the canteen. It was estimated",44,Forrest Wa S The Scheme
322,Mr Maloney (Melbourne) [3,"55]1that i d . profit was made upon a bottle of brandy or whisky sold at the price at which it was purchasable by officers. Therefore, if five or six officers-and there were not manv at Queenscliff drank a bottle of whisky per day, the canteen would benefit to the extent of about 6d. per week. In order that there may be no confusion with regard to this matter, I desire to quote the list of prices at which goods were sold at the canteen. The list is as follows: R.A.A. CANTEENS (VICTORIA.) Prices to be charged to sergeants' mess or officers -Sergeants ' mess and officers may obtain the undermentioned goods at the prices placed against each item on signing a requisition for same.

It was stated that the prices were fixed, with a view to prevent drunkenness amongst the men. matches were dearer. thu object of encouraging sobriety that the prices of teetotal drinks, including mineralwaters, were raised. The honourable member for Maranoa was not complimentary May, 1905. when he called Mr Patchett a fool.

As a matter of fact, its members are not senior cadets in the proper sense of the term. For the past ten or twelve years they have gone into camp regularly with the ordinary volunteer and militia troops, and they have proved their capacity to hold their own. A t the last encampment I had the honour to command them, and I know that they did a twenty-miles march, and manoeuvred at the end of it just as well as did any of the other troops. I urge the Government not to lose the services of this regiment, which costs the Commonwealth less than does any other regiment of infantry. It is a body which is capable of being moulded into a very fine regiment indeed. It consists of excellent material, and possesses good officers; but because it is known as a body of senior cadets it is likely to suffer in the 7earra.ngement of our cadet forces.

In the first instance, I would point out the unsatisfactory position in regard to the contract post-offices. In answer to a question which I put to him recently, the Minister presented a return showing that there are in Victoria thirty-nine contract post-offices having a revenue of £ 4 0 0 per annum and over. ister has an urgent motion to propose.

352,Mr Tud Or (Yarra) [4.42],"I desireand it seems to me that if the Public Service Commissioner can, by means of a classification, destroy the rights of men in this way, no officer of the Department is safe. It has been held that certain high officials, such as heads of Departments, can not be classified, and it will be observed that at page 201 of the Estimates provision is made for the payment of the salary of the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria at the old rate of £900 per annum. It is stated in a footnote, however, that any future occupant of the office will receive only £750 per annum. I have no desire to sav a word against the present Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria, but I certainly do not think that the lower-paid men in the service should be subjected to treatment different from that extended to those in the higher ranks. If the rights of the higher-paid men, as existing at the date of transfer, are preserved, there is no reason why the lowerpaid men should not also receive the increases to which they are entitled under the Victorian Act. It would seem, however, that because they fought for their rights they are to suffer, whilst others, probably because they happen to be on the higher end of the scale, are paid their increments without demur. It is fortunate that the House insisted upon fixing a minimum wage instead of adopting the suggestion that the matter should be left to the Commissioner. .1 hope that the capable officers. It was further desired Postmaster-General will take the case of the letter-carriers into his favorable consideration, and see that they obtain fair treatment. Another matter to which I desire to refer relates to the examination of telegraph operators. I have handed to the Minister a statement in which the female operators complain that the examination to which they are subjected is unsatisfactory. In answer to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, the honourable gentleman stated to-dav that Mr Hesketh had not reported on the question of the use of the automatic transmitter, but that hd, had expressed the opinion that it was perfect. In view of that statement, one cannot help asking what, in the opinion of the Minister, is a .""report."" Must it be either a written or a printed document? Cannot a report be made orallv? The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne also inquired \yhv the transmitter was used in Victoria and not in New South Wales, and was informed that it is now being used in the mother State. I should like to know what percentage of the candidates who submitted themselves for examination in New South Wales passed in the use of the automatic transmitter, so that we might compare the returns with the passes in Victoria. In reply to a further question by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne, the Postmaster-General said that it was not necessary that those who went up for examination should be allowed, first of all, a trial use of the transmitter; but, as a matter of fact, they were given from three to five minutes to test it. It was stated tliat it was not necessary that the candidates should have an opportunity to accustom themselves to the transmitter. Mr Hesketh stated that the sound of the automatic transmitter, as compared with that of the ordinary instrument, was as different as printing is from writing; therefore, those who used the automatic transmitter for the first time were placed at a great disadvantage. When we passed the Public Service Act, honourable members on both .sides of the House desired that examinations should be conducted under ordinary routine working conditions, and that no special test should be applied that would be calculated to present obstacles to the promotion of deserving and possibly highly and understood that the public servants of every State would be dealt with on the same footing, and that officers in the smaller States would be subjected to the same examination as had to be passed by those in Victoria and New South Wales. We were told last year, when a number of operators went up for examination, that the automatic transmitter was perfect. It has, however, been subjected to some alteration since that time, and it is still pronounced to be perfect. If it had been perfect on the first occasion, it should not have been necessary to make any change. Those officers who failed to pass the test in the first case are, I think, entitled to some consideration, if it can be shown that the condition of the machine placed them at any disadvantage, or contributed to their want of success. There is one other matter to which I desire to direct attention. Some time ago the honourable member for Grey and I questioned the Minister of Home Affairs with reference to the Sunday i6 labour which telegraph operators were called upon to perform. I know that many persons develop conscientious scruples when they are compelled to work on Sundays. I do not wish, however, to refer to that aspect of the case. I have always understood that officers who were compelled to work on Sundays were entitled, by the regulations, to be paid at the rate of time and a half, and I thiink that telegraph operators should certainly receive extra remuneration. The Minister of Home Affairs promised that operators, many of whom have had to work for eleven, twelve, and thirteen days without any rest, should not be required to work more than six days on end without a day off. It seems to me that as the Department charge double rates for any messages sent on Sundays, they should pay their employees more than the ordinary rates. It must also be remembered that those who are called upon to perform duty on Sundays have not the same facilities as are available on week days for getting to and from their homes in the suburbs. This point should be taken into consideration. I trust that the Postmaster-General will look into the whole question, and do his best to discourage Sunday work. to protest against such an immense sum of money as that proposed to be voted in connection with this Department being dealt with in such a than House. I have previously directed attention to the undesirability of keeping the Estimates back until the last moment, and then hurrying them through without proper consideration. The Government apparently think that it is easier to transact business when there is but a small attendance of honourable members; but I strongly object to the way in which the affairs-especiall y the financial affairs-of the Commonwealth are being dealt with. It was recently stated in the newspapers that the Postmaster-General had agreed to allow paper patterns to pass through the post as newspaper supplements. I have received some communications from persons engaged in the business of newspaper publication work, in connection with which paper patterns are distributed. They regard the Postmaster General's action as illegal. The Post and Telegraph Act 1901, section 28, sub-section 2, saysA publication printed on paper, and issued as of issuing paper patterns in connection with, a supplement to the newspaper shall be deemed society journals. Estimates. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Estimates. to be a supplement, and to be part of the newspaper, if {a) It consists in substantial part of reading matter other than advertisements or of engravings, prints, lithographs, or coloured supplements; and (c) It has the title of the newspaper with which it is issued printed on the top of each page of letter-press. The Postmaster-General cannot make regulations except in conformity with the Post and Telegraph Act. There is nothing in that Act which empowers him to make any such concession to a newspaper as would permit paper patterns to go through the post as supplements. A supplement must "" in substantial part"". consist of reading matter, and it must have the title of the newspaper with which it is issued printed on the top of each page of letter-press. There is no letter-press with a paper pattern which in any way conforms to the requirements of the Act so as to entitle it to be issued as a supplement. A decision was given regarding this matter about four years ago. The decision of the Department was in writing under the signature, ""Robert Scott, Secretary,""-that paper patterns were not supplements as defined by sub-section. 2 of section 28. Does the Postmaster-General intend to persist in treating these paper patterns as newspaper supplements ? Another point worth mentioning is that a paper pattern issued with a newspaper, though not as a supplement, would bring a revenue of i d . to the Post Office. But under the proposed arrangement it would only pay about i d . Consequently, the revenue of the Department will suffer, even if what is proposed be legal. But I point out the illegalitv of it. Apparently, the only reason for making this concession is that a certain publication printed in Melbourne, and which is in no sense a fashion journal, proposes shortly to issue paper patterns Ideal tion the title of the publication. It seems probable tnat the Postmaster-General has been misled into the belief that he was doing a thing which would advance the interests of a certain journal, without injuring other people. But in this case it is pointed out that what is proposed would injure very seriouslv persons engaged in the business",49,Department Of The Postmaster General

It might as well be said that a cloth pattern issued with a newspaper was a supplement. If the Minister proceeds to give effect to what is alleged to be his intention, he will be acting beyond the scope of his powers. Passing from that matter, I wish to draw attention to the extraordinary condition of the Postal service regarding the status of a number of its omcers. Many of those in most important positions in New South Wales are not really gazetted to the offices which they hold. Some papers laid on the Library table a little while ago, which I had an opportunity to peruse, included a report from the Acting Chief Clerk, Mr Russell. I find from it that there are, occupying positions though not properly gazetted to them, the following officers in New South Wales :-The Deputy Postmaster-General, the Chief Clerk, the'Clerk in Charge, the Senior Clerk of the miscellaneous branch, the Appointment Clerk of the same branch -wh o has been in the same position for four years-the Telegraph. Manager, the Second Assistant, the Assistant Electrical Engineer, the Cashier, and the Distributor of Stamps. Two inspectors are. at present acting officers, and until recently there were more acting inspectors than properlyappointed inspectors in the Department. In addition to those originally mentioned who are only "" acting,"" and in manv instances have been doing so for a long time, there are in the General Post Office an "" acting"" assistant superintendent of mails, an ""acting"" telephone manager, and scores of minor officials who have not been permanently appointed to the positions which they occupy. Then the officer in charge at Tamworth has been an "" acting "" postmaster for about three years, the officer at Bourke for about four years, the officer at Newcastle for over a year, and the officer at Goulburn for about a year: while throughout the Department there are scores, and possibly hundreds, of junior officers who have not been permanently appointed to their positions. Mv information is obtained from the report of the ""acting"" Chief Clerk, Mr Russell, of Sydney. He points out that these make-shift arrangements are not conducive to efficient service or proper responsibility, and that the loyalty and self-sacrifice of the staff in working "" far into the night and on Sundays without expecting fee or reward or even commendation '' is largely responsible for the efficiency of the Department. To quote his own wordsSuppose each officer had stopped work at the regulation hour, and not worked voluntarily on Sundays, complete breakdowns in the Public Service, disorganization, and chaos would most assuredly have occurred. It is insisted that most of the trouble arises through not filling vacancies. There is a minute on the report expressing astonishment that this state of things exists; but, so far as I can ascertain, no attempt has been made to put an end to it. hinges on the appointment of the permanent head for New South Wales. able gentleman must admit that officers who are only acting cannot command the respect from, or exercise the authority over, their subordinates that permanent officers can do. have more confidence in permanent officers. matter is a very serious one, I hope that the Postmaster-General will look into it, and that no time will be lost in appointing a permanent Deputy Postmaster-General, and making as many other permanent appointments as possible. Another matter to which I have had occasion to make frequent reference is. the practice of employing clerical officers to do the work of general officers, particularly in the mail branch of the Sydney General Post Office. These men complain that they do not receive promotions in the clerical branch when they occur, because of their special fitness for the work which they are doing. No doubt heads of Departments naturallv try to keep round them the most efficient men procurable, to facilitate the business of the office. But it is unjust to keep back from promotion those who are most efficient. HithertoI have called attention in vain to the anomaly that the more efficient a man the less chance he has, under some circumstances, of receiving promotion. While I do not like to have to repeat complaints, I must take advantage of this opportunity to impress upon the Minister the necessity for -jiving the matter his serious consideration. I have made representations to the Department and to fhe Commissioner without mentioning individual cases, and I do not think 1",51,Department Of The Postmaster General

361,Mr Johnson,"That is so. As thethat in doing so I have gone beyond the .scope of my legitimate duties. But hitherto my efforts have been like beating the air. I wish now to pass on to another matterthe practice of getting station-masters to act as postmasters without remuneration. One -case of the kind has been the subject of a good deal of correspondence between the Department and myself, without satisfactory results-that of the station-master at Mortdale, near Sydney, who for a long time has been acting as postmaster without remuneration. I have not with me a letter received from the Department in regard to the case, but shall quote a similar reply, sent to the Premier of New South Wales, about itSir,-With reference to the letter which you forwarded to this office some time since, from TsU. J. Reilly, stationmaster at Mortdale, New South Wales, respecting a claim made by him to this Department for payment whilst acting as Postmaster at that p.lace, I have the honour to inform you inquiry has been made, and the following is copy of a report submitted by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, in regard to the matter :Mr Reilly's appointment was made in the usual manner relating to the appointment of railway officers, viz. :-That the allowance paid for the conduct of the duties is paid direct to the RailDetectives Gilder and Gowen, who, I think, way Commissioners. As his letter of appointment clearly points out ' that the remuneration allowed him by the Railway Department includes payment for his services as Postmaster, Mr Reilly's claim is untenable, as the allowance for the Postal duties has already been paid to the .Railway Commissioners. Of course, if the Post Office Department pays the Railway Department for the services of its officers, with the concurrence of the officers themselves in the arrangement, there is some difficulty; but the reply which I have read does not quite fit the circumstances of this particular case. He points out that his appointment was not madeuntil after he had occupied the position of station-master at Mortdale for two years. Consequently, he had to undertake these duties without receiving any extra remuneration whatever. I know that in a number of cases where station-masters have been appointed, it has been arranged that they shall act as postmasters as well. If they agree to do so, of course they have no claim for additional salary. But in this case Mr Reilly had been appointed as station-master for two years prior to being, called upon to discharge the duties of postmaster. Consequently, any regulations Xr. Johnson. of that kind would not apply to him. He saysI should certainly have declined accepting such duties at the rate of salary received by me, namely, £\f,o per annum. He affirms that the amount due to'him for two years and eleven months' service, at £ 1 6 per annum, is £ 4 6 13s. 4d. I think that that amount might very well be paid to him. paid by the Railways Commissioners or by the Commonwealth ? missioners will not pay him, I think that more than a moral responsibility rests upon -the Postal Department to see' that he is paid. I should like to have the assurance of the Postmaster-General that the matter will be the subject of proper inquiry. orable member that assurance. functory inquiry, but a real genuine inquiry. I am heartily sick of the stereotyped replies tardily given by the Department. When the Estimates of the Public Service Commissioner were under consideration yesterday, I referred to the case of have been most shamefully treated. In each of these cases the sums involvedwhilst they mean much to the individualare so trivial to the Commonwealth, that it is contemptible and paltry for the Government to take up the attitude which they have adopted. Where a moral responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth, it ought not to stand upon its strict legal rights. liveries ? ber has reminded me of one matter which had quite escaped my memory. About the beginning of the session I addressed two or three communications to the Department, embodying complaints which had been made in respect of late letter deliveries, and asking for a more efficient service in certain localities. But I have not received any information bearing upon that subject. About a week ago I wrote to the Deputy Postmaster-General reminding him that I had not received an answer to my requests, but I have not been favoured even with an acknowledgment of that letter. In the matter of correspondence, it seems to me that there is vast room for improvement in the methods adopted by the Department.",52,Department Of The Postmaster General

Deputy Postmaster General very obliging, and very willing to render every possible assistance. But in the matter of replying to correspondence, there is considerable room for improvement in the Department. My trouble is that constituents usually attribute their failure to get their wants attended to to neglect on my part, which puts me in a false and very unfair position. After a couple of months Have passed, it is not an unusual thing to receive-from a constituent a letter bewailing my apparent inattention to the particular matter which he has brought under my notice, when, as a matter of fact, I have at once, on the receipt of the first communication, brought it under the notice of the Department, with a request for its consideration. There is room for improvement, and in future I shall make a careful note of the dates on which I write to the Department, and those on which I receive replies to my communications. received to-day two letters in reply to communications addressed by me to the Postal Department, in which the statement is made that the subject-matter of my request has been submitted to the Secretary to the Postmaster-General, who will communicate with me. I wish to know whether this is to be taken as an indication that a new rule has been adopted in regard to the correspondence of the Department. Hitherto, I have always received from the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria very prompt replies to any letters on matters of detail that I have addressed to him, and on Questions of principle affecting the Department I have always written to the Minister. It would appear, however, that instructions have been issued that the Deputy Postmaster-General is not to address letters to members except through the Secretary of the Department. the matter. the General Post Office in the capital of each of the States a room is set apart for the convenience of members of the Federal Parliament, and I desire to point out to the Postmaster-General that after the next general election accommodation for ladies will be required, since a Miss Selina Anderson is to be refumed to the House of Representatives. [5.35] -The honourable member for Darling, who had to leave rather hurriedly to catch his train, requested me to bring under the notice of the Minister a complaint by a Mr Muleavy, that three letters addressed to him, care of Yarrawdn Station, Brewarrina, had not been delivered. I have not the f u l l details of the case, but I understand that the letters were sent out to Yarrawin, were returned to Brewarrina, and I presume sent on to the Dead Letter Office. When1 lived in the district, a private bag used to be sent cut to Yarrawin, and I believe tliat that practice is still in force. It is, to say the least, singular that Mr Muleavy should h « t been treated in this way. I ve have a similar complaint to make in regard to the non-delivery of the Worker to a subscriber employed on Cato's Station, Mumblebone, vid Warren. The man in question was working on the station for some months, but the Worker, which was sent to him every week, was returned to the office. The general feeling is that if those to whom private mail-bags are sent out refuse to deliver letters and papers to people living in the vicinity, the privilege should no longer be extended to them. It has been implied during the debate that in some cases the Postmaster-General has not been as attentive as he might have been to the requests for increased postal f acilities. I can only say that I have never had any cause to complain. AlthoughI have voted against Government proposals quite as often as any member of the Labour Party, tjie -Postmaster-General has always responded 'very readily to anv request that I have made, and, indeed, I may say the same of his predecessors. I now desire to bring under notice a complaint in regard to the Mount Morgan Post Office. Some time ago, I succeeded in inducing the Minister to remove the office from a higher to a lower point, and it was found necessary to cut down the ground at the back of the office to the extent of 4 or 5 feet. No steps were taken, however, to prevent the earth being washed away, and in wet weather there is nothing but slush and mud in front of the postmaster's residence, which is immediately behind the office. I trust that the Minister will take steps to have this grievance remedied.",53,Department Of The Postmaster General

I repeat that there is no desire on the part of the Government or the Department to countenance sweating. We propose to come down with a strong hand on some officials if it is true that they encourage the evil. As regards contract offices, honourable members know the position.

But the residents, represented in many cases by the Federal member, sav that very great satisfaction is being given by the person in charge, that they have every convenience they can expect to enjoy, and do not desire a change to be made. the service? we are in a dilemma between the officers and those who, although not under the Commissioner's control, have some claim If upon our consideration. For instance, a postmaster or other bread-winner dies, and leaves a widow with children; she office work. If a contract office is available we give her an appointment. She gives great satisfaction, does everything possible, the residents are satisfied, and'consequently we are very loth to interfere. that the honourable member would admit that we are right in that respect. In He insists upon the test being almost every case I have asked the opinion of the Federal member, who generally has a good local knowledge.

I listened with very great interest the honourable member believes in making an exception, and very often I agree with him, because he always looks at the merits of the case. The question of the condenser charges is very familiar to me, because he has freauentlv pressed it upon my attention. He has argued the matter to that point that he has nearly convinced me that something will have to be done, notwithstanding that the officers report that it is a difficult subject to deal with. I propose in the near future to make some reduction in the charges for trunk line conversations. But the difficulty is that if I proposed to A f t e r the make a reduction it would have to apply in all cases, otherwise I should get on to what my honourable friend admits is dangerous ground-that is making exceptions. We cannot make exceptions, but I propose to make a slight reduction. I have asked for a lot of information, at the honourable member's instance.

In a short time we hope to have a permanent chief officer appointed., and then every effort will be made to fill other positions, and thus remove existing anomalies.

I may say that most of the applications we receive from the country are for telephones on the toll system. I have had the financial aspect of the matter carefully considered; and it is now proposed to charge a minimum of £ 5 per annum in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide, and £ 4 ios. per annum in Perth and Hobart, allowing six free calls per diem. That is a very material improvement from the subscribers' point of view, because they really are given 1,000 free calls each half-year, which they can make at any time-if a subscriber does not use his telephone for twenty-five weeks, he may have his 1,000 calls in the twentysixth week. The new scale of charges will enable business people to obtain an improved service for £ 5 , as compared with! the present charge of £ 9 per annum in Sydney .and Melbourne, £ 6 per annum in Brisbane, and £ 1 0 per annum in .Adelaide. In Perth and Hobart the charges are now £ 7 and £ 6 respectively. There will also be greatly reduced charges in the country districts. At present the minimum charges for telephones in country districts are as follows:-Ne w South Wales, for business service, £ 8 per annum, and for domestic service, £ 5 per annum; Victoria, £ 7 and £ 5 respectively; Queensland, £ 6 for each class of service; South Australia, 2 For the year £ 5 for each class of service; Western Aus£ 4 ios. the charges as between States? the old State charges.

The two-party service is private, and in other respects is equal to, if not better than, that afforded by a single line, the only difference being by a three-party service a service of three people may be some distance apart, but they This applies more particularly to the country districts. The party system has been in vogue in America for some years, and hasproved of great service in the country districts. Under the toll telephone system, I propose to give subscribers a service with six free calls per day for considerably less than is now charged, and I am quite confident that when the people become acquainted with the fact that an efficient service can be secured for a low charge, there will be very few homes in the country that are not connected with the telephone system. come into operation? may send in an application to-morrow, and we shall start to deal with it on Monday.

Applications may be made forthwith, and we shall establish telephone connexions as rapidly as possible.

Some hundreds of thousands of pounds will have to be spent, and the work will have to be done gradually, but we propose to start forthwith, and to continue our operations upon the most progressive lines. After having carefully looked into the financial aspect of the telephone system, I find that we are now receiving a net profit of 10 per cent, per annum, and I am fully satisfied that the more we can keep down rates and improve the service, the more largely it will be availed of, and the greater will be the satisfaction given to the public. That is one of the reasons why I propose to allow a larger number of free calls than was intended in the first instance. consideration. We must be generous to the public, and make reductions in charges and increase the facilities as the expansion of the revenue warrants. By adopting this policv I trust that we shall be able to make the service one of the most popular in the Commonwealth. There has been a considerable development of telegraphic and telephonic communication in country districts, owing to the liberal policv now adopted, and a number of lines have been erected which previously were reported not to be warranted. If there are any other matters upon which honourable members desire information, I hope that they will bring them under my notice. I trust that I shall have the pleasure of seeing them back here next session, by which time the Post and Telegraph Department will be very much improved. If honourable members will continue to help me as they have done in the past, I am sure that we shall give satisfaction to the public. I desire to refer to a matter which has already been dealt with by the honourable member for Yarra.

If , for instance, the automatic transmitter is to be used in connection with examinations of telegraphists, it should be employed in all the ""States. I know that a number of the higher officials in the post-offices in Victoria desire to shunt all women workers. It was impossible to obtain justice for them when the Department was under State control, but, under the better regime of the Federal Government, we have been able to secure for women the same wages that are paid to men performing similar work. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that no injustice is done to the women workers in his Department. honourable member that the female employees in the Department shall have every to congratulate the Postmaster-General upon the work he has done in introducing reforms, more particularly in connection with the extension of telephone services, and the reduction of the rates.

Negotiations have been prolonged for some months, but, owing chiefly, I venture to believe-in some degree at all events by the High Commissioner, Lord Selborne, the task has at last been brought to a successful issue. The difficulty has been that almost the whole of the trade between the' two countries consists of exports from Australia to British South Africa, our imports from there being very small at present. The treaty is drawn upon those lines. Of course, it will not be made public until the proposals are submitted to this House. But, as honourable members are aware, under the terms of the South African Customs Convention there concessions are made by way of reductions in duties, and the concessions from us will also be by way of reduction of duties. Now that we have brought a prolonged negotiation to a successful issue, I trust that, even at this late period of the session, the agreement will meet with the approval of both sides of the House, and result in great benefit to the country. I offer the Government my heartiest consecuring reciprocal trade with British South Africa, whereby Australia has a great deal to gain. Tasmania has suffered considerably through losing contracts which she had previously been supplying for years, and I hope that she will now win back what she had lost.

I trust that the agreeand our desire that that blot upon the fair ment, will have the support of all sections, knowing as I do that it will have the most beneficial' effects in regard to Australia. 1 wish to refer to a matter about which I should have spoken when the Estimates of the Department of Trade and Customs were under consideration had not an engagement prevented me from doing so. I desire to bring briefly under the notice of the Prime Minister the fact that the regulations drafted by the Customs Department to govern the importation of patent medicines and infants' and invalids' foods do not carry into effect the desire expressed by honourable members in voting for the resolution of the honourable member for Barrier. The drugs in the list, with but one exception, are vegetable products, mineral poisons having been left out of account altogether. The intention of honourable members was that the packages or bottles containing patent medicines should be labelled with information as to the constituent parts of their contents; but what is provided is that if they contain any of the drugs specified that fact must be announced on the label. What we really want to know is the composition of these preparations, the feeling being that a large number of so-called patent medicines are not medicines, but are calculated to do harm, and that many of the infants' and invalids' foods are absolutely valueless. If it is not obligatory that information begiven on the labels of the contents of these preparations, they will continue to be imported and sold as at present. I hope to be able to refer to the matter again next week, but in the meantime I ask the Prime Minister to cause an investigation to be made as to why the Customs Department ,has given effect to the resolution of the House in such an extraordinary manner. I endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, and will, like him, take another opportunity to speak at length on the subject to which he referred. I desire to give my meed of congratulation to the Prime Minister, because of the conclusion of the negotiations for reciprocity with British South Africa. I trust that the closer relations and more friendly feeling which such, an agreement with those States will bring about will cause their people to understand the real feeling of 'Australia in regard to the Chinese question, fame of the country shall be removed. I trust that the word "" reciprocity,"" which comes down to us from the great Chinese philosopher, will be the means of causing them to know that we look with horror and loathing upon the action of the wealthy classes there in importing Chinese labour.
