(8) Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (lines 2 to 22), omit section 49D, substitute: 49D Operative time during growth phase-reduction of later standard pension or lump sum amount (1) If: (a) at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and (b) after the operative time, standard pension becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest; then the annual rate of that standard pension is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders. Note: If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to standard pension, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any widow’s pension that becomes payable. This happens because the amount of the widow’s pension is based on the amount of invalidity pay (a standard pension) that would have become payable to the member spouse at the time of death. (2) A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non-standard pension that later becomes payable. Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of pension under section 42 payable to a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death. (3) If: (a) at the operative time, standard pension is not payable in respect of the original interest; and (b) after the operative time, a lump sum amount becomes payable, in respect of the original interest, under section 32, 48, 48A, 56, 57 or 77; then that lump sum amount is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders.

Where paragraph 18(10B)(a) applies (one office) (3) If paragraph 18(10B)(a) applies, then: (a) the additional service factor at the payment time is 0.75; and (b) the additional service factor at the operative time is: (i) if the period of service in the office is at least 12 years-0.75; or (ii) otherwise-the number calculated, by reference to the member spouse’s period of service in the office before the operative time, by adding: (A) 0.0625 for each full year; and (B) 0.0625/365 for each left-over day. Where paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies (highest-paid office) (4) If paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies, then: (a) the additional service factor at the payment time is 0.75; and (b) if, at the operative time, the member spouse is not entitled to parliamentary allowance, then the additional service factor at the operative time for the highest-paid office to which paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies is 0.75; and (c) if, at the operative time, the member spouse is entitled to parliamentary allowance, then the additional service factor at the operative time for the highest-paid office to which paragraph 18(10B)(b) applies is worked out as follows: (i) calculate a factor under paragraph (2)(b) of this section for each office referred to in paragraph 18(10B)(b), other than an office for which the period of service began after the operative time; (ii) for each such factor, calculate a weighted factor under subsection (6) of this section; (iii) add together the weighted factors calculated under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (5) If the additional service factor at the operative time, worked out under paragraph (4)(c), would be more than 0.75, then it is taken to be 0.75. (6) The weighted factor is calculated using the formula: Salary for the office Factor× Salary for highest office where: salary for highest office means the number of whole dollars in the salary applicable at the payment time to the office referred to in paragraph 18(10B)(b) that had the highest rate of salary, or allowance by way of salary, at the payment time. salary for the office means the number of whole dollars in the salary, or allowance by way of salary, applicable to the office at the payment time. Division 2-Benefits for non-member spouse 22CD Associate annuity for non-member spouse (1) This section applies to a superannuation interest under this Act (the original interest) if: (a) the Secretary receives a splitting agreement or splitting order in respect of the original interest; and (b) the original interest is not an entitlement to an annuity under section 19AA; and (c) the member spouse and the non-member spouse are both alive at the operative time; and (d) if a base amount applies-the base amount at the operative time is not more than the family law value or the scheme value. Immediate annuity if operative time in payment phase (2) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the non-member spouse is entitled to an associate immediate annuity from the operative time, at the rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount. Deferred annuity if operative time in growth phase (3) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest, then the non-member spouse is entitled to an associate deferred annuity in accordance with section 22CE. 22CE Associate deferred annuity (1) The associate deferred annuity is payable at an annual rate calculated under the Orders by reference to the transfer amount. (2) The annuity is payable from the later of: (a) the operative time; and (b) the earliest of the following dates: (i) if the Trust is satisfied that the non-member spouse has become permanently incapacitated-the date that the Trust considers to have been the date on which the person became permanently incapacitated; (ii) a date notified to the Secretary under subsection (3); (iii) the 65th anniversary of the non-member spouse’s birth. (3) The non-member spouse may give a written notice to the Secretary specifying a date that is not earlier than the 55th anniversary of the non-member spouse’s birth. However, the notice has no effect if section 26B would prevent the annuity being paid to the non-member spouse from the specified date. Note: Section 26B applies the preservation requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations. (4) The annuity is not payable unless: (a) a written application has been made requesting payment of the benefit; and (b) the applicant has provided any information that is necessary to determine whether the benefit is payable. (5) An application for payment on the ground of incapacity must be accompanied by the following: (a) a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by the Trust; (b) a certificate given by a medical practitioner nominated by, or on behalf of, the non-member spouse; (c) such additional information or documents as the Trust requires. (6) The certificates mentioned in paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) must include a statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the medical practitioner concerned, the non-member spouse is permanently incapacitated, as defined in this section. (7) If the non-member spouse dies before the annuity becomes payable, an amount calculated under the Orders must be paid to the legal personal representative or, if no legal personal representative can be found, to any individual or individuals that the Trust determines. (8) For the purposes of this section, a person is permanently incapacitated if, and only if, the person suffers from permanent incapacity within the meaning of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. 22CF Commutation of small associate annuity (1) If: (a) the annual rate of associate immediate annuity that becomes payable to the non-member spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders; or (b) the annual rate of associate deferred annuity that becomes payable to the non-member spouse is less than the amount determined under the Orders; then the non-member spouse may elect to commute the annuity. (2) The election must be made in writing to the Secretary not later than 3 months after the annuity becomes payable. (3) If the non-member spouse makes the election, then the non-member spouse is entitled instead to: (a) if paragraph (1)(a) applies-a lump sum equal to the transfer amount; or (b) if paragraph (1)(b) applies-a lump sum calculated under the Orders. Division 3-Reduction of benefits for member spouse 22CG Operative time during growth phase-reduction of lump sum (1) This section applies if: (a) at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and (b) the original interest is not an entitlement to an associate annuity. (2) The contributions in respect of the original interest are reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula: Contributions at OT × Transfer factor where: contributions at OT means the amount of the contributions, ascertained at the operative time. Note: Under subsections 20A(2) and 22Q(3), certain amounts are deemed to be contributions (in addition to contributions under Part IV). (3) Any section 16A amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula: Section 16A amount at OT × Transfer factor where: section 16A amount at OT means the section 16A amount, ascertained at the operative time. (4) Any section 22Q amount in respect of the original interest is reduced, with effect from the operative time, by the amount calculated using the formula: Section 22Q amount at OT × Transfer factor where: section 22Q amount at OT means the section 22Q amount, ascertained at the operative time. 22CH Operative time during growth phase-reduction of retiring allowance (1) This section applies if: (a) at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and (b) after the operative time, a retiring allowance (the affected benefit) becomes payable to the member spouse in respect of the original interest. Note: If the member spouse dies before becoming entitled to a retiring allowance, then subsection (1) will nevertheless result in an indirect reduction of any annuity under paragraph 19(1)(a) to a surviving spouse. This happens because the amount of that annuity is based on the amount of retiring allowance that would have become payable to the member spouse if he or she had not died. Reduction of basic percentage (2) In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, the applicable basic percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:       BSF at PT –  BSF at OT × Transfer factor   × 100           where: BSF at OT means the basic service factor at the operative time. BSF at PT means the basic service factor at the payment time. Reduction of additional percentage (3) In calculating the annual rate of the affected benefit, each applicable additional percentage is replaced by the percentage calculated using the formula:       ASF at PT –  ASF at OT × Transfer factor   × 100           where: ASF at OT means the additional service factor at the operative time for the office concerned. ASF at PT means the additional service factor at the payment time for the office concerned. (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to an applicable additional percentage for an office if: (a) the period of service in the office began after the operative time; and (b) paragraph 18(10B)(b) does not apply. Multiple interest splits for same original interest (5) If, before the affected benefit becomes payable, the original interest has been split more than once (that is to say, section 22CD has applied more than once), then the calculations under subsections (2) and (3) are modified as set out in subsections (6) and (7). Note: If the same superannuation interest is subject to 2 or more payment splits, then section 22CD applies separately in relation to each of those splits. (6) In applying the formula in subsection (2), the component (BSF at OT x Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest): (a) calculate a factor (the interim factor) for the first split using the formula: BSF at OT Transfer factor for first split × for first split (b) calculate a factor (the interim factor) for the next split (the current split), using the formula:    BSF at OT – Interim factor  Transfer factor × for current split  for current split for previous split  (c) calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b); (d) add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c). Example: Assume2 splits, with the first split having a basic service factor (BSF) of 0.4 and a transfer factor of 0.5 and the second split having a basic service factor of 0.6 and a transfer factor of 0.5. Applying the above steps, the replacement number for the formula is 0.4, that is: 10.4 × 0.56 + 210.6 – 0.26 × 0.57 (7) In applying the formula in subsection (3), the component (ASF at OT x Transfer factor) is to be replaced by the number calculated using the following steps, based on the chronological order of the operative times (starting with the earliest): (a) calculate a factor (the interim factor) for the first split using the formula: ASF at OT Transfer factor for first split × for first split (b) calculate a factor (the interim factor) for the next split (the current split), using the formula:    ASF at OT – Interim factor  Transfer factor × for current split  for current split for previous split  (c) calculate a factor for each remaining split (if any), using the formula in paragraph (b); (d) add together the factors calculated under paragraphs (a) to (c). Reduction not to affect later non-standard annuity (8) A reduction under this section is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non-standard annuity that later becomes payable. Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death. 22CI Operative time during growth phase-reduction where original interest is entitlement to associate deferred annuity (1) This section applies if: (a) at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is not payable in respect of the original interest; and (b) the original interest is an entitlement to an associate deferred annuity. (2) The annual rate of that associate annuity (when it becomes payable) is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders. Note: Although an associate immediate annuity becomes payable at the operative time, an associate deferred annuity will often not become payable until some time after the operative time. 22CJ Operative time during payment phase-reduction of standard allowance or annuity (1) If, at the operative time, standard allowance or annuity is payable in respect of the original interest, then the annual rate of that allowance or annuity is reduced to the amount calculated under the Orders. (2) A reduction under subsection (1) is to be disregarded in calculating the amount of any non-standard annuity that later becomes payable. Note: For example, the reduction will be disregarded in calculating the amount of annuity payable under section 19AA in respect of a child of the member spouse after the member spouse’s death. Division 4-Miscellaneous 22CK Ministerial Orders (1) The Minister may make Orders prescribing matters required or permitted by this Part to be prescribed. (2) An Order is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. (3) An Order is taken to be a statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903. (10) Schedule 1, item 27, page 31 (line 5), after “Family Law”, insert “and Other Matters”.

(Notice given 1 April 2004.) Thursday, 1 April 2004 ----Environment: Climate Change Labor government for taking action on the issue of climate change and encouraging the states and territories to follow suit. The fact that the federal government has completely failed on this issue will haunt their term of government for decades to come. The CSIRO has said that average global annual emissions over the past decade were 13.3 billion tonnes, but its latest figures show that 18.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were released into the atmosphere in 2002 and 17.1 billion tonnes were released last year. This level of annual increase in emissions could lead to a faster than expected jump in the Earth’s temperatures. Almost every other equivalent nation on the planet has signed the Kyoto protocol-not because it will fix global warming but because it is the first small step towards reversing the pollution of the atmosphere. That pollution will lead to massive social, environmental and economic dislocation in the coming centuries if we do not do something. The following examples demonstrate the impacts of recent weather and climate change. Although it is impossible to precisely link individual catastrophes to global warming, the frequency and intensity of these kinds of events is projected to increase as the world warms. In August last year a heatwave hit Europe and led to as many as 15,000 deaths-mostly amongst the elderly-in France alone, where temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius. Just last week we heard reports of the first-ever cyclone off the Argentine coast. Germany received as much rain as it normally gets in a year in less than two days in August of last year, and the resulting floods killed at least 108 people in Europe and forced 450,000 people to evacuate. Weather related disasters, including floods, droughts and windstorms, are growing in frequency and intensity. Since 1980, 10,868 weather related disasters have caused more than 575,000 deaths and have forced many more people to flee their homes. In 2002, economic losses to homes, businesses and crops from weather disasters approached $53 billion worldwide-a 93 per cent increase over 2001 losses. It is predicted that by the year 2050 megacatastrophes, which used to appear every 100 years, will occur every 25 years. There has been a lot of anguish in international discussion amongst the major pollutersthe Western developed countries. Unfortunately, during the term of this government Australia has gone to the forefront as the worse per capita greenhouse gas emitter on the face of the planet. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the government, I would assume, recognise and have taken heed of the CSIRO’s warning that a 60 per cent reduction in global warming gases by mid-century is a minimum if we are not going to have the most disastrous destruction of the world’s environment since the extinction of the dinosaurs. The world is rapidly warming. The news coming from scientists around the planet is not getting more reassuring but more alarming. I therefore am relieved that at least the state and territory governments around this country have the foresight to take some action on this very important issue.

276,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,,176,Statements By Members
277,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (9.40 A.m.),"I rise to commend the New South Wales CarrCasey Electorate: Croydon and Lilydale Community great stalwarts from the Croydon and Lilydale community in the electorate of Casey: Neil Gryst, Ken Gibbons and Eric Dosser. Neil Gryst has recently retired as secretary of the Croydon RSL, having served in that position and in other roles within the RSL for many years. Neil is a great community person who is always looking out for the welfare of others. So too is Ken Gibbons, who has just completed his term as president of the RSL sub-branch in Croydon. Both men have served our nation with honour in times of need, and both continue to do so at the local community level in Croydon. Neil’s long standing service was acknowledged through the awarding of a Centenary Medal last year. In a similar way, Eric Dosser has also served the veteran community in Lilydale and in the wider Yarra Valley. In recent times, he has been president of the Lilydale RSL, making a great contribution to many of the ex-servicemen there-whether making sure that the facilities at the RSL were up to date or ensuring that veterans from Melbourne’s outer east and the gateway into the Yarra Valley got all the help they needed. Eric has been a key contributor and a friend to many. As the sub-branch president, he was instrumental in establishing the Yarra Valley Ex-Services Support Centre, which runs totally on volunteer effort and the help of many of the other local veterans and their families. Eric was also awarded a Centenary Medal and continues to work tirelessly on behalf of the community. In recent years, these three men have had key roles in organising and running ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. Both ceremonies at Croydon and Lilydale are increasingly well attended by hundreds of local residents. It is a credit to them that the Lilydale and Croydon ceremonies have featured a wide array of participants, including large numbers of young people from local schools and youth organisations. Around our nation the ANZAC spirit lives on. It is pleasing to know that younger generations have a growing understanding of the sacrifices made by those who served our nation. In our area, this pleasing trend is growing because of the efforts of people like Neil, Eric and Ken. Meeting and knowing them and having an understanding of what drives them shows in a very clear way the strong community spirit that exists throughout the suburbs and townships of Melbourne’s outer east and Yarra Valley. Taxation: Business Activity Statement difficulty small businesses-and particularly, I suppose, microbusinesses-face in achieving compliance with GST requirements, particularly the work involved with the preparation of the BAS, which takes small business people away from the vital functions of putting in the often very long hours involved in running their businesses. The problems that small businesses face are compounded by the difficulties many of them have in getting accountants and similarly qualified people to do the essential work for them and the costs involved with that. That situation is being made more difficult by the ATO-the tax office-putting out a document called ‘Important information for bookkeepers providing BAS services’. This particular statement from the ATO says: Bookkeepers whose work includes BAS-related services for clients need to be aware of the legal restrictions on who can charge a client for the provision of tax advice.

279,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (9.45 A.m.),"I think all members would be aware of theIt goes on to make it clear that unless a person has particular professional qualifications they are unable to assist small businesses in the preparation of BAS statements. This is going to impose-and is imposing-significant hardships on many small businesses or microbusinesses in which often there is a situation where typically an experienced woman, for example, does some part-time work in assisting a small, corner milk bar or some other small business in the preparation of their BAS for a small fee. That is no longer possible. In fact, the restrictions go even further. In the question and answer section of the ATO’s circular they give the following examples: If bookkeepers don’t charge a separate fee for BAS preparation, are they allowed to prepare a BAS as part of a total bookkeeping serve? The answer is no-they cannot. The next question is: If bookkeepers don’t charge a fee for BAS preparation, are they allowed to show a client how to prepare a BAS as part of a total bookkeeping service? Again the answer is no. This is going to impose extraordinary additional difficulties on small businesses in this important activity. It is also going to put a significant number of peoplemainly more experienced women-out of economic activity because they are not going to be able to earn a dollar for those services. One understands that there are some areas where care needs to be taken. For example, it would be quite improper for a person unqualified in a professional sense to make representations to a potential client that they have got a qualification. It is similarly important for clients to understand that, with the sort of arrangement that has existed in the very small business sector, the businessperson themselves needs to be signing the statement and accepting full responsibility for the preparation of the statement. But, as I said, the difficulty in getting access to professional advice and the cost of it means that things are going to be much harder for small business. (Time expired) Employment: Mature Age Workers yesterday when I saw a postcard entitled ‘Why mature age workers?’ It was a postcard that was promoting the employment of older Australians, but it sends the wrong message. By the use of the words ‘mature age’, it indicates that these are people who are at the end of their working life. What it should say is ‘Why experienced workers?’ People over 45 or so, who are generally considered in this category, bring wide-ranging experience and skills to any business that employs them. They relate well to customers of all ages-and I think we all understand that. They have less absenteeism, fewer accidents and are a steadying influence on younger workers. They are enthusiastic, they welcome training, and they adapt well to new technologies. In short, an experienced worker is the perfect employee. In my particular area in Townsville, where tourism is a very significant industry, there are huge opportunities for experienced workers. I ask Townsville and Thuringowa locals to consider the tourism industry. In Australia, one employee in 10 is employed in tourism or in related industries. It is a huge job market. Currently there are 325,000 jobs available Australia wide in the tourism industry. Experienced workers are best able to meet the requirements of the tourism industry, and I encourage Townsville’s experienced workers to apply for jobs, to look for some extra training that is available, and to join that industry because there are opMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members
280,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.49 A.m.),"I want parliament to understand that I was angryportunities that suit both the employee and the employer. Often in the tourism industry, you can make an arrangement with your employer that you work hours that are not the normal nine to five, because they happen to suit both the employer and the employee. It is a good outcome for everybody. I ask the departments responsible for the usage of the words ‘mature age’ to say what they really are and change those words to ‘experienced workers’. Health: Food Additives ing nitrofurans. It first came up in newspapers and also on the program Today Tonight. More recently, nitrofurans have again been in the media. The government must act to rebuild consumer confidence as a result of concerns about the safety of imported prawns and honey. For the past two years, any food product containing a traceable amount of nitrofurans-a carcinogenic antibiotic used in some overseas farming practices-has been banned from entering the European Union and North America. Australia, technically, has a zero tolerance of nitrofurans in food, and it is illegal to import any food product containing a detectible amount of this antibiotic. However, the food agency which is charged with enforcing this zero tolerance, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, is out of step with the rest of the world by claiming that low levels of nitrofurans do not pose a health risk and by not acting to deal with this issue. The problem with this claim is that consumer confidence in Australian producers and manufacturers of products linked to imported foods containing nitrofurans, such as honey and prawns, may suffer as a result of the government’s tardiness in ensuring that a proper testing and enforcement regime is in place. The government must act immediately to ensure that FSANZ’s scientific evidence, which has led them to claim that low levels of nitrofurans are safe, is peer reviewed. If the Europeans and Americans are banning food products containing nitrofuran and we are not, the right thing to do is to have FSANZ’s evidence peer reviewed, as this is a fundamental tenet of good science. The second thing the government needs to do is explain how an antibiotic found in food products can be illegal but little or no action is taken to prevent its entry into Australia. If a food product is deemed illegal and there are potential public health and safety risks, that product should be refused entry or withdrawn from supermarket shelves so that consumers are not exposed to any potential harm. I am gravely concerned about having imported prawns, honey or any other product with this antibiotic in it on our shelves. Even though FSANZ are saying that low levels of nitrofurans are not dangerous, products containing nitrofurans are illegal. It should be black and white when it comes to food safety and protecting consumers: if it is illegal it should not be sold here. It is fundamentally important that we ensure that consumers are not put off buying Australian foods such as prawns and honey because of the concerns about their imported counterparts. The last thing we want is a lack of consumer confidence in our seafood and honey industries. SoI stress: when we are talking about nitrofurans, we are only talking about products imported from parts of Asia and Argentina. The government has failed to prevent imported food products containing nitrofurans being sold in Australia, despite stringent bans overseas. SoI call on the minister responsible to make sure that FSANZ’s claims are peer reviewed. I also call on the government to instigate more MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Cowper Electorate: Dorrigo Dramatic Club Lawler, is a key work in the history of Australian theatre and has been drawing audiences since its Australian premiere in 1955. On SaturdayI had the pleasure to attend a performance of this play by the Dorrigo Dramatic Club. The production, directed by Gwynneth Denner, is a credit to this small but dedicated production company. The play deals with mateship, loyalty and change and is brought to life by a cast of local actors. The cane cutters-Barney Ibbot, played by Leo Bradney-George, and Roo Webber, played by Wayne Burley-travel to Melbourne from the cane fields for the annual lay-off over the summer months, as they have done for many years. Lisa Rogers, who plays Olive Leech, and Dina Luciani, who plays Pearl Cunningham, also bring the show to life. Bubba Ryan, Emma Leech and Johnnie Dowd, played by Jennie Clayton, Francis Aylott and Liam Pastro respectively, complete the cast and provide for a very entertaining evening of drama. Like all productions, much work goes on behind the scenes and I would like to commend the work of stage manager Monica Sala, and production manager and lighting operator Bob Denner. Sound assistance was provided by Peter Munro, wardrobe by Cass Heness and set construction by Mick Fawcett and Bob Denner. Poster design was by Caitlyn Streets-Hanby and Mary Kell was assistant to the director. This production had widespread community support, with the CWA craft group and the Uniting Church meet and greet group assisting in making some of the props for the production. The season commenced in the old Gazette Theatre in Dorrigo on 13 March and concludes on 2 April. The Dorrigo Dramatic Club also supports very young actors and Dorrigo Young Drama, which meets at 10 a.m. on Saturdays during the school term. Dorrigo Young Drama is for children aged between seven and 14. As I have said, the production at the theatre is one that is very much a community effort; the theatre oozes with charm; and it has been basically done completely with volunteer labour. In our area we depend very much on tourism. To have great beaches and a great environment is only part of the total tourism experience. Our region has a very important focus on culture and the arts to complete a total tourism experience. It is pleasing to see the Dorrigo Dramatic Club playing their role in enhancing culture in our region, increasing enjoyment for the people of Dorrigo and for tourists in the area who may wish to see a very fine local production. If we can allow tourists to stay one extra night it greatly increases employment and greatly increases wealth in our area. It is great to see Dorrigo Dramatic Club putting on a fine production not only for locals but also for tourists. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded.

Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.57 a.m.)-I would like to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004 and indicate Labor’s support for the proposed changes to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act. It is really a welcome development in this area. In the community a lot of concern is expressed over our classification system. I believe we have a very good classification system. Certainly if you look around the world you will see that we are lucky that our classifications are largely well understood and adhered to. The bill before us today will bring into line the classification systems that apply to films and to computer games. It is going to be a very useful tool, particularly for parents who are keen to ensure that they exercise some control and guidance over their children and the sorts of material their children will be using. It is difficult for parents to ascertain what level of violence, sexually explicit material or other sorts of matters that come within our classification systems are in computer games in particular, and we are in a world where they are changing quickly. This is raised with all of us every now and again when we are in the community and in our electorate offices. It is welcome that this bill seeks to make the classifications in the film area, which are perhaps better understood, apply consistently to video games. The major change deals with making ‘a more effective distinction’ between the advisory classification types G, PG and M and those where a legally enforceable restriction applies: MA15+, R18+ and X18+. I think that the reference to age in the legally enforceable classifications gives parents some sort of guidance. It makes clear to children and young adults what is appropriate for them to view and gives a little bit of consistency so that people do not have to understand what the classification categories mean for video games as opposed to what they mean in the film area. I had a discussion with a colleague of mine yesterday about this bill-she has a child who is 14. She said it would be the most effective thing to be able to say, when telling him he cannot see a film that he wants to go and see, ‘You know, if you go to the cinema they’ll ask you for your identification or your age and you won’t be allowed to go in.’ She said she did not have that confidence with video games and so was very pleased that this bill would ensure that a restriction would apply to some of the potentially damaging materials that most people in the community would prefer to see mature adults dealing with rather than young children. She said that having a legally enforceable cut-off point in some of these categories would be useful to parents as a way of encouraging their kids to use appropriate material. It will also be useful to have the backing of some enforceability and to be able to say, ‘Actually, you’re not going to be allowed to buy those,’ or ‘You’re not going to be able to get into the cinema.’ I guess we have to be realistic: young adults are pretty good at getting around some of these guidelines and it is difficult to see how we can stop some of them seeing material that is not appropriate for them, but I think these guidelines and changes will assist. It is true that as a result of this bill there will be no change to what is classified in a particular way-so there is no suggestion that the classification guidelines themselves will be altered-but there will be some consistency in the labelling of material so people can understand what is meant by a classification. I am also pleased that the government has indicated that, along with changes to the act, there is an intention to more widely discuss what the different classifications mean and to encourage others in their obligations to conduct broader MAIN COMMITTEE community education on this issue. I think that is welcome; I think it would be welcome with the existing classification structure, but now that there is to be consistency across film and video games it makes it even more worthwhile because a bit of a blitz education campaign or advertising material would be really helpful. I note that initially there were some concerns expressed by the commercial television industry about what the new requirements would mean for the showing of MA15+ material on TV. I understand that some of their concerns have been worked through and that because there is, as I understand it, also going to be a review of the code of practice there may be an opportunity to take up those issues. Obviously, it is in everybody’s interest to make sure that the classification structures are actually workable. Whilst the parliamentarians in this House and parents in the community will not always share 100 per cent the interests of the commercial television associations or film distributors, it is worthwhile for us to make sure that we have discussions with them about practical ways to ensure that these classification structures have meaning for parents-that when a warning is issued before a film starts on TV it needs to give families, young adults, parents and others watching a clear indication of what it is they are going to see. I must say my personal view-and it is not an issue that is really dealt with by this bill-is that it would also be helpful for TV viewing if some of those classifications and warnings were shown a little more regularly throughout the film. I think it is not a realistic expectation, because of the way we live our lives, view TV and do all sorts of other things, that everybody will be there at 25 past eight when the film starts. It might be preferable if there were some way of making those classifications more widely noticed. Often just the logo is there and I think this ties back in with the need to make sure that the classifications are widely understood; so that if you do see the new MA15+ classification you understand what that means and whether it is appropriate for your children to watch that sort of film. It is good that confusion is going to be removed as a result of this bill. It will be helpful not just for consumers-although that is the primary consideration that we in this parliament have-but also for distributors, broadcasters and others who run video stores and sell computer games to have some consistent application as well. I note that this is the result of discussions and agreements that have been reached with the states and territories. I understand that it will be necessary for the states and territories to implement some changes by introducing complementary legislation to support this bill and that they have the primary role of ensuring that the classification structure is adhered to. Some of the issues that I am concerned about are not reflective of there being any particular inadequacy in this bill. It will fall to the states and territories to make sure that the implementation is as effective as it can be. There is nothing more that I want to raise regarding the bill other than that I understand that there will need to be a transitional phase-in. There is going to be some provision made for existing material which has already been marked with the old classification structure. There obviously will be some phase-out time, which is appropriate, and there should not be any problem with there being a short phase-in time. I understand that the Office of Film and Literature Classification is to carry out a national public awareness campaign to draw attention to the revised classification types. I urge the House to take an interest in that. It is of growing importance to the community to make sure that, without unnecessarily censoring the material that adults are able to see, we have clear guidance available to our children MAIN COMMITTEE and young adults. Frankly, as adults, we want to be able to choose whether we see films that contain violence, sexual activity or other things. The more information we have and the more easily as adults we can make choices about the sort of material that we want to view or the games that we want to use, the more that is in everybody’s interests. It is particularly for children and young adults that these classifications will have an impact. I commend the bill to the House and indicate Labor’s support for these changes. note the opposition’s support for the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004, and appropriately so; it is a non-controversial piece of legislation which the community in general will support. I support the member for Gellibrand’s comments on the regular indication of the classification of particular films. It is unlikely that viewers will be present at the very beginning of the showing of a film, so regularly showing the level of classification is worthy of pursuit. The bill brings computer games into line with film classifications. It ensures that, when computer games are sold, parents have a clear guideline of whether such games meet various criteria and what their appropriate classification is. It is important to note that the classification for X-rated films does not apply to computer games, and rightly so because of the ease with which they are obtained and young people’s access to them. The predominant aim is to bring computer games into line with film classification and to ensure that we do not have Xrated computer games depicting violence or showing explicit scenes which would readily be available to young people. I believe it is a sensible way of classifying. It is appropriate that there has been some discussion with the community about the way the films should be classified. I am aware, on the straight suitability of films, that there are many people who are not necessarily prudish in terms of films but who certainly take exception to extreme violence. They want to be aware, if they go to see a film, that the classification is right. They want to be aware that it does contain violence or explicit sexual scenes. They want to be aware so they can make an adult choice as to whether or not they wish to view them. But its predominant assistance is to parents, because our aim is that young people do not have access at too early an age to pornography, scenes of violence-particularly the ultraviolence that is often displayed-or sadomasochism. That is something that we simply want to avoid in the publications, films and computer games that our young people are seeing. This bill will amend the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 and will assist in a more fluid operation of the classification scheme. The aim is to make a common classification scheme for films and computer games, as I have said. The bill will not alter the type of material permitted within each classification group; it will merely bring the two classification schemes into one. There is a more effective distinction between the class types. For example, the G, PG and M classifications will stand for film and apply to computer games. For classes where legally enforceable restrictions apply, there will be a reference to the specific age-for example, MA15+, R18+ and X18+. Of course, as I have said before, you do have R18+ and X18+ for films, but for computer games the highest classification will be MA-for mature adults-15+. The bill will help make classifications easily available to parents and give a clear, distinct hierarchy to the classification of films. The bill does not deal with publications; they are not MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill 2004
284,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.07 A.m.),"I am very happy to follow the member for Gellibrand. Iclassified in the same way as films and computer games. It will also give effect to the agreement by the Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers to change classification laws to better inform the community about strong materials in films and computer games. The bill also does not affect the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, nor does it affect the importation of publications, films or computer games. Imported products remain subject to classification prior to release in Australia. By way of background, there are two main pieces of legislation which oversee the classification of publications, films and computer games-the classification act and the broadcasting act. Descriptions of the products which would fall within the classifications are contained in the National Classification Code. For example, the code sets out the level of depiction of sex, violence and other issues which would cause a film to be classified as G, PG, M et cetera. The criteria for classification are also contained in the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. The broadcasting act deals with program standards for broadcasting primarily for commercial television. It permits radio and/or television industry groups to develop codes of practice relating to broadcasting standards and provides that, in developing codes of practice, the industry must take into account community attitudes to issues such as violence, sex, offensive language, drugs-including alcohol and tobacco-and the depiction of gender and ethnicity. It is a bill that both sides of the House agree to. It does bring the two classification schemes together in terms of films and computer games. It is a useful guide to parents. It is not a question of the government introducing more restrictive guidelines but rather providing a useful means for young people to be guided on publications, and of course it provides a clear indication to those who run video shops and who lease and sell computer games that they must abide by those requirements. The ready availability of pornographic films to young people and imported computer games which are also available through the black market are of concern. We want our young people to develop a healthy attitude towards sex and personal relations, and this is one aim of such a classification system. We also want to ensure that they do not see depicted excessive violence, which can lead to them simulating that behaviour in the streets of Australia. This is a sensible and worthwhile approach, and there have been extensive public discussions on this issue. I commend the bill to the House. cations, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004 is one of those bills for which there is bipartisan support. It is an important bill because it is at the centre of the type of government regulation we would like to see in this country. That applies especially to the coalition insofar as one of the most concerning problems for many in the community is the different regulations, different levels of regulation and inconsistent standards about content that the government applies. This unfortunately was the situation that applied to the differentiation between film classification and computer games classification. There is a growing convergence between the games industry and the films industry. We are seeing many games modelled on films and vice versa. One example is the highly successful film series The Matrix, which quickly developed into a computer game. In reverse, the computer game Lara Croft Tomb Raider-which I am sure you are very familiar with, Mr Deputy MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill 2004
285,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.16 A.m.),"It is pleasing to note that the Classification (PubliSpeaker Causley-came from the computer game industry first and was then transferred into a film. Many people rely on the operation of government and the agencies that are charged with making the appropriate classification of films and computer games. Parents rely on them because in today’s time-poor society parents do not have the opportunity to perhaps sit down and watch a film or play a computer game to deem whether it is suitable or otherwise for their children. If it were not for the classification system, parents would be required to do this if they wanted to be good parents. If parents wanted to determine whether or not something was suitable for their children, they would need to ensure that the computer game or film was appropriate. Of course, that is not feasible, and that is why government need to send a clear message that we take the time to look at and make an informed decision about the appropriate classification of a computer game or film. In this regard, parents need to have confidence that they can rely upon the classification that is given to a film or a computer game. The fact that there was previously an inconsistency between the two classification types applying to films and computer games meant that it would sometimes be a little confusing for parents to make this decision. I am very pleased that the bill before the chamber today deals with minor amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. These amendments seek to bring classifications into line so that you have a uniform standard that applies both to computer games and to films. The existing classifications for films are the ratings of G, PG, M, MA, R, X and those that are refused classification. To the corollary, the existing classifications for computer games are G, G8+, M15+, MA15+-there is no R or X category-and those that were refused classification. Now the two are coming together. We will now have one uniform standard which will apply-that is, G, PG, M, MA15+, R18+, X18+ and RC, which is the refused classification. The benefit of this is that you have the one uniform standard. The introduction of MA15+, R18+ and X18+ means that there are now legally enforceable age thresholds which will apply to both films and computer games. This is a fairly uncontroversial piece of legislation, and I have pretty much touched upon all the areas that I sought to cover, but I will go on while I wait for the parliamentary secretary to come into the chamber. I would like to assess in more detail the various points of this bill. It ensures that we help to protect those aged under 15, for example, from exposure to unsuitable material. It is most concerning, I am sure, for many parents to walk in and see their children playing a computer game or watching a film which they would deem to be unsuitable. It is very important that there is a comprehensive and detailed list of material available so that parents can make informed decisions about what their children are watching. I turn my mind to one game in particular, which I know has been controversial of late: Grand Theft Auto. I have had the benefit of seeing and playing Grand Theft Auto, because I am a firm believer in and supporter of my local computer games industry, which, incidentally, is in fact bigger than the film box office industry. This highlights the way that society is changing as computer games become more and more popular. Grand Theft Auto caused a lot of controversy when it was released because it dealt with a number of fairly violent, some would say, aspects-in particular, in this game players steal various cars and drive them MAIN COMMITTEE around, and this often leads to situations such as beating people up or driving over them in their vehicles. Understandably, this caused some concern for many parents, but the point I would raise is that this game is targeted towards a specific age group only. It is a game that, like many films, is targeted towards a mature age group-people that can differentiate between simulated violence, for example, that they might see when playing a computer game versus other violence that occurs in the real world. It is important that we do not seek to impose a government enforced mandate about what is appropriate or inappropriate but rather that we try to ensure that people have actual information about whether a game might be appropriate for the intended audience. That really is the point, because classification of films and computer games is largely built upon providing information to families and parents, as well as to customers. Classification operates in parallel with our need to ensure a strongly enforced system for the sale of such products. There is no point, quite frankly, in appropriately classifying films and computer games if we then do not ensure the enforcement of the sale of these products. There is little point in classifying a film X-rated or R-rated, or indeed MA15+ for a computer game, if there is no enforcement of the market to which these products are sold. This is a twopronged approach. If, for example, an X-rated video is readily and widely available to children, then that classification obviously serves no benefit whatsoever. There must be a strong enforcement of classifications in terms of sales, because that is a fundamental aspect. I note that the member for Gellibrand said that she was of the view that the bill will give parents greater control and confidence about what is appropriate for their children, particularly young adults, to see. This applied, in particular, in respect of the legal restrictions that might apply to MA15+ material. I am very pleased that this is the Labor Party’s position, because it is consistent with the Liberal Party’s position, and that is always a good outcome. I heard the member for Cook speak about this bill, highlighting the fact that the very last thing we would want to do is ensure that there is a prevalence of violent material made available to our children. The reality is that we do not want our children to see unnecessary levels of violence nor, indeed, unnecessary levels of sexual material in film and on TV. In that respect, it is very important that this new code applies. I notice that the member for Franklin is particularly keen to speak on this bill, so I will wrap up my comments there. I commend the bill to this chamber. It is a good bill. It ensures that we have consistent and uniform legislation. I am very pleased to support it. gratulate the government on this initiative. I think it makes real common sense. It obviously has bipartisan support. A couple of issues came to mind as I listened to the debate this morning. One of those is the suggestion by the member for Gellibrand that we should have a continuous classification logo on movies. We see that WIN TV, in particular, have their little logo for the duration. I am not too sure whether or not it is to discourage you from videotaping whatever is on television, but I do think that a continuous classification logo on movies would be a great idea. One thing that worries me is that the explanatory memorandum says that states and territories are going to pass complementary legislation. I would be interested to find out what the time frame for this is. Knowing some of the states and territories as I do, they have got such a backlog of legislation and they meet so infrequently that one wonders whether this is going to MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill 2004
286,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.25 A.m.),"I, like other speakers in the chamber today, contake 18 months, two years; whether there is a time frame for Commonwealth and state agencies to sit down and work this out. Another thing that worries me is, when you go into video stores, whether these new 15+ computer games are going to just be up there with bestsellers, top rating things, or whether there is going to be a discrete section in the video stores of 15+ video games, so that young kids do not wander in. If you visit a video store, as I do reasonably infrequently, you find it is just a great big barn. There is stuff all over the walls and people wander around. You are grabbed only at the end, when you rock up to the counter with whatever you have got. There is no real perusal of whether you are there looking at MA15s and you are eight years of age and scanning what is on the box. I would be interested to know who is monitoring this, whether there is going to be a discrete 15+ section for computer games. As I say, this bill has bipartisan support. As federal members, each and every one of us will be alerting our constituents through our newsletters to the changes that have been proposed in this Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004. I congratulate the government and the minister for doing this. It is interesting that the original bill was in 1995 and, in less than 10 years, we are now aligning both films and computer games. People, when they introduced the original 1995 bill, did not realise the way computer games were going to take over many people’s lives. For most of the young people that I am in contact with, much to their educational edification, these computer games are taking over their lives. Some people are even saying that our thumbs are going to be more useful than our fingers. I again congratulate the government, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the bill this morning. stration) (10.30 a.m.)-I would at this stage like to thank all of those honourable members who have spoken on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004. As members of parliament we often get pilloried for appearing to disagree on everything, but every so often-in fact, more often than people appreciate-we do find a unanimity of purpose and a oneness of aim, and that is represented by the way in which all honourable members have supported the very positive improvements included in this particular bill. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill makes a number of procedural amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The bill merely renames the existing classification types and does not affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games. The amendments will improve the operation of the national classification scheme by lifting the profile of the computer games classifications and making the distinction between the advisory and legally restricted classifications clearer. The amendments will be of great assistance to all consumers, and particularly parents. The confusion currently experienced about the difference between the M and MA classification types should be addressed by the changes to the names of the classification types in conjunction with education activities by the OFLC and the use of consistent classification information by all sectors, including television. Amendments to state and territory classification enforcement legislation will closely follow the passage of this bill. Consequential changes to the National Classification Code have been agreed in principle by censorship ministers and will be formalised prior to the commencement of the bill. MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill 2004
287,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiThe member for Franklin in his speech congratulated the government, and I thank him for those worthy words. He pointed out that this particular bill is common sense. We note his view that there should be classification on movies continuously. This is an issue for the determination of markings. States and territories are committed to making amendments to complementary legislation, and the passage is expected in about 12 months. I also note that the member for Franklin suggested that there should be a discrete section in video stores for 15+ classified computer games. As the member for Franklin would be aware, video store placement of games is not an issue for the Commonwealth. Maybe that is a matter that could be taken up with the various censorship ministers in the states and territories. As a parent myself, I see a lot of worth in the suggestion made by the member for Franklin. The member for Cook, in his usual bipartisan way, welcomed the support of the opposition for this noncontroversial bill, and he supported remarks made by the honourable member for Gellibrand in favour of more frequent classification information on television. He noted that the X rating does not apply to computer games and saw that as being sensible. He pointed out that there had been appropriate consultation with the community-and there has been appropriate consultation. The government always prides itself on seeing what the community wants and trying to reflect community standards and attitudes. As the member for Cook said, issues related to TV codes of practice are not addressed by the bill. Comments by members in respect of classification information on television will undoubtedly be noted by Commercial Television Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In my view, it would not do any harm to bring some pressure to bear on those particular organisations. The important point has been made that everyone can use classifications to make viewing choices, especially with respect to violence. The member pointed out the extensive consultation that has taken place. I do note concerns regarding potential access to restricted products by children. This is actually a state and territory matter, and again this is one of those situations where we need the states and territories to act as well. The member for Moncrieff also noted the bipartisan support for the bill and spoke very strongly with respect to his support for its provisions. Parents use the classification system to make choices regarding films and computer games for kids. Parents are not in a position to make informed choices without classifications, and I think that is an important point to be noted. The shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, pointed out that Labor supported the bill. I think she said that it was a welcome development and a very useful tool, especially for parents. As the member said, this bill will give parents greater control and confidence about what is appropriate for their children, particularly young adults, to see, and particularly in respect of the legal restrictions about MA15+ material. As the honourable member noted, the government wants TV and the OFLC to keep discussing consistent classification messages for TV, films and computer games. Various industry groups, consumer groups and community organisations around the country have contributed to the policy and, on behalf of the government, I express my appreciation of their involvement. The collective wisdom that has emerged from those consultations has given effect to the provisions of this bill, which I now commend to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the paper. upon which Mr Snowdon moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added at the end of the motion: “and the Prime Minister’s and Leader of the Opposition’s speech of 30 March 2004 to the Prime Minister’s motion relating to ADF personnel in or around Iraq” a.m.)-I rise in support of the Prime Minister’s motion. As a nation, we have a proud tradition of sticking to the end, of seeing the job through. That is what we are doing in East Timor, that is what we are doing in the Solomon Islands and that is what we will do in Iraq, provided the decision remains with the coalition government. Sadly, the Leader of the Opposition has been caught on the hop on this issue and does not have the presence of mind to admit that he is wrong-and that tradition will not be the case if the member for Werriwa is the Prime Minister after the election later this year. As reported in today’s media, and in fact in the media all this week, an explosive mixture of Iraq, intelligence briefings, confidentiality, misrepresentation of intelligence and credibility has been catapulted into the public arena-and, with it, the Labor leader has been catapulted into his second major miscalculation on security in two weeks. The bottom line is that the Labor Party wants Australia to shirk its responsibility. That is a sad thing for the people of Iraq, but it is a shameful thing for Australia for a number of reasons. We have 850 ADF personnel in Iraq at the moment. They are undertaking an important and practical role. This role extends to the RAAF C130 Hercules contingent of 150 personnel providing vital airlift support. This air support is the principal means for Australian officials to enter and leave Baghdad, which currently has no commercial flights. As well, there are 80 air traffic controllers managing ATC service operations at Bagdad international airport-and, by all reports, doing a very good job. As well, 53 Army trainers are training the new Iraqi army, and no-one could doubt the importance of that. A Navy training team of 12 is also due in April. All these roles are vital to Iraq’s security, both present and future. The work of the Australian Defence Force is about creating a modern army in Iraq, focused on the defence of Iraq not tyranny. And, of course, we have HMAS Melbourne conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf, combined with RAAF AP-3C Orions, also conducting maritime patrols and support on counter-terrorism operations. As the shadow foreign affairs minister said, the people of Iraq need us at this time. In a nation that was governed by a tyrant for so long, our people-Australian men and women-are providing important training to the Iraqi police force. It is in the interests of democracy in Iraq that we train these people. It is also in our interests to protect our diplomatic personnel from attack by foreign and local terrorists operating in Iraq. It is even more important that we do not send a signal to terrorists that we are an easy touch-that we roll over when they, the terrorists, carry out their despicable acts. I am afraid that this is the message that the Leader of the Opposition has inadvertently sent: bully us, Australia, and we will back down; murder our citizens, the citizens of our allies and MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill 2004
288,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom,"Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (10.37innocent people, and Australia will give ground. It is a sad but not an irreversible position. The Leader of the Opposition needs to put politics to one side and do the right thing-admit he is wrong and get behind our troops based in Iraq. Remember, it is not the government but defence experts that have pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition’s position may have put our troops in great danger. For instance, Professor Ross Babbage said: In the wake of Madrid, words can be bullets. Any suggestion we are going to withdraw the troops before the job is done could give the impression Australia is weakening … Dr Alan Dupont of the Lowy Institute said: If the US, Britain and Australia all pulled out, then Iraq would descend into civil war and the terrorists would be able to say Western governments can’t stay the course … Finally, let me quote Brigadier Jim Wallace, who said: … I am concerned it could make our people more vulnerable. It invites the terrorists to think they’ve had a victory … I call on the Leader of the Opposition to reverse his position, but I fear he will not. The member for Werriwa’s stance on this issue is the start of the peeling away of the facade of policy credibility he has concocted. He had a hard issue to deal with; he failed the policy test and then resorted to accusing the government of playing party politics. Our troop commitment in Iraq is a weighty issue. It is not a populist, low-hanging fruit that the Leader of the Opposition can suddenly pick and use to ingratiate himself with the electorate. He has failed the policy credibility test on a number of fronts already. Firstly, it seems that he did not consult with his shadow cabinet and he was caught making policy on the run. He should have done the right thing and confessed to a mistake, but instead he spun the line that it had been policy for 12 months-all of which was news to the shadow foreign affairs spokesman. The member for Werriwa talks about honesty and integrity, he talks about re-engaging the electorate, but he has been caught out spinning to cover his own disregard for the process, to cover his own mistakes. Secondly, he claimed that he had received substantive briefings on the strategic environment in Iraq and the ADF’s role, but the government’s advice showed that this was incorrect and yesterday’s debate showed that the opposition leader was still unable to substantiate his claim that he had been thoroughly briefed on the matter. Perhaps he was briefed by Andrew Wilkie. Andrew Wilkie, of course, is ex-ONA and now a Green candidate in the next election. It is just like the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week: perhaps the policy was worked out with Bob Brown during the Styx Valley tour. In conclusion, now is not the time to withdraw into ourselves and hope that by pulling out of Iraq we will somehow be less of a target. Now is not the time to be pulling back on our responsibilities in the hope that someone else will do the heavy lifting. That is simply not the Australian way and we do not do that. If we leave we will diminish the solid international and hard-fought reputation that Australia’s Defence Force personnel have built up over the last 100 years. To leave will have the opposite effect to that intended, providing comfort for the likes of bin Laden who have attacked us first, not for what we do but for what we are. As Australian Defence Association executive director Neil James said, Mr Latham is offending the troops and their families by playing politics. Mr James said: MAIN COMMITTEE When you’re over there doing a job for the country, the last thing you want to hear is a politician of either side in Australia saying you shouldn’t be there. If the people we’re fighting think that we might pick up and go away, it’s more likely to increase the risk to Australian troops rather than decrease it. It is for that reason that I support the motion before us; it is for that reason that I support our troops in Iraq. It is for that reason that I send my best wishes and those of my electorate to our ADF personnel serving in Iraq and to their families. Resources, we do not have 850 personnel in Iraq; we have 850 personnel in and around the gulf. Many of those people are fighting the war on terror and would not be part of the group of people that we are proposing to bring back. For many months this government has continually misled the Australian public about just how many people we have in Iraq and how many people we are talking about bringing back. ask a question? member for Boothby? the war in Iraq, we talk about ‘American intelligence’ being a classic oxymoron, but I have another one: John Howard and honesty and integrity. That is one of the classic oxymorons of this debate. We have heard that we should not cut and run, but that is exactly what the Prime Minister intends to do if he gets elected at the next election. He will not be around to see everything through; he will be cutting and running and handing over to someone else. SoI find it ripe that the Prime Minister is saying that we need to stay in Iraq to see the job through, when, if he is elected again, he will be cutting and running himself. We know that he will probably be handing over to the Treasurer or-heaven forbid-the Minister for Health and Ageing. We know that because the member for Sturt said so publicly. I think he got a bit chastised for that, but we all know that he was telling the truth-the PM himself is going to cut and run. On numerous occasions I have stated in this place my objections to the government committing Australian Defence Force personnel to military intervention in Iraq, recklessly endangering their lives, based on the facade of disarming Iraq of their weapons of mass destruction. Of course, we are all now aware of how fictitious this reasoning was, yet the Prime Minister is still hanging his hat on the argument that Australian troops will be needed in Iraq for an indefinite period. He talks of ‘getting the job done’ and says that the ADF should not be withdrawn from Iraq until their respective tasks have been completed. Mr Howard talks of how it is the ‘Australian way to stay there and go the distance, to see it through’. Given that the government used the reasoning that sending troops to Iraq was to disarm Saddam Hussein of his supposed weapons of mass destruction, that was the job to be done; that was the government’s instruction. Although incorrect, it has now been finalised. The job has been completed, yet we see the government moving the goalposts on this issue. They are ducking and weaving, changing their reasoning for keeping troops in Iraq to suit their own political purposes.

293,Mr Wilkie,"Maybe at the end of my contribution, but not at the moment. In regard togovernment occurs in the middle of this year-perhaps the Labor Party announcement to bring the troops home by Christmas 2004-is just too sagacious for the government. They have had to politicise this issue because our policy is just too logical-they are jealous that they did not get to call it first. We have rained on their parade again, so to speak. This is the government’s hypocrisy at its best. Just a few days ago the Prime Minister was talking time lines of May or June for the withdrawal of ADF personnel-namely, air traffic controllers-from Iraq. The Defence minister also referred to May or June as the time that the air traffic controllers can look forward to rejoining their families in Australia. Mr Howard spoke of Australia’s military commitment in Iraq as being ‘of a quite short, specific duration’. It smacks of duplicity that we have had the most senior member of the Liberal Party and his Defence minister both referring to a timetable of troop withdrawal and yet this motion-‘that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal’-has been introduced. Mr Howard speaks of the increased threat to us of terrorism if we make an exit out of Iraq and how we ‘would be the very first to unconditionally break ranks if we pulled our people out’. He is creating a fictional crisis between the US and Australia if we pulled troops out of Iraq. He is again kowtowing to the Bush government. He thinks we will be letting down our close friend and ally and that removing troops from Iraq would not be in the long-term best interests of Australia. Didn’t our friend and ally let us down in the very first instance, dragging us into a war based on a false pretext and providing to Australian intelligence agencies incorrect and inconclusive information? I would say that in this case our ally was not acting in the long-term best interests of Australia. Mr Howard says: We would let down our allies and friends at the worse possible time in the worldwide struggle against terrorism and, worse of all in the immediate context, we would send the wrong signal to the terrorists not only in Iraq but around the world. The conflict in Iraq, albeit successful in capturing Saddam Hussein, has unnecessarily diverted Australian Defence resources away from the focus of capturing terrorists, of breaking up networks which will continue to develop and prosper without Saddam Hussein overpowering smaller fundamentalist groups. The Osama bin Laden and the Jemaah Islamiah networks in north Pakistan, Afghanistan and South-East Asia will flourish. The Australian Defence Force personnel should be in Australia defending our nation against terrorism, not based in Iraq defending that country. Mr Howard talks about how our reputation and standing on the world stage would be adversely affected if troops were withdrawn from Iraq. However, according to Dr Adel Abdul Mahdi from the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq it will not have any impact in Baghdad. He said: The sky won’t fall in. As long as we do not have chaos, their leaving by Christmas will not be an issue. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mr Amr Moussa, claims that the war in Iraq will cause ongoing havoc in the region. Mr Moussa said: The region is already engulfed in extreme anger and agitation because of what's going on in Iraq and what is going on in Palestine. More than that, it will sow havoc across the region. MAIN COMMITTEE The foreseeable future may hold a bloody civil war for the people of Iraq as these groups rally and gain potency. The new interim government has a tough task ahead. Australian troops, as part of the coalition forces, will have fulfilled their duty when that government becomes established. Just prior to the war in IraqI was in Egypt as part of a delegation. We were meeting the then head of the united Arab League. He pointed out to us that if Saddam Hussein was removed from power in Baghdad there would be chaos: there would be civil war and there would be all sorts of unrest because although Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator he actually kept in check many of those groups in the country that sought to cause terror and create instability in the region. Basically, that is what has happened. I am not a fan of Saddam Hussein. I am not a fan of Robert Mugabe. I have said in this place previously that it is interesting that we sent troops to Iraq and a cricket team to Zimbabwe. I believe that dictators, wherever they are, need to be dealt with. But they need to be dealt with a in a proper way and in a way that is not going to cause havoc in that country once they are removed. Unfortunately at the moment that is exactly what we have seen happen. The lives of the Australian men and women-and I am thankful that none has been lost in this deployment in Iraq-should not be treated with disrespect by the government. These people should be sent home as soon as possible. They have completed their duties once the interim government is in place midway through this year. In March 2003 the foreign minister said: We made it clear to the Americans right at the outset, early this year before the war began, that whilst we would make a contribution to the war ... we weren’t intending to stay on there for any period of time. Well, time is up: the war is over. ADF personnel have already been used in an international game controlled by the government and allies. These Australian men and women deserve to be returned to Australia to be reunited with their families, particularly at Christmas, given that since their deployment to Iraq they have served their nation in such a proficient and professional manner. As John Lennon and Yoko Ono sang in their happy Christmas song War is over, let us make it a good one for Australian Defence Force troops: a merry Christmas and a happy new year without any fear. Labor wants Australian Defence Force personnel back on our soil, protecting Australians in the war against terror. When it committed our troops to Iraq the government effectively made Australia a target for terrorism. Our troops should be here at home in Australia protecting Australian citizens. It is obvious. The opportunity to withdraw once the interim Iraqi government is established is perfect timing. The Howard government have got it wrong again. Labor calls for Australian national security and the war against terror to be a principal priority for our defence forces. We should have clear-cut and defined exit strategies for removing the Defence Force personnel when committing troops overseas so as not to leave them and their families languishing with indefinite time lines. I believe that the second part of the motion should be replaced and instead clarified timings provided for the withdrawal of Australian military forces from Iraq as soon as viable, preferably before the end of 2004. It is interesting that we have heard speakers from the other side go on and on about how withdrawing the troops would increase our risk of terrorism. I would like to remind members opposite that the war in Iraq was not about terrorism; the war in Iraq was allegedly about reMAIN COMMITTEE moving weapons of mass destruction, which we did not find. Now it is supposedly about removing a dictator. It was nothing to do with the war against terror. That is why I say that we have 850-odd personnel in the region and many of those personnel are involved in antiterrorism activities in the gulf. Labor would support those people staying there because they are fighting the war against terror. But in relation to Iraq we are saying that those people should be brought home when the interim government is there, and preferably before Christmas. Earlier the honourable member opposite suggested that he wanted to ask a question. I would be happy to answer that if he wants to ask it now. Age that a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Opposition initially said that it was all 850 troops that would be withdrawn. reports wrong. I would suggest this is probably just another case of that occurring. Clearly we now know the position. If we are to remove people, we are talking about the people in Iraq, not the people involved in antiterror activities. I suggest that we get these people home as quickly as possible before some tragic event, not of their making, happens in Iraq. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.58 a.m.)-Having the troops home by Christmas is very catchy. Hawker Britton have tested it and apparently it tests quite well. It is the sort of thing that they said in Britain in August 1914 when the British Expeditionary Force went across to France as part of the mobilisation in the First World War. Then, as now, it was clearly wrong to set an arbitrary deadline. We know with hindsight that of course the troops were not back by Christmas; they were back four years later. In Australia we did not say our troops would be home for Christmas. We said something different-that Australia would be there. These days people might feel that that was jingoistic or whatever, but it is actually the nature of the country that we have always been. Australia does have a proud record of standing up for what it believes in, of standing up for the rights of democracies and of standing against tyranny. In the First World War, the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam and, more recently, Iraq we have always been a tough country which stands up for what we believe in. There are really two parts to the debate we are currently having in parliament. They go to the heart of, firstly, the quality of the decision that the Leader of the Opposition made on the important issue of troop withdrawal and, secondly, the process of that decision. It has been very evident in the last week that talking about reading to children is easy, but actually making decisions on national security is hard. We have clearly seen the inexperience of the Leader of the Opposition in full view. The world in the last week has got a glimpse of how dangerous and erratic Mark Latham would be as Prime Minister of Australia. If the Labor Party regarded national security as a priority and as being serious, why on earth did it choose the current Leader of the Opposition over the member for Brand as leader of the Labor Party? The member for Brand is a former defence minister, a former Deputy Prime Minister, a long serving member of the cabinet National Security Committee and one of the most experienced members of the Labor Party in national security. It is inconceivable that the Labor Party would have behaved as it has over the last week under the leadership of the member for Brand. We all know that. So the day that the Labor Party elected the member MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Australian Defence Force Deployment
294,Dr Southcott,I wanted to ask the honourable member if he was aware of the report in the,194,Australian Defence Force Deployment
295,Mr Wilkie,"The government goes on and on about how newspapers are often gettingfor Werriwa over the member for Brand as Leader of the Opposition was the day it gave up any pretence of regarding national security as a priority. The government’s approach is to say that the troops should be withdrawn from Iraq when the job is done, when reconstruction is finished. This was the Labor Party position until the member for Werriwa went on Mike Carlton’s radio program. What are we talking about? There are 850 Australian troops in and around Iraq. This makes Australia a significant country in the reconstruction of Iraq. According to the Brookings Institution, after the United States, Britain, Italy, Poland, the Ukraine, the Netherlands and Spain, we are No. 8 on the list of countries. A withdrawal by Australia before reconstruction is under way, while the security situation in Iraq is still not good, sends a terrible message. We have been told by the Leader of the Opposition that the rationale for this, his defence of Australia doctrine, is that they are needed back in Australia. What are we talking about? Who is over there? The ADF includes 85 troops who are providing security to Australian civilians and the Australian representative office. This enables the ARO staff to move around Baghdad and Iraq to advance Australia’s political, security and economic interests in Iraq. That is pretty important. There is a contingent of 150 RAAF Hercules personnel, which is providing vital airlift support, which is the principal means for Australian officials to enter Baghdad. That is also important. There are 80 air traffic controllers managing air traffic control services and operations at Baghdad International Airport, and by all accounts they are doing a tremendous job. There are 53 Army trainers training the new Iraqi army. There are 12 people in a Navy training team, and there are 270 people on HMAS Melbourne conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf. There are also 160 people with the RAAF Orions conducting maritime patrols and support to counter-terrorism operations. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, agreed after he visited Baghdad that the protective security as it relates to the well-being of several hundred Australians still in country is of paramount importance. In the Australia Defence Force we have 51,000 personnel. The Labor Party, if I follow their argument correctly-and it does change day by day-are suggesting that bringing back a couple of hundred who are essential for the security of our officials in Baghdad is essential for the defence of Australia. From what? Are they seriously suggesting that 100 or 200 people will make the difference in the defence of Australia? And, if the ‘home by Christmas’ principle is so important, why aren’t we applying it to the 500-odd troops in the Solomon Islands and the 450-odd troops in East Timor? More importantly, this sends a very bad signal. Do not take my word for it; Paul Kelly in an article in the Australian, following the bombings in Spain, said: The legacy from Spain is that political parties, in government or opposition, must decide whether to lead or merely to follow public opinion as the war on terrorism penetrates the political culture of Western democracies. He concludes by saying: But in the interim the terrorists, utterly convinced that the West is weak to its core, will seek to divide the alliance and to intimidate its electorates. MAIN COMMITTEE If we look at similar countries to Australia, in Britain the approach of the Labour Party could not be different. Jack Straw said in mid-March that all countries-not just those who supported the campaign to topple Saddam Hussein-were the targets of terrorists. He went on to say, ‘We are under a threat from Islamic extremism and so is almost every other country in the world.’ No-one should believe that somehow, if you say, ‘I opposed the military action in Iraq,’ it will make you safer or exempt you as a potential victim. But the positions of oppositions are very important as well, because it is part of the objective of extremist terrorists in Iraq to get deep within the political culture of democracies. I read the words of British opposition leader Michael Howard. You could not find a greater contrast when reading the words of this opposition leader who has approached this with a bit of courage and a bit of resolve. On 19 March, Michael Howard said: If the terrorists hope they can gain their ends by perpetrating in Britain a similar outrage to that in Spain, their wickedness will be in vain. Whatever my disagreements with Tony Blair, any government that I lead will not flinch in its determination to win the war against terror, wherever it has to be fought. Can you imagine hearing those words from Australia’s Leader of the Opposition? If only! Michael Howard went on to say: Countries could not insulate themselves from terrorist attack by opting out of the War on Terror. We cannot buy ourselves immunity by changing our foreign policy. Apart from the moral cowardice of that position it can never work in practice. And we have seen similar comments from Senator John Kerry. He said that it would be wrong for Spain to withdraw their troops from Iraq at this point. A lot has been said about the chronology of this. I found on the ALP web site an interview that has not been taken off the web site-a doorstop interview with the Leader of the Opposition on 15 December at Ingleburn, following the capture of Saddam Hussein. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was ‘very good news indeed’, but ‘that doesn’t mean the work is over.’ The Leader of the Opposition was asked: What can the Australian Government do now? He said: Labor’s stance with our troops is that of course, at the first practical opportunity we want them back in Australia. But, there’s still work to be done, there’s still a task there, there’s no room for complacency. ... at an appropriate time of course the work of the Australian troops will be complete. That is basically the government position-that, when the work is done, the troops will return. It disgusts me that we have seen the Labor Party basically accept a demand by the leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown. We never saw this under the leadership of Kim Beazley. Bob Brown said, ‘A 10-point plan: I want the troops home by Christmas,’ and the Leader of the Opposition went walking in the Styx forest and, under pressure from Mike Carlton on 2UE, that was the position. And we have now heard from the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, that this was never part of the shadow ministry decision; that this was something made on the run. We also now know about the whole process of how this decision was made, and we know that it was made with very little information. There was a long debate in the House of Representatives yesterday regarding what was discussed at the various briefings with ASIS, DSD and so on. I have met the defence secretary, Mr Ric Smith, and the head of ASIS, David IrMAIN COMMITTEE vine, when they were ambassadors. I met Ric Smith in Jakarta when he was Australian Ambassador to Indonesia; and I met David Irvine in Port Moresby when he was Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea. IfI were to make a judgment about who I would trust, I would come down firmly on the side of the public officials-both of whom have been ambassadors to China and are our most senior people in the area of defence and foreign affairs. It is ironic that the great defender last week of the head of the AFP is now saying that ASIS and Defence have not put the full picture. The Leader of the Opposition has not said anywhere that he did actually receive a full briefing on our deployment in Iraq. He has never said anywhere that they discussed reconstruction in Iraq. We have heard a little bit about the shadow cabinet decisions; these all dated back to March or May last year. What we know is that over the last year the security situation in Iraq has not been good. To cut and run at this point is going to send a very bad message to the whole of the Middle East, because we now have a situation in the Middle East where something is going on, and the fall of Saddam Hussein has been perceived very differently in the Middle East from the way it has been perceived in Western democracies. Members of the opposition have to ask themselves: why did Libya give up its weapons of mass destruction programs? Why are we starting to see the first chink of light coming through in countries like Syria, Iran and so on? There is now an opportunity to see a Middle East which is going to be much more favourable for the long term to all Western countries rather then being a haven for extremism and terrorists. In conclusion, I support the motion of the Prime Minister in support of the troops. As always, Australian troops will return when the job is finished, and we should never cut and run. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.13 a.m.)-To listen to government members participating in this debate on the motion of the Prime Minister, anybody would think that the Leader of the Opposition had said that Australia should pull its troops out of Iraq tomorrow. To look at the plain facts, Christmas is nine months away. The handover to an Iraqi governing body is less than 100 days away. If the invaders cannot get it together by Christmas-in nine months time-to enable Iraqi governance in Iraq, it will just emphasise that this invasion was wrong and that the Prime Minister sent young Australian men and women to a war to search for weapons of mass destruction that were not there, based on dodgy intelligence reports. The original motion moved by the Prime Minister on Tuesday this week was as follows: That this House: (1) expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; and (2) is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams you will remember the fiasco in the House of Representatives on Tuesday because of that original resolution. The Prime Minister originally moved it to try and force the Labor Party to vote against the support of our troops. That is something that we in the Labor Party would never, ever do. Of course we support our troops. We support our troops wherever they are, whatever circumstances they are in. MAIN COMMITTEE The Prime Minister must have then had second thoughts. Maybe Arthur Sinodinos has got on the phone and said, ‘Look, this might not be the right way to go. In the electorate out there, Australians will be able to see that you are just trying to play politics with this situation.’ So what did we see in the House of Representatives on Tuesday? We saw the government’s bovver boy, the Leader of the House, call for a division on this particular motion, only to have the Prime Minister come rushing in to overrule him, saying, ‘No. This isn’t the right way to go. We should be allowing the Australian Labor Party to support the troops in and around Iraq.’ That was the right and proper thing to do on this particular occasion and I commend the Prime Minister for allowing us to do that. What do we have here? We have a motion that we in the Labor Party are voting against. The second part of the Prime Minister’s motion is that the Defence Force personnel should not be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary time should be set for such a withdrawal. As I indicated, it is less than 100 days until the handover to an Iraqi government but it is nine months until the end of December-nine months to enable Australian troops and other invading powers to get their act together to help the Iraqis in their governance. We should be supplying expertise in relation to electoral matters, to enable them to hold elections, and we should be supplying a physical presence on the ground to resurrect the basic infrastructure that we helped blow apart in Iraq, such as water and electricity supply, housing, hospitals, and schools for Iraqi children. We do not support the second part of this motion. That is why the Leader of the Opposition moved on Tuesday that the House: ... is of the opinion that: (a) Australia’s international security policy should have as its principal priorities: (i) the on-going war against terrorism; (ii) enhancing the security and stability of our immediate region; and (iii) the protection of Australians both at home and overseas; (b) any Australian Government committing Australian forces overseas should have a defined exit strategy for the eventual withdrawal of those forces; (c) the Howard Government has previously provided public undertakings to the Australian people ruling out a post-war Australian military commitment in Iraq altogether or else limiting that commitment to months, not years; (d) Australian military forces in Iraq should be withdrawn from that country as soon as practicable once Australia’s responsibilities as an Occupying Power have been discharged with the intention of returning our forces to Australia by the end of 2004; (e) Australia should continue to provide strong levels of humanitarian assistance and economic reconstruction assistance to the IraqiA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.18 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. (f) all members of this Parliament express their unqualified support for the courage and professionalism of the members of the Australian Defence Force deployed to Iraq and the surrounding region. As I said, this debate is happening less than 100 days out from the Iraqis taking control of the government in their own country. While this debate is happening here, and while the occupyMAIN COMMITTEE",194,Australian Defence Force Deployment
296,Ms Hoare,"The final point of the Leader of the Opposition’s amendment is:ing forces are still in Iraq, an independent commission into the 11 September 2001 attacks is currently being held in the USA. The national commission in America is made up of five Republicans and five Democrats and is due to report by 26 July this year. One of the people who have testified before the national commission in America is Richard Clarke. Richard Clarke was President Bush’s top counter-terrorism expert until he resigned in February 2003 after serving in every US government since the Reagan administration. He has been reported on US television, and one of the main quotes from Mr Clarke is quite telling. He said on American television: … to those who are here in the room, to those who are watching on television, your government failed you, those entrusted with protecting you failed you and I failed you. This continues on from David Kay, the weapons inspector, who said in January that he did not believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. This independent commission is investigating the 2001 hijacked plane attacks in New York and on the Pentagon. Mr Clarke said in his evidence that President Bush took him aside the day after the September 11 attacks and ordered him to ‘see if Saddam did this. See if he’s linked in any way.’ Clarke said he responded that al-Qaeda was responsible and that Iraq was not linked to the attacks. However, with Bush’s insistence, he agreed to look into the request and again found no cooperation between Saddam and al-Qaeda. So not only are questions being asked in Australia about the reasons why Australia invaded Iraq but there are also questions that are now going to be aired through the national commission in the USA. I want to also look at what has happened and what is happening in Iraq. I have already mentioned the devastation of the infrastructure of Iraq-the loss of power and water and the bombed schools, hospitals and homes-but I want to look at some of the statistics. I refer to an opinion analysis in the Newcastle Herald at the end of March by Phillip O’Neill, the Director of the Centre for Regional and Urban Studies at the University of Newcastle. He refers to an American newspaper and says: If you read it with a young son’s image in your mind you will be shocked, for the story reports that eight American 18-year-olds have been killed … Also dead are 34 American sons and daughters aged 19 years, 53 aged 20 years, 52 aged 21, 39 aged 22, 32 aged 23, 36 aged 24, 28 aged 25, 36 aged 26, 28 aged 27, and the list goes on. He goes on to talk about the US: … maintaining a massive military force of 1,400,000 active service personnel, about 150,000 of whom are in Iraq. By comparison, Australia’s defence forces number about 50,000 with about 850 in Iraq. So far, 545 young men and 17 young women from across America have died in Iraq, most of them since President Bush declared a cessation to combat on May1 last year. Most were young, denied a good shot at the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Phillip O’Neill concludes: Eventually history will judge if they have died in vain. Point (d) of the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition refers to Australia’s responsibilities as an occupying power. On 13 April, our shadow foreign affairs spokesman, Kevin Rudd, issued a statement that clearly defined Australia’s responsibilities as an occupying power unMAIN COMMITTEE der the terms of the fourth Geneva convention. In that statement he noted on behalf of the federal parliamentary Labor Party: The Geneva Convention confirms that as one of the three combatant states in Iraq, Australia is now one of the three “Occupying Powers” in Iraq. Australia’s status as an Occupying Power has been confirmed by the UN Secretary General, the British Government and even Prime Minister Howard (albeit with great reluctance). The convention outlines what precise responsibilities occupying powers have towards the civilian population of the country they are occupying. These responsibilities include the maintenance of law and order, the provision of health and hospital services to the local people and the operation of basic infrastructure such as electricity, water and roads. Australia’s responsibilities are therefore clear cut. We have nine months to ensure that we adhere to the Geneva convention that we participate in the building of infrastructure in Iraq. Government members have been talking a bit about the interview in which the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he would like, as a Labor Prime Minister, to see the withdrawal of the troops from Iraq and the troops in Iraq home by Christmas. We need to look at the transcript to get a correct understanding of that interview. The Leader of the Opposition said: We believe we have a responsibility to rebuild that country and as soon as that responsibility is discharged they should be back here. Hopefully that will be before the end of the year. Under a Labor Government our strategy is to get them back as soon as that responsibility is discharged, and you have got a sovereign hand over to a new Iraq Government. The interview went on, and the Leader of the Opposition said: Things can go wrong things can get pushed back a while, but our intention is to ensure that once the responsibility is discharged and that is at the time of the hand over to the new sovereign Government in Iraq then Australian troops will come back under a Labor Government. It is quite clear that we understand that things can go wrong in the takeover, that we have a responsibility to help the Iraqi people rebuild their infrastructure, that we have a responsibility to help the Iraqi people embark on a democratic process-which would mean providing electoral support-and that we have a responsibility to provide continued aid to help Iraq rebuild its community and its society. Hopefully all of that can be done over the next nine months by our troops that are already there. In that interview the Leader of the Opposition concluded: Yes well if that timetable of mid year is adhered to then that would be the case. That is, the troops would be home by Christmas under a Labor government. I spoke about the statistics of the war in Iraq and the number of US service personnel killed. As well as those, there have been 22 armed forces suicides to the end of 2003, 600 troops in America are absent without leave to avoid service in Iraq and a further 3,273 troops have been injured in the invasion of Iraq. I have a friend-Donna Mulhearn-who is well known in the Hunter region. During the war she was a human shield. She went back to Iraq to help the children that she befriended during that time and to set up an orphanage. In conclusion, I would like to quote from her email sent to us at the beginning of the year. This is what it is like on the ground and why we want our troops home by Christmas. She said: I tried to talk to the soldiers, to ask them how they felt, but they didn’t want to chat with me. They responded angrily prompting one bystander (who looked and sounded remarkably like me) to challenge MAIN COMMITTEE their presence here ... One soldier responded in no uncertain terms: “We don’t want to be here! I have a wife and a daughter at home, do you think I want to be here?” So the soldiers don’t want to be here. the Iraqis don’t want them here. It seems one point on which both sides here agree! It’s just a few politicians sitting behind desks on the other side of the world who want these young kids to risk their lives for a mission they admit they don’t understand. (Time expired) the Prime Minister’s motion and, in supporting this motion, show my strong support for the troops that are in Iraq and for the job they are doing. I repeat the motion that is before the House: That this House: (1) expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; and (2) is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal. That is all common sense stuff, and it is strongly supported by the government. Unfortunately, the second part of the motion is not supported by the opposition. But I certainly support it very strongly. In my view, this whole episode really shows up the incredible contrast between the government and the opposition. The government is operating extremely professionally, working with our defence forces, working with the people who understand these issues on the ground and working closely with all of the various agencies to do the best possible job. This very professional approach from the government is contrasted with the most incredibly amateurish, cavalier way in which the Labor opposition handles these very serious matters. This seems to be an ongoing thing. It does not matter whether it is our national security, the deployment of troops or any other portfolio policy area, at the moment we are seeing this amateurish, cavalier way in which policies and various announcements are being made. We saw it with the superannuation announcement, where a definitional error was put down by Mr Latham as, ‘Sorry, just a definitional error’-a mere $8 billion definitional error. I understand that the announcement that was hurriedly put together over the last couple of days and announced yesterday out in Queanbeyan, in my electorate, also has some question marks over it about some aspects of the funding. The constant amateurish way in which they are going about announcing and developing policy is in stark contrast to the way in which the government handles these issues. I think the opposition leader has in fact dug himself into a hole over this. To me it is obvious what his modus operandi has been with respect to many policies. He is picking out various issues that he thinks are popular out there in the broader community and throwing something in each day, deciding on a different one every second day. That is how we got this notion of ‘let us get the troops home by Christmas’. He probably thought, ‘That will run pretty well with the people out there in voter land. Everybody will want the boys back for Christmas.’ It was that sort of attitude. It was another one of those almost throwaway lines and populist comments, but it is backfiring. So now he is scurrying around trying to work out a MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Australian Defence Force Deployment
297,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (11.40 a.m.)-I would like to put on the record my support forway in which to get around that. Hopefully the people out there in voter land take notice of this sort of operation by the opposition and see that stark contrast that I mentioned. Sure, it sounded like a popular thing, but it was not. As we have seen from many people and many quarters around the nation since he made that announcement, even people who were opposed to our troops going to Iraq in the first place have come out very strongly, saying, ‘But they need to be there for however long they have to be there to do the job that is required.’ What is that job they are doing? It is quite varied. We have got in the order of 850 people, all told. There are 150 with the Hercules contingent. They are doing a variety of airlift work. In fact, the Hercules are the principal means for Australian officials to get in to Baghdad, because there are no commercial flights. We have got 80 air traffic controllers, managing those sorts of issues at Baghdad International Airport. There are 53 Army trainers, training the new Iraqi army. From the Navy training team, 12 will be there this month. They are going there in April. That is all incredibly vital to Iraq’s security right across the board. We have 270 on HMAS Melbourne, conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf, and we have got another 160 involved with the P3C Orions, conducting maritime patrols and support to counter-terrorism operations. So they are doing a very important job. The security aspect of personnel cannot be overstated. We have heard reports this morning of a number of American civilians who have been killed in an attack in a town near Baghdad-civilians there doing the job of helping to reconstruct Iraq. Those sorts of people need to be protected. Our troops are doing a variety of that sort of work. There are constituents from my electorate in Iraq. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has a contract for getting the power back on in northern Iraq. I certainly want to make sure that those people, from a company based in my electorate of Eden-Monaro, are secure. So we need to continue to do our job there. How important those key positions are came out last Friday at a hearing of the Defence Subcommittee here in Canberra on US-Australian relations. During those hearings a number of questions were asked of defence officials about the positions that our personnel are occupying in Iraq. Defence official after defence expert who gave evidence last Friday clearly stated the important role of those people in Iraq. There are issues here that I am sure the opposition leader has not even given one second of thought to, because a number of the Australian troops are holding down particular positions within the overall structure in Iraq that are vital to the work they are doing now. If you pull them out, somebody might be able to replace them-but not easily, because our people are so highly regarded. That is the first thing that would happen if you pulled them out prematurely. The second thing that would happen if you pulled them out prematurely is you would deny those people incredible experience. The defence officials, in the hearing last Friday, went through the very good experience that those people are getting. You can do all sorts of operations with our foreign allies, but there is nothing like being there amongst the real thing. The type of work they are doing will bode well for those troops in the future. The third thing that would happen if we pulled them out, and this was made clear as well in our hearings, is it may cause a problem in our relations with our allies. Our allies are relying upon those people to continue to do the jobs they are doing. If all of a sudden they are pulled out, our allies have to make arrangements to have them replaced, and that may not go down all that well. Our relationship with the US is clearly a vital matter that needs to be further deMAIN COMMITTEE veloped. At the moment, it is probably as high as it has ever been, and that is a very good position for Australia to be in, for our own future security. You would not want to do anything to compromise that. But the opposition leader’s announcement will certainly compromise that. Clearly, thought was not given to that decision. You would normally expect, before a person in that position made such a statement, a series of very detailed briefings from the full cross-section of people within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence. That has not happened. We know it has not happened. Various senior officials of those departments have written to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence telling them that those briefings have not happened. What has happened is that, out of some other briefings which were designed for a totally different purpose, the opposition leader claims that he is fully on top of all these matters. There is no way in the world that the standard briefings that he had after he became the opposition leader could in any way equip him with the necessary information to make the policy decision that he made. The opposition leader never intended that. When he became opposition leader he was asked, ‘What are you going to do about pulling the troops out?’ He said: ‘I can’t really make that sort of decision now; I have only just been elected. I need to get very detailed briefings. I will need to talk to these people and those people.’ You would expect that, at the very least, he would have talked to the Chief of the Defence Force and/or the Chief of Army and/or the Chief of Navy and/or the Chief of Air Force. But none of that has been done-not even involving some officials below those key personnel. It is an extremely amateurish way in which to develop foreign policy and I think he has been caught out something dreadful in that respect. In finishing, I reiterate that I strongly support our troops and I strongly support that they should do the job that they have been sent to do and not be pulled out prematurely until they complete that job. I want to see the great work that they are doing in Iraq continue to assist Iraq to form its democracy. I want to see the security of not only the Iraqi people but also the various personnel in Iraq maintained, including people from companies like the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, who are helping to get the power back on in various parts of Iraq. Let all the personnel in Iraq get on with the job without such pressure being applied to them by the Leader of the Opposition. closely to the member for Eden-Monaro. I wonder whether, on some future opportunity, he will inform the House of what he thinks of the recommendation by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the Howard government develop an exit strategy for peace monitors in Bougainville, which the government ultimately accepted. We are debating whether it is the Australian way to ‘cut and run’, as the Prime Minister describes it-that is, to leave before the job is finished. ‘It is a long standing philosophy,’ says the Prime Minister. That is interesting. In the first and largest deployment of infantry after the Vietnam War we sent troops to Somalia, and we did it the Labor way. What is the Labor way? We set a firm time line and we extracted those troops. Yes, it is true that in the Australian area of operation-not that we had a civilian infrastructure-elders pleaded with us to stay. What did the Prime Minister say about that? What did the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, say about that? MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Australian Defence Force Deployment
298,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.52 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I listenedI say to the member for Eden-Monaro and other members of the government: ‘Go and look at the Hansard record,’ because they said absolutely nothing. If you had listened to the Prime Minister today, you would believe that we should have had troops in there until we had a Black Hawk Down incident ourselves. But when Labor send troops overseas, we value the lives of our serving men and women. We understand that we put them in harm’s way-they are not playthings. They are not things to make political points out of. We need to value those lives. We need to value the service of those men and women. Labor administrations, whether you talk about Somalia-and it is exactly the case for Rwanda-go in there for a finite time, set goals, exit strategy and pull them out. Irrespective of whether our coalition partners, friends and allies want them, that is what we have done in the past. The Prime Minister says, ‘Oh, cut and run.’ I could accept that if he had at least once got up in the House and said, ‘We object to you pulling the troops out from Somalia,’ because, arguably, the job was not done. Somalia is still a lawless state. It is the same with Rwanda: we could have had troops there for years if we wanted to. I make this other point: we are an occupation force in Iraq. This is not some peacekeeping mission; we are an occupation force. That responsibility ends when a new civilian administration takes over in Iraq, as it should. We all have a vested interest in seeing a democratic Iraq-an Iraq that respects human lives, an Iraq free from tyranny. There is no argument about that, but at some point you have to transition from the troops being the primary force there to other forms of aid. What Mark Latham as the Leader of the Opposition has said is, ‘We’ll pull them out by Christmas.’ He did not say, ‘We’re going to pull them out if we have an opportunity on the day after the transition to a civilian authority.’ No, he said, ‘We’ll pull them out by Christmas.’ Even this government is pulling out some of the troops-some of the air traffic controllers-by May. That is your own defence minister saying that. Why are you cutting and running on air traffic controllers? But this is just a debate about hypocrisy. This is a debate about wanting to politicise what is in Australia’s interest. The other thing I wanted to say is this: there has been a lot of discussion this week about the role of intelligence agencies, whether or not you can have a briefing from an intelligence agency and canvass some issues. The first thing I wanted to say is that these things are confidential. It is quite usual for ministers to be aware that someone is being briefed but not the detail of the briefings. That is being politicised by the Prime Minister. Here we were in this Main Committee debating an intelligence report by the joint intelligence committee of this parliament-chaired by a coalition member-that was furiously leaked before it was ever tabled, and we all know that that leaking came out of a minister’s office. Here we have the Prime Minister writing to intelligence agencies seeking details of the briefing and then wanting to argue with the Leader of the Opposition about whether he had adequate briefings upon which to base his decision to withdraw the troops by Christmas. It is most extraordinary. In fact, even worse was an argument that the Minister for Foreign Affairs made saying that Mr Latham had received no briefings whatsoever, putting the Leader of the Opposition in a diabolical position. To say yes he would have had to acknowledge the possibility that they could have been intelligence organisations. Mr Latham tried to craft it in a way to protect those confidential briefings. He said it was the Department of Foreign Affairs-in other words, ASIS-and Defence officials. That was not good enough for the Prime Minister. He had to go to the heart of the matter and discover the Leader of the Opposition had had intelliMAIN COMMITTEE gence briefings. What better person, I might say, to get a briefing from than the head of the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and our geospatial organisation. This bloke heads them all up, and they are trying to say he would not have known. I am pleased to say that we on the joint foreign affairs committee received a confidential briefing from Defence intelligence. I cannot go to the nature and detail of that, but I can tell you we were talking about things 10 and 15 years out and assessing their views. I have to say I respect their views. In fact, I found some of them in accord with my own. I respect them. Not only did the Leader of the Opposition have these briefings but, more importantly, he acted consistent with Labor Party policy: that is, we do not have indefinite commitments. Look at the commitments this Howard government has made in relation to committing troops: Bougainville was open ended; East Timor was open ended. Yes, we are bringing them out; I admit we are bringing them out. But they were very open-ended commitments. There is no concern for the lives of our serving men and women, with no defined exit strategy developed. There is also the Solomon Islands. I hope to see the troops out by the middle of the year, to be frank with you. They have done an excellent job. But I do not think that if we bring them out by the middle of the year we are saying we can cut and run, because there is still a lot to be done in the Solomon Islands. The other thing I want to mention is the extraordinary circumstance of Howard government ministers outing directly and indirectly the role of ASIS. I have never seen that before. There are people in this place with longer memories than me, but I have never seen that before. It is embarrassing; it is a disgrace. I suppose if you have a government that is going to leak a joint report by the intelligence committee, it should not be unexpected. But it is clear that in this unprecedented outing of ASIS and its role and the location of its agents we are putting some lives at risk-all to score political points. Why can’t we just have a decent debate about the fact that the Howard government likes open-ended commitments and the Labor Party, when in government, has always had a defined term of commitment and gets the troops out to allow the country to transition? Why do we have to wait for a ‘Black Hawk Down’ in Iraq? That is what I would like the government members to tell me. When you get up to speak, tell us why we should have to have a ‘Black Hawk Down’ in Iraq. Isn’t it going to be better for Iraq to grapple with the difficulties that they have? Isn’t there a need, with a new administration in Iraq, for there to be a regional response there to the problems? The Leader of the Opposition has been flayed by government members because he said, ‘My priority is the defence of Australia. We should have our troops back here.’ We have sent an unprecedented number of troops to the Solomon Islands because it is a failed state. This government has tried to take some action in Papua New Guinea but is waiting for a joint resolution of that country’s parliament before it can become effective. But make no mistake about it: the jury is still out in PNG, and in terms of defence tasks that could be one of our significant jobs-I use a different word usually-and a significant challenge for us. But it is not the only failing state. The Philippines is now listed as a failing state. These will present monumental challenges for the region if we do not transform their status, if we do not get in there as a friendly country and help. Any one of them could become an issue at very short notice. The deterioration in the Solomons was quite dramatic. I might say, in response to ‘cut and run’, that it is interesting that the Howard government rejected a much earlier request MAIN COMMITTEE by the former Prime Minister for a battalion to go to the Solomons-‘No, we’re not going to send a battalion over there.’ That is why we need troops back here. In fact, if anything, it is fair to say that in recent times the defence forces have been so stretched by the requirements of the government, which they honourably fulfil, that they actually need to get back and work up their skills. I want to make this point: this government has adopted a policy not of one unit being deployed, one training up and one resting, but in twos. The Army sustainability model is based on the fact that one battalion is deployed and one is getting ready to leave, and when the one that has been deployed comes back it has to get ready to leave. That is a disgraceful state of affairs, particularly if we get involved in a long-term commitment like the one that East Timor represented for us, because we are supposed to be able to send a brigade and a battalion overseas, and the Army knows we cannot do it. We cannot sustain that in the long term. It is an utter disgrace. Therefore, we have to very carefully review each and every commitment we have. We should not place Australia and our region as a second-class priority when it comes to defence and security matters. Last but not least, what has happened to the war on terrorism? As the member for Bendigo said in an interjection, we have a one-man war in Afghanistan: a lieutenant colonel is the only Australian military figure in Afghanistan tracking down the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. What a joke, when we are unctuously lectured about the war on terrorism. (Time expired) and acknowledge the great contribution of the ADF troops and the other Australians serving in Iraq. It is a crying shame that the ALP, through cynical vote-grabbing manoeuvres, have put at risk the stature of Australia as a world leading country. Australians do not cut and run. Australians have always stood up and been counted when it really mattered. It matters now that we stay to finish the job. Unfortunately, the ALP have sent the wrong message abroad before. I have spoken to ADF troops who served in Iraq last year during the war phase. They were confronted by US troops who, having got their story from the US media, had a view that our country did not support our troops being there, fighting alongside the US troops. Fortunately, the Australian troops were able to explain that only some Australians supported the ALP, the Greens and this insular view. How tragic it is that this sort of propaganda has been circulating among our courageous troops. The majority of Australians know and understand the consequences of allowing a sadistic dictator who supported terrorists to be given a free rein to continue his evil ways. When I went for an interview for my second job, my future boss asked me if I ever made mistakes. My answer was: ‘It does happen sometimes.’ He was pleased with my answer, because everybody makes mistakes. As he explained, it is just as well, because if you cover up a mistake you will eventually be found out, and the more you try to hide the error the more problems are created, and eventually the situation becomes far worse in the long run. This is exactly what is happening to the Leader of the Opposition. He has compounded his mistake of ‘policy on the run’ to bring troops home by Christmas; he has shown the failings of his one-man-band leadership by ignoring the member for Griffith’s knowledge on the subject; he has shown his inability to be truthful to the Australian public-and, in doing all of this, he has put our troops, the people of Iraq and the reputation of Australia at risk.

299,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (12.08 P.m.),"I rise to support the Prime Minister’s motiontration of absolute inexperience does not bode well for Australia if ever this nation has the misfortune of having Mr Latham as Prime Minister. As Barry Cohen, a former member of the Whitlam government, has said in newspaper articles in my electorate, ‘The problem with today’s Labor Party is that they are all ex-unionists or ex-lawyers or ex-staffers, and they have no experience in a real-world job.’ This is exactly the case with the Leader of the Opposition. He has been a staffer to John Kerin, to Gough Whitlam and to Bob Carr. He has never had a real job, he has never worked in industry. The Australian government have indicated that Australian led air traffic control functions are likely to have concluded by the time the transition of power to the Iraqi authority occurs in mid-2004-this is of course once the 80 or so air traffic controllers can be replaced with a new, trained Iraqi army. Many would see this as a confirmation of our position: to stay until the job is done. Only the opposition leader, with his twisted rationale, could conclude that this reflects government hypocrisy. The Leader of the Opposition simply cannot be trusted. He failed to get advice from the head of Foreign Affairs on this issue. He failed to get advice from the head of the Department of Defence. He failed to get advice from the Chief of the Defence Force. In other words, the very people he said he would get advice from, the very people whose advice is relevant to forming a balanced judgment as to whether or not we should remain in Iraq, are the very people with whom the Leader of the Opposition has failed to liaise and of whom he has failed to ask the right questions. The Leader of the Opposition has not given any thought to this issue. Given the likelihood that the current levels of violence being experienced in Iraq will continue past July 2004, the withdrawal of approximately 90 personnel performing escort and protection duties would make the conduct of general business by other Australian government personnel in Iraq extremely hazardous. Without the escort and protection provided by combat personnel, other Australian government personnel are likely to face the risk of assassination unless a similar escort, by other coalition or Iraqi forces, can be provided. Even if such a level of escort could be provided by other international contingents, these other Australian government personnel would need to adjust their movements to accord with the timetables under which security could be provided by these other contingents. Such adjustments would undoubtedly hamper the current speed with which Australian officials can move about in Iraq. Allowing this to occur would also require some surrender of Australian dignity. How could the Leader of the Opposition’s policy not allow for this? Because his is a reactive policy-it is bad policy and, as I have said before, it is policy on the run. The greatest threat to terrorists is a free, independent and democratic Iraq. Australia plays a critical role in ensuring that Iraq completes its transition from tyranny to democracy. Some 53 Australian Army and 12 Navy personnel are helping to build a new state through the training of the Iraqi defence force and the Iraqi police. How can we leave these budding forces before they are fully trained? How can we leave Iraq before our job is done? The Labor Party knows that the return of the 850 Australian defence personnel assigned to Iraq would not substantially alter the broader tasks and capabilities undertaken by 51,000 Australian Army and Navy troops in the Australian region. Comments by the Labor Party and the Greens that Australia, with its large landmass and small population, needs its Defence Force personnel at home defy the obvious, fundamental differences between secondMAIN COMMITTEE generation warfare and today’s war on terror. Indeed, we heard the member for Chifley talk about there being no exit strategy-no fixed time frame. There is no time frame for terrorists. Challenging the asymmetric threats posed by terrorist networks cannot be done through battlefield linearity and the reliance on masses of men poised near the border, awaiting invading armies. That is what you did in the old days; that is what happened in the past. The ways of war need to be revised for this new kind of terror-it knows no bounds. Intelligence is vital. The war against terror is fought primarily with good intelligence. Look at what has just happened in Britain. The British intelligence forces have found that six Britons who were going about their daily lives normally were actually terrorists. They uncovered quite a lot of bomb-making materials. Britain surely has thousands and thousands of army personnel in Britain, as they do in Iraq, but it was intelligence that uncovered this unseemly act about to occur. Indeed, even in Madrid it was stated in a newspaper article that the vehicle carrying the explosives was stopped due to a traffic offence. Because the vehicle was not reported stolen, the police in that country let them go, to go on to do their evil thing. An army was not there to stop them-an army could not stop them. The problem is that the Labor Party does not understand the simple ways of terrorism. It does not understand that terrorism knows no boundaries and that to remain insular is not to remain safe. If we are to protect Australia from the long term threat of terrorist attack, we cannot walk away from our responsibility. Spain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, France, Germany and Russia have all experienced al-Qaeda attacks. This is not because they were in Iraq, for not all of them were. This is the wrong time to get out of Iraq. Withdrawal from Iraq may raise doubts in US circles about broader Australian willingness to commit military to the war on terror in areas beyond our immediate region. This may have a twofold impact. Australia may forgo the opportunity to interdict terrorist operations in havens which are intended to target Australia directly. It may also raise doubts in US minds about the value of the ANZUS alliance. Why can the Leader of the Opposition not see that this is a highly unstable time to turn our backs on our friends and allies in the fight against terrorism? If Australia and the rest of the world react wrongly to the tragedy in Madrid and rush to withdraw our defence forces from Iraq before the job is done, what kind of message is going to be sent to the terrorists who thrive on weaknesses? The Leader of the Opposition has not only made a fundamentally bad decision about the deployment of our forces in Iraq but also given the worse impression possible. He is saying that, if enough pressure is applied by terrorists, he will bow down to them by changing Australian policy accordingly. We need to be emanating the message that Australia does not bow to terrorism. Terrorism, far from weakening the resolve of this country, merely strengthens our resolve to finish the job and make the world a safer place. I conclude by asking the Leader of the Opposition to stop compounding bad policy with misinformation to the Australian public, to acknowledge that Australia as a nation has a political and moral obligation to finish the job in Iraq and to cease engaging in cynical, political, poll driven populism. We Australians have never been ones to shirk our duty and responsibility when it comes to international events. We always stay until the job is finished, and Iraq is no different. We cannot walk away from building a new Iraq. We cannot pretend the threat of attack does not exist. Let us work with our friends and allies to fight against this war on terror. MAIN COMMITTEE Prime Minister’s motion relating to the Australian Defence Force personnel in and around Iraq. As I told the House during my truncated contribution to the debate on Tuesday, I support our troops. No-one should have any doubt that the Australian Greens and all Australians support our troops. However, I do not support this motion, which the Prime Minister has turned into a cheap political stunt by tying support for our troops in Iraq to the question of their eventual withdrawal. The call for Australian troops to be withdrawn from Iraq is one which the Greens have been making since last year, and we are not alone in that. Indeed, my colleague in the other place Senator Bob Brown included the call in the 10-point plan titled ‘How to make Australia a proud, compassionate, independent nation’, which he offered publicly to the opposition leader on 2 December last year, following his appointment. The Greens are not alone in calling for the withdrawal of troops. For example, there is a growing campaign in the United States calling for exactly the same thing. In that regard I draw the attention of members to a rally held at Fayetteville, Fort Bragg, North Carolina on 20 March 2004, just a couple of weeks ago. That rally was, like many rallies, rather emotional. It was addressed by a retired US Special Forces Master Sergeant, Stan Goff. I would like to read out what he told the rally, as it is relevant to the motion now before us, I believe: The Bush administration is a gangster administration, and they have used gangster tactics at home and abroad, and they have signed our names to their crimes, and they have spent our treasure on their crimes, and they have spilled out children’s blood and the blood of the children of others to commit their crimes, and we have had-by God-enough. And we are not going to sit idly by and pretend about this. We are not going to pretend that we haven’t heard that John Kerry’s only criticism of this war is that it isn’t being fought competently. We are not going to pretend that this is not about oil. We are not going to pretend that this was an intelligence failure. We are not going to pretend that this is something we can change by being civil or by being obedient. We will not be civil with gangsters, and we’d better learn to quit obeying them. Because it is our obedience that co-signs their crimes, and it is our silence that will make us complicit. So we will not be silent, and we will not be obedient, and we will not stand down-no matter how long it takes, no matter the cost, no matter the effort, because we are fighting for our children and our grandchildren who we will not surrender to gangsters. We are not going away. This may be called the instant gratification society, but hear us right now, George Bush and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and John Kerry for that matter-we are not an instant gratification movement, and we are not here to make deals with the lives of our children or the children of others. NOT ONE MORE DAY. NOT ONE MORE DIME. NOT ONE MORE LIFE. NOT ONE MORE LIE. So it was a very impassioned address by US Special Forces Master Sergeant Stan Goff, and I make no apology for drawing it to the attention of honourable members. You see, there is more. The New York Times of 26 March 2004 reported that 75 per cent of US soldiers in Iraq say command leadership is poor and lacks concern for troops, while 52 per cent say morale is low MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Australian Defence Force Deployment
300,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (12.18 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on theor worse. And this is the United States’ war. The troops, and their families, are sick of the war and want to go home. The movement is growing and it is becoming a political threat to President George W. Bush’s re-election chances. Perhaps that is why the Prime Minister is so reluctant to commit to an exit strategy: he is still supporting his ‘great and powerful friend’. I therefore reject the Prime Minister’s motion as it was presented to the House, relating to Australian Defence Force personnel in and around Iraq. We had a vote on the first part of the motion, for which there was unanimous support, but the second part of the subsequently split motion I must say we still reject. The Prime Minister is the same man who told us the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but he now says it was about regime change. The cold, hard truth is that it was about neither of those issues. It was about oil. The rest of the world is coming to realise that. We knew at the time the war started that that was also at the heart of it. Consider what Canada’s former Ambassador to the United Nations wrote in the Toronto Globe and Mail on 19 March this year: Rarely in life is a decision so quickly and thoroughly vindicated as Canada’s decision to opt out of the war in Iraq. A year later, the stated casus belli has evaporated. No weapons of mass destruction have been found, despite the best efforts of more than a thousand American weapons inspectors with free rein. No connection to al-Qaeda has been established. No persuasive argument endures about the urgency of the US. need to act. … … … The most obvious consequence is that the United States and its posse are caught in a morass. They cannot end the occupation precipitously without triggering a civil war and undoing the good they have done in removing Saddam Hussein. They cannot stay in Iraq without losing more soldiers and more money. Echoes of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the Iraqi toll also rises. As one … ambassador at the United Nations put it, the Americans have swallowed a razor and nothing they do now will be painless or cost-free. The cost to US. interests extends well beyond Iraq. In December, the US. Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World, headed by former US. ambassador to Israel and Syria, Edward Djerejian, reported that “the bottom has indeed fallen out of support for the United States.” According to a poll released this week by the Pew Research Centre, international discontent with the United States and its foreign policy has intensified rather than diminished since last year. In some Muslim countries, support for the United States is in the single digits. Pew found little change in the overwhelmingly negative attitudes of countries toward the Iraq war. In Britain, support has plummeted from 61 per cent last year to 43 per cent now. The Globe and Mail/CTV News poll found that two-thirds of Canadians believe that President George W. Bush “knowingly lied to the world” about Iraq. Nor are all the critics foreign. The war, according to a report of the US. Army War College, was a strategic error, a distraction from the war on terrorism. Beyond the neo-cons, few see terrorism as monolithic. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that weapons of mass destruction were not an immediate threat, inspections were working, the terrorism connection was missing and war was not the best or only option. In the face of all that, our Prime Minister wants our troops to stay in Iraq. That is impossible to comprehend. The same man who told us that our troops would be committed in Iraq for months, not years, now wants an open-ended deployment, and we cannot support that. We must not allow the Prime Minister that, despite our unswerving support for the troops. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Bring Them All Home Now
301,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.27 P.m.),"I move:That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Roads: Calder Highway ment’s falsification of its promise of 1997 to fund the duplication of the Calder Highway. I refer to the ludicrous answers of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to my questions on notice. This government not only has betrayed the Calder Highway but also is butchering history to legitimise its atrocious performance. This government, after winning the 1996 federal election, promised under its Roads of National Importance program to go fifty-fifty with the Victorian government to duplicate the Calder Highway all the way to Bendigo. It has repeatedly promised to match the funding put up by the state government for each section of the work. It distinctly stated two years ago that the finishing date was originally set at 200203. It failed. Through its candidate for Bendigo in the last federal election, Mr Maurie Sharkey, a decent man who was misused by this government, the Howard government specifically promised Bendigo to complete it by the Bracks government’s deadline of 2006. Now it wants to wreck that too and blow out the completion date to well beyond 2010. Bendigo region people know this government by its appalling Calder history and will not trust any panic promise it cooks up to restart funding the Calder on the way to the next election. This road is now notorious: ‘John Howard’s Calder Lie Way’. He has never delivered on it, and what he promised to deliver he never will deliver. All his Calder promises have crashed. It is a city-centred government that wants a two-class road-a fast duplicated highway all the way from Melbourne to Kyneton and then a goat track from Kyneton to Ravenswood. That section of the Calder would just be a passing lane if it were put next to any of the other major highways in Victoria. Last year, for the first time, the transport minister, Mr Anderson, in reply to my question, made the outrageous claim that the Howard government had already fully met its commitment to the Calder and that it not provide any RONI funding for the Calder north of Kyneton. That claim is rubbish. The original commitment was duplication all the way to Bendigo. It took the minister 142 days to answer this week my further question to him about the government’s commitment. He now claims that the Howard government’s commitment was not to duplicate the Calder from Melbourne to Bendigo but merely to ‘begin the task of upgrading the worse sections’ between Melbourne and Mildura. This is yet another of the coalition’s Calder copouts. Note the language: only to begin the work and not to finish it, and only what he chooses to list as the worse sections. He talks as though he promised only to fill up the occasional pothole along the Calder. Maybe he promised only to start to fill them up. Maybe he meant only to fill up the worse potholes. If he undertook to fix the worse, why has he pulled out of funding the appalling long sections between Kyneton and Ravenswood? The biggest pothole is in his promise: it extends all the way from Kyneton to Ravenswood. The total cost of the Calder duplication, as originally promised by the Howard government, adds up to around $530 million. The Howard government has abandoned the Calder after paying just $100 million-17 per cent of the total cost-instead of the $265 million it should have paid under the RONI agreement. It really rankles with my electorate that the Bendigo region is the only major provincial region in the state without a duplicated highway to Melbourne. It is the only major provincial centre in Victoria that cops the Liberals’ CityLink entry tax to drive into Melbourne and then pays a GST on top of that. This government refuses to MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Adjournment
302,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.27 P.m.),"I rise again to express my disgust at this governduplicate the Calder to Bendigo, but it has duplicated the road taxes paid by Calder motorists driving to Melbourne. It is giving nothing back to the Calder. Where did the money go? The Howard government stole it from the Calder to pay for the Scoresby Freeway. They robbed the Calder to pay for a RONI-come-lately. Even now, now that it is not needed for the Scoresby, this miserable government will not give it back to the Calder. What a contempt they have shown for central Victoria, as they have set out to sabotage the Bracks government’s work on the Calder and let them go it alone. This is another of their petty wars on the state governments. They are happy to crush the Calder in central Victoria just for the joy of sniping at governments that do the jobs that the Liberals and Nationals will not do. There is not a single cent of federal money being spent on construction work on the Calder. The last new federal funding was before the election in 2001. Since then, there has been a five-year federal freeze on new Calder works and nothing to match the $70 million put down by the Victorian government for the next major stage. We all know that the Howard government originally promised to complete the Calder to Bendigo, because the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ answer shows that they allocated $3.9 million to help plan works from Kyneton to Ravenswood. Why would they plan a project that they were not going to take on? He says that one of the two studies is finished, so why was there nothing in last year’s federal budget for this year and nothing at least for another three years, to 2006-07? I questioned the minister 142 days ago on who made the funding decision to kill the Calder, who approved it and when. He will not say. He will not say, because the decision is so disgraceful that nobody will own up to it. The Howard government decided well ahead of the state election in 2002 to dump the Calder. Their crocodile tears over the Scoresby Freeway since last year were just another bogus excuse for backflipping on the Calder. It just shows the hypocrisy of the Treasurer’s wailing over promises on the Scoresby Freeway while he himself welches on his promise to the Calder. Why didn’t he speak up against Jeff Kennett’s CityLink tolls on Calder motorists when they introduced them on the Tullamarine Freeway? Fuel: Ethanol five questions specifically attacking Manildra and its owner, Dick Honan. While the questions were openly and fairly answered, their attempt to denigrate Manildra and Dick Honan only confirmed that the Labor Party intend to bring about the demise of Manildra. So preoccupied are they with Dick Honan that they are prepared to destroy the ethanol industry and the jobs that it brings. So preoccupied are they with their political needs that they have effectively said that Manildra, all of its employees and all those who depend on the business can go to hellthis from the member for Fraser, a member who proudly displays his trade union credentials. The workers can cop it on the chin as long as the political ambitions of the Labor elite are satisfied. The fact that Manildra donated to both parties seems to have become irrelevant. Rather, the preoccupation is how much was donated and that somehow this is encouraging favourable treatment as a result. It is not my purpose to argue the pros and cons of these assertions. WhatI want to point out is that a whole industry is about to be sacrificed by the so called champions of the workers and the environment. Here we have an ex-trade union leader willing to sacrifice 260 direct jobs at the Bomaderry mill, with another 60 to 70 contractors jobs and a downstream effect on another 1,700 jobs. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Adjournment
303,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.32 P.m.),"Last week during question time the opposition askedThe opposition spokesman on agriculture and fisheries is equally bereft of forward thinking. He supports the attack and thereby supports the demise of Manildra, the jobs and an opportunity to develop an alternative fuel industry. This is especially confounding since Labor constantly harps and whinges about the loss of jobs, the loss of industry. Here they are, doing exactly what they are railing against. What utter hypocrisy! What utter spivs! I doubt whether either of these two honourable members have been to Manildra and seen for themselves exactly what the industry is about. If they had, they would have gained a better appreciation of the negative effect of these tactics they are pursuing. A further irony is that most of these endangered employees are union members themselves. I just hope that their Labor representatives here in parliament have gone to the trouble of letting them know that they were playing with their livelihoods. If not, that only compounds the complete shallowness of this action. If not, then I would urge all of the unionised employees of Manildra to put pen to paper and let the honourable members know of their displeasure, tell them that they are not willing to be the pawns in their game, that they want their jobs and that they have families to support and mortgages to pay. I want to reiterate my position on the ethanol industry and Manildra. I have spoken before on this subject in the House and, for the benefit of those that want to destroy the industry, I think it is necessary to repeat the message. Let me repeat a statement. I made as recently as 19 February this year: I am not afraid of promoting ethanol against those who seek to question its reliability. When people look at the facts on ethanol, it is obvious that the campaign against it seeks to play on people’s fears. Surely, if people were told the truth about the virtues of ethanol in fuel it would not be hard to appreciate the benefits of a clean-burning additive. In fact, it is the only fuel additive you can actually drink. Compare this to the harmful carcinogenic additives contained in other petrol ... Labor’s campaign has made it hard enough for Manildra to sell ethanol ... If Manildra cannot shift its products, it stands to reason that it cannot continue. That statement holds true even more now, as Labor’s deliberate and dishonest campaign escalates. They create a scare campaign and destroy the reputation of fine Australians and their companies all in the name of getting at the government. It is called point scoring. Given the level of ignorance that prevails in the Labor Party on ethanol, as evidenced by some of the debate we have heard, it is not surprising to see them resorting to a hysterical fear campaign. That is what they are good at. They have no policies. What are their plans to promote ethanol in Manildra and Bomaderry? That takes creative ideas and it takes hard work, and they are not up to that. Instead, they scare the people, because what would they know? They think people are stupid enough to believe what they have to say. I meant it then and I mean it now: this is pure politics, and the so-called party of the workers just does not seem to care. AgainI issue an invitation to the honourable members on the other side to come and see Manildra for themselves, to see the jobs that are involved, and to see the work they do. Come and speak to their families about how you are attacking this ethanol industry and see how it affects them. Hasluck Electorate: Kalamunda District Community Hospital Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (12.36 p.m.)-There is an important public meeting being held in my electorate of Hasluck this Sunday concerning Kalamunda District Community Hospital. At the outset I wish to record my continuing support for the hospital, its staff and the services they provide. They perform a vital function in our local area with care and with friendship. I MAIN COMMITTEE am a strong advocate for the redevelopment of the hospital and a supporter of the proposal by local doctors to establish a new medical centre co-located on the hospital site. The local community has been kept waiting by respective state governments of both political persuasions since 1998 for the redevelopment of the hospital. Redevelopment of the hospital is necessary to ensure that our hospital can cater for the health requirements of the local community both now and into the future. It is critical for everybody involved to be bipartisan. Our motivation should be: what is in the best interests of quality health care services for our community? I want to acknowledge the hard work of the local Kalamunda hospital redevelopment planning group-consisting of representatives from the community, the Perth and Hills Division of General Practice, the Kalamunda medical advisory committee and the Eastern Metropolitan Health Service-who have worked over many months to develop an updated concept plan for the redevelopment of the hospital, which includes the proposed medical centre. The planning group was formed by the state government to progress the redevelopment of the hospital, and they have done a good job. One area of disagreement that has become apparent is in the area of obstetrics. The obstetric service provided at the hospital is a very good one, with excellent clinicians and-might I say-even better midwives. Many locals fondly talk of their own babies being born at Kalamunda hospital; in some cases generations of families started out at Kalamunda hospital. I want this service to continue, safely and responsibly, for our community. However, I understand from my discussions with various stakeholders that there are clinical concerns about the obstetrics service into the future. Appallingly high medical indemnity costs for GP obstetricians and a looming work force shortage of obstetricians have limited the number of specialist obstetricians available. In addition, there has been a state-wide review of obstetric services that has questioned the clinical safety and responsibility of continuing obstetric services in smaller hospitals such as Kalamunda. I would urge clinicians to address these concerns urgently to clarify what is required so that there is an appropriate clinical coverage to ensure the retention of a safe obstetric service at the hospital. In addition to the direct concerns of the hospital, the main area of health concern is the ability of Hasluck constituents to access appropriate GP services. The number of GPs practising in Western Australia is decreasing and the Western Australian health department has said that an additional 600 to 700 GPs are needed for Western Australians to have the same per capita level of access to GP services as other Australians. Though it has been widely acknowledged that Australians living in rural and remote areas have great difficulty accessing GP services, less recognition has been given to the situation in outer metropolitan areas. I have consulted local doctors and have been advised that the pressure on remaining practices and the doctors concerned is unsustainable. Concerns have also been raised by constituents regarding their inability to access a GP who bulk-bills. Over the past three years there has been a decline in bulk-billing of 12.4 per cent in my electorate to just 69.2 per cent in December 2003. This decline in bulk-billing is already causing some constituents to delay seeing a doctor-which has implications for their health status: that is, they get sicker before seeking assistance-and/or to present at public hospitals for care. This is the major reason why I am supporting the innovative proposal for a new co-located medical centre with investment from the private sector and the federal government. I note that MAIN COMMITTEE the federal government, unlike the state government, has not given a commitment to supporting the proposed medical centre. I am astounded that the federal government short-changed Western Australia in the recent Commonwealth-state health agreement. In 1996, the Commonwealth share of health expenditure in Western Australia was 47 per cent. By 2002 it had fallen to 41 per cent. I agree with the observations of Mike Broad, member of the legislative assembly and the state Liberal shadow health spokesperson. He said in state parliament on 19 November last year: Large amounts of money are being spent on primary health care by the State that ought to be paid for by the Commonwealth or provided more cheaply by a more adequate health care service or a secondary hospital closer to where people live. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for the Kalamunda Hospital and the colocated medical centre. I further call on all levels of government and the local medical community to work together in the best health care interests of my constituents. (Time expired) Environment: Kyoto Protocol able members will be aware that it is now considered unlikely that the Kyoto protocol will be ratified, certainly not in the immediate future, as Russia, one of the critical signatories, has failed to sign. With the United States declaring its intention not to ratify, it remained imperative that four of the major players, including the European Union, Russia, Japan and Canada, ratify for it to come into effect. It was intended that at the October 2003 meeting in Moscow this would occur but Russia is yet to ratify the protocol. From the Australian point of view there is also a concern regarding the Kyoto protocol that it may be a flawed mechanism in that it fails to ensure that those countries which are among the largest producers of greenhouse gas-in particular in our region the industrialised economies of India and China-are included within its ambit. It is important, though, that we should still address the concerns about climate change in a way that is going to be sensitive to real concerns and at the same time ensures that Australia does have a policy that is driving towards a successful outcome. I want to propose briefly a 20-year proposal to address those challenges. The need for such a long-term approach is because national, regional and international solutions to the challenges are necessary and a long lead time is appropriate. There should be five-year goals, with the conclusion being that at the end of the period Australia will have led the world in bringing forward a program of legislative and administrative reforms that may even achieve a better outcome than Kyoto, particularly if through regional cooperation the other economies I have mentioned, which are responsible for 75 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, are included. One way of proceeding, I suggest, is that government should develop a comprehensive and coordinated proposal based on the current greenhouse gas reduction programs with some minor adjustments, such as phased introduction of natural gas refrigerants as replacements for CFCs, but specifically targeting the critical areas of stationary energy, transport, fugitive emissions, industrial processes, agriculture, land use change, forestry and waste. It is also appropriate within the target period, providing that international cooperation does occur, that Australia not be left outside the carbon trading opportunities, especially in the area of electriMAIN COMMITTEE",212,Adjournment
304,Mr King (Wentworth) (12.41 P.m.),"On the question of climate change policy, honourcally generated carbon. These can only be addressed through legislative reforms, having regard to the need for a comprehensive Commonwealth-state agreement on such matters. Within 10 years it is possible for Australia to have greenhouse gas emissions below those of the Kyoto projection rather than take the averaging approach which has been adopted by some. By that date, through APEC and other regional institutions-and I commend the government for taking initiatives so far through the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the APEC Energy Working Group and the International Partnership for Hydrogen Energy-it is possible for Australia to have adopted the position along the lines I have suggested. It can include China and India as long as appropriate negotiations have been conducted with the governments of those countries. The 15-year stage would see Australia not only as a world leader in its own right in achieving climate change outcomes but also as a regional player in this internationally important area of policy development, with a view by that stage, in cooperation with our regional neighbours and through APEC, through a similar-minded group of nations to develop a world alternative to Kyoto. The 20-year stage, I suggest, would see a new world approach more comprehensive, more workable and fairer than Kyoto, based on reasonable commitments and sound outcomes for all countries prepared to address climate change issues. By stages such a program is practical and achievable. It should be truly universal and actually address the critical issues necessary to bring about climate change instead of being a political document flawed by north-south language. Family Services: Family Payments Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.46 p.m.)-I rise today to speak about Labor’s new baby care payment. This fantastic proposal is an excellent start to helping family balance their work and family life commitments. It leaves the United States as the only OECD country not having paid maternity leave and brings us almost up to scratch with most of the other OECD countries, where paid maternity leave has been an absolutely standard provision-for many decades in some cases. Some purists, I suppose, would argue that this is not paid maternity leave; it is also being paid to women who are not in the work force at the time of having a child. But what we need to remember about the modern condition is that women constantly move in and out of the paid work force, particularly in their child bearing years. It would have seemed unfair not to pay this baby care payment to someone who may have been in the paid work force for five years and taken a year off and who, probably when her children are a little older, will return to the work force but, because of the anomaly of not being in the paid work force on the day she leaves on maternity leave, would not receive the payment. That would have been very unfair indeed. The baby care payment will be worth $3,000 in 2005. It can be taken as a payment over 14 weeks or people, if they wish to, can extend the payment by receiving a smaller amount every fortnight over 12 months, still adding up to $3,000 in 2005. It will rise to $5,380 by 2010. This is very important because it will then be the after-tax equivalent of 14 weeks of pay under the federal minimum wage and will truly represent what it is supposed to be, which is paid maternity leave. It is important also to remind people that it is tax free. It is means tested, but MAIN COMMITTEE its cut-out is very high so that 90 per cent of women having children will be eligible for the payment. As I have said, this is one very important measure in balancing work and family and it has been received very well. Pru Goward, who has never been a particular friend of the Labor Party, has welcomed it. She has said: Let’s hope this proposal is the beginning of a policy bidding war, not the high point. There is a backhanded compliment. I really hope it is the beginning of a bidding war. But for three years the Prime Minister has been talking about balancing work and family and we are yet to see something from him. Yesterday we heard accusations that this was an idea that the Labor Party stole from the government. The government has had a substantial amount of time to do something. At the last election the Prime Minister said that balancing work and family would be his key issue for this term of government. We have heard nothing about paid maternity leave from him. He raises it and says, ‘We’re thinking about it,’ and then it is dropped again. But the idea that we would have to steal policies from the government on balancing work and family is laughable. The ACTU have also praised the scheme, calling it ‘a major policy breakthrough’, and Sharan Burrow, the ACTU President, has said that it is in stark contrast to the ‘shonky baby bonus’. I have criticised the baby bonus in the past. The take-up has been massively lower than the government expected because it just does not meet the needs of working families. As I said, this is only the beginning of the task of helping people balance work and family commitments. We need to address a number of other issues, including issues of overwork for both men and women. Australians are working the second longest hours of any OECD country. It is important to have a realistic understanding that people should not be working 70or 80-hour weeks. We need to have more flexibility in the work force. Part-time work is very good for some families, but it has to be regular, well-paid part-time work that also has some career advancement built into it. Low-paid and casual work has been the trend, and that is not flexibility; that it just exploitation. The other area we need to address is the affordability and quality of child care. The ABS suggests that there is a shortage of 174,500 places in child care. The stress of not being able to find child care is enormously difficult for many working families. One woman, Cathy, wrote to me from Alexandria, saying that she has a nine-month-old daughter whom she put down for child care before she was born, yet she could not find a place for her. (Time expired) Cowper Electorate: Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter Service sue of the services provided by the Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter. I do not think a day goes by that we are not reminded in the media of the great work that this service provides. They certainly do a great job. Reid Harris and Associates’ review of aeromedical services in New South Wales recommended the establishment of a base facility for a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour in 1994. Following that, a white paper was prepared by the then superintendent, James McLachlan, which recommended the placement of a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour in 1995. There was a further review of aeromedical services in 1999, which also made reference to basing a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour. MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Adjournment
305,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (12.51 P.m.),"I rise in this debate to speak on the vital isIt is a vital service. A number of reviews have recognised the importance of having a facility established in Coffs Harbour for a range of reasons. The Pacific Highway is being constantly upgraded, and part of that upgrading has resulted in a shift north of the fatigue zones to an area between Kew and Ballina. We have had a lot more accidents happening in the largely unimproved area between Kew and Ballina. The general volumes of traffic have also been increasing rapidly, particularly heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle movements have increased by an incredible extent, particularly with the opening of the Chinderah to Yelgun freeway. We have large amounts of traffic coming down the highway and a shift in the fatigue zones, and in Coffs Harbour we need the establishment of a base for the rescue helicopter. Not only do we have growth in through traffic; we have growth in local traffic and growth in the local population. All of these things point to the need for a rescue helicopter based in Coffs Harbour. We also have adventure tourism. Many adventure tourism activities, such as whitewater rafting or horse riding, occur in highly isolated spots, and the possibility of misadventure by virtue of the relatively risky nature of these activities also points to the need for a rescue helicopter to be based in or around Coffs Harbour. The community of Coffs Harbour has recognised this need and has been raising funds to finance the service. All that is required is for the New South Wales government to declare Coffs Harbour a rotary-wing aeromedical service base and to guarantee that the helicopter will be tasked by appropriate authorities. When the necessary state government approvals are obtained, the board of Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter will purchase an additional helicopter to enable a craft to be based permanently at Coffs Harbour. The rescue service will absorb all the additional costs in getting the Coffs Harbour service up and running, with regard to training the medical crews and up-skilling our various ambulance personnel. The Westpac rescue helicopter facility will meet the establishment costs and a lot of the costs of getting this service up and running. The board would only be seeking additional funds from the New South Wales state government when the agreement, which is due to be renegotiated in March 2005, comes along. The initial establishment costs would be met by the board. Certainly the need is there. We saw recently an accident where a woman who was driving a tractor fell underneath a slasher and the resulting injuries were quite horrendous. Any time that can be saved in getting to such an accident situation should be saved indeed. The community is behind our getting this very important service. The local council has been highly supportive and very proactive in seeking to have a rescue helicopter based in Coffs Harbour. The local National Party state member, Mr Andrew Fraser, has been very vocal in attempting to secure the necessary New South Wales government approvals. I think our securing this service really transcends party politics. The New South Wales state government should come on board with the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service to give the necessary approvals to get the service up and running to save those precious moments that may save a life in our community.

Transport and Regional Services: Regional Partnership Program (Question No. 3216) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 5 March 2004: (1) Which regions have been identified to be pilot sustainable regions under the Regional Assistance Program. (2) What are the funding allocations to each pilot region under the program. (3) What is or was the purpose of each grant. This question was referred to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP, as the matters raised fall within his portfolio responsibility. The Regional Assistance Programme did not have pilot regions. That programme is now part of the Regional Partnerships Programme. The reference to ‘pilot regions’ indicates the question is directed to the Sustainable Regions Programme (SRP). Therefore answers are provided as they relate to the Sustainable Regions Programme, and are as follows: (1) The pilot sustainable regions under the Sustainable Regions Programme are: Campbelltown-Camden, NSW Far North East NSW Gippsland, VIC Atherton Tablelands, QLD Wide Bay Burnett, QLD Kimberley, WA Playford-Salisbury, SA Cradle Coast, TAS (North West and West Coast) (2) The funding allocations to each pilot region under the Programme are: Campbelltown-Camden, NSW – up to $12 million Far North East NSW – up to $12 million Gippsland, VIC – up to $12 million Atherton Tablelands, QLD – up to $18 million Wide Bay Burnett, QLD – up to $8 million Kimberley, WA – up to $12 million Playford-Salisbury, SA – up to $12 million Cradle Coast, TAS (North West and West Coast) – up to $12 million (3) Details of projects funded to date under the Sustainable Regions Programme, including the purpose of the funding can be found at http://www.sustainableregions.gov.au under each region’s web page. Family Court: Child Access Arrangements (Question No. 3229) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 2004: (1) Can he explain how Family Court Orders are enforced if the party who has the order against them will not abide by it. (2) How are parents to provide proof to Centrelink and the Child Support Agency that they are providing care to their children through access arrangements if an ex-partner denies to both agencies that access is occurring. (3) What do Centrelink and the Child Support Agency consider to be proof of parents participating in child access arrangements. (4) Are Family Court documents considered to be proof of child access visitation.",220,Questions On Notice
310,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Enforcement of court orders is done through the Family Court. (2) Where there is dispute about care arrangements, CSA asks both parents to provide whatever evidence about care they have, including documentary evidence such as diary notes. CSA may also contact Centrelink and other third parties who may be able to provide relevant information for consideration. CSA obtains comments by the parents on any conflicting information. After considering all information available, the CSA officer decides on the balance of probabilities what care levels should be reflected in the child support assessment. In relation to Centrelink, where former members of a couple share the care of a child of that former relationship, and the parties disagree as to the level of care, verification is required of both carers to determine the actual care arrangements. Each carer is given the opportunity to provide verification of care. Where a formal arrangement exists (family law order; parenting plan; or custody order) a copy of the document is required for verification. (3) In order to be reasonably satisfied that particular care arrangements are occurring, CSA will accept any credible information provided by any source. Both parents can seek review of the decision in relation to their assessment if they are unhappy. Centrelink advises that additional evidence to support parents’ declared arrangements may be by way of: confirmation of playgroup, kindergarten or school enrolment, proof of attendance or membership of local organisations or activities, receipts for expenses incurred while the child was in care, confirmation of care arrangements from close family friends or relatives, social worker reports, especially in cases where there may be a fear of violence if the other parent is contacted, proof of travel arrangements at contact times (e.g. rail or airline tickets), records from Centrelink or other government departments which may confirm present or previous patterns of care, such as information about past shared family payments which may be relevant to the current situation, or confirmation from professional members of the community who have regular contact with the family, such as teachers, police, ministers of religion, accountants, lawyers or doctors. (4) Family Court documents are not proof of actual care. Child support legislation requires CSA to consider orders or parenting plans where a parent is not complying with the order or plan and is seeking a higher assessment of child support as a result. Where the order or plan is being breached without reasonable excuse, carers are assessed as having care to the level provided for in the order or parenting plan, or to their actual level of care, where this is less.
