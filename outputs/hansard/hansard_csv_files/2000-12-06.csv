Mr Emerson to move: That this House: (1) expresses its alarm at large-scale tax avoidance by unscrupulous company executives; (2) expresses its disappointment that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has issued a series of favourable private binding rulings in support of schemes that the ATO itself has likened to the infamous bottom of the harbour schemes; (3) condemns the Treasurer for refusing to legislate against the abuse of executive share schemes and for obfuscating on promised Wednesday, 6 December 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23577 Wednesday, 6 December 2000 ----Collins Class Submarines members an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, 25 November. The article-an excellent one-was written by David Lague and was titled ‘Out of the Deep’. It impressed me because it was not only well written but well researched. The article started off by saying, ‘They’re duds, they’re noisy-wrong.’ That is the key point, Mr Deputy Speaker: wrong, wrong, wrong. It continued: In fact, almost everything you have read about Australia’s Collins class submarines is false. The writer talks about the top secret naval exercises in the Pacific, off Hawaii, earlier this year, when the Collins class submarine HMAS Waller, in his words, ‘proved to be a silent and deadly submarine stalker’. In actual fact, the first that the United States Navy Los Angeles class nuclear submarines knew about Waller was when they heard the torpedoes running. Not bad for the noisy duds that we have heard so much about! David Lague compares the submarine contract with the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme, with observers saying it was like taking an engineering challenge that was much more difficult and complex than the Snowy Mountains scheme and packing it into six narrow steel tubes. The article also talks about the people who, since the project was announced, have deliberately and maliciously peddled lies; and, as far as misinformation about the progress of the submarines is concerned, there is none more so than the current defence minister. David Lague points out in his article that-and I quote: Before the first high pressure hull was welded together it came under assault as part of a domestic engineering cringe. This evolved into nasty intra-navy rivalryup above the water, the weekend yachties, going back and running the Navy nine to five in the middle of the weekand was then ruthlessly exploited by Moore, one of the tougher political operators in Canberra, as a vehicle for political point-scoring and bureaucratic infighting. Spot on. I, along with others who have been closely watching the development of the project-and why wouldn’t I, since it is in my seat of Port Adelaide-have known this for a very long time. It is just a pity that I had to read about the truth in an interstate newspaper. The Adelaide media and the ABC nationally have been happy, as usual, to print the scuttlebutt and the allegations without checking the real facts. In a question that I placed on the Notice Paper to Minister Moore about how the submarines were performing in international exercises and about its combat system, his answer was, quite simply, limp. It is about time that the minister ceased canning Australian workers, who, after many teething problems, have produced a world-class submarine. The major failing of the submarine has been the combat system. As one sailor said in the article, if the Collins combat system was a PC, it would be a 286. What was not said in the article was that the defence department got its own way against the wishes of the Australian Submarine Corporation in regard to the combat system. The minister confirmed that fact in an answer he provided to me. If the minister were dinkum about building an Australian submarine for the 21st century, he would stop bagging the project and start marketing its positives to the media, the public, and beyond our shores.

304,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (9.40 A.m.),"I would like to bring to the attention ofParliament House: Staff people in and around this building who make our lives so much easier than they could be. IfI take it chronologically in a normal day, they would include the fellow from the transport desk in the Sergeant’s office who says a cheery hello every morning. Then there are the security people who let me into my office when I forget my key and reset my duress alarm every time. I set it off. The office is shiny and clean because Vera has cleaned our rooms early in the morning, so as not to disturb us in the evening. Danica comes through during question time and empties the bins once again. She, too, always has a smile on her face. The newsagent who delivers the papers whistles and jokes a lot and also adds to the joy of a new day at work. The mail arrives promptly, delivered by the people who our office calls the nameless, faceless, green and grey people. Carol has been our most regular attendant. She has been ever so patient and polite while directing us when we are lost, or rushing that last bit of mail off to catch the truck. Nothing has been insurmountable. Often we marvel at the corporate willingness to please. I, for one, know that this attitude has grown over time. If it could be bottled, it would sell like hot cakes in private enterprise. Every piece of equipment in our office seems to have a team of helpful professionals to back it up. IfI have trouble relating to the electronic media in the office, the people who answer the phone when I dial extension 2020 never laugh at me and always get me through the process. Almost anything else I want to know is available from the many helpful people who answer when I dial 9. That magnificent library is truly heaven on a stick! They give me information in the form that best suits me and do not grumble when I have to cancel everything at the last minute for the second time in a row. On the way to and from other offices we walk past really interesting and provocative art, stunning and peaceful gardens and beautifully manicured lawns. The canteen and other eateries provide sustenance to us for long hours each day and the staff are dedicated to our satisfaction. To Kath, Nelly, Monica, Tanya, Linda and Bill the chef, thank you for your cheery help. Then, of course, there are the people from hospitality and the PEO and the tour guides who show our constituents and our schools through the House, answer thousands of questions and keep us all informed. Even the people at the gym do not laugh when you turn up for some gentle exercise and they really give you a positive push. Here in the Main Committee chamber, ring the bell and an attendant is beside you, glass of water in hand. I thank the attendants who ring the office because I forget my glasses and safely pass reams of paperwork in both directions. On occasions I occupy the Speaker’s chair and it is only through the valiant efforts of the clerks of the House that I preside in any kind of professional manner. They keep me on track and in order. The nursing sisters, the fellows who look after the indoor plants, Lizzie the hairdresser, Jetset, the Hansard people, the Sound and Vision people, Laurie from stores, the staff in the parliamentary shop, the florist Audrey and the people from Ministerial and Parliamentary Services are all here to serve our needs, and they do their jobs so well. IfI have left out anyone, I apologise. Through your efforts, I can do my job a whole lot better each day. Although we may not tell you, I and my staff bless your little cotton socks! Lee, Mr Kevin: Miscarriage of Justice the process of raising a matter of a serious miscarriage of naval justice some 45 years ago affecting a constituent of mine, Mr Kevin Lee.

306,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (9.46 A.m.),"I want to use this opportunity today to startWednesday, 6 December 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23579 In a letter to the Chief of Navy Admiral Shackleton on 9 February 2000, Retired Rear Admiral Kennedy indicated that he was ‘not happy with this one’, that is, the circumstances surrounding the miscarriage of justice affecting my constituent, Mr Lee. Admiral Kennedy has provided some detailed documents. In part he says: ... I believe his [Lee’s] story to be the truth. I believe I detect in the documents some pre-disposition and haste to ‘hang someone’ on the part of HMAS COMMONWEALTH officers so as to make an example and placate the Japanese. He goes on: I wish I knew or could recall how the identification of Lee ... was made but I do not. I am clear in my mind that the two ‘Red Caps’ could not have. If this is the case, then the judicial process which followed was seriously flawed in that:The accused did not have a defending counsel and did not understand the charge or proceedings properly [and had] no first-hand witness who was present to identify [him]. He says that he believes that there was not a fair and proper trial concerning the assault matters which were the substance of the charges. This material was sent by Admiral Kennedy to Admiral Shackleton. A reply to Admiral Kennedy came from the research officer to the Chief of Navy on 23 March in which he indicated: The circumstances surrounding the incident and actual trial appear to be unmerited in the light of your informationand that matters concerning Kevin Lee ‘certainly require closer scrutiny’. Therefore you can understand my disappointment, and particularly that of my constituent, when on 27 October Admiral Shackleton wrote to Mr Lee saying: Unfortunately as the matter is now some 45 years old, and despite the evidence you have provided, it has been impossible to garner the type of information required to rebut the charges. As a result ... I have been unable to conclude that your trial was improperly conducted and therefore cannot justify the overturning of your conviction. This is a slur which my constituent feels very deeply about. He is a gentleman of considerable stature in my local community. He believes he served this country with honour some 45 years ago. He has the support of an admiral of the distinction of Admiral Kennedy yet Navy is not prepared to reopen this matter and clear his name. This is a disgrace that I intend to pursue in this House as time permits. Dawson Electorate: Burdekin Bypass Project bypass in my electorate of Dawson. This proposed project was announced in 1996. The consultation since that date has been undertaken by the Department of Main Roads and overseen, of course, by the federal department of transport and the federal minister, the Hon. John Anderson. Only last month we finally had recommendations from the Department of Main Roads on which of the alignments that have been placed on the map is their preferred alignment. Let me say that some 11 alignments have been put forward-11 lines on the map through some of the most valuable cane land in Australia. This has caused a great deal of grief in our community because obviously people cannot develop, sell or make business decisions when there is the possibility of a bypass going through their farm. Mr Bredhauer unfortunately has ignored the community. He has not listened to the various meetings that have been conducted and the submissions put forward. Those community groups cover cane growers, the representatives of the largest business organisations in the",146,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (9.49 A.m.),"I rise today to speak about the BurdekinBurdekin, the Burdekin Chamber of Commerce and, of course, the council. I would like to read out a letter from Mrs Pirrone from the Save Our Homes and Farms Action Group. The letter reads: Dear Deanne, The Save Our Homes and Farms Action Group wishes to thank you for your article in the Advocate 2/11/00 where you were stated ‘The community does not approve of any of the proposals put forward by Main Roads ... they want the whole project shelved with lines on maps and notations on land titles removed,’ ‘AndI agree with them’ and again on the 24th of November. We realise that you have a difficult task in trying to represent all of your constituents. Would you please bring this matter before Federal Parliament this week as we have heard via radio that road funding will be discussed. Please find enclosed a copy of a letter that we have released to the press and we hope that by giving you the opportunity to peruse this information you will realise our concerns, and we implore you to pass this on to our Federal Minister for Transport Mr John Anderson and could you please discuss it in the chamber. Of course, I am very happy to do that. Let me assure the residents of the Burdekin and community associations that we will listen to their concerns and that John Anderson places great note on community interest. Roads: Funding be applauded. It would be churlish to devalue this much-needed injection of funding, but the spending needs to be put in its correct context. Evans shire mayor, Norm Mann, welcomed the $464,000 annual boost to his council’s road budget over the next four years but said it would take a lot more than an extra $1.8 million to bring the shire road network up to acceptable standards. He cites the enormous impact of forestry trucks breaking up local roads while earning export dollars and shareholder dividends for people well outside the shire, yet the council bears the cost. Bathurst, with $333,000 extra for four years, welcomes the chance to bring several projects forward. Likewise, Cabonne is grateful for $3.3 million over four years, as are the councils of Lithgow, Blayney, Orange, Cowra and Oberon. But the editorial in the Central Western Daily got it right when it stated: The funding is to be welcomed as is the way the money is to be distributed, according to a funding formula that ensures it is not driven by political considerations ... All very welcome, but what needs to be remembered is that the Government, while playing Santa Claus, is also playing catch-up. Public investment in roads has declined from two per cent of gross domestic product in 1960 to around half of one per cent now. This is on top of the demise of rail and the huge increase in large truck movements-many of them on local council roads. This is a vast country of great distances and few people. Our income tax collection just cannot meet the needs of our road network. It is economically irrational to not spend much more on bringing our rail network up to the sort of standard needed to not only compete with but replace much of our road transport. Both should work in tandem, but to achieve this the rail infrastructure and the charges applied to it by government should be realistic. We are spending three times more on roads in one year than we budget for rail over four years. Unless we tie petrol tax into road funding, we will continue to rely on a very ad hoc method of funding our rural and regional transport infrastructure. The New South Wales state 3x3 cents program worked very well and was easily understood. A 10x2 cents program from existing excise might be the way to go for federal road infrastructure funding-quite likely taking much of the heat off the anger over rising fuel 23580",147,Representatives Main Committee

Why not make it 10x3 cents, with a cent of the fuel tax dedicated to rail? That way the electorate could see some real and continuing results from its petrol tax. Unless we get serious about rail, until we take the burden of timber, wheat, coal and other products off local council roads, then a once in a blue moon $850 million will achieve very little. Welcome and belated though this money is, let us not get carried away with rhetoric that this money will provide enormous export boosts from paddock to wharf. The member for Ballarat described in his speech on the second reading of the bill that the national shame is our local road network. It will still be shameful, even after this injection of funds. Yabulu Nickel Refinery on the Yabulu extension project. Yabulu is a nickel refinery in Thuringowa-Townsville which has been operating for about 20 years. It is facing some very significant problems at the moment and, to the credit of its management, they have been doing a lot of work in trying to ensure the future viability and, in fact, the expansion of that plant. They have come up with an innovative program of expansion to build a new mine in Western Australia to partially process the lateritic nickel ore over there, ship it around to Townsville and double the size of the existing nickel plant in Townsville. It is very exciting because it confirms the existing jobs in Townsville and ensures their long-term future. But more than that, it creates new jobs both in Western Australia and in North Queensland. There are a number of issues before the federal government on which I have certainly been doing a lot of work. I am very pleased to support this important project in TownsvilleThuringowa. First of all, we are looking for major project facilitation status for this project. It is a billion dollar project, so it certainly well qualifies. I have been doing a lot of work with the government on this and I am expecting a positive outcome in the not too distant future. That will certainly be welcomed by the company and by the people of Townsville. Also, we need environmental approval under the EPBC Act. This is a minefield; it is very difficult to work through with Queensland EPA laws and so on. I have seen some very positive results in that regard and I am certain that that process will be okay. In relation to help with tariff by-law imports, I think we have been able to get that signed off, which will help the project. But the matter that I am concerned about is the greenhouse gas abatement program. It is very important, in my view, that the plant take this once in a lifetime opportunity to convert from coal to gas. Also, it provides a 26-petajoule demand for the proposed new gas pipeline going down the Queensland coast. If we cannot get the plant changed to gas, that will cause some significant worries in relation to the viability of the pipeline. I am certainly doing everything that I can to get the government to support the greenhouse gas abatement program application that the company has made. We have to get that up because it also means that cogeneration will happen on site with the power station. We will get rid of the terribly dirty coal station that is there. Of course, it is good for our environment in relation to the use of gas. Rail: Infrastructure Calare in his comments on the need for rail infrastructure in Australia. The job dividend provided by the Roads to Recovery Program would be 16,000 to 22,000 jobs. With rail, the figure would be 35,200 to 40,000 jobs-basically double the dividend. In terms of employment in this country, I am not suggesting that no money be spent on roads, but the expenditure balance between shipping, rail and roads in this country is an absolute disgrace.

(2) If so, (a) when was each piece of advice received, (b) what course of action was recommended in each case and (c) what action did the Government take in response to each of these recommendations. (1) and (2) No estimates have been provided to the current Government of the revenue at risk from the abuse of employee benefit arrangements because as the ATO has stated, abusive employee benefit arrangements are not effective under the existing law. The ATO is in the process of pursuing those arrangements which are ineffective under the law. In this regard I refer the honourable Member to the relevant pages in the ATO’s 1999/2000 annual report. On 30 June 2000 the Assistant Treasurer announced amendments to address aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements following advice from the ATO that these arrangements were still being actively promoted. These legislative amendments were introduced into the Parliament in September 2000. Customs: Airport Services (Question No. 1997) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: What has been the cost each year since 1995, including 2000, of providing customs services and processing at each airport where those services are provided. the honourable member’s question: Customs is unable to provide a breakdown of costs at each individual airport.

Tax Avoidance Schemes (Question No. 2012) Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on Wednesday 4 October 2000: In light of the Treasurer’s statement that the Government has received advice on tax avoidance through employee benefit schemes (Hansard, 6 September 2000, page 18273), has any of that advice proposed the option of amending legislation. The ATO has always been of the view that abusive employee benefit arrangements are ineffective under the current law.

(1) An ‘open’ tender was let for the supply, on a lease basis, of postage meters and the provision of associated services to Federal Electorate Offices in all Australian States and Territories. The criteria used to evaluate tenders were: (a) Compliance with the contractual Terms and Conditions of the Request for Tender; (b) Understanding of Ministerial and Parliamentary Services (M&PS) and its needs; (c) Financial capacity and viability; (d) Proven performance including expertise in machine purchase/leasing/contract management; (e) Professional standing and reputation within the industry (through referee reports); (f) Outline of proposed strategy (including capacity to carry out tasks required); (g) Key personnel; (h) Competitive pricing. The assessment of the postage meter tender was undertaken by departmental staff. Ernst& Young (external auditors) conducted a probity review of the tender evaluation and concluded, “We report that the evaluation was conducted in accordance with the Tender evaluation plan. We are of the opinion that this evaluation demonstrates probity”. (2) Yes. (3) The supplier installed the machines at no cost to the Commonwealth. Information regarding maintenance costs are Commercial-in-Confidence. The release of costing details has the potential to damage the Commonwealth’s position in future negotiations with suppliers.
