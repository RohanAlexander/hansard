Monday, 13 October 2008 ----Melbourne Cup Day timely that the issue of having a truly national public holiday has again come to the forefront. In February 2006 I prepared a private members motion recognising that the Melbourne Cup has become a national event observed by the majority of Australians and, as such, it would be highly appropriate that it be observed as a national public holiday, replacing the Queen’s Birthday public holiday. While the motion was not debated on the floor of the parliament, it remains an issue of considerable importance to me. SoI was pleased to read that Tom Percy QC in Perth in his Sunday Times magazine column yesterday expressed a similar sentiment. As Mr Percy points out, why not make the day of ‘the race that stops the nation’ a day where work officially stops across the nation? In Western Australia the public holiday for the Queen’s birthday has no correlation with Her Majesty’s birthday. It is months later. It is tied to nothing more than the footy and nice weather. Thousands of Perth people gather at Ascot for Melbourne Cup Day celebrations. With a strong racing industry in Western Australia, particularly in my electorate of Canning, it is without doubt that Melbourne Cup Day is as important to Western Australians as it is to those on the east coast. As public sentiment moves away from traditional ties to the monarchy, the leaders of both major parties have lent their weight to the republican debate, with Malcolm Turnbull, a staunch republican, and Kevin Rudd putting it on the government’s agenda. Perhaps now is an opportune time to reassess the importance of the Queen’s Birthday public holiday in favour of days like Melbourne Cup Day.

The chairperson, Bradley Edwards, heads up a fantastic committee and a hard working group of volunteers. As we know, without volunteers, sporting clubs and competitions like this would not exist. The centre was happy to announce the use of their new timekeeping gates, which have been installed since last year’s season. During the off-season, the centre’s clubhouse was upgraded, and I attended the opening of the upgraded building. This upgrade was greatly appreciated by the members and has contributed to the increased membership of the club. The Belmont City Council was instrumental in this upgrade and Mayor Glenys Godfrey attended Saturday’s morning ceremony. Unfortunately, Little Athletics receives no federal funding, as it is not recognised by the Australian Sports Commission as the representative of that sport. This should be addressed so that associations like Little Athletics can be financially assisted. (Time expired) Mr Andrew Chin Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.43 pm)-I note that Mr Andrew Chin has recently retired after 35 years of service at the Parliamentary Library. I first met Andrew during one of the first sitting weeks of the new parliament. Since then, he has assisted me with a number of research questions in an area in which we share a keen interest: foreign affairs. As someone who came to the Parliamentary Library in 1973, Andrew has seen a number of changes in this place, including six different prime ministers and the historic move from Old Parliament House. Andrew has worked with governments in the South Pacific region in developing their parliamentary libraries. This has included visits to Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Tonga and Niue. As a developed democracy, it is our duty to help strengthen democratic institutions in our region, and I congratulate Andrew on the role he has played in achieving this. Andrew’s responsibility for developing and building the United Nations deposit collection is another area where his work will benefit parliamentarians for many years beyond his retirement. I would like to record my sincere thanks to Andrew for all the assistance he has provided to me and to my parliamentary colleagues and their staff, past and present. I hope his retirement is peace filled and happy. In noting the outstanding contribution that Andrew Chin has made, I also wish to acknowledge the work of all the staff at the Parliamentary Library. The work of the library staff not only assists us as individual members but unquestionably improves the quality of debate and decisions made in this place. Cowan Electorate: Little Athletics Little Athletics Centre for the opening of their season. I have the highest regard for the concept of Little Athletics.

139,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (6.45 Pm),"On Saturday, 11 OctoberI attended the Kingswayyoung athletes in the club, I also pay tribute to the many other volunteers who help run the training and competition days at Landsdale. From the well-presented uniforms and conduct, you can see that the Landsdale club is a well-run club and a credit to the parents, volunteers and athletes. One of those athletes is Terrell McKenzie, or TJ, who represented Western Australia at the Australian Little Athletics Championships in April. Terrell won a bronze medal in the 80 metres hurdles and came eighth in the shot-put and 10th in the discus. He also won the Kingsway Centre Championships in the under-13s 100 metres, 80 metres hurdles, long jump, shot-put and javelin. I also want to mention two of the other up-and-coming Landsdale and I think future WA state athletes. Carly Trewin is now an under-12 who has been competing for seven years. At the state Little Athletics championships in March she won four silver medals for the hurdles and throwing events. I am also informed that Shakeel Alexander, now also an under-12, won three gold and two silver medals at those state championships. They are great talents for the future of Landsdale Little Athletics club and Western Australia. Down Syndrome Awareness Week Ms SAFFIN (Page) (6.46 pm)-To mark Down Syndrome Awareness Week, I want to talk about what is going on in my electorate of Page. We are lucky to have such an active, artistic community and a wonderful service organisation called RED Inc., which stands for ‘realise every dream’. Their aim is to support young people with disabilities to achieve their goals, realise their dreams and maximise their potential. In July this year RED Inc. staged a musical production called Showboat of Dreams. About 40 people performed in this vibrant musical production. A crowd of 500 packed the Lismore City Hall and the production received rave reviews. This month RED Inc. staged its second annual art exhibition at Lismore’s Serpentine Gallery, called Any Medium Goes. Working in portraiture, landscape, abstraction, printmaking, ceramics and multimedia, these young artists have expressed all facets of life: passions and dreams, love of community and hope for the planet and its future. I am proud to be part of a community that celebrates abilities in people with Down syndrome and other disabilities, but it is not all singing and dancing and good news for people with Down syndrome and their families in Page. As in many regional areas, there are gaps in the services available and often a lack of social support. Young mothers with new babies with Down syndrome can face the daunting task of trying to understand the special health needs of their child without the advantage of some of the support groups in the cities. A child with Down syndrome may have major health problems as well. This can mean travelling to a city hospital.

140,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (6.48 Pm),"I would like to speak tonight about a special eventfor their work in instigating this program and getting it going. They were rewarded for their foresight and hard work by being given the honour of cutting the ribbon. A skate park might not seem much to many, but in Coonamble it is a big deal. There are not a lot of activities for young people. What made it special was the fact that it was something that the children sought and fought for themselves. What also made it special was that it was funded and supported by three levels of government and the local community. Regional Partnerships, which has been much maligned in this place, contributed $46,000. The New South Wales state government contributed quite a large amount. The local council contributed too, and the local students contributed quite a bit through their own fundraising. This is a classic example of when local communities, local government, state government and federal government work together to produce real outcomes that are of benefit to the whole community. Lindsay Electorate: St Marys Spring Festival Marys Spring Festival which took place in St Marys last Saturday. In its 33rd year, the festival was scheduled to be held on 6 September but was postponed due to rain. As a result of the herculean efforts of the organising committee, the event was reorganised within a matter of five weeks. This was no small feat, considering that the festival is a major event in the local calendar and showcases St Marys, attracting crowds of over 40,000 people. Behind the scenes, many hours of hard work have been dedicated towards making this event a success. I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the volunteers who enable the festival to take place each year. The organising committee includes: Tony Biddulph, Chairman; Norma Thorburn, Secretary-Treasurer; John Wilcocks, Vice-President; Isobel Lowe, Publicity Officer; and Leonie Hannah, Minutes Secretary. Other committee members are Maurice Spalding, Dorothy Radford, Marj Elphick, Judy Shepherd and Councillors Greenow, Allison and Davies. I also acknowledge the two junior committee members assisting over the last two years, Trevor and Hayley Elphick. I also acknowledge the Penrith City Council for its financial and in-kind support of the festival; the Erskine Park and Llandilo brigades of the Rural Fire Service for acting as marshals; and the members of the Mustang Owners Club under Wayne Byrne’s leadership, who provide the spectacular vehicles that lead the parade. I acknowledge all of these hard working individuals and the many other volunteers for their contribution to the promotion and enrichment of our local community. Fuel Prices lute malfunction of fuel pricing in regional South Australia and, in particular, the regional city of Whyalla, and the apparent impotency or complete lack of concern shown by the ACCC. Over the last three months, petrol in Whyalla has been as much as 10c a litre dearer than in Adelaide and, even more disturbingly, diesel has been 20c a litre dearer. Given that the cost of freight from Adelaide to Whyalla is only about 3c a litre-and we are talking here about one of the biggest regional markets in South Australia-it is apparent that the competitive market is failing. I raised the issue with the ACCC and just today received a response.

142,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (6.51 Pm),"I take this opportunity to inform the House of the absoand lower volumes. It points out that, because country sites refuel less often than city outlets, price drops take longer to work their way through the system. I refute all of these arguments. Whyalla has the secondor third-largest regional population in the state and, as a result, outlets fill frequently. It is only 380 kilometres from Adelaide and 270 kilometres from Port Lincoln-both fuel terminals-equating to a freight differential of between 2c and 3c per litre, and there are at least seven outlets in the city. Nearby centres have significantly cheaper prices than Whyalla-in fact, Port Augusta, just 80 kilometres up the road, and nearer to Adelaide, is averaging diesel prices 15c a litre lower. For the ACCC to tell Whyalla citizens, through me, that a 20c premium for diesel is all part of the natural cycle is totally unacceptable. Either the ACCC has no teeth or it doesn’t care. (Time expired) Poverty Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.52 pm)-Members will be aware that this week Micah Challenge, a global alliance of churches and Christian groups, are holding a Voices for Justice event in Canberra as part of the campaign in support of the Millennium Development Goals. Micah Challenge is working closely in this objective with the Make Poverty History coalition of more than 60 aid agencies, community groups and religious organisations within Australia, which is calling upon the Australian government to take the following steps needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals: increase Australia’s aid and ensure it is used effectively, make trade fair, drop the debts of poor countries, help poor countries keep their governments accountable, and tackle climate change in developing countries. In the Millennium Declaration adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2000, leaders from all over the world, including Australia, resolved that: We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected. I am aware that there is a private member’s motion about poverty to be debated shortly. I congratulate the member for Parramatta for moving the motion and all those members speaking in support of it. I hope that, with bipartisan support, this parliament and this government can help ensure an end to poverty in our lifetimes. 192A, the time for members statements has concluded. Poverty Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Owens: That the House: (1) notes: (a) that 12-18 October marks Anti-Poverty Week with the United Nations declaring Friday 17 October as International Anti-Poverty Day; and (b) that the last time Australia contributed .5 per cent of Gross National Income (GNI) was in 1974-75 and that the contribution has declined since then to as low as .25 per cent from 2000-04; (2) recognises: (a) the Federal Government’s commitment to lifting the nation’s contribution to .5 per cent of GNI by 2015; and MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Statements By Members
143,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! In accordance with standing order(b) that the majority of the world’s poor live in our region; (3) commends the excellent work done by Micah Challenge and Make Poverty History in bringing this matter to public prominence; and (4) calls on the Government to continue to play a leadership role in our region and to honour our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (6.54 pm)-This week is Anti-Poverty Week and the United Nations has declared this Friday, 17 October, International Anti-Poverty Day, so it is appropriate this week that so many of us rise to draw attention to the plight of nearly one billion people around the world. It is appropriate, of course, that we keep global poverty in mind every day, as nearly 10,000 children die each day from hunger and malnutrition. This morning on the lawns of Parliament House hundreds of people from Micah Challenge, Make Poverty History and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation gathered to welcome a group of cyclists who had ridden from Brisbane to Canberra to draw attention to the plight of those living in poverty around the world. On arriving, they cycled once around Parliament House for each of the eight Millennium Development Goals-once to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; once to achieve universal primary education; once to promote gender equality and empower women; once to reduce child mortality; once to improve maternal health; once to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; once to ensure environmental sustainability; and finally, on the eighth time, to develop a global partnership for development. In the words of the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance: The Millennium Development Goals are tangible, real indicators of success in the struggle against global poverty and inequality. It is impossible to be committed to a world where children grow up free from the scourge of poverty, illiteracy and disease without accepting that the Millennium Development Goals are the medium-term goals for which we should aim. We are at the halfway point and there have been some key successes. For example, in all but two regions primary school enrolment is at least 90 per cent. The gender parity index in primary education is 95 per cent or higher in six of the 10 regions, including the most populous ones. Deaths from measles fell from over 750,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2006, and about 80 per cent of children in developing countries now receive a measles vaccine. Some 1.6 billion people have gained access to safe drinking water since 1990, and the share of developing countries’ export earnings devoted to servicing debt fell from 12.5 per cent in 2000 to 6.6 per cent in 2006, allowing those countries to allocate more resources to reducing poverty. But in other areas much greater effort is required. About one-quarter of all children in developing countries are considered to be underweight and are at risk of having a future blighted by the long-term effects of undernourishment. Of the 113 countries that failed to achieve gender parity in both primary and secondary school enrolment by the target date of 2005, only 18 likely to achieve that goal by 2015. More than 500,000 prospective mothers in developing countries die in childbirth or as a result of complications in pregnancy. Some 2.5 billion people, almost half the developing world’s population, live without improved sanitation. Developed countries’ foreign aid expenditures declined for the second consecutive year in 2007 and risk falling short of the commitment made in 2005. The last time Australia achieved the interim target levels of 0.5 per cent of GNI was way back under the Whitlam government in 1974-75. The figure has steadily declined since, MAIN COMMITTEE reaching an all-time low under the previous government of 0.25 per cent of GNI between 1999 and 2004. In 2007, the Australian government ranked 13th out of 21 developed OECD donor countries in per capita aid. In contrast, as private individuals we ranked second in private donations to non-government organisations, demonstrating what a generous community we are. The Rudd government made an election commitment to meet the 0.5 per cent of GNI target by 2015. The 2008-09 budget contained a projected nine per cent real increase over the 200708 budget figure, bringing the total in the 2008-09 year to $3.7 billion, or 0.32 per cent of GNI, and that lays the foundation for filling our election commitment. There was also a postbudget announcement by the Prime Minister on 13 June for a four-year $49 million maternal and neonatal health program for eastern Indonesia to make pregnancy and childbirth safer for women in Indonesia’s poorest area. These are small, positive steps to re-establish Australia as part of the global community working to halve poverty by 2015. In the words of Ban Kimoon, the UN Secretary-General: We must act now and together, responsibly, as one world community, for one shared humanity. (Time expired) Anti-Poverty Week and Friday is International Anti-Poverty Day, as declared by the United Nations. The aiming mark for foreign aid is to be increased to 0.5 per cent of gross national income, and I note that the government has committed to achieving that mark by 2015. It is appropriate to note that increases in Australian foreign aid have been made over many years in real terms. However, when we think of the keen focus on a mark of 0.5 per cent, we should be very careful that this does not become our only focus. Should we reach that mark, it should not be ‘game over, tick the box or mission accomplished’. Even though the Rudd government has said it will take six years to reach the mark, it is critical that we focus on making sure foreign aid targets the capacity to ensure self-sufficiency. Yes, stopping people starving right now is very important, but aid designed to develop agriculture and water projects is where the long-term focus, the goal, must be. Critically important also is the need for governance and strong systems in the countries receiving aid. Take a look at any country where the government is corrupt and where resources are diverted from the people to a ruling elite and you find the greatest hallmarks of poverty. The need for an effective or progressing democracy should be linked firmly as a prerequisite to our aid programs in order that we may have confidence that the money is going to count for the people suffering in these countries. It is appropriate that I also make mention of poverty in Australia. In this country I know that ACOSS has defined the poverty line as 50 per cent of median disposable income, which I understand was $281 per week in 2006. That figure sounds familiar these days, because here we are in late 2008 and that is what the aged single pension and a number of other pensions round out to per week. It is my view that not all of those on $281 per week in 2008 are in poverty but they have to be very well organised to be able to afford housing, transport, food and clothing. I think a single age pensioner would have to own their own home to be able to afford to live on that amount. I would, however, like to take up the case of someone who is not even getting that much, Mrs Margaret Anne Ryan, a constituent of mine in Ballajura. Mrs Ryan is 60 years old and a recipient of the widow’s pension. Mrs Ryan sent me an email last week, which said: MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Private Members Business

I worry that people like Mrs Ryan are under the poverty line and cannot afford three meals a day. This is the front line in this country for those on fixed incomes who face potential poverty. Here is an older Australian who is community minded-and I can personally vouch for that-and doing the right thing in 2008, as she has always done in her life. So where is the government for all the Mrs Ryans in this country? It is hard for me to speak in favour of increased foreign aid when I know how hard she and others like her are doing it. There is of course a big contrast between Mrs Ryan and those people who tell me how tough times are whilst standing in front of their houses, with two cars, a huge wide-screen TV and a Foxtel subscription. I also make known my concern about those parents out there who might prefer drugs, alcohol or cigarettes before healthy food for their children. There is a marked difference between people in those sorts of circumstances who have adopted those sorts of lifestyle choices and someone like Mrs Ryan, who has always done the right thing and stands in a very difficult situation. This brings me back to the main issue, and I will finish by saying that there are people suffering here and around the world. Aid should be given, either in the form of increased pensions or payments here or by foreign aid, but always with accountability. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (7.04 pm)-This week from 12 to 18 October marks AntiPoverty Week and the United Nations has declared Friday, 17 October as International AntiPoverty Day. During this week we reflect on poverty in Australia and recognise that, although our country is not perfect, Australians are in many circumstances much luckier than people in other parts of the world. We are a rich country and as such we have a moral responsibility to play a role in helping developing countries establish good education and health systems, as well as stable government. In 2008-09 Australia will provide nearly $4 billion in official development assistance, ODA. Nearly $3 billion will be managed by AusAID. The ratio of Australia’s ODA to gross national income is estimated at 0.3 per cent for 2007-08. The 2008-09 budget increases the ratio to 0.32 per cent. The government expects the ratio to increase again to 0.35 per cent in 2009-10, 0.37 in 2010-11 and 0.38 in 2011-12. The government has a commitment to increase Australia’s ratio to 0.5 per cent by 2015-16. The Asia-Pacific region remains a poor part of the world. The Asia Development Bank and the United Nations estimate that about 641 million people in this region continue to live on less than one US dollar a day. Australia has been a strong supporter of the Millennium Development Goals. These goals were adopted unanimously by the United Nations Millennium Summit in September 2000. The MDG are a set of global development objectives to be achieved by 2015. The MDG have eight specific objectives, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality and empowering women; reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIVAIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring environmental sustainability; and developing a MAIN COMMITTEE global partnership for development. The 2008-09 budget also provided assistance to faster progress towards the MDG by increasing Australia’s multilateral engagement, development financing and Australia’s core funding for key UN agencies. The budget also established new programs in infrastructure development, land administration and public sector capacity building. I have many constituents in my electorate who have contacted me since my first election on the issue of Australia’s foreign aid. They have expressed an interest in Australia’s foreign aid program and expressed to me a desire for an increase in Australian ODA. I have been pleased to inform my constituents of the government’s commitment to increase our ODA and I am delighted to inform the chamber that there are many organisations in my electorate which also do their bit in working towards those objectives. There are also volunteer organisations which help refugees and refugee families once they arrive in Australia to integrate into our community. I am patron of an organisation called who settle in Wollongong from the African continent. They do excellent work running homework programs for children, running learn to drive programs for adults, teaching adults how to seek work in a local area and working with local employers to increase their ability to become full citizens. I should indicate that I am also a member of the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad, APHEDA. I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to people in my own local area like Cathy Bloch, who is a local trade unionist I have known for a long time, an activist and a particular advocate on behalf of APHEDA. In fact, she told me that on the weekend they had a very successful fundraising dinner. I think it is a really important role that the union movement has played through its international connections through that organisation. I also acknowledged Peter Jennings, APHEDA’s executive officer, who I have dealt with on a number of occasions as well. Trade Unions. My connection to it goes back to my teaching days and I have been very pleased to be able to continue to participate in it. I particularly like the program where you can decide what particular areas you would like to focus your donations in and to do some extra work for women and children in some of the countries where they provide assistance. Anti-Poverty Week is an important week and our electorates do their bit. It is important that the government also does its bit in meeting those goals. international poverty and Australia’s efforts to assist those in need. As we all know, this week is Anti-Poverty Week and the United Nations has declared this Friday, 17 October, International Anti-Poverty Day. As Australians, we are extremely fortunate to live in a country where extreme poverty is not a common occurrence. But as those of us who have travelled in neighbouring regions know, we do not have to go very far to find people who are living in horrific conditions. Earlier this year I was very fortunate to be part of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Cambodia to observe Cambodia’s fourth national general elections. My visit to Cambodia really highlighted for me the level of poverty that exists within our region. During the eight MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Private Members Business
145,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (7.09 Pm),"I am very happy to speak on this motion relating todays I spent in CambodiaI travelled beyond its centre, Phnom Penh, and throughout the countryside, which allowed me to gain an insight into the realities of life in an impoverished nation. As Australians we live in a country where, although poverty is not unknown, absolute poverty is a rarity. Cambodia is a country where absolute poverty lies around every corner. WhetherI was walking the streets of the capital or travelling through the remote countryside, there were scenes of abject poverty which have been seared into my memory. For decades, the Cambodian people suffered at the hands of oppressive and corrupt governments-most famously under the Khmer Rouge and its brutal leader, Pol Pot. No single person in Cambodia would remain untouched by the horrors of the past. Indeed, under Pol Pot a population of eight million was reduced to five million in a matter of years. While the recent election brought with it a number of positive developments and the tide looks like it is finally turning, the repercussions of Pol Pot’s murderous regime will linger for some time yet, with perhaps the most unfortunate consequence being widespread poverty. According to common poverty measurements, such as income and broader human development indicators, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world. The statistics are alarming. For example, about one in three Cambodians live below the national poverty line of just 45c a day. It is not until you see the human toll behind the figures that the full realisation of absolute poverty becomes apparent. Added to this, the internal troubles are extrapolated by external ones. Fears over political instability and corruption have, to a large extent, deterred foreign investment in the country. Corruption is both a cause and an effect of poverty, and the historical corruption that has become almost synonymous with Cambodia’s ruling elite has been perhaps the most direct factor in the inadequate levels of health care and education, for example. I would like to commend the excellent work carried out by AusAID across Cambodia. In the 2008-09 financial year, Australia will provide approximately $37 million to promote development, stability and prosperity in Cambodia. AusAID aims to increase the productivity and incomes of the poor, reduce vulnerability and strengthen the rule of law. There are many incredible projects operating in Cambodia, and one in particular that I enjoyed visiting was Radio National Kampuchea, which operates under AusAID’s Cambodia Radio Development Assistance Program. The radio station has set new standards for political debate in Cambodia and has introduced a talkback program to enable broad based participation by those living in rural and remote communities. This was the first election that Cambodia has had where the population had access to such a great thing. The day we were there, we actually saw this undertaken-in very primitive conditions but it is an excellent step forward for democracy. Improving agricultural practices is one of the goals of AusAID’s work in Cambodia. Through programs such as the Agriculture Value Chain Program, the Agriculture Quality Improvement Project, Integrated Rural Development and Water Resource Management, farmers, researchers and policymakers in Cambodia are learning practical skills which will ensure improved food security and productivity, better marketing and value-adding for products and increased income for farmers. I was able to observe some of the benefits of these programs during my visit and I was extremely impressed by the high standard of the work being undertaken. In addition to the projects run by AusAID, there are many volunteers working for nongovernment organisations in Cambodia who are devoting years of their lives to helping the MAIN COMMITTEE Cambodian people overcome the repercussions of poverty. I was very privileged to meet some of these great young Australians, and we should be very proud that they are over there giving their time-basically free of charge-to help an impoverished nation. It is a testament to the human spirit that so many people give selflessly in order to improve the lives of others. I would like to commend the excellent work done by Micah Challenge and Make Poverty History across the world. Make Poverty History, in particular, has made an invaluable contribution in the fight against global poverty by putting the issue firmly on the political and public radar. night. I applaud the member for Parramatta for moving this motion, in that it is Anti-Poverty Week and Friday also marks the United Nations International Anti-Poverty Day. Along with many members. I would say most members of the House-I am very proud to be part of this government’s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. There are currently two UN targets in place. Firstly, there is an interim target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income. Secondly, there is the ideal target that we want all nations to commit to, which will see aid become 0.7 per cent of GDP over time. The sad fact is that the previous government sat idle on this issue for 12 years. Our current contribution is very low, at around 0.3 per cent, which means it is a massive leap to get to 0.5 per cent by 2015. We are committed to the 0.7 per cent, but it will take some time. In difficult economic times it can be tempting for some people to say that less should be spent on foreign aid. But the reality for the world’s poorest is that every day represents great economic hardship, at levels that we cannot even begin to understand. Foreign aid is something that should never be politicised; it is something that should be maintained and improved by governments all around the world, not just the Australian government. The Australian government is also committed to continue increasing the aid budget beyond 2010 so that it reaches the interim Millennium Development Goals funding target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015. The recent federal budget laid the foundation for the implementation of this long-term goal. There is no need to say this, but I will say it anyway: being fiscally responsible and being very careful in the way we put together the budget gives us the opportunity to be able to meet our millennium goals and our targets while at the same time managing the economic crisis that we all face-and we will do that. Australia will provide an estimated $3.7 billion in overseas direct aid in the 2008-09 budget, increasing Australia’s aid from 0.3 per cent of GNI in 2007-08 to 0.32 per cent in 2008-09. The government expects to increase Australia’s aid to levels equivalent to 0.38 per cent of GNI in 2011-12. World Vision and others in the Make Poverty History Alliance have been extremely positive and excited about this commitment. Of course, increased funding is only one aspect of the government’s commitment to end global poverty. Ensuring that aid funds are spent effectively on poverty reduction and making sure that we collectively achieve with other nations the maximum possible benefit is also essential. The government is committed to increasing both the quality and the quantity of the Australian aid program and retains the target ODA level of 0.7 per cent of GNI as an aspirational goal. To this end, reforms are well underway to strengthen the effectiveness of our aid. For example, the AusAID Development Research Strategy 2008-10 provides greater transparency on MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
146,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.14 Pm),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion to the performance of the aid program to the Australian public and will encourage greater debate on the challenges facing our region. This strategy outlines the way AusAID will increase the role of research in contributing to the effectiveness of the aid program, including a whole range of things that we are doing-strengthening funding for development research, establishing stronger ties and a whole range of other really effective applications that we can put forward. In the end, by partnering with other organisations and institutions we can increase the effectiveness and the efficiency of the money that we provide in direct foreign aid. Australians sit proudly as the second-most generous aid contributors in the world in terms of contributions to non-government organisations. We have a very strong and long history and we have seen in recent years just how generous Australians can be. I think that is at most times also reflected in the culture in the Australian government. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia once again becomes a development leader by ensuring that an increased aid budget has a genuinely positive impact on those who need it most. I would also like to recognise and congratulate the dedicated and very enthusiastic cyclists who rode from Brisbane to Canberra as part of the Micah Challenge. Being an avid cyclist myself it was great to see such a devoted team highlighting the plight of so many millions of children around the world. Mrs May-Did you ride, Bernie? tres-although I would have loved to! But congratulations to the Make Poverty History campaign people, who do a fantastic job, and also to the Micah Challenge. Any support that we can give them is always something that is warranted. I support this motion and commend it to the House. breaking issue-namely, the unacceptable levels of poverty in the world. Personally, I have seen first hand, during my own years working in developing countries, the impact of poverty and disease on people’s lives. I commend the member for Parramatta for bringing this motion before the House and I now understand why I saw her earlier today in the car park in her bike gear. She was obviously on her bike this morning, which is great. This week, as previous speakers have highlighted, marks Anti-Poverty Week, and Friday, 17 October marks International Anti-Poverty Day. Our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region, to our great shame here in Australia, have some of the highest levels of poverty in the worldpoverty on a scale that we do not see here in this country. Urbanisation in this region has grown at an unparalleled pace, more than in any other region in the world, but it has come at a cost. There is no doubt that urbanisation has resulted in economic growth, and this is certainly to be applauded, but sadly it has also resulted in higher levels of poverty. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, two out of every five people who live in urban areas in the Asia-Pacific region reside in slums with no access to clean water. In September 2000, the international community responded to the issue of poverty by coming together at United Nations headquarters to adopt the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which commits each signatory nation to reducing extreme poverty with a series of targets to be met by 2015. As we know, this declaration has become known as the Millennium Development Goals. The goals include halving extreme poverty, halting the spread of HIV-AIDS and providing universal primary education.

148,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (7.19 Pm),"I rise tonight in support of this motion on a heartIn September this year, the UN Secretary General convened a high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals. We are now at the halfway point towards the 2015 target date and we must urgently increase our efforts if we are to meet the goals by 2015. The seeds of poverty are planted in indifference, but I am pleased that we in Australia-indeed, successive governments in Australia-have embraced the Millennium Development Goals. The goals are ambitious-there is no doubt about that-but they are also achievable as long as we, as a nation, maintain our focus, our drive and our commitment to reaching them. I believe education is the key to alleviating poverty, particularly for women. It is lamentable that in many developing nations women are often left out of the equation. I truly believe that economic change must start with women. Along with education, one way to bring about this change and empower women is through microcredit programs. The tremendous work undertaken by AusAID in providing microcredit facilities has made it possible for many thousands of men and women in countries such as China, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Vanuatu to access loan services. Microcredit provides a facility for the poorest people in the world to take care of themselves and their families and achieve some level of independence. As Australians, our responsibility is huge, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Poverty breeds discontent. The eradication of poverty assists with the security of our region. Everyone on our planet, irrespective of where they live, the colour of their skin or the level of their education, should have access to fresh food, clean water, shelter and education. Last year there were food riots in 30 countries, something unheard of in this country-food riots by people who cannot access food on a daily basis. According to the World Bank, 850 million people around the world are malnourished. The hurdles to achieve success are immense. Climate change, rising food prices and rising fuel prices are only a few of the challenges we face. As such, the commitment to ending poverty should be a priority for Australia and, indeed, for the world. I commend the motion to the House. for Parramatta for bringing such an important motion to the House to highlight this very important issue that affects many poor nations around the world. As the motion identifies, 12 to 18 October has been declared Anti-Poverty Week, with this Friday 17 October being International Anti-Poverty Day. I would doubt that anyone truly disbelieves the merits of relatively wealthy nations such as Australia contributing to the development of poorer nations and the rise in living standards of their populations. Ongoing commentary and analysis of collective progress towards the UN’s Millennium Development Goals reminds us of the impoverished circumstances and lives of so many hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings around the world-circumstances that have persisted for generations, but circumstances in which current generations look to a brighter future as a result, in part, of the efforts and support of wealthier countries. A few recent reports indicate that the proportion of people living on less than US$1.25 per day has decreased from 29 per cent of the world’s population in 1990 to 18 per cent in 2004, and it is expected to decrease to 12 per cent by 2015. The number of children dying from preventable diseases around the world has decreased by half, to 30,000 per day-that is a 50 per cent drop, albeit over 20 years. Now we are experiencing 30,000 deaths per day, virtually a million per month, which is over 10 million per year. Two million more people are being MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
149,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (7.24 Pm),"I too would like to congratulate the membertreated for AIDS, while two million more people are infected every year. Forty-one million extra children are going to school. While some nations continue to make progress towards meeting the eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015, some nations face the prospect of not meeting any. Academics fear that the recent world food shortages and oil spike may have wiped out recent gains in many, many countries. In particular, in our neighbourhood, Papua New Guinea is at risk of not reaching one of the eight Millennium Development Goals. A recent report highlights their disadvantage. Fifty per cent are under a basic-needs poverty line; 46 per cent of children do not complete primary school; child mortality is at 74 deaths per thousand; maternal mortality is at 470 out of 100,000; and 475 people per 100,000 contract TB. As such an important and close neighbour, Papua New Guinea’s predicament must call Australia to intensified action. The government has of course committed to increasing the share of Australia’s wealth dedicated towards international development. No doubt the systems that need to be put in place to channel these increasing funds towards real and measurable outcomes need time to develop. We must of course make sure that our action is effective and that development assistance achieves the outcomes for which we all strive. Australia’s historical government aid may not be the most effective means of achieving shared Millennium Development Goals, Australia’s government aid might not even be the most useful in every context, but there is enormous collective will focused on the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals throughout the Australian community and overseas populations. We are blessed with a well-educated population and a highly skilled private sector. We have a population that will stand up for what is decent and right. I believe that a tremendous opportunity exists for the Australian population itself to contribute to the alleviation of overwhelming poverty in our very own region. I support of course our government’s increase in government aid, the increase in the focus of our aid and the attempt to improve the results of our aid, but I especially wish to congratulate the Australian public for its lack of acceptance of world poverty and its continuing attempts to highlight the acute and unnecessary levels of disadvantage, disease and death in so many nation states around the world, including in our very own backyard. I wish to give all the encouragement I can to those people, whether they are community volunteers, as we saw here on the parliament lawns today, church groups or the more altruistic within the private sector, who continue in their efforts to make our world a better place for the bottom billionodd people around the world today and the billions and billions of our fellow human beings who we hope will not be born into poverty in the decades ahead. I commend the motion to members of the House. like my colleagues, I thank and commend the member for Parramatta for bringing this matter to the attention of the House and Australians generally. Australia is a very lucky country. Australians are blessed to live in a land that is not only free and democratic but rich in culture, wealth and opportunity. It is that opportunity that allows us to develop our talents and to fulfil our goals and dreams. We are the blessed ones in any eyes. That is not the case for hundreds and hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens across the world. That is why this motion is important. Although there are very difficult global economic challenges, relatively speaking Australians live in prosperity, in harmony and in a peaceful nation. Therefore, it is all the MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
150,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (7.29 Pm),"I am pleased to speak on this motion on poverty and,more important that we in the parliament remember that there are so many who do not have the opportunities that we in this country have. This week is Anti-Poverty Week. It aims to strengthen the public understanding of the causes and consequences of poverty and hardship around the world and in our own part of the world, the Asia-Pacific region. It aims to remind us to encourage research, to discuss all the issues around poverty and trying to alleviate poverty and to address these problems in a collaborative and sustainable fashion. This includes actions by individuals, communities, organisations and governments at all levels. The principal national sponsors of this week are Community Sector Banking and Jobs Australia. There are some 13 national sponsors. I thank them for their participation in Anti-Poverty Week. Anti-Poverty Week has grown from four activities in 2002 to more than 250 registered activities last year. That shows the interest of Australians in doing their bit and raising awareness in the community. In Australia Make Poverty History is a coalition of more than 68 agencies, community groups and religious organisations. The coalition seeks to ensure the Australian government creates policies that guarantee and improve aid. It focuses on debt relief, fairer trade, helping poorer communities to keep their governments as accountable as possible and trying to honour the commitments made to the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Development Goals are of deep interest to my constituents in the western suburbs of Brisbane in the Ryan electorate. It is an electorate that is very community minded and that takes a deep interest in the affairs of our region and the world, particularly the struggling parts of our world. The Millennium Development Goals are a series of goals and milestones aimed at trying to halve poverty by 2015. The eight main goals are: to end poverty and hunger, to achieve universal education, to reduce child mortality, to promote gender equality, to improve maternal health, to combat HIV-AIDS, to ensure environmental sustainability and to develop a global partnership for development. The goal is to meet all MDGs by 2015, and rich countries need to more than double their current aid levels. As a member of the national parliament of Australia, I want to lend my support to this tremendously worthwhile and visionary initiative. We live in a very fortunate country, but in our region there are so many countries that are struggling. My mother is of Chinese background and I have heard the stories of how she grew up in desperate poverty in China. My wife is Vietnamese and I have heard her stories of deep poverty in the towns and the villages that she grew up in with her family in Vietnam. I grew up in the country to our north, Papua New Guinea, and I have had a little bit of exposure to the great challenges of so many people. I very sincerely add my voice to this motion and thank the member for Parramatta for her initiative. I ask all my colleagues to try and focus on this as well as on all the other main issues in the national debates of this country. raising this very, very important issue. Poverty and severe hardship affect more than a million Australians, and more than a billion people around the world would be considered desperately poor. Anti-Poverty Week, which focuses on poverty around the world, commenced yesterday and was established in Australia as an expansion of the UN’s annual International AntiPoverty Day, which is on 17 October. The success of this week depends on people and organisations taking action and, particularly, drawing attention to reducing poverty and hardship throughout the world. Last year, there were more than 250 official events, and this year I have MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
151,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (7.34 Pm),"I too begin by thanking the member for Parramatta forbeen advised that the figure will be even higher, which is a positive testament to the effects of the Micah Challenge and of the Australian community at large. I take this opportunity to convey my gratitude to organisations in my electorate who are undoubtedly changing the lives of people and making a difference. Only last week I attended the community kitchen run by the Church at the Crossroads in Liverpool. I acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Pastor Gino Zucchi, national coordinator Tony Benjamin and Liverpool coordinator Jessica Buffa in providing services to the disadvantaged people of the south-west of Sydney. This community kitchen in Liverpool offers free, regular and nutritious meals to many people who would otherwise not have access to those meals. Additionally, it is also a great referral point where people can be put in contact with emergency accommodation, counselling and legal services, and more importantly it is an opportunity for social interaction. When I was talking to some of the people during my visit there last week, they were telling me how much they appreciate that there are people in our community that care for them. Imagine that on a worldwide scale. What makes this program at Liverpool even more wonderful is that Work for the Dole participants work there serving meals, providing hospitality to these people and, hopefully, receiving a sense of fulfilment from helping others in the community less fortunate than themselves. Another area of my electorate I also draw attention to is the Guise breakfast club that Bernadette, my wife, and I attended a couple of weeks ago. Seven years ago, this club was started by Linda Ufope, a former P&C president of the Guise Public School, which is in the middle of Macquarie Fields. Dedicated volunteers provide breakfasts to kids who otherwise would be at school without any breakfast on a daily basis. Throughout the years, this program has provided a safe place for thousands of kids and has also resulted in improving attendance rates. The club runs five days a week and has at least a hundred kids every day it operates. So my sincere thanks go to the principal of the school, Bev Newitt, the current P&C president, Anne Sibley, and all of the volunteers and parents who volunteer their time. On a wider scale, the Rotary Club of Ingleburn has taken on a very substantial commitment in helping the Nofo School on Emae Island in Vanuatu, an area in our own backyard. Vanuatu has a very small population, limited industry and resources and would be regarded as a very poor South Pacific nation. Its young people are increasingly vulnerable to poverty and health problems, particularly HIV and AIDS. I thank the President of the Rotary Club of Ingleburn, Reg Robinson, and his members, for what they are doing-physically building a school on this island for those kids to give them an opportunity. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of both the Micah Challenge, who are here today and whom I will be meeting with tomorrow, and the Make Poverty History campaign for their continued commitment to this important matter. I understand that the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent remains an aspiration. This government has made an election commitment, and will honour it, to increase official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national product by 2015, which is a Millennium Development strategy. I also note that this is a substantial increase in our international commitment. There are many different ways to make a difference, and I am proud to be a member of a government that is determined to maintain its focus on reducing disadvantage and improving the life chances of children and families throughout the world. MAIN COMMITTEE Week and to lend my voice to the call for the Australian government to continue to play a leadership role in our region and to honour our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. At the millennium conference in September 2000 Australia joined the rest of the world in saying, as part of the UN Millennium Declaration: We will spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected. We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want. For these fine aspirations to be achieved, it is essential that Australia continue to scale up its aid, as planned, towards 0.7 per cent of GDP. By way of history: in 1970, the international community adopted an aid target for moredeveloped countries of 0.7 per cent-that is, developed countries should devote 70c in every $100 they earn to international development assistance. The international aid target of 0.7 per cent of GDP has been affirmed on numerous occasions by the international community, including the UN General Assemblies of 1980 and 1990, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development, the 1995 World Summit for Social Change and Development in Copenhagen, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico. The international aid target has been recognised as a national aspiration by the current government and, indeed, the previous Howard government. The international aid target provides a way of ensuring that each developed economy can make an equitable contribution to the international aid effort. It is noted that the domestic resources of many developing countries are so low that they are unable to make the investments they need in infrastructure, health and education. For example, in 2006 government expenditures, converted to purchasing power parities, saw the government of Australia spend a little over US$6,131 per Australian, but the government of Cambodia was able to spend only $109, the government of Malawi only $122 and the government of Bangladesh $140 per individual citizen. In other words, when the governments of Cambodia, Bangladesh and Malawi seek to provide services to their people they have revenues that, in purchasing power terms, are less than 2.5 per cent of the purchasing power of the Australian government. Development assistance can help developing countries fill the financing gap. Yet let us not be fooled: aid alone cannot solve poverty. Developing countries must implement effective plans to lift their populations out of poverty and mobilise their own public and private resources to this end. But, even after they have done this, developing countries still may need assistance for the short term, provided by developed nations, to bridge the gap between their own resources and their needed resources. We know that well-used aid can achieve dramatic and rapid results. In recent years, Australia has made significant improvements to the volume and focus of its aid program, to the point where this year the budget is 0.32 per cent of Australia’s GDP, rising to 0.5 per cent by 2015. If the developing world is to engage and benefit from the resources provided by the developed world, the issue of corruption must be addressed. Corruption hurts countries, it harms communities and it scars individuals.

The Royal African Society in London have stated that Africa loses as much as US$148 billion a year in corruption-a figure that is accepted by the UN and the World Bank-which represents 25 per cent of the gross domestic product of African countries. They claim the money is rarely invested in Africa. Eliminating corruption globally will require significant effort by all countries. However, it will not be assisted by withholding aid from developing countries. Withholding aid is likely to only increase corruption and hurt the poorest and least powerful in the countries where aid is withheld. Instead, aid needs to be targeted in ways that do not assist corruption and that support parts of society that are seeking to tackle the corruption epidemic. Whilst the answers to lifting many of the world’s people out of poverty are complex, it must start with the leaders of the developing world being honest. It must start with corruption being anathema. I commend the work of Micah Challenge and I look forward to seeing the Millennium Development Goals realised. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Tourism Industry Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Ciobo: That the House: (1) condemns the Government for abandoning the tourism industry in a time of need; (2) notes the negative impact that the Government’s decision to reduce funding for Tourism Australia by $5.9 million in real terms will have on the tourism industry; (3) recognises that the Government’s $940 million of new tourism taxes will adversely affect the 483,000 Australians employed in the tourism industry; and (4) acknowledges that, in the new spirit of cooperative federalism, many State Labor Governments are following the example set by the Federal Government and are reducing their support for the tourism industry. It is often said that you can tell the nature of a friend by whether they are beside you or with you when you are doing it tough. That is the reason I moved this motion that is before the House today-firstly: That the House: (1) condemns the Government for abandoning the tourism industry in a time of need … government’s hypocrisy when it comes to apparently being supportive of Australia’s $85 million tourism industry than its actions at this very point in time, a time when this industry is most in need. Australia’s tourism industry employs some 480,000 Australians. It generates in excess of $20 billion in export earnings. Yet it is an industry that the Rudd Labor government has treated as a cash cow. The Tourism Forecasting Committee recently revised down forecasts for growth in inbound visitor arrivals for 2008 to zero. I repeat: zero. The Minister for Tourism has been travelling around Australia talking to tourism operators and others involved in the industry and saying, for example, as he did on the ABC’s PM interview with Mark Colvin on 28 July 2008: The tourism industry is actually doing it very tough at the moment.

154,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (7.45 Pm),"There could be no clearer example of the Rudd LaborFurther, on 19 June 2008, in answer to a question without notice, the minister said: I also appreciate that the tourism industry today is going through a huge challenge both domestically and internationally. Finally, on 30 July 2008-and I notice that ‘Scooter’, or I should say the member for Leichhardt, is in the chamber today-it was reported in the Cairns Post: Tourism Minister Martin Ferguson admitted the Australian tourism industry was struggling in a tough market. So we have all these sorts of claims from the Minister for Tourism-and I notice the member for Leichhardt nodding his head in agreement-that the tourism industry is doing it tough. We know the tourism industry, this $85 billion industry for Australia that employs some 480,000 Australians, is doing it tough. And what is the Rudd Labor government’s solution for an industry that is doing it tough? What would you expect of a government when an industry is on its knees, battling a high Aussie dollar, battling extremely competitive destinations? What would you expect a government to do? You might say ‘a tax break’. You might say ‘tax relief’. You might say ‘extra investment in the industry’. But what did the Rudd Labor government do that the member for Leichhardt is going to stand up and defend today? It introduced $1 billion in new tourism taxes. That is the record of the Rudd Labor government. That is what the member for Leichhardt dares to come into this chamber to defend: $1 billion in new tourism taxes on an industry that is already on its knees-and that is acknowledged by the tourism minister himself. Indeed, the minister went to Leichhardt in Far North Queensland, as I have done twice this year so far, to talk to local tour operators-and let me share something with the member for Leichhardt: they are not happy with you, member for Leichhardt. They not happy with the member for Leichhardt because all they get from him is Canberra’s voice in Cairns, not Cairns’s voice down here, not a representative for those tour operators who are literally withering on the vine at the moment because they have been slugged with $1 billion in new tourism taxes. No, what they hear from the member for Leichhardt-as they are about to hear again tonight-is a withering defence of this government’s appalling track record when it comes to the tourism industry. That is the reason why the first limb of this motion tonight is to condemn the Rudd Labor government for abandoning the tourism industry in its time of need-and they are not simply my words; they are the words of the tourism minister himself, a man who is a fair-weather friend. When it suits the two of them-when the minister is with the operators, just like the member for Leichhardt-they are out there saying to the industry, ‘We know you’re doing it tough and we’re here for you.’ But what do they do? They slug them with $1 billion in new taxes. That is their track record and, for that, they should be ashamed. The second limb of the motion is to note the negative impact that the Rudd Labor government’s decision to reduce funding for Tourism Australia by $5.9 million in real terms will have on the tourism industry. As I said, we already know that this Labor government has actually imposed a billion dollars of new taxes on an industry that is doing it tough. But, to rub salt into the wound, this is the same government that has now slashed funding for Tourism Australia by $5.9 million in real terms. There are all these brand-spanking-new as that the minister loves to roll out and talk about, about how this is going to lure tourists back to Australia and about how it is going to excite and mobilise the people of Australia to travel domesMAIN COMMITTEE tically. Guess what: there is now $5.9 million less available to actually promote tourism in this country. The third limb recognises that the Rudd Labor government’s $940 million of new tourism taxes will adversely affect the 483,000 Australians employed in the tourism industry. I will read some interesting quotes, again by the Minister for Tourism. He said: … we have had the tourism industry used to pad the government’s budget bottom line … through the increase in the passenger movement charge, which is ripping off the travelling public … Or perhaps this, again said by the tourism minister: I believe that the tourism industry is vital to the economic well-being of Australia and does not deserve to be hit by unnecessary taxes. The tax burden that faces the industry due to the GST is well documented. But what is worse is that the government is failing to rule out an increase in the passenger movement charge to pay for the much needed funding boost for the tourist industry. Someone logical might think that this is a robust defence by the Minister for Tourism, talking about how any increase in the passenger movement charge is ‘ripping off the travelling public’ and how these taxes were ‘used to pad the government’s budget bottom line’. Unfortunately, what I speak of here is nothing but rank hypocrisy by the Labor tourism minister. It is rank hypocrisy, because these comments were from 5 March 2003 and 12 February 2003, comments that the now tourism minister made when he dared to attack the previous coalition government’s track record on tourism. I am certainly more than willing to stand in this chamber today and make it very clear that, yes, there were occasions in the past when the Howard government did increase the passenger movement charge. But the key and fundamental difference is that the then coalition government supported the tourism industry with real funding increases and provided massive injections of funding for increased marketing, a restructuring of Tourism Australia and a tourism white paper. That was the coalition’s track record. So, if there were increases in the passenger movement charge, it was made sure that that money was channelled straight back to the tourism industry, and that stands in such stark contrast to Labor. I look forward to hearing the member for Leichhardt dare to defend not only the hypocrisy of the tourism minister but also the utter hypocrisy of the Labor government, which has turned its back on these sentiments and imposed $1 billion of new tourism taxes-$459 million through the passenger charge increase, $300 million through the Tourism Refund Scheme and $179.4 million of new taxes through increased tourism visas. This makes a grand total of $938.7 million of brand-new tourism taxes imposed by the Rudd Labor government and imposed by the Labor tourism minister, who only a matter of years ago dared to question the previous government’s commitment to tourism because we increased these amounts, but we also provided in the tourism white paper additional funding for Tourism Australia. The fourth limb acknowledges that, in the new spirit of cooperative federalism that we hear so much about from the Labor Party, many state Labor governments have decided to follow the example set by the federal Labor government and are also reducing their support for the tourism industry. As I have said, we have seen $5.9 million axed from Tourism Australia’s budget by the Labor government, but we see across the board, over the period from 2001 to 2008-09, decreases-or I should say slashes-in tourism funding that amount to a cut in South Australia of 46 per cent, a cut in New South Wales of 28 per cent, a cut in the ACT of 10 per cent and a cut in Queensland of nine per cent. That is Labor’s record: slashed support MAIN COMMITTEE for the tourism industry of between nine per cent, in Queensland, and 46 per cent, in South Australia. SoI say to the member for Leichhardt: stop being an apologist for your Rudd government back in Leichhardt. Recognise that your industry is doing it tough and for once have the spine, the backbone, to stand up for those operators in your electorate that are doing it so very tough, as they are across Australia. Recognise that this Rudd Labor government’s record and the Minister for Tourism’s record on their lack of support for tourism deserve to be condemned. Any government that imposes $1 billion of new taxes and slashes funding by $5.9 million deserves to have it very loudly made known to tourism operators that it has not stood by the industry. The government have walked away from the industry. In walking away from the industry they have consigned many people to the unemployment scrapheap. try to the Australian economy, not only in our big cities but also in our regional areas. It is great to be here tonight with the member for Forde, who I know is a strong proponent of the tourism industry in his local electorate and his local region, as I am a strong proponent of the tourism industry in my region of tropical North Queensland and the great city of Cairns. I am not sure which mushroom the shadow minister for tourism has been hiding under in bringing this motion forward, but it is a pretty outrageous motion, particularly considering the current economic climate facing the tourism industry in this country and some of the tough times it has gone through. I know that what the tourism industry thrives on is confidence. What it is looking for from the government-and, one would hope, from the opposition-is some sort of support for the industry in the form of continuing to work with it and developing confidence in it. To suggest that the Rudd government is doing nothing to support the tourism industry is really a shameful act by the shadow minister, as is bringing this motion here tonight. We only have to look at the actions of the Rudd government to see that in the short term we are working with industry, with the release of our new campaign, through Tourism Australia, built off the Australia movie. I think it is a fantastic campaign. I hear positive feedback about it from the tourism industry in my local area. We are showing through our National Long-Term Tourism Strategy that we are committed to ensuring that we have a long-term plan for the tourism industry in this country. So we are working in the short term as well as in the long term. We have a national aviation strategy. Aviation is critically important to tourism in this country and we are going to build support for the aviation industry going forward. We are also moving forward on a process of national accreditation to ensure that the industry provides the highest level of service to tourists when they come to this country. The government have also been proactively managing the Approved Destination Status scheme, recently suspending companies from the scheme due to immigration and quality-of-tourism breaches. The government is also undertaking a range of microeconomic reform to support small businesses, the backbone of the tourism industry. They have been struggling with the skills crisis. They are looking for a government to invest in infrastructure. They are looking for a government that provides some certainty in industrial relations and gets the balance right. We are doing that. We have tackled some of the immigration bottlenecks that built up under the former Howard government and prevented the industry from getting skilled workers. We are dealing with some of the red tape issues in areas like superannuation. MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
155,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (7.55 Pm),"The tourism industry is a very important indusI tell you that in my area tourism is built on natural icons, like it is in many parts of Australia. I see the member for Forde here, who I am sure would agree. People are looking for a government that is going to tackle climate change and take this issue seriously, because it is a real threat to our natural icons and to our tourism industry. I mentioned the National Long-Term Tourism Strategy. The National Long-Term Tourism Strategy will provide long-term vision for the tourism industry. It will establish the basis for consistent, long-term policy engagement with the tourism industry by successive governments. It is aimed at strengthening the tourism industry supply side capacity and maximising the net economic benefits to industry in Australia. The tourism strategy, like the government, is focused very much on working with the industry. We have taken a bipartisan approach. We have put together the strategy, and I congratulate the minister for it. Margaret Jackson is the chair of the steering committee. Members include people who have supported the opposition, such as Matt Hingerty. We are not taking a partisan approach to tourism. We are looking to work with the industry in partnership to build it into the longer term. I talked about the Australia campaign that was released recently. This is a fantastic initiative by Tourism Australia. I want to congratulate Geoff Buckley, his board and his team on bringing it together. This ‘come walkabout’ campaign not only builds on the natural icons that we have in this country but also links in with some of the challenges that people find in their busy everyday lives and how they look to go on holidays to seek to find themselves and, in finding themselves, to have more rewarding lives. I think Tourism Australia have done fantastic work. I was at the Tourism Tropical North Queensland awards on Saturday night. They played the advertisement there and it received a huge round of applause. Rob Giason, the local TTNQ CEO, wanted to play it again later. The industry is really looking forward to gaining leverage off this campaign to attract tourists back to Australia. The member opposite talked about tourism operators and made some disparaging comments about this government, but the feedback I get from operators is very positive-although they have commented on some of the previous campaigns. One of the big operators in my electorate, Mr Charles Woodward, said the former government’s campaign through Tourism Australia, the ‘Where the bloody hell are you’ campaign, was a complete disaster, particularly in markets like Japan. And you might ask: ‘Where the bloody hell has the shadow minister been bringing this sort of motion forward? Where the bloody hell has he been? Hiding under a mushroom?’ Mr Woodward said that it was essential that Australia got back to basics and focused on nature based tourism. The Australia campaign, through Tourism Australia, not only focuses on those natural icons but also links in with people’s busy lives. The campaign is going to be delivered across Europe and America, and the eastern nations will be promoting and delivering that campaign. The industry is very supportive of it, as I have said. The advertisement on the internet has had some fantastic hits and it was also presented at the recent tourism awards in Cairns. I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that coming from an electorate like Leichhardt, where tourism is particularly important to the local economy, I do understand how important it is to have the government supporting the tourism industry. The industry in my local community is worth $2.8 billion. We had 4.2 million visitors who were drawn to the region last year, and there are 7,100 tourism related businesses in my local area. We have some fantastic tourism hubs, whether in my local town of Cairns, or Kuranda, Port Douglas, Cooktown or all MAIN COMMITTEE the way up to the Torres Strait. We have some fantastic towns that depend on tourism, and they deliver some fantastic experiences. The region offers an array of experiences to visitors, including outdoor adventures, the outback, culture and heritage and Indigenous culture, as well as food and wine. There is increasing development in agricultural tourism, and of course we have the rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. Clearly, tourism is fundamental to Cairns and tropical North Queensland. It is particularly important to me and to the Minister for Tourism. We took a hit this year with the decision by Qantas to cut flights between Japan and Cairns in December. That is going to impact on our local industry. We are going to lose 62 per cent of total flight capacity out of Japan later this year. Estimates are that it is going to cost the industry around $100 million. I met with the Minister for Tourism on the day that that happened, and we discussed the issue. I worked with the local tourism industry through TTNQ, and I congratulate Rob Giason and his team for the work that they have done in working with us and with the Queensland government. We will continue to work with them with our $4 million package to support the industry through these difficult times. We have already announced $750,000 in marketing support for charter flights from Cairns to Japan and from Japan to Cairns. We want to ensure that the industry is well placed to deal with the cutback later this year. We are putting in place some short-term support for the industry, particularly in terms of marketing and support for charters. We are also working to make sure that the industry is supported into the longer term. We have some work happening and we are working with the industry in developing that with some research and analysis to ensure that we are well placed to take advantage of developing markets, whether they are in Korea, China or India. The Prime Minister has taken a direct interest in tourism in my electorate, and he was particularly interested in ensuring that we responded appropriately following those Qantas cuts. He rang me from Japan. He took a real interest in how our package was going down in tropical North Queensland. AndI know the industry has appreciated not only the minister’s interest-he has been up there twice in the last couple of months to meet with the industry and discuss our package-but also, as I have said, the Prime Minister’s interest. As I said-(Time expired) expired. Kokoda Track Campaign Debate resumed, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the House: (1) recognises the importance of the Kokoda Track campaign in World War II in stopping the overland Japanese advance to Port Moresby, which would have given the enemy a beachhead into Australia; (2) acknowledges the courage, endurance, mateship and sacrifice demonstrated by the Australian Defence personnel during the Kokoda battles; (3) pays tribute to the contribution of Papua New Guinea (PNG) nationals, specifically the Koiari people affectionately known as “Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels” in carrying supplies and equipment for Australian soldiers in the Kokoda campaign as well as the carriage of wounded to safety; (4) notes that the Kokoda battles were fought in PNG from July 1942 on Australian soil; and MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of

The time allotted for this debate has(5) in recognition of this contribution, urges the Australian Government to: (a) acknowledge the service of the PNG nationals affectionately known as “Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels”; (b) direct the new Defence Awards and Honours Tribunal to promptly determine the most appropriate form of medal or recognition for the remaining “Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels” or their surviving families; (c) consider any other appropriate initiatives including making a small ex-gratia payment to each “Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel”, in recognition of their contribution over and above the call of duty; and (d) examine, and where appropriate fund initiatives to upgrade the health and education status of the PNG people in the isolated villages along the Kokoda Track. from the Japanese, Papua New Guinean nationals with their local knowledge came to the assistance of Australian soldiers fighting to protect this country. When Japanese troops landed at the tiny seaside village of Buna on the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea on 21 July 1942, securing Port Moresby was considered the final hurdle for the Japanese before advancing onto Australian soil. Standing in their way was the Australian 39th Militia Battalion in the harsh conditions of the Kokoda Track. Steep ridges plunging to even deeper valleys and mosquito-infested swamps, combined with constant tropical downpours and searing heat and humidity, were just some of the conditions and obstacles faced by the Australian diggers. In conditions foreign to Australian soldiers, our diggers had the assistance of the PNG nationals, whose local knowledge and bush skills proved invaluable in enabling the diggers to create and maintain a human supply line between the front line deep in the jungle and the base at Port Moresby. Fuzzy wuzzy angels brought food and ammunition in packs usually weighing around 20 kilos or more to the diggers up the track. On their return journey they acted as stretcher-bearers, carrying wounded diggers back to safety. Considering the critical role these PNG nationals played in helping Australia to halt the Japanese advance, it is a disappointment that our nation is yet to formally recognise the significant role of the Koiari people. In bringing this motion before the House, may I pay tribute to the work of my colleague from that other place, Senator Barnett, who initiated this motion in the Senate to recognize the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Senator Barnett felt compelled to do so after he and a group of 17 trekkers walked the 96-kilometre track during April in honour of the Australian diggers and to raise money for juvenile diabetes research funding. It was during a recent diabetes function celebrating this trek that I was fortunate to be seated alongside Papua New Guinea’s High Commissioner to Australia, Charles W. Lepani. The High Commissioner was deeply touched by the motion. Fears that such recognition would pave the way for compensation are not a reason to delay recognition of the role the fuzzy wuzzy angels played in assisting the Australian soldiers. Credit should be given where credit is due. To rectify the lack of formal recognition, I join with my colleagues in this place and in the Senate in calling on the Australian government to direct the new Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal to promptly determine the most appropriate form of medal or recognition for the remaining fuzzy wuzzy angels or their surviving families. Other initiatives also need to be considered in recognition of their contribution over and above the call of duty, including making a small ex gratia payment to each fuzzy wuzzy angel MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Apheda Was Established In 1984 As The Overseas Agency Of The Australian Council Of
157,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (8.05 Pm),"During a time when our nation was under attackand, where appropriate, funding initiatives to upgrade the health and education status of the Papua New Guinean people in villages along the Kokoda Track. The Kokoda campaign was one of the most significant for Australia during World War II. Our nation needs to recognise all those who played a role in protecting our country. I deeply appreciate the bipartisan support of my colleagues in this motion and I thank all of them for the contribution that they will make to the debate and, once again, I think it is long overdue that we acknowledge the courage, the endurance, the mateship and the sacrifice demonstrated by Australian Defence personnel during the Kokoda battles, but also, importantly, that we recognise those fuzzy wuzzy angels who made the way just that little bit more bearable in conditions that were truly shocking. member for Pearce in this very noble motion. I would like to join with her-and I am sure others would too-if the member for Pearce would like to, to write a bipartisan letter to the parliamentary secretary to put before the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. I would be more than happy to support her to do that. The Kokoda Track or Kokoda Trail campaign is infamous for a lot of reasons. First and foremost, it is infamous for the nature of the combat that took place on that stretch of Papua New Guinean soil in July and particularly August 1942. I believe up to 4,000 people lost their lives in that campaign, not to mention the many that were wounded. You only need to look at Damien Parer’s films, particularly Kokoda Frontline, just to try and appreciate for a moment the degree of difficulty of the area and the nature of the warfare that took place there. The trail itself is infamous for its physical nature. Very quickly: the track was approximately 100 miles, or 160 kilometres, long and folded into a series of ridges which rose to 7,000 feet and then declined again to 3,000 feet. It was covered in thick jungle, with short trees and tall trees tangled with vines. From looking at Parer’s pictures, I know it constantly rained and then they would be knee deep or ankle deep in mud. It is a very difficult piece of physical terrain. It is also infamous for the controversy over whether it is a trail or track. I hate to disappoint the trackers, but I think the official Australian War Memorial conclusion is that ‘trail’ appears to be the most widely used. However, most people call it the ‘bloody track’, so that is what we will use. It is infamous for the courage, heroism and sheer effort of those who campaigned there. It is infamous for the extraordinary story of two groups in particular. The first was the 39th Battalion, which was effectively a militia force and known as the chockos. They were much maligned until Damien Parer’s films came out and showed the extraordinary effort they made as a group of young men, young militias. They basically would have just learned to clean a rifle before they got up there and faced the onslaught of a most hardened, very difficult and very courageous enemy. Then they were reinforced by the 53rd Battalion, 21st AIF Brigade and the 2nd/14th Infantry Battalion. The other group-and this is important for the motion that the member for Pearce so eloquently put-was an equally remarkable group of Papua New Guinean people affectionately dubbed the ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’. Again, in seeing Damien Parer’s film-and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this area, and we should be-you really do appreciate what they did. He filmed on site and he lived the same life as the soldiers and the fuzzy wuzzy angels. The film illustrates quite clearly that for 40 wounded they used groups of eight bearers.

158,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (8.09 Pm),"It gives me great pleasure to support theThere were four carriers and four resting-if you could call it resting-and then they took over. The persons carried were literally carried by groups of eight. You had 350 natives, fuzzy wuzzy angels, supporting the wounded as stretcher bearers. They carried heaps of equipment. They carried messages. They appeared to never complain and to be ever careful. I think this is demonstrated most poignantly-for those who would like to have a look at it-in the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels poem by Sapper ‘Bert’ Beros, who wrote in on the trail in 1942. It gives a great demonstration. What is terrific about it, too, is the mother’s reply, saying thank you to them all. We have had ample description by people who witnessed first hand what the fuzzy wuzzy angels did. There is plenty of literature to show you that. The most important thing is that, like the Nashos in the past and a pet of mine, Teddy Sheean-but unlike Teddy in this sense-they have not been recognised formally. It is quite extraordinary that all those to a person who partook in the campaigns said, ‘We want to recognise them; we should recognise them.’ The motion of the member for Pearce does that directly. I would like to write, with her and others here, to the parliamentary secretary, a letter to be put before the awards tribunal to ask that the fuzzy wuzzy angels get what they duly deserve-that is, our true recognition. (Time expired) for Pearce. There are many people who say that foreign forces have never invaded Australia. They would say that, when you look at all the armed conflicts we have been involved in, Australians have always fought battles away from our own territory. This is very much a post1970s view. We should of course remember that in World War II the Japanese did in fact invade Australian territory. Most Australians may not recall that, apart from Japanese air raids which decimated parts of Darwin and northern Western Australia, as well as the sinking of HMAS Kuttabul by midget subs in Sydney, Japanese forces did actually invade Australian sovereign territory during 1942. I am of course referring to what is now known as Papua New Guinea, which was then the Australian protectorate of Papua. One of the most critical campaigns that Australians were involved in during World War II was that fought along the Kokoda Trail, in the Owen Stanley Ranges. Stretching for over a hundred kilometres in some of the most rugged and inhospitable terrain in the world, it is traversable only by foot. This proved to be a logistical nightmare for the movement of ammunition and medical and other supplies for Australian soldiers who fought to prevent the Japanese from establishing a base at Port Moresby. The Kokoda and subsequent campaigns in New Guinea were pivotal events in our history as they represented the first time that Australian territory had actually been threatened directly by an enemy during an armed conflict. These battles formed part of the battle for Australia, fought primarily in the South Pacific. It was also the first time Australians had fought and defeated an invader on Australian soil without the direct assistance of the United Kingdom. The Kokoda campaign further complemented Australia’s emergence as a nation in its own right, as well as its military effectiveness. With an overwhelming superiority in numbers, with 30,000-strong mostly Australian forces, they suffered approximately only 625 casualties as opposed to Japanese losses of around 6,500. Courage, mateship and sacrifice are all examples of the qualities that are part of the ANZAC legend first mythologised by Charles Edward Bean during the First World War. It could also be argued, however, that these terms can also apply to the ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’, especially the Koiari people, who carried supplies and equipment for Australian soldiers.

159,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.14 Pm),"I wish to support the motion moved by the memberThey were often called ‘as gentle as a bush nurse’, and it is believed that not one known injured digger was ever abandoned by a fuzzy wuzzy angel. Without the assistance of the fuzzy wuzzy angels and their invaluable knowledge of local terrain, it is questionable whether Australian forces would have been able to prevent the continued onslaught of the Japanese. Unaware of local conditions, the orders given by senior Australian commanders were largely unrealistic and impossible to implement. Armed with local knowledge, however, Australian diggers were far better equipped to defeat Japanese forces than they would otherwise have been.

Economy is happening to local business across the nation. The global economic crisis is having an impact, but the bigger impact is a crisis of confidence driven by this Labor government’s response to that global economic crisis. When the Labor government came to power, the first thing they did was to talk down the economy and talk up inflation. ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle’ is what was said. Now that the crisis is upon us, Mr Rudd is siding with the banks and not pressuring them to pass on the benefits of the interest rate cuts. Whose side are you on? Certainly not on the side of small business, not on the side of families who had plans to retire, not on the side of pensioners who expect an increase in your next budget-and now you are saying that an increase may have to be put off until much later. Last FridayI held a local business roundtable in my electorate of Greenway and I was honoured to have the Hon. Julie Bishop, shadow Treasurer, as my guest to listen to local business owners small, medium and large offer their account of the impact of the Labor government’s imprudent choice of language at this very worrying time. With one voice, this mix of accountants, hospitality leaders, real estate agents, nursery and landscape suppliers, franchisees and customised craftsman-built producers agreed that the Prime Minister, instead of building business confidence and encouraging people to hang in there, was instilling fear and uncertainty. All report an increase in bad debts and a decrease in sales. Conferences and meetings are being cancelled.

People who were thinking of retiring are putting it off and holding on to their jobs while that job is still there. For the first time since the 1970s very successful shopping centres have vacant shops. We are seeing an increase in interest for self-managing personal super as people do not want to lose what they have and believe they can take control of their own funds better by themselves. There has also been a shift from tourism into groceries as people prioritise their spending. Businesses report that sales of big-ticket items have slowed and sales of lipstick, champagne and chocolate are increasing-a sure sign that ordinary people are anxious. What Australian business needs right now is strong leadership and a vision business can believe in. But what do they get? A Prime Minister and a Treasurer who are devoid of ideas and comprehension about what is needed at this time. Thanks to the competent economic performance of the coalition when in government, Australia has been left with an economy that had no government debt and a huge surplus. It is an inconvenient truth for the Rudd Labor government that the coalition has a proven record of sound financial management. The Rudd Labor government has yet to prove itself. To date its record is showing signs of failurefailure to properly and strongly reassure this nation that, because of Australia’s strong economic position, the legacy of the coalition, we have the best chance of any country in the world of riding out this economic storm. There is failure to stand up to the unions, who have become very active since Labor came to government. There has been an 800 per cent increase in strikes this year compared to the same period last year. There is failure to stay home when this government needs its Prime Minister: 16 overseas trips since November and a trip by Mr Swan, the Treasurer, to watch what was happening with the New York Stock Exchange. The coalition has not been sitting and watching; the coalition has been listening to the public. We have heard the concerns out there in the community and recently the coalition leader and the shadow Treasurer gave Mr Rudd a lesson in leadership. The coalition called on the government to take action immediately to increase the guarantee on deposits with banks, building societies and credit unions from $20,000 to $100,000; to put not $4 billion into the home lending market but $10 billion to make a real difference in stimulating that market; and to abandon the 2010 start date for the emissions trading scheme. Businesses are distracted by the necessity of the 2010 deadline. They should be concentrating on managing their business while the economic crisis looms large. The test of leadership will be how the Prime Minister responds to the coalition’s call to stimulate the home lending market and to postpone the emissions trading scheme. Make no mistake: Australia’s banking industry is very strong, but business has had enough. They tell me they have lost confidence in Mr Rudd and Mr Swan to come up with the right responses. They tell me that the fear, uncertainty and doubt being put out there by the government are the most obvious sign of what the future holds under Labor. Business will cope with this crisis. They will adapt and change-and they are alreadydiversify, cut back and find niche markets. Many will not just survive but will grow. The business people who met with me are ordinary Australians who have worked hard to build up their businesses. They are people who have families. They tell me that the damage being done through the crisis of confidence is being manifested in a number of ways: ordinary Australians, working families, have started migration to the country to cheaper housing; singles and MAIN COMMITTEE couples have started to move back home with their parents; and financially astute people are paying off credit cards and other debts, even though, as has been reported, that payment is as minimal as $20 a week. The Treasurer says that Australians should expect higher unemployment as the economy slows down. A strong leader would be looking at job creation but, to date, there has been no leadership in that respect. In fact, the opposite is happening. The government is scrapping Work for the Dole, a very successful scheme that helped the unemployed into jobs. The coalition worked very hard to develop an environment where business had confidence to employ people, and we saw unemployment fall to a record 30-year low. Under Labor, where will we be this time next year? Businesses face a tough time during the current global economic crisis, and they need to be encouraged and given confidence to move forward. The Rudd government had an opportunity to show leadership by pressuring the banks to pass on all the one per cent increase interest rate cut but, instead, it sided with the banks. The coalition called on the banks to pass on the full interest rate cut. We are seeing every day that the people who need relief are small businesses and mortgage holders. Uncertainty is having a big impact and no new jobs will be created. In fact, jobs are being put at risk, but it does not have to be that way. I return to my opening statement: the global economic crisis is having an impact, but the bigger impact is a crisis of confidence driven by poor leadership and a lack of ideas and a proper understanding of what is happening with small business in this nation. Peacekeeping Memorials have. I am probably not so much aggrieved by specifics other than my concern and frustration for the memory of veterans in our community. As you know, on many occasions I have spoken in this chamber and the other chamber about our veterans and about the areas of huge significance in my region. TonightI want to talk about the motion by the member for Pearce, who spoke about the Kokoda Trail, the commemoration and how we recognise and remember in history the achievements and the sacrifices that our military people have made. Tonight, I bring the attention of the House to the area of peacekeeping. The functions of peacekeeping and peacemaking are very important to our military, and a long history is associated with peacekeeping. My frustration is that, like the Kokoda memorials and like our quickly vanishing history, the living history of our veterans disappears year by year. If we do not capture and understand our past-in this case, the military and our veterans-we will lose the history in time. It was very interesting for me to have hosted very recently our Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Dr Mike Kelly, a man who has had a much esteemed military career. I brought him into the region to show him what is currently the only peacekeeping memorial in the country, and it sits in the seat of Forde, very close to other areas of significance that I have spoken about in previous times. As you know, I have sung the praises of Canungra, a well known military installation within the electorate of Forde, and not so very far up the road we have the memorial to the peacekeepers and the peacemakers. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the dedication of Australia’s peacekeepers. We must recognise their dedication and commitment and recognise our military history. Australian Peacekeepers Day was held on 14 September 2008. This year marks some 61 years MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Grievance Debate
163,Mr Raguse (Forde) (8.42 Pm),"TonightI want to speak a little about a concern that Isince Australian peacekeeping operations began. Many may not be aware that Australian peacekeepers have served in more than 26 areas of operations since the Second World War and more recently in the Middle East, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In fact, about 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel are presently deployed on more than 10 operations around the world. A number of defence personnel are also deployed on exchange, thirdcountry deployments and special tasks, such as support to border protection operations. Some of those peacekeeping missions have been Operation Catalyst, Operation Slipper, Operation Paladin in the Middle East, Operation Citadel in East Timor, Operation Anode in the Solomons, Operation Osier in Bosnia, Operation Mazurka in the Sinai, Operation Palate in Afghanistan and Operation Pomelo in Eritrea and Ethiopia. I would particularly like to bring attention to a certain constituent in my electorate who has been working very hard to ensure that we remember and pay tribute to those peacekeeping missions that many of our Australian personnel have been involved in. At this stage I would like to acknowledge Bob Whiley, an ex-serviceman in my electorate who is very passionate about ensuring that peacekeeping is acknowledged in a memorial. Bob’s passion started when his son was deployed on a peacekeeping mission in East Timor. It is fitting that there is a memorial to remind the community of those brave men and women who served in peacekeeping missions. Bob is a member of the south Queensland branch of the Australian Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Veterans Association. The only memorial currently in the country-until, as I mentioned before, a national memorial is established next year-is located in my electorate, in Carl Heck Boulevard in Windaroo. It is the only peacekeeping memorial in the country. This government has committed to establishing a national memorial in Canberra. Just over a week ago, the member for Eden-Monaro and Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Mike Kelly, visited the peacekeepers memorial. Mike was certainly impressed with the hard work and effort that Bob Whiley put in towards the establishment of this memorial back in 2000 and his ongoing enthusiasm to support and commemorate veterans. It was significant and fitting that Mike Kelly was able to name the peacekeeping missions that he himself had been involved in-and there were some four or five that he recognised on the plaque. I know that he was impressed by the fact that we have established this memorial. We probably need to consider how we can do this across the country. There are peacekeepers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we should continue to be reminded of their service. Peacekeeping is an often forgotten aspect of war. It is planned that on 14 September 2009, next year, there will be a national memorial unveiled in Canberra-all things being equal and taking into account some of the fundraising that has to occur-to honour all those who have served and those who continue to serve in peacekeeping operations. The proposed memorial will include those from the Australian Defence Force; from federal, state and territory police forces; and from government agencies who have served and made the ultimate sacrifice in peacekeeping operations commanded or authorised by the United Nations or sanctioned by the government of Australia. The memorial will commemorate and recognise the courage and sacrifice of Australian peacekeepers in the same spirit as other conflicts that are remembered by other cenotaphs. It will also celebrate Australia’s contribution to international peacekeeping since Australia’s commitment to the first UN peacekeeping mission on 14 September 1947. MAIN COMMITTEE I am pleased to note that one of the donors to this project is RSL Queensland. I implore all organisations that have some understanding of the work of the peacekeepers, through their veterans organisations, to support the establishment of other peacekeeping memorials. I would also like to acknowledge the Australian Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Veterans Association. I look forward to working with Bob Whiley and the Australian Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Veterans Association and to helping them in their journey to get some of these memorials recognised. We also need to ensure that our military memorials are maintained and woven into the fabric of our local history. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this House about areas of significance in my electorate. I have talked about Canungra and there is also Tabragalba, where the Z force trained during the Second World War. Commandos trained in that very region. These areas are disappearing very quickly without any recognition, and for me it is about trying to establish that these are precincts in the electorate of Forde but probably, spearheaded by the notion of our future engagements, it will be more about peacekeeping and peacemaking. I think it fits very well and I am pleased that today I can bring attention to this particular issue. At Camp Cable, 20,000 American troops who were stationed there during the war were mobilised for the Battle of the Coral Sea. We heard speeches this evening about Kokoda and what occurred on our doorstep. Most people know that areas in the north of Western Australia were under attack and so was Townsville. Townsville was considered a front line one month before the Battle of the Coral Sea raged out in the Pacific. The mainland of Australia was actually bombed and Townsville was one of the targets. I would like to sum up by saying that, while I have identified my region as a significant military precinct, General MacArthur drew the so-called ‘Brisbane line’ from where Australia was going to be defended. If we were attacked we were going to ultimately defend from Brisbane, because the logistics would allow us to mount a great defence and wear out the logistics and the supply lines of the invading Japanese. This history is very significant for our region for all the reasons that I have given tonight, particularly in light of my concern about getting recognition for the peacekeepers and ensuring that the national memorial goes ahead. We should continue to raise funds to provide a very fitting memorial for those people who have served in the capacity of peacekeeping and peacemaking. It is a very important part of our military role in this day and age. To be part of a combat force in another country is not necessarily the way we need to go. It is about peacemaking, peacekeeping and the dedication to that. In closing, I would like to say that I am going to continue to push this. Hopefully, on 14 September 2009 we will be able to unveil that national memorial. People like Bob Whiley in my electorate are working very hard, and I will be supporting them to ensure that we do not forget the courageous contribution that the peacekeepers and peacemakers of this country have made. Apprenticeships Identity Fraud Ms LEY (Farrer) (8.52 pm)-Tonight during the grievance debate I would like to talk about two issues. One is relevant to my electorate of Farrer, and that concerns apprentices and apprenticeships. The other is related to my role as spokesperson for justice and customs within the opposition and is relevant to everybody in this place, and that concerns identity fraud. Identity fraud is something that we need to be particularly well aware of this week, beMAIN COMMITTEE cause 13-17 October is National Identity Fraud Awareness Week. I would like to give members some sense of what this means when it happens to an individual, how easy it is to have your identity stolen and what you should do to make sure that it does not happen. Identity fraud occurs when a person’s personal information is used, without their knowledge, by someone else to obtain credit, goods or other services fraudulently. Victims of identity theft bear significant financial and emotional costs in regaining their identity and credit ratings, and the Rudd Labor government really does need to work to improve identity security, to fight identity crime and to protect the identities of innocent Australians from being used for illegal purposes. One of the most common ways in which one’s identity can be stolen is quite obvious, and that is raiding bins for information found on bank and credit card statements. It is amazing how many people throw these statements out with their ordinary rubbish and then they end up at the tip, or somebody simply lifts the lid of the bin and helps themselves. Internet sites regularly ask users to share personal information to gain access to websites and to buy goods. Fraudsters can combine the personal information-such as your mother’s maiden name-that you provide to unsecured internet sites with other bits of valuable information that they find out about you to obtain credit in your name. Card skimming occurs when a shop assistant or waiter, for example, gets your information by skimming or copying your credit card information when you make a purchase. This information is then often onsold to professional criminal organisations. If you leave your credit or debit card at a restaurant or retail outlet, do not ring them and say, ‘Yes, it is there,’ and go back and pick it up, because during that time any amount of fraud can be conducted in your name. Mail forwarding is another method. By completing change-of-address forms to redirect mail, fraudsters can receive a wealth of information about you delivered to their nominated address or post office box. ‘Phishing’ is a term that describes identity theft via email. Fraudsters will send an email claiming to be from a bank or other official organisation and ask for urgent information whereby you have to enter account details and passwords to update your account. I am sure we have all received those, and some of them look incredibly realistic. For example, I applied for a debit card recently in order to get out of the credit card rate race. Immediately, my inbox was flooded with very realistic emails from the bank asking that I update my information and provide seemingly innocent information. I know that many people do fall into this trap. Another obvious case of having your identity stolen is when your purse or wallet is stolen. When something is stolen, it is tedious, time consuming and difficult to go through all of the things that you need to do to re-establish cards, bank accounts and Medicare et cetera, but you need to do that and you need to be very vigilant from that point onwards if you believe that you have had some part of your identity stolen. To actively prevent identity fraud, people need to check their credit reports at credit reference agencies to ensure that no credit or other accounts have been illegally set up in their name. They can do this with three main agencies in Australia-Baycorp Advantage, Dun and Bradstreet and the Tasmanian Collection Service. They need to shred all documents to ensure that fraudsters cannot build up a profile based on the information they discard in their rubbish, stay safe online by making sure they have the latest security patches and up-to-date antivirus software installed, protect their incoming mail, lock their mailbox, pay attention to billing MAIN COMMITTEE cycles and contact creditors immediately if their bills arrive late-as a missing bill could mean that a fraudster has taken over their account. Passwords help to provide extra protection to important accounts. We noted the high-profile case of hacking when US Republican vicepresidential candidate Sarah Palin had her email hacked into. It was a relatively easy process, I understand. People should use passwords that are very difficult for others to figure out, even if they may forget them themselves. They should be vigilant and aware of anybody who contacts them unexpectedly asking for personal information. A couple of quick examples will highlight the problem. In 1997 a 24-year-old female applied for 61 credit cards in false names; 45 were granted. Some of these identities were fictitious but many of them were real, including those of some people known to her from her school days. This resulted in the destruction of access to credit for many, one of whom also suffered the additional indignity of being named by the applicant as her co-offender and mentor in the frauds. In another case, a male assumed the identities of four babies who had died in the 1970s by obtaining their birth certificates. Over an eightmonth period he obtained $20,800 in the form of unemployment benefits in the dead infants’ names. He was arrested in possession of many false proof-of-ID documents to support his welfare claims, including motor vehicle learners permits, mobile phone accounts, student cards, rental leases and bank account access cards. So please do not let this happen to you. Increasingly, the world of modern innovative telecommunications intersects with transnational global crime. High-tech affects us all every day and it is very useful and handy to have access to these sorts of tools. Yet the ability to commit fraud is increasing. There need to be some very serious proactive measures by governments, because the tools that fraudsters are using are often barely even thought of. For example, on an ordinary website that I check every day, I noticed an advertisement today for sending money to various banks in India. All you need is your cell phone. In the old days we used to hear of money being wired across the world and that was a big deal. But this is something that is morphing. A few details are entered into a computer and something comes up on your cell phone, which you then take to a financial institution, and it is turned into money. The other side of this, of course, is the way in which money is laundered around the world. This has devastating effects and is linked with organised crime. National Identity Fraud Awareness Week is this week. In the time remaining, I want to talk about the importance of apprenticeships to all Australian families and my concerns about apprentices in my electorate at the moment. A major concern we have is the lack of staff to supervise and train apprentices. I say that because at the moment, with the possibility-in fact, some would say the inevitability-of the economy turning downwards, the willingness of employers to invest in apprentices is likely to back off. We need small and larger businesses, but particularly small businesses, to take that time to supervise, train and invest in apprentices. But too often we find that when the job market does take a turn for the worse, first-year apprentices are the first to go because they are of the least value to the company. That is devastating for the young people involved because they have, in many cases, worked hard to get themselves on this first rung of their working life. The money is not good. They have probably given up a lot to be there. It is so important that in times of increasing unemployment special measures need to be put in place to protect apprentices. I have certainly argued for this in the context of the town of Broken Hill in my electorate of Farrer, which recently lost over 400 workers from the Perilya mine, mainly due to the downMAIN COMMITTEE turn in the price of zinc. Caught up in this are the apprentices who work in the mine, and it is most important that if the mine is not able to give them a job then some program be introduced into the local community to help the other employers support these apprentices in the short term until they can get back into employment in their chosen field so that we do not lose them. I certainly noticed during my time as the member for Farrer that the previous government invested a lot in apprenticeships. It established Australian technical colleges that were hitting the ground running. We now have this government’s trade training schools. I do not think they are going to do the job nearly as well. A key focus of the previous government’s tech colleges was their industry focus and their endorsement by industry, and this is the key for any apprentice or trades training effort-that is, that it be very closely linked to the activities in the region so that the link between industry, the training provider and the apprentice works well and the results are positive for everyone. As Andrew Pressler from West State Training in Broken Hill said recently: Apprentices need to learn the balance of work placement and TAFE classes. The final year is all on-site training and they need that time to settle in. (Time expired) Mental Health Week Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (9.02 pm)-Last week I was afforded the honour of opening Participate 08, a health and well-being expo in Launceston which was part of Mental Health Week. The expo focused on mental health promotion, education, prevention and early intervention. It was a great opportunity to educate the community about mental health. It was also a great way to encourage communities to actively participate in their own mental health and well-being. In the lead-up to the event and in researching exactly what Participate 08 was all about, I had to stop and reflect on the impact of mental illness on people, their families and the wider community. It will come as no surprise to you, Madam Deputy Chair Saffin, to learn that mental illness is on the increase in our community. In my electorate of Bass and in my home state of Tasmania it is becoming more prevalent among children and adolescents as well as older people. This indicates that more and more young people are suffering from ailments like depression and autism, but also it is indicative of Tasmania’s ageing population. Exactly what do we understand by the term ‘mental illness’? There are many things which fall under this very broad umbrella. Perhaps the most common mental illness is depression. According to the World Health Organisation, depression will be the second largest killer after heart disease by 2020 and studies show that depression is a contributory factor to fatal coronary disease. Thirty per cent of women are depressed. Men’s depression rate was assumed to be half that of women, but new estimates have it higher. Forty-one per cent of depressed women are too embarrassed to seek help, 54 per cent of people believe depression is a personal weakness and 80 per cent of depressed people are not currently having any treatment at all. If these statistics indicate anything, it is the importance of talking about these issues openly and honestly. If someone has cancer, we talk about it. If someone breaks a leg or an arm, we talk about it. I hope that through events like the health and well-being expo and annual events like Mental Health Week we can break down barriers and do away with the stigma all too often associated with mental illness because, let us be honest, it affects a whole lot of people. MAIN COMMITTEE Who of us does not know someone who at some point in their life has been affected by mental illness? I am sure many of us in this House have at some point suffered with mental illness. It should not be embarrassing, it should not be a point of shame and yet all too often it is. One man whom I spoke with last week is an example to us all, whether we suffer from or know someone with a mental illness or not. Brian Sipthorp has bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorder, or, as he likes to refer to it, a blessing. What makes Brian such an inspiration and worthy of mention is the candour with which he discusses his illness and the steps he takes each and every day to live his life. Brian speaks with passion about taking control of his illness, recognising the impact it has on his life and using it to assist, rather than hinder, how he functions. He is actively involved in what is known as the Pathways program, a wonderful initiative run through Anglicare in Tasmania, which Brian says gives him a place to be involved. To Brian, being involved means activities like bowling, music afternoons, dishwashing, cleaning, walking-scheduled activities which get him out of the house four days a week. This is an example of the system working and of the impact of one of the countless organisations which exist to support people with mental illness, and these services are being called upon more and more. In Tasmania, the state Department of Health and Human Services set up a mental health helpline two years ago. In that time, the referral and assessment service has compiled a database of more than 13,250. It receives more than 80 calls a day on average, which equates to around 100 new consumers each month who are referred on to a range of services. Those who run the hotline, whilst already under pressure from a rising workload, fear they are seeing just a fraction of those who could be assisted. In fact, they estimate they are in contact with only around four per cent of those people in Tasmania who suffer with mental illness. Having said that, that is quite an improvement on the estimated one per cent of a few short years ago. The Rudd government’s commitment to mental health is absolutely evident. We are committed to working with the state and territory governments to reinvigorate the national mental health reform agenda. On top of significant funding for mental health through the MBS and PBS, funding for mental health specific programs will nearly double over the next four years, compared to the previous four years. That means $783 million over four years, compared with $411 million in the previous four years. We have also established a National Advisory Council on Mental Health, which will provide independent expert advice to government on a range of issues. There is always more to do, but to the organisers of the health and well-being expo in Launceston, I say congratulations and reaffirm my ongoing and full support. Mallee Electorate: Drought member of the House of Representatives to advise the House of the state of their division. Grievance debate is an appropriate name because there is a great deal of grief in the federal division of Mallee, all of it to do with the lack of rainfall, either within the region itself or in the upper catchments of the rivers that supply the region with water. There are three distinctive regions of Mallee. In the south there are the Wimmera and Western districts, which predominantly produce grain and livestock. They centre around agriculture and primary production, which is the business activity of the whole region. There is also some horticulture, centred around wildflowers and olives. Further north of that is the dryland Mallee region, which MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Grievance Debate
164,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (9.08 Pm),"The grievance debate provides an opportunity for apredominantly produces grain, with some livestock. Then there is the Murray Valley, all the way from Leitchville in the east to the South Australian border, passing great cities like Swan Hill and Mildura. All of those regions have been drought declared and in exceptional circumstances for three years, now going on four years. There has been bitter disappointment after autumn starting rains undermined confidence in the grain-growing areas. You have to admire the resilient, determined primary producers of Mallee. They went out and borrowed yet again from their banks to have another go, after their sixth year of depressed returns. Sadly, we did not see in winter the finishing rainfall so badly needed nor have we seen it in spring. In fact, extreme hot weather, with temperatures nudging 30 degrees Celsius, has just destroyed the hopes and aspirations of those in the dry land graingrowing regions. They are beside themselves with anxiety and worry. Added to that is this. Along the northern boundary, which follows the state boundary, the Murray River, is the Murray Valley region. It produces dairy in the east and a whole variety of horticulture all the way to the South Australian border. I will focus on the prognosis for horticulture. The conditions that the determined and resilient people of Mallee are confronted with now are appalling. Currently in Victoria high-reliability irrigators, who are principally horticulturalists, have only 13 per cent of their water entitlement-and this is following last year, when they barely received half of their water entitlement. This is an entitlement they pay for and yet, because of the dire circumstances of run-off in the upper catchments in those dams that supply the valuable water of the Murray-Darling Basin, they are currently on only 13 per cent. They do not have the financial resources to compete yet again, as they did last year, in the water markets to buy precious water this summer. The weather in the Murray Valley this week has been hot and windy. There have been terrible, hot spring days. Yesterday it was 31 degrees. This increases the demand for plant moisture at a time of the year when early season moisture stress can adversely impact on the final crop yields. Already, due to the river drought, close to 30 per cent of citrus crops and vineyards in fine soldier settlement districts like Merbein, Red Cliffs and Mildura have been left to die. You can imagine the impact that has on the surrounding communities, on all the added businesses. They are living in uncertain times. It is going to take millions of dollars when the drought finally ends to restore all those plantings. These blocks are showing that the water has been turned off. Some families made that decision as far back as 18 months ago and are watching their vines and citrus trees die before them. SunRISE21 is an economic development program we have had in the region for many years now. It has been funded by federal and state governments over the years. It is currently trying to get another project up to get a better measurement of this anecdotal information, but blind Freddy could see from just driving around the region the impact that water shortages are having. The ongoing economic inactivity that will affect the small businesses of the district is starting to come through in, if you like, a tsunami. The crazy part about all this is that across the border in New South Wales, in the member for Farrer’s constituency, high security Murray irrigators now have 80 per cent of their water entitlement. This is because New South Wales has a different classification for water from Victoria. There is less water for high security and there are fewer irrigators in New South Wales, but an enormous explanation is needed for those irrigators on the Victorian side who MAIN COMMITTEE look across at the orchards and vineyards of their compatriots in another state who are getting a much larger allocation of their water. In addition to this, the net result for Victorian horticulturalists on 13 per cent is that they will be competing in the water market against the federal government for the purchase of water. The government’s priority seems to be to purchase water for environmental purposes. For the life of me I struggle to understand how they can put the economic and emotional well-being of people that produce food and fibre after the needs of the environment. Of course the environment is important-it is vitally important-but we are talking about human beings and their need to be involved in economic activity, to the benefit of the nation and to the benefit of the regions they come from. The South Australian government has promised to spend $67 million to buy water for its own high security water irrigators. That is a bold step, and it is just a tragedy that Victoria does not follow suit and back important wealth creators, particularly people who produce food. Murray Valley commodity leaders in the wine, table grapes, dried vine fruits and citrus industries advise me that the lack of appropriate allocation to Victorian irrigators leaves their harvest planning absolutely in tatters. The growers do not know how much they will get for their grapes and other products-if they produce a crop, that is. Because they do not have price, they cannot budget accurately or convince lenders for a loan in order to purchase water to keep those crops growing. The end result is that many fixed planting irrigators are simply trying as best they can to keep their vines and trees alive and have long since given up trying to produce a crop. When you think about the size and importance of these commodities, the production of wine grapes in the Murray-Darling and Swan Hill regions of the Murray Valley the last vintage was 365,000 tonnes, with a value of $203 million. Many growers had to spend $200 a tonne buying water to get their crop for a return of between $300 and $450. The margin is just not there; they are simply keeping their fixed plantings alive. In citrus, 2007-08 production was 132,505 tonnes, of which more than half was exported, particularly to the United States. In the current season, 2008-09, the prognosis is that the crop will fall to 116,000 tonnes. All of this is due to the lack of water, because without water you cannot produce that beautiful, juicy orange. Dried vine fruit had an absolute shocker last harvest with only 11,300 tonnes produced. In 1998 it was 43,000 tonnes. We are talking about an industry that in its heyday produced 200,000 tonnes of dried vine fruit, all for the export market. The story for table grapes is no better. So there is enormous uncertainty out there. It is a bitter disappointment that the government’s response to this has been to manage the transition of people like these wealth creators to exit their properties, offering a $150,000 exit grant, which was announced on 20 September, and that the government would buy the water. This is hardly a solution, certainly not a long-term one, to ensure that important, viable communities continue to create wealth. There are currently 940 horticulturists out of 1,400, just in the Sunraysia region associated with Mildura, who are now seeking help from financial rural counsellors. I just hope that the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry takes heed of my remarks and does not undo the assistance that has been provided with valuable EC support(Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Bali NineI have been involved with now for some time. Earlier this year I met two people at a party in the Northern Territory-Christine and Lee Rush. During the course of the evening I discovered that they are the parents of Scott Rush. Scott is one of the Bali Nine currently on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Indonesia. What transpired that evening was a significant story as it unfolded. Lee Rush, about my age, who obviously loves his kids, was very worried about his son. He thought his son was mixing with the wrong crowd and certainly had grave reservations about the people he was associating with. He suspected his son was involved with drugs. Lee told me that evening that he knew his son would probably never speak to him again but that he was determined to do something about it so that this would not be his son’s future. What he did was to go to the police. He told the police what he suspected his son was involved in, with whom his son was associating, where his son was going, his exit time to Bali and when he was returning, and therein started an Australian police operation. Lee and Christine Rush said to my wife, Bernadette, and me, ‘We didn’t think at that juncture we were signing our son’s death warrant.’ Their son was apprehended in Bali, and he was tried and convicted. He was initially sentenced by the court to life imprisonment, which is obviously a substantial penalty in itself. However, he appealed to the District Court. The District Court confirmed his sentence of life imprisonment. He further appealed to the Supreme Court. When he appealed to the Supreme Court he was one of a number of applicants, one of three drug mules. Whilst they were all tried by the one court, they were sentenced by separate sentencing panels. Without the police or the prosecution seeking to have his sentence increased, his sentencing panel came to the decision to increase his sentence from life imprisonment to execution. Two paragraphs of that decision took this young man’s life. The sentencing panel does not record in its judgement any comparison with anyone who was arrested on the very same day or for the same crime. The others who appealed under the same circumstances as Scott Rush had their sentences of life imprisonment maintained. Presently, Scott Rush is the only drug mule in the death tower at Kerobokan Prison. Notwithstanding that, presently two other Australians involved with the Bali nine are also in the death tower. I have been talking about this for some time-as a father, quite frankly-and I think we should have a view on this. We are one of only 130 nations that have an abolitionist approach to the death penalty. In modern society, I really think we have adequate means for punishing people for their crimes and an ability to actually rehabilitate people in the process. That is why I decided to take a stand on this. What father has not had concerns about the people his kids are associating with? What father-or what parent-would not go out of their way to do something to ameliorate the situation in the hope of giving their kids a better future? Here is a father who tried to do that and, as Lee Rush says, in the process he signed his son’s death warrant. TodayI received a letter that was written on 10 October. I would like to read this letter. It is addressed to me from Kerobokan Prison and says: Dear Mr Hayes Today is World Day against the Death Penalty. I’m not sure what is happening outside but it’s just another day inside the death Tower. MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Grievance Debate
165,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.18 Pm),"This evening I would like to talk about an issue which I’ve been kept informed of your Motion in The House of Representatives which I understand is supported by many other Australian Parliamentarians. I’d like to thank you and your colleagues for caring and taking a principle position in relation to the death penalty. All of us in the Death Tower are following your motion with keen interest. Efforts by people like yourself and Mr Ruddock and Mr Dreyfus help give us hope that we can have a future. I don’t want to be in any way political but from a practical point of view of someone inside on Death Row it makes practical and good sense to have a consistent position of opposing the death penalty without discrimination. If the Opposition is just (for) us Australian citizens it makes us stick out, like sore thumbs, amongst all the other nationals who have also got the death penalty. I say this because I share my cell with a Nigerian, Emmanuel, who’s dignity and kindness helps comfort us on our many dark nights. So taking consistent stand for everyone on the death penalty that helps us here on the inside of the wall. On this day I want to repeat something I’ve said before. I AM really sorry for the crime I have committed. I really do want the chance to show I’m capable of reform and that I will be completely reformed. I want the chance to give back to the communities that I have offended. I could be a very unusual ambassador against the cancer of drugs in Australia and Indonesia today. I’m writing underneath a sign that says in Indonesian “Don’t even try drugs” and, it’s right! That’s the message I’d like to get across to other people who like me didn’t understand. FinallyI hope your colleagues in Parliament listen to you when you speak to the Motion which I hope will be passed. If it is passed it will help, in a practical way, people like myself and my parents. Because what happened to us, could happen to any Australian family. I thank you most sincerely, Scott Rush It is a parent’s nightmare to have their child committed to death. We saw what an emotive issue this is when Nguyen was executed in Singapore. I recall very vividly the vigils that took place on that occasion and the prayers that were offered. Unfortunately, it still eventuated that this Australian was executed in Singapore. It is my intention not to wait until people are executed but to be prepared to make a stand as someone who is committed to youth, as someone who has a family and as someone who has from time to time not been totally happy with the company that my kids have kept. As Scott Rush says in his letter, this is something that could afflict any family. As a parent I think it is time that we expressed our general opposition to the death penalty. There must be other ways by which these matters can be dealt with and other ways that punishment can be mete out to best fit the crime that has occurred. I think I would like to be in a situation where we can generally claim clemency for Australians currently on death row overseas and also, as Scott Rush says in his letter, be consistent and maintain our principled position and our opposition to the death penalty. This was something that was unanimously moved in this parliament in(Time expired) Mallee Electorate: Woomelang marks by finishing with a positive story about Woomelang, a small township on the Sunraysia Highway in the eastern Mallee that lost their general store. Woomelang is a town with fewer than 300 people. The community got some funds together and got a small grant from the state government and bought their own store and, through working bees, have restored it. They have an ambitious program to save the petrol bowser in their town and set up a traveller’s rest to attract passing traffic on the Sunraysia Highway. MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Grievance Debate
166,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (9.28 Pm),"by leave-I would like to continue my previous reI wanted to mention that as a positive, because it is a celebration of community and a great testimony to the resilience of those hard working people out there in the Mallee who just never give up. I applaud their efforts to save their general store. There is nothing more important than a store to provide those important victuals-the newspaper, the milk and the bread-and an opportunity for the community to meet and greet. I was a little disappointed that the federal government have not recognised the needs of communities like this. We have to wait to see how they will replace the wonderful Community Assistance Grants that were put in place by the former government to assist proud communities like Woomelang. expired.

167,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ja Saffin),"Order! The time for the grievance debate hasEnvironmental Stewardship and Caring for our Country Programs (Question No. 206) Dr Stone asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 26 August 2008: (1) How much funding will be available for the Environmental Stewardship Programme in 2008-09. (2) Will he extend the timeframe for applications under the Caring for our Country program. (3) What is the breakdown of funding for each of the regional natural resource management or catchment management bodies in (a) 2007-08; and (b) 2008-09. (4) How many: (a) Landcare and Natural Resource Managers; and (b) staff at regional natural resource or catchment management bodies have lost their jobs as a result of the Caring for our Country program. (5) In respect of Caring for our Country advertisements: (a) in total, how much money has his department spent; (b) how many were placed, and where. (1) $7.5 million is available for the Environmental Stewardship Program in 2008-09. (2) No. Proposals for 2008-09 have been received and are currently being assessed. (3) The breakdown of funding for each of the regional natural resource management or catchment management bodies in (a) 2007-08; and (b) 2008-09 is in Table1 below. (4) The Australian Government does not directly employ Landcare and Natural Resource Managers or staff at natural resource management bodies through Caring for our Country. The Government therefore does not have access to specific data on the number of people employed as (a) Landcare and Natural Resource Managers; and (b) staff at regional natural resource or catchment management bodies. The Australian Government has, however, carried out a survey on the number of full time equivalent positions employed by all regional Natural Resource Management bodies in response to a request by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. The survey data showed that on 20 November 2007 a total of 1,891.32 full time equivalent positions were employed and on 7 May 2008 a total of 1,882.58 full time equivalent positions were employed. This information was provided by state and regional organisations and cannot be verified by the Australian Government. The Australian Government is not the only source of funds used to employ Landcare and Natural Resource Managers and staff at regional natural resource or catchment management bodies and variations in employment numbers is a combination of a range of factors including variations in funding from all sources. (5) As at 8 September 2008 the total amount expended on Caring for our Country advertising, including the Working on Country program, Open Grants, Community Coastcare, National Reserve System and the Environmental Stewardship Program, is $173,799.44. This includes 225 radio spot advertisements placed across the country and 60 advertisements in the print media in several national, regional and indigenous newspapers. Advertisements were placed in all capital city and major rural newspapers in all states and territories and the following towns specifically for the Environmental Stewardship Program target area: Blayney, Wagga Wagga, Boorowa, Cootamundra, Cowra, Crookwell, Forbes, Goulburn, Grenfell, Molong, Hay, Orange, Temora, West Wyalong, Yass, Young, Bungendore, Gundagai, Harden, Narrandera, Braidwood, Cooma, Condobolin, Parkes, Nyngan, Griffith, Junee, Queanbeyan, Leeton, Tumut, Orange.",199,Grievance Debate

Welfare Reform (Question No. 213) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 26 August 2008: (1) At what specific sites will welfare payments be made conditional on school attendance. (2) What precise mechanisms will be implemented to ensure that all children are enrolled in school and how will these mechanisms be enforced. (3) How will schools be required to monitor children’s attendance. (4) How many unexplained absences from school will constitute failure to attend regularly. (5) What action will schools take if they are concerned a child is not attending regularly. (6) What will constitute reasonable action by parents to ensure satisfactory attendance. (7) Will attendance rates by school be published; if so, how often and where. (8) Will schools be required to provide daily attendance records directly to Centrelink; if not, why not. (9) Will she guarantee that this measure will be implemented before the end of 2008. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure will be trialled in six locations in the Northern Territory – Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole, Katherine, Katherine Town Camps, Wadeye and Tiwi Islands. In addition, there are two metropolitan locations, one in the Cannington area of Western Australia and one other yet to be announced. It is intended that from the first term of 2009 all parents receiving income support within the selected locations will be required to provide details of their child’s school enrolment to Centrelink. Parents who are doing the right thing and have their children enrolled in school will not need to do anything further. Parents who fail to provide enrolment information to Centrelink without a reasonable excuse will have their income support payments temporarily suspended. As soon as these parents enrol their child or provide enrolment information their payments will be reinstated with back pay, if the requirement is met within a 13 week time period. Parents receiving income support will also be expected to take reasonable steps to ensure their children are regularly attending school. In instances where a child is not attending regularly, the relevant state, territory or independent education authority can inform Centrelink. Parents will be required to show they are working with the school and their child to try to improve the child’s school attendance. If they cannot demonstrate this, they may have their income support payments temporarily suspended until action is taken. However suspension is not the first step; it is the last step. Families will be offered support from schools and from Centrelink social workers before any consideration is given to suspension. It is important to note that where a child has unsatisfactory school attendance despite the best efforts of their parents no penalty will be imposed on parents. Consistent with their current responsibilities, education authorities/schools determine which children are not attending regularly. Under the measure, education authorities/schools may choose to inform Centrelink of those parents in receipt of income support whose children are not attending regularly and who may benefit from a Centrelink intervention. Education authorities/schools will subsequently determine whether there has been a satisfactory improvement in attendance. Guidelines for determining reasonable action by parents to ensure their children attend school will be negotiated between the Commonwealth and state education authorities/non-government schools in the formulation of bilateral agreements. Implementation of the measure has commenced and includes development of the legislation, system changes, an evaluation methodology and policy documentation. Parents living in trial locations will not be subject to the measure until the beginning of the 2009 school year. Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Question No. 218) Mr Farmer asked the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 28 August 2008: In respect of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) for the years 2006-07 and 200708: (a) what was the total amount of money spent on facilitating compliance with the World AntiDoping Code; (b) how much funding was spent on the athlete testing regime and investigations; (c) how much was spent on ASADA’s prosecutions framework; (d) are there currently any cost recovery arrangements for athlete testing, investigations, or prosecutions; if so, (i) what percentage of cost is recovered, and (ii) from whom is this cost recovered; and (e) what are the terms of reference for the review into ASADA’s cost recovery arrangements (Budget Paper 2, page 233), and (i) who has been appointed to the review panel, and (ii) when will the review conclude. Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The core function of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) is to ensure compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code and therefore all its resources are directed towards this compliance. The total amount of resources expended in 2006-07 was $13.635m and 2007-08 was $15.126m. (b) In 2006-07, ASADA conducted 4 264 government funded tests at a total cost of $4.620m and in 2007-08, 4 228 tests were conducted at a cost of $4.015m. The total amount spent on investigations in 2006-07 was $0.694m and 2007-08 was $0.348m. (c) The total amount spent on prosecutions in 2006-07 was $1.174m and 2007-08 was $1.110m. (d) Athlete Testing– Yes, via User Pays testing arrangements. Investigations – No. Prosecutions – No. (i) In respect of both years all marginal costs associated with conducting User Pays testing were recovered. (ii) Testing costs are recovered from national sporting organisations and international sporting federations who contract ASADA to conduct User Pays testing. (e) The Terms of Reference (TOR) stated that the review was to provide advice on: the rationale and scope for ASADA to recover costs under the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 and Government anti-doping in sport policies; the current cost recovery arrangements and their effectiveness in promoting the efficient allocation of resources and meeting the Government’s anti-doping in sport objectives; the appropriateness of recovering costs for all other Authority activities undertaken to meet the Government’s anti-doping in sport objectives by examining the efficiency and effectiveness of any potential cost recovery measures; any revised or new cost recovery arrangements and the statutory or other requirements necessary to implement the changes; and mechanisms and timeframes for ongoing monitoring and review. (i) The steering committee consists of representatives from ASADA, the Department of Health and Ageing and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. (ii) The cost recovery review will conclude prior to 31 December 2008. Sport Funding (Question No. 219) Mr Farmer asked the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 28 August 2008: (1) What is the role of the new independent panel reviewing sport funding in Australia, and how does this role differ from the role of the Australian Sports Commission Board (ASCB). (2) Will the ASCB make funding decisions while the independent panel is reviewing sport in Australia. (3) Has the independent panel been established; if not, when will it be; and if so, who has been appointed. (4) What are the key milestones for the independent panel, including the timeframe for its final report and recommendations. (5) How often will the independent panel meet. (6) Will the independent panel be remunerated. (7) Will the independent panel consult with: (a) the general public; (b) all National Sporting Organisations; (c) all of the State and Territory Institutes of Sport; (d) the ASCB; and (e) the Australian Sports Commission. Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The role of the independent expert sport panel (the Sport Panel) is to investigate and report on measures required to ensure that Australia’s sporting system remains prepared for the challenges of the future, at the elite and grassroots levels. In preparing the report the Sport Panel will address the terms of reference publicly announced on 28 August 2008. The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) is a principal agency responsible for implementing the Australian Government’s sports policy and delivering the Australian Government’s sport programs. (2) The ASC Commissioners will continue to perform their statutory functions in accordance with the ASC’s enabling legislation. (3) The Sport Panel was appointed on 28 August 2008. Details are contained in a media release issued on the same date which is available at: http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishin.nsf/Content/MediaReleases-KE-1 (4) The Sport Panel will provide an interim report by the end of 2008 and a final report in 2009. (5) The Sport Panel will meet as required to complete its tasks and will determine its own meeting schedule. (6) The Sport Panel members will be appropriately remunerated based on Determination 2008/07: Remuneration and Allowances for Holders of Part-Time Public Office of the Remuneration Tribunal. (7) The Sport Panel will consult directly with key stakeholders and provide an opportunity for anyone who wants to make their views known to do so by written submission. Productivity Places Program (Question No. 236) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 28 August 2008: In respect of the Productivity Places Program: how often are the Industry Skills Councils required to undertake new Environmental Scans. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Under their existing funding arrangements with the Department, Industry Skills Councils are required to provide an Environmental Scan to the National Quality Council once every 12 months. The Environmental Scan provides information about skill shortages and training gaps based on the dayto-day interaction of the Industry Skills Councils with employers, unions, regulators and other stakeholders in their industry sectors. The Scan also provides a stocktake of physical changes made to the endorsed components of Training Packages over the preceding 12 months to reflect industry’s emerging needs and address identified skill shortages and gaps. Over the next three years, Industry Skills Councils will be resourced by the Commonwealth to work with enterprises to identify their skill needs and appropriate training solutions. Information gathered through this role will see the Environmental Scans become increasingly rich with real-time data to gauge the magnitude of issues, and in doing so, become a valuable direction-setting document for the national training system. Work Experience Placement Program (Question No. 241) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 28 August 2008: In respect of the Work Experience Placement Program: what proportion of job seekers utilising the program and referred to it by Vocational Rehabilitation Services providers gained employment with the Work Experience Placement host. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Between1 July 2007 and 4 September 2008, 17.54 per cent of Vocational Rehabilitation Services job seekers participating in the Work Experience Placement Program were recorded as having accepted employment with the host organisation. Sport Funding (Question No. 248) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 28 August 2008: In respect of the funding in the 2008-09 Budget for the Sturt Baseball Club, Marion Sports and Community Club and the Blackwood Football Club: (a) on what date and in what form where these clubs notified they would receive funding; (b) on what date did these clubs receive funding; (c) under which Portfolio Budget item was this appropriation made; and (d) what is the name of the program under which this funding was made available. Ms Kate Ellis-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) I wrote to the Blackwood Football and Sturt Baseball Clubs on 10 July 2008, and the Marion Sports and Community Club on 16 July 2008. (b) In each case contract negotiations are underway to determine a suitable payment schedule against project milestones. Funding will be provided in line with the agreed payment schedule when a funding agreement has been executed with each organisation. (c) Sport and Recreation Facilities – contribution to funding. (d) In each case the funding honours an election commitment. Veterans’ Affairs: Staffing (Question No. 249) Mr Simpkins asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 28 August 2008: (1) Have there been changes over the past 12 months to the staffing arrangements in the Perth branch of his department; if so, have they resulted in an increase or a decrease in the number of staff. (2) If there has been a decrease in the number of staff assigned to deal with over the counter enquiries, why has this occurred. (3) Can he provide assurances that changes in staffing arrangements will not adversely affect the quality of services provided to veterans in Perth. (4) What are the customer service quality standards for his department. (1) Yes, there were some changes to staffing arrangements in my Department’s Perth Office in the past 12 months. Some functions necessitated an increase in staff, others a decrease. Overall there has been a decrease in the number of staff in WA over the past 12 months. (2) There has been an increase in the number of staff in the Perth office assigned to deal with over the counter enquiries. (3) Quality of service remains of the utmost importance and priority to my Department. The reduction in overall staffing has resulted from a process of national reorganisation to make the best use of available resources. This process of consolidation commenced almost two years ago and continues under this Government. These changes will not impact on clients or the levels of service they currently receive.",200,Questions In Writing
169,Mr Griffin,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) My priority is the quality of service my Department provides to the veteran community and its ongoing commitment to meet the service standards articulated in its service charter. A copy of my Department’s Service Charter is available on the Department’s internet site at www.dva.gov.au/media/publicat/2006/service_charter/index.htm. Defence: Overseas Study Tour (Question No. 254) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 2 September 2008: (1) Did staff from his department and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) go on an overseas trip as part of their efforts towards acquiring an Executive Masters in Complex Project Management. (2) If staff from his department and the ADF did go on this trip: (a) what were the dates; (b) how many staff from his department and the ADF attended; (c) what was the itinerary; (d) what was the cost of the (i) airfares, (ii) accommodation, and (iii) meals; (e) what were the specific outcomes; and (f) would it have been possible for the attendees to achieve the same outcomes without leaving the country. (1) Staff from the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) and the ADF are currently participating in an overseas study tour as part of the course curriculum of the Executive Masters in Complex Project Management. (2) (a) The tour departed on Friday 19 September 2008 and is scheduled to return on Sunday5 October 2008. (b) Defence staff comprises 14 civilians from the DMO and two ADF (Army) members. (c) Students will travel to the UK and USA visiting; the London Olympic Delivery Authority and Olympic Site; Mary McKinley, Vice President of the International Project Management Association; Michael Jackson, British Systems Scientist and Professor of Management Systems; BAE Systems Submarine Solutions (Astute Project); National Defence University Industrial College of the Armed Forces; Micron Technology Inc; and The Joint Strike Fighter project at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. (d) (i) $3,726 per person. (ii) Estimated at $3,948 per person. (iii) Estimated at $910 per person. (e) The study tour is a requisite component of the Masters course and counts towards one full unit of study. Students of the Queensland University of Technology are required to participate in the activity to ensure that they meet the university’s requirements to graduate with this degree. The study tour will consolidate learning from the first half of the course and form the basis of several critical pieces of assessment on their return. (e) The study tour forms a critical component of a broader learning strategy to incorporate a strong practical and experiential element within the program. “Implementation of Complex Projects” is an important unit of study on the program, putting into practice the academic theory that students have studied to date.

170,Mr Fitzgibbon,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ate the strategies (successful or otherwise) these individuals implement in managing these projects. As the majority of Defence’s most complex projects form part of a global supply chain it is important for our future project managers to appreciate the challenges this presents in addition to developing an understanding of how these challenges might best be managed in an environment characterised by uncertainty and high levels of scrutiny. Experiential learning in this style is an essential element to successful adult learning and development and has been proven to enhance knowledge retention and subsequent successful application. The Masters course has been developed with the Competency Standard for Complex Project Managers as the underpinning knowledge of the course content. View8 of the Standard refers to “Culture and Being Human” and is based around the importance of Complex Project Managers having a sound appreciation of the cultural nuances that can impact international projects. Experiencing this first hand on the study tour fulfils the requirement that students be exposed to this as part of their ongoing understanding of the underpinning knowledge in the Standard. (f) No. Disability Employment Network (Question No. 257) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 September 2008: What percentage of job seekers in the capped Disability Employment Network program have been exited to Intermittent Support. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: In 2007–08, there were 1585 exits from the Disability Employment Network (DEN) of independent workers with exit reasons indicating the potential need for intermittent support at some point in the future. This represented 7.7 per cent of all exits in 2007–08. Disability Employment Network (Question No. 258) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 September 2008: (1) What percentage of the Disability Employment Network caseload has entered the program as “employment in jeopardy”. (2) What percentage of job seekers in an “employment in jeopardy” situation, who have been on the Disability Employment Network caseload for six months or more, retain employment. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) As at 30 June 2008, there were 1103 Disability Employment Network (DEN) capped stream participants listed as ‘employment in jeopardy’. This represents 3 per cent of the 35 978 current DEN capped clients at that date. At the same date, there were 28 DEN uncapped stream participants listed as employment in jeopardy. This represents 0.2 per cent of the 13 253 current DEN uncapped clients at that date. (2) 94.6 per cent of the workers who entered the DEN capped stream between 01/01/06 and 31/12/06 with their employment in jeopardy, retained their employment for at least six months. It is not possible to provide comparable information for the DEN uncapped stream, due to the small number of employment in jeopardy clients who had entered the program by the end of December 2007. Disability Employment Network (Question No. 259) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 September 2008: In respect of the total caseload of “employment in jeopardy” job seekers linked with Disability Employment Network providers: (a) how many have a (i) Disability Maintenance Instrument rating 4, (ii) Disability Maintenance Instrument rating 3, (iii) Disability Maintenance Instrument rating 2, (d) Disability Maintenance Instrument rating 1?

Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: As at 30 June 2008, 94 capped Disability Employment Network (DEN) sites were below the benchmark of 90 per cent utilisation of allocated places, averaged over 13 weeks. This represented 25 per cent of all DEN capped sites nationally. However, the majority of these were only slightly below the benchmark.

However, as at the 30 June 2008 the national utilisation of capped places stood at around 92 per cent. This would suggest that the current available capacity is sufficient to deal with existing demand, given the continuing high number of entries into and exits from the program in the course of the year. Disability Employment (Question No. 265) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 2 September 2008: In respect of the Disability Employment Network: (a) how many capped places are there across Australia; and (b) how many uncapped places are expected to be filled in the 2008–09 financial year?

It is also a requirement that participants between the ages of 15-17 receive accredited training. All other participants receive on-the-job training through CDEP activities to improve skills and employment prospects.
