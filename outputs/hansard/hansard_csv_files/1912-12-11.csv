This Bill covers every point that has been raised in this House in discussions on the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act. It includes the point raised regarding naturalization, provides authority for the Treasurer to pay blind persons invalid pensions, makes some relaxation regarding contributions made by relatives to pensioners, exempts gifts from the deductions that may be made, and grants a somewhat wider authority to the Commissioner. The Bill really embodies the departmental view concerning several little defects that have revealed themselves in the working of the Act. It is very well drawn. It is not proposed to have a general discussion on the whole question at the present time. question of the homes of pensioners? pensioner, if used as a home, will be absolutely excluded from the amount that may affect the pension; ancl",19,Duties On Drugs

The extra expense involved is not very, large. Probably about ,£150,000 will cover the whole cost. Persons are often very much attached to their homes. To take some people away from their homes would practically amount to putting them in prison. limit of the value of the home? If , however, the home of a pensioner brings in an income, that will be taken into account. Buti f no income is derived from the property, no deduction will be made on account of it. The principle underlying the proposal may be summed up thus: One home does not compete with another. The idea of civilization is that every family should have a home. Inasmuch as one home does not compete with another, I do not see how any harm can arise from this little relaxation of the law. The extra expense is hardly worth all the trouble of making deductions on account of small homes. That has"" arisen under the law as at present existing. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The Bill does not deal with any other matter. It is true that a suggestion was made that another matter might be dealt with, but I have not included provision for it in this Bill. The fact is that under the Victorian law, I think, and certainly under the New South Wales law, there is what is called a 10-years' rule, under which clerks who have been employed in solicitors' offices for that period are permitted to present themselves for examination under certain conditions other than those which relate to candidates generally. It has been pointed out that the law as it stands does not permit persons who are employed in the Crown Solicitor's office of the Commonwealth to take advantage of this rule. Inasmuch as it is not usual for the Crown Solicitor to article clerks, it is felt that an injustice may be done to them. It has been suggested that provision should be made for them in this Bill, but I have not done so, because it is relatively an unimportant Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution adopted. .

As the Bill provides for such a novel proceeding in connection with the raising of revenue, I cannot find it in my heart to oppose it. I want to say a word or tw.o on the industrial aspect of this Bill. complaints to make about the increased revenue which the Minister of Trade and Customs desires to obtain. But I do not think that under this measure he will collect as much revenue as he might. For example, he proposes to charge Excise upon only 52 gallons in a 54-gallon hogshead, upon 34 gallons in a 36-gallon barrel, and upon 26 gallons, instead of 27 gallons, in a halfhogshead. I hold in my hand a communication from the Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Federated Coopers' Association, whose members' are interested in the manufacture of the casks which will contain this beer. The communication readsRegarding the Beer Excise Act, I wish to give you a few facts by which you will see that both our trade and the Commonwealth revenue suffer through the f u l l standard measurements not being insisted on. . The measures scale show the capacities of the following vessels to be :Hogsheads 54 gallons, barrels 36 gallons, halfhogsheads 27 gallons, and kilderkins 18 gallons. That is standard measurement, and the sizes which our tradesmen have lo make the casks. As a matter of fact, every new cask has to be made io hold about a gallon over to allow for future shrinkage in fair wear and tear. Now it is obvious that a vast amount of Excise duty has been lost to the Commonwealth when they chnrge excise on only 50 gallons for a hogshead (old Act), and will still lose a vast amount by makgallon. ing 52 gallons dutiable only under the amended proposal when you consider that nine out of ten hogsheads hold the f u l l 54 gallons.

The honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Maribyrnong, appear to rejoice at the prospect of an increase in the Excise duty under this Bill. But who is going to pay that revenue? The man who takes his "" long sleever"" along with his counterlunch occasionally ? Some consideration should be shown for this gentleman who is representative of a very large proportion of the constituents of the Minister of Trade and Customs. There are a few, also, to be found in the electorates represented by the honourable members for Maribyrnong and Parramatta. We already derive a very large revenue from this commodity. good authority, that what is termed in the vernacular a "" long sleever,"" costs to produce about one-sixteenth of a penny, and yet a man cannot get one for cash for less than 3d., and Without cash he cannot get one at all.

142,Mr Tudor (Yarra,"Minister of Trademay have forgotten what I said on that occasion. The object of the Bill is to reduce the margin of allowance upon the contents of hogsheads, half-hogsheads; and kilderkins, at present provided for. The late Right Honourable C. C. Kingston, in submitting the original measure,' made provision that hogsheads should contain not less than 50 gallons, nor more than 54 gallons. At that time, there was in operation in the States legislation providing for a similar allowance. methods of brewing have been improved, and it is no longer necessary to make such an allowance. Very little dregs are now left in the casks, and we propose to charge duty upon the contents which it will be possible to utilize from each hogshead. about 56 gallons in some hogsheads. but I shall have the statement inquired into. If it is correct, it is a somewhat serious reflection upon our Excise officers. upon them. that is not the honourable member's desire, but, if the statement be correct, it is evident amended that in some cases they have not done their duty, and have permitted barrels to leave the breweries which contain more than they should contain.

I can assure honourable members that the officers of the Department are very particular in seeing that the vessels used in the trade are of the stipulated sizes. honourable member.

The increase will amount to no more than 6d. on 54 gallons, or about one-ninth of a penny per gallon. head? from 50 to 54 gallons. gallons. so. If there are many hogsheads in use which contain over 54 gallons, I can assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong that there will be plenty of work for the coopers, because vessels of that size will not be permitted to leave the breweries. I do not wish honourable members to think that the officers of the Department do not, at present, make strict inquiries into these matters, because I am aware that they do, and that, in a distant State, hogsheads containing half a gallon, or a little more than the reputed contents, were prevented from going into use. the allowance now proposed? Since then, the of 4 gallons in each hogshead has been provided for. The brewers have said that they are unable to get more than 52 gallons out of a hogshead, but the reports of the officers of the Department show that they will be able to get more; and it is the object of this Bill to charge Excise upon the quantity of beer which it will be possible to' get out of the casks.

Trade and Customs) [11.35] I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the Bounties Act 1907. It will be remembered that, in 1907, the honourable member for Darling Downs, as a member of the then Government, introduced a general Bounties Bill, covering a number of subjects, including flax and hemp, jute, linseed, rice uncleaned, fish and dried fruits, the bounties in regard to all of whicli expired on the 30th June this year. produce some of these commodities, and, in moving the second reading of the Bill, I shall show what has been done in this direction. A further appropriation is necessary, not for the purposes of any of the items I have mentioned, because for these there are sufficient funds available, but for the bounty on combed wool or tops. It is found that there is not sufficient funds to pay this bounty for the period over which it is proposed to extend it. Had it not been for the fact that it is desired to extend this bounty for another two years, under slightly different conditions, there would be no need to ask for this appropriation. However, those engaged"" in the industry-bot h employers and employees-hav e seen me on the subject, and made certain representations; and I have also received a deputation representative of people who desired that this bounty should be abolished. I informed the latter deputation that I would be no party to any proposal of the kind. At that time [246]2 I was under the impression that, as the bountydoes not expire until nearly the end of 191:3, there was no necessity for any extension during this Parliament,, but those engaged in the industry have informed me that they have to enter into contracts for the selling of their tops for at least a year ahead. I submitted the matter to the Cabinet, and, in the circumstances, it was agreed to recommend an extension of the bounty on wool tops for another two years. The Minister tells us that a further appropriation is necessary in order to provide for the payment of the -bounty on wooltops. The establishment of works at Botany for the manufacture of wool tops has been the subject of considerable discussion in the press, and two deputations have been received by the Minister. Considerable dissatisfaction exists in connection with the payment of bounties to those engaged in the wool top industry. It is true that a large establishment has been carried on at Botany apparently with great success. In fact, statements are made that those engaged in the industry are making large fortunes by reason of the bounty, .and that they are able to place their competitors at the sheep sales at a very great disadvantage. The'manager of the large meat works near Parramatta has written to me, and to several other honourable memEndeavours have been made to bers, representing that the present position is most unsatisfactory, especially to those engaged in the butchering trade. On 8th October last, I asked a series of questions in this connection. I asked the Minister if it was a fact that the bonus of £10,000 paid by the Commonwealth in respect to wool tops represented double the amount of wages paid annually in the industry. It must be perfectly clear to any one who visits the Botany establishment, as I did, that by far the largest amount of wages is paid for the class of work that is carried on in ordinary fellmongering establishments. Certain work of ""a different character is carried out by girls, but the main part of the labour employed is similar to that to be found in the industry mentioned. I want to know whether the suggestion conveyed ifi my question,is correct? I asked, furtherIs it a fact that the effect so far of the bonus on wooltops, amounting to over ^30,000 of public money, has been threefold, viz. :(a) Cheap tops to the Japanese?",23,Tudor

But I wish to know whether independent inquiries or two combing mills? have been made by the officers of the Department? If such an inquiry has been made, I hope the Minister will give us the results as soon as possible. I regard the bounty on wcol tops'as operating to the distinct prejudice of a very large » section of our primary producers, namely, the wool-growers.

Why should we not encourage an industry like this? We spend thousands of pounds on bounties for the production of steel, iron bars, and pig iron, and the Labour party wishes to encourage the working up of our raw products as much as possible. There is no reason why all our wool should be exported in the grease, or why we should be merely the exporters of raw material. Our people have as much irifelligence and enterprise as those of any other country, and we should manufacture our own requirements, instead of going back to the old barbaric Free-Trade way of doing nothing, and letting others take advantage Of our beautiful country. Minister shall have a full inquiry made. I believe that it was a right thing to though the Minister has made inquiries. The honourable member for North Sydney has said that the bounty on wool tops has had a tendency to reduce the price of wool, but, although the bounty has been in existence for four years, the price of wool to-day is higher than it has been since 1899. Therefore, the honourable member has more reason for saying that the bounty has 'increased the price of wool. The trouble is that Messrs. F. W. Hughes and Company buy live sheep, to obtain their skins, and, consequently, have to find a market for their mutton. They have thus competed against the Auburn Meat Ring, which is pulling the strings to prevent the extension of the bounty. The result of the competition is that mutton is cheaper in Sydney than it is in Melbourne. evidence of that. admitted that there is a meat ring keeping up prices to a certain figure. That was said by Mr Gee. the bounty on wool tops injures the local manufacturers of tweed, I have here a telegram from Mr Vicars, of Marrickville, saying that his industry is in no way affected, and that he is prepared to give an order for tops to the local companies. The wool-top industry employs 700 hands, and its business is increasing. I do not hold shares in the company, nor are my relatives connected with it, but the company, having incurred a large expenditure to instal the latest and most up-to-date machinery, ought to be encouraged. To refuse an extension of the bounty would be to bring calamity upon the people of my district, as well as on those who have invested their capital in the enterprise. The wool is bought at from Q\&. to iod. per lb., and the tops sell at from 2s. to 2s. 3d. per lb., though the various processes of manufacture reduce weight by half. I do not object to an inquiry if it is thought to be needed, but as we encourage other industries by bounty, we should encourage this industry. We should not be satisfied to merely export wool in the grease, but should aim at exporting it in a manufactured condition. In a few years time the bounty will be no longer required, but it is needed now, because the initial expensesof the industry are so heavy. give a bounty for the production of wool tops in the first instance, but it was stated at the time that the industry would be established within five years. I do not wish to see any industry languish, and onestarted by means of a bounty should have a reasonable chance to be established beforethe bounty is withdrawn, but the honourable member for South Sydney will admit that we ought to have proper information to enable us to give a sound judgment on therequest for an extension of the bounty. principle. The purpose of this particular bounty, given for a specific period, was to enable an industry to be established. All the d if ^ ficulties which had to be contended with were pointed out in a report circulated at the time. It was stated that by the lapseof time the difficulties would be overcome,, but during the initial stages-that is organizing the industry, getting labour together, and opening up a market-it seemed' to be clearly established on the evidence that assistance was necessary. All that we on this side are pressing for is that the proposed extension be shown to be really necessary. Meat Trust gave that evidence. They said, "" Take away the bounty, and we will shut this crowd up.""",26,Bounties Bill

204,Mr Tudor,"In the Bill which I haveleaf, fish, dried fruits, and for continuing the bounty on tops for .another two years from 3rst December, 1913. have already stated briefly the reasons for that extension. I think it is a great pity that the question of extending bounties should arise in the final session of a ParliamentI f it could be avoided it would be better for the question to arise in the middle of a Parliament, and not at a time when the bounties have to be either extended or allowed to lapse. It is for that reason that I propose to extend the two years' bounties under slightly different confind it difficult to induce others to join ditions, as will be seen when the Bill is introduced. on coffee or other eight years' articles are concerned, where it has been shown, by persons that they have made a determined effort to secure a bounty in each case, it is to be extended. -In some cases, in respect of the smaller items, even where no such intention has been expressed, it is thought advisable to extend the bounties, rather than to allow them to lapse, inasmuch as an attempt may be made later on to earn them. On the motion for the second reading of the Bill -I shall put before the House the payments that have, so far, been made. A statement of the payments made is published in the press every quarter, but I think it would be advisable to provide for an annual return for the information of honourable members. scribe that a return shall be furnished. members would then be able to see what bounties had not been claimed, and the extent to which the system had develope'd certain industries. As to what has been said in regard to the bounties on coffee, ginned cotton, and cotton seed, I recognise that the pioneers in the industries to which they relate must experience considerable , difficulty, and I am confident that if it were shown that the lapsing of any one of the bounties would cripple an industry, the Government of the day, no matter what party might be in power, would consider the desirableness of extending it for a further period. When the honourable member for Darling Downs, some five or six years ago, introduced the Bounties Bill, it was thought that the granting of these bounties for a period of five years would be sufficient to enable the industries concerned to be fairly well established. That belief, however, has not been borne out by experience. Flax-growers in the elecI torate of Flinders propose next year to plant out more crop. Flax is being grown there, and there is no reason why it should not be grown in other parts of the southern States. The flax produced in the electorate of Flinders is, I am informed, of very good quality, and the growers tell me that they are just getting on their feet, but that it would be impossible for them tg continue if the bounty were at this stage withdrawn. Those who have entered upon the industry them, and the trouble is that, unless there So far as the bounties is a fairly large output, it is impossible for them to obtain the machinery necessary to convert their crop into a marketable commodity. I brought these representations before the Cabinet, and it was decided that, with one exception, the bounties should be made payable for a period of ten years, instead of five, as at. present. The exception relates to the bounty on wool tops, which it is proposed to extend for a period of only two years. should not have taken up the time of the Committee at this stage if the honourable member for South Sydney had not seen fit to describe me as a Free Trader. Free Trader, and I wish to correct the honourable member's statement. I desire to remind the Minister of Trade and Customs that in respect of certain crops-particularly in the case of coffee and sisal hemp a considerable amount of preliminary work .is necessary before the bounty can be claimed. The land has to be cleared and planted, and five years at least must elapse before the first crop, which is necessarily a small one, can be obtained. I think it would be well for the Parliament to pass a Bill providing for the payment of a bounty for an indefinite, instead of as at present a fixed, period. Where a limitation is imposed, those who are pioneering these industries do not know whether, at the end of the period fixed, the bounty will be renewed. Difficulties consequently arise. The bounty on coffee, for which the present Act provides, certainly would not induce' me to enter the industry at this stage, because I should know that it would lapse before I could hope to secure the slightest return.

209,Mr Greene,"I have never been aiof wooltops is different, since an immediate return is obtained from that industry. It is much easier to determine whether a bounty is necessary in that case than it is in the case of certain primary productions. The Minister has stated that a very small amount has so far been claimed in respect of certain bounties. to the fact that some time must necessarily elapse before it becomes generally known that a bounty is payable in respect of certain industries, and before steps can be taken to earn it. It takes some little time for such legislation to have any appreciable effect on production; and, under the present system, the moment a bounty begins to take effect, it starts to disappear. ask the Minister to consider whether it is not desirable to grant bounties, at least in respect of primary productions, for an indefinite period, leaving it open to the Parliament at any time to review the whole matter and to consider whether the payment of any one bounty should be continued. As to the bounty on wooltops, I would impress upon the Minister the desirableness of having an'impartial inquiry. itself. the Minister. There are all sorts of ugly rumours afloat in regard to the bounty on wooltops. is any ground for them, but, in justice to all concerned, a f u l l , impartial, and independent inquiry should be made. Such an inquiry should have been held weeks ago. There is complete evidence that the company now drawing the bounty on wooltops is paying very large dividends. There can be no real necessity for the Parliament to bolster up that particular industry any more than it should bolster up other industries which are paying equally good dividends. There are many Australian industries which, so far as I know, are not giving as good a return on the capital invested as this particular industry is supposed to give, but which are not assisted by a bounty. more labour. labour. As to the statement made by the honourable member for South Sydney that £ 5 7 , 0 0 0 is annually being distributed in wages by one company, I have only to say that, whilst that statement may be perfectly true, nothing like that amount is paid by way of wages to persons actually engaged in manufacturing wooltops. ness. wooltops is a comparatively small part of the business of the company in question. is, from the point of view of the number of persons employed in the manufacture of wooltops and the wages paid. It may very well be, as the honourable member for Illawarra has said, that the amount Of wages paid to those actually engaged in producing wooltops is not nearly as much as the I bounty paid to the company. The industry is one into which machinery enters very largely. The .major portion of the work is done by machinery, whilst the rest is done by girls. Very little adult male labour is employed. I do not object to factory girls obtaining a fair share of any work that is going, but, from what I have heard, I doubt very much whether the bounty on wooltops is really necessary. I am willing to extend to any Australian indusI n justice to the company try as much encouragement as possible within reason. But I do say that in regard to bounties we need to be very careful as to what we do. Otherwise we may pay away a great deal of money unnecessarily. I do not know whether there Before this Bill becomes law I think that the Minister should have an impartial investigation made. The bounty will not expire before Parliament meets again. If it were paid to the end of 1913, in all probability the company could make arrangements in such a way that its contracts for wool tops could be fulfilled without any trouble. The company are manufacturing a certain amount of wool tops for Australian consumption now. only get the bounty on wool tops that are exported. not manufacturing for local use the ground is practically cut from under the feet of the honourable member for South Sydney, because his great contention for the continuance of this bounty was that an Australian industry is being built up. I do not see that we are building up an Australian industry if wool tops are simply manufactured to be sent abroad. We pay",29,Bounties Bill

We should not confine it to wool tops manufactured for export. I again impress upon the Minister the necessity of giving us full and complete information from impartial sources, because, as far as I can learn from what he has said this morning, his information has hitherto been entirely of an ex parte character. Mr ""KELLY (Wentworth) [12.34] I confess to a feeling approaching to astonishment that the Minister should have done nothing to honour the promise he made to this House on 8th October with regard to the matter under discussion. A Ministerial promise made to a Parliament is not usually a light thing. member for Illawarra that I had made inquiry, and that I proposed to make a statement. I made it when introducing the Bill. Minister, so far, had done nothing. T withdraw my criticism if it be incorrect, but I was not aware that he had done anything to carry out his promise. He said, on the 8th OctoberInformation as to the details referred to in the honourable member's questions will, so far as practicable, be obtained, and a reply made as soon as possible. the honourable member for Illawarra were as follows1. Is it a fact that the bonus on wool tops of ^10,000 per annum is about double the the use of labour-saving machines, but one amount paid in wages in the industry? 2. Is it a fact that the effect so far of the inference underlying these questions was bonus on wool tops, amounting to over ^30,000 that this bounty was being paid to capital, of public money, has been threefold, viz. :(a) Cheap tops to the Japanese? \b) Dividends at 10 per cent, and 6 per cent, to combing mills and meat company shareholders? (e) Girl labour with odd overseers in oneobtaining in most other industries in Australia. or two combing mills? 3. Is it a fact that one top-making company during the twelve months ended 30th June last received something like ,£10,000 or ^11,000 of this bonus, and at the same time guaranteed to buy a subsidiary company's (the Colonial Meat Export Company) sheepskins at such a price as would pay a dividend to the meat company of 10 per cent, per annum? 4. Is it a fact that a portion of the ^10,000 to whom its light clean nature appeals. or £11,000 bonus by the Federal Government has been applied indirectly to pay the dividend in the Colonial Meat Export Company? 5. If so, is the effect of this to place the profit on wool combing at 4^d. per lb., inguaranteed meat company in a position to crushingly compete against any (and, in fact, all) small buyers of sheep at Flemington, Sydney, New South Wales? 6. W i ll he, before continuing the bounty, have a searching inquiry made into the whole industry, and report the result of such inquiry, to this House? Those questions, categorically put by an ex-Minister of the Crown, in my humble judgment, were sufficiently serious to justify the Minister of Trade and Customs in determining to seek to repeal the legislation as to paying a bounty on wool tops unless he could get satisfactory negative replies. That seems to me to be >a proper position for any Minister of the Crown to adopt. Apparently the Minister's inquiry has not been satisfactory to himself. able member that the inferences contained in those questions are not borne out by the information which we have received. all the questions? There are one or two inferences underlying them which are borne out by the actual prospectus of the company itself. I hold in my hand some extracts from Messrs. Hughes and Company's prospectus. I find, for instance, in regard to the question of labour the following statementThe machinery employed in all departments is most up-to-date, and throughout the important item of saving labour has been carefully studied. As an instance, the wool is fed to the mammoth scouring machines, 120 feet in length, by one lad, and it is scoured and dried without further labour, save for an onlooker, to watch the working of the machinessaving machinery as far as possible. and not, to labour. Further on the prospectus saysThe immunity from labour troubles in this industry is in marked contrast to the conditions I do not suppose that one lad could form a union ""on his own."" The first quotation continueswhile in the combing mills the work is carried out almost entirely by girlsThat is another inference which the Minister says is not borne out by his inquiriesThe capacity of the present plant is about 1,000,000 lbs. per annum, and will be installed about the end of the year.

I know that, in Gippsland, farmers who came from New Zealand, recognising that the climate .there was favorable for flaxgrowing, had many difficulties to face. Although linseed, which is used for the manufacture of oil, is the seed of the flax, the fibre flax plant is different from the flax plant which produces linseed. The straw of the flax used for fibre is from i8 inches to 2 feet, and even 3 feet long. You cannot get both linseed and fibre from the same plant, Although £25,000 was available for five years for the production of linseed, only £ 6 was claimed. There is a bounty of 20s. a ton on uncleaned rice, the maximum for one year being £1,000, or £5,000 for five years, but there has been no claim. Honourable members, however, may have read an article which re'Cently appeared in the Melbourne Age, in -which Mr El wood Mead spoke of the possibility of rice-growing in some districts of Victoria, and in other parts of Australia. 'America, this industry has increased the value of land from £ 4 an acre to five or ten times that price. Although there has been no claim the bounty is to be continued, as the rice industry would be a valuable one, especially in the Northern Territory.

No doubt He said that in Arkansaw, in honourable members are desirous of getting on with business, but I think it desirable to let them know how the Act has been availed of. Forty thousand pounds have been available for flax, but in 1907-8 there was no claim, because the land had to be prepared, and there was no flax ready for harvesting. In 1908-9, £126 was claimed; in 1909-10, £ 1 2 0 ; in 1910-11, £ 1 2 3 ; and in 1911-12, £480. on coffee? terminate for another three years, and it is not proposed to interfere with any of the eight-year bounties at the present time.

There was no bounty paid public on tobacco leaf for high grade cigars in 1907-8, but in 1908-9 £1.21 was paid; in 1909-10, £ 2 7 6 ; in 1910-Ti, £ 9 0 ; and in 1911-12, ,£78. Mr Gilmour, the New South Wales expert, reported, in April of this year, after visiting Manilla, Tamworth, The answers to that set of questions were Somerton, and other New South Wales as follow :northern centres, that the quantity and quality of farmers' tobacco crops which had been irrigated were the finest he had seen. Up-to-date methods of curing are now being followed, which improve the colour of the tobacco leaf. In Victoria, Mr Temple Smith, the Government expert, reports equally optimistically. He saysThe result of experiments in the production of Meat Export Company) sheepskins at such a cigar leaf has been especially good. In three instances leaf had been sold at prices ranging from is. to is. 6d. per lb. When it is realized that yields are obtained from 700 lbs. to 1,200 lbs. per acre the profits attached to the growth of this crop are apparent. There are thousands of acres in eastern Gippsland capable of producing cigar tobacco. In Queensland, such districts as Texas and Inglewood are very suitable to the production of tobacco. there are getting very good prices. payments in respect of dried fish are gradually increasing, while the payments in respect of the bounty on dried fruits are increasing very rapidly. In 1907-8 the bounty payments in respect of dried fruits amounted to £ 1 3 9 ; 1908-9, £ 2 8 ; 1909-10, £104; £1,734; or a total for the five years of £2,945. paid on only 54,000 lbs. of dried fruit, whereas last year the payments were made in respect of 636,000 lbs. The debate so far has centred round the bounty on wool tops, and to that matter I propose to give some attention. The honourable member for Wentworth complained this morning that I had not given the information which the honourable member for Illawarra had sought to obtain by means of a question put to me on the 8th October last. On that The honourable 1. Is it a fact that the bonus on wool tops of paid in wages in the industry. To that, I replied ' ' No . ' ' H is second 2. Is it a fact that the effect so far of the bonus on wool tops, amounting to over .£30,000 of money, has been threefold, viz. :(a) Cheap tops to the Japanese?

To that I replied, "" I am not aware."" ant inquiry, other, may do what it pleases with the money that it earns and is paid by way of bounty. If , for instance, Messrs. Dalgety and Company Ltd. or Messrs. Goldsborough, Mort and Company Ltd., decided to produce wool tops, and, fulfilling all the conditions, earned the bounty, they could at tlie same time, if they so desired, buy up an electric light or gas-making business, and carry it on without running the risk of losing the bounty. As long as they legitimately earned the bounty we could not interfere. opposite would say straight out, "" We are opposed to a bounty on wool tops because we think it would be harmful to Australia, "" that would take up a legitimate attitude. But to say, "" We are opposed to this bounty because a company that is earning it is engaged in another industry, in which it runs up against a company in which we happen to be shareholders""a meat-exporting company, or a meat-preserving company-is not to take up a right stand. members say that we are paying too much searching as a bounty on wool tops? opposite say, if they like, that the bounty should be wiped out.

The percentage of the bounty to the .added value was 5.1-Sd. per cent. I trust that honourable members will pass the Bill. If the payment of a bounty upon the production of wool tops had not been involved, probably it would have been agreed to within twenty minutes or half an hour. But I know that one newspaper in Sydney has published a series of articles concerning nhis industry. There are some persons who are anxious .to crush it as soon as possible. Personally, I think it is a good industry. The honourable member for Wentworth referred .this ""morning to a prospectus which was issued by a certain company. But I ask him whether he has ever known a prospectus to fulfil all its predictions? Perhaps Messrs. Hughes Brothers in starting this industry expected that they would be able to produce wool tops very cheaolvk' I am confident from the informatiori^<iWmv possession that they have not realized their expectations in this matter.. If they choose vestigation by experts, including MrH . to use some of the money which they have made out of the industry in any other industry they are at perfect liberty to do so. We have no more right to say they shall not purchase sheepskins than to declare that they shall not make tweed from wool tops. If they fulfil the conditions laid down for the payment of the bounty, they have a right to claim it. I do not rise for the purpose of opposing underlying the payment of bounties has always had my support. But although the Minister stated that he would give us all necessary information in connection with this proposal, I doubt whether he has done so. Originally, a bounty upon wool tops was granted for a period of five years. An extension of payment is now sought for two years. What are the reasons for that extension? I am prepared to view the 8 proposal sympathetically, but we ought to be told the . particular reasons why this extension of the period over which the bounty shall operate, is sought. I presume that the Minister"" has had a deputation from the employers and the 8 workmen. not told us what reasons they advanced for asking an extension. ing that they informed me they, had to enter into contracts twelve months ahead, and that they could not pay wages to-day but for the bonus-that if the bonus were withdrawn the industry must lapse. of which I was a member introduced the original bonus proposals we felt that we were perfectly justified in doing so. It was pointed out to us that there would be a distinct advantage to the wool trade from the wool growers' and from the sellers' point of view, because there would be increased competition. This would be more especially so in the case of tops made fromsheep skins. It was said this would re-act favourably on the value of sheep and the frozen meat export trade by increasing the value of the sheep skin. The bounty proposals were introduced in no haphazard way, but after careful inV. Jackson, New South Wales; Dr. Cherry, Victoria; Dr. Holtze, South Australia ; and Mr J. Dreyer of Western Australia.

The period that was asked for was five years, which, we were informed, would be quite sufficient to enable this to rank as one of the first industries. we are all human, and it may be that the foundations of that 'prophecy were not correct; and some information from the Minister in this regard would be welcome. The memorandum goes, onThe industry of scouring wool in Australia must always be a diminishing, one, as the manufacturer prefers to have every operation conducted under his own supervision. For this and other reasons the standard of price on a clean scoured basis is lower for scoured wool than for greasy. No fewer than seven reasons were given why the tops should be made in Australia, as follows:(«) By treating the wool whilst fresh, and avoiding the hard pressing of wool (which causes deterioration), a better product will be obtained. (6) The climate and the quality of water available are much in favour. (c) The uncertainty (as to yield and quality) in buying will, to a great extent, be overcome; instead of purchasing thousands of bales and having to wait months for the result, tests can be made and the buyers' judgment supported from time to time. This would commend itself to all firms buying in Australia, and if an up-todate works were erected, would be much availed of by buyers. (d) Contracts for supply of a standard article would be easier to negotiate, thus regulating the market. U) Saving in freight. (/) The favorable position to secure Eastern markets. ig) The local trade in manufacturing cloth that might be developed as a result of the establishment of large top-making establishments from which spinners and weavers could draw supplies more economically than manufacturing themselves in a small way. The question we had to ask ourselves was : Whether there would be any chance of permanently establishing this industry by means of this bonus, paid over the definite period mentioned? Figures were supplied showing that we were justified in anticipating that the industry would be ultimately established on a profitable basis. I think the Minister ought to look at these, and see whether they still hold good. being tion in this, connection :Reduced to pence per lb., the advantages and disadvantages to the local wool-scourer should run out as follow :Credit.

311,Mr Groom,"Quite so, but we are enbe made cheaper .and as well in Australia owing to the perfect natural conditions which exist in Australia in the shape of raw material, water supply, and climate. The number of combs now at work in Australia is estimated at twenty, which represents 1,560,000 lbs. weight of tops per annum, said to be very far below actual requirements-abou t 15,000,000 lbs. weight. I am sorry that the Minister has not seen his way to propose to extend the bounty on coffee, which expires in about three years' time, and which,' in view of the development of the Northern Territory, might prove of great advantage. It will be admitted that coffee is one of the products that will meet with some success in the Territory. Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock for this year we are toldA ll the world over the consumption of coffee does not show such expansion as does that of tea, and consequently the effects of over-production are constantly in evidence in most coffee-producing countries. The coffee plant flourishes through the eastern coastlands of this State, from ""Furthest North"" right down to Brisbane. What is said of that part of Queensland may with equal truth be said of the Northern TerritoryThe shrub, however, will not bear frost-certainly not if in the least severe-so that coffee production would hardly be practicable further south than Brisbane. The production here has not reached the demand of the Eastern States of the Commonwealth, so to this extent expansion of output is feasible. In regard to tobacco, I should particularly like to direct the Minister's attention to what Mr Neville, the Queensland tobacco expert, has to say on the administration of the bounty amongst the farmers. Speaking of cigar leaf, on which the bounty is paid, Mr Neville saysSo far the bounty of 2d. per lb. has not done much to encourage this branch of farming, as the farmers say that it has been so hedged about by regulations that it is hardly worthwhile to look to it unless less strictness is observed. Prices for cigar tobacco have been very satisfactory, growers averaging over is. 3d. per l b . ; and some this year are expecting to get at least 25. for the crop, as they have the best samples that they have ever grown. 1+ would appear that leaf of the very best quality can be grown here, and that the outlook, as a whole, is a good one. Mr sure ground regarding rates and condiNeville said in a previous part of the reportI think it is worthwhile that this Department take under consideration the advisability of assisting the small grower in installing irrigation plants. That this industry will become a valuable one to the StateI do not think can be questioned, as the buyers are urging the increase of the crop, and some of them are showMr Groom. ing their faith by their works, and are spending money freely to encourage and forward it. Already the average crop in growing, hauling, and handling is worth to the State between .£40,000 and ,£50,000; and there is no reason why, if the adverse weather conditions can be neutralized by artificial watering at the proper time, in a few years' time it should not be more than doubled. I have to report also there seems a disposition to improve the quality and the better class of improved seed are now almost altogether being planted. It would be well, I think, if the Minister were to make some inquiries as to the cause of the trouble to which Mr Neville refers. In the amending Bill, one very important change is made. Section 6, In the annual report of the which is to be repealed, saysEvery grower or producer who claims bounty under this Act shall specify the rate of wages paid in respect of the labour employed by him, other than the labour of members of his family, in growing or producing the goods, and the Minister, if he is of opinion that the rates so paid are below the standard rates paid in the place or district in which the goods are grown or produced, may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. Bounty is not paid unless the standard rates of wages prevailing in the districthave been recognised by the claimants, which is a fair condition to impose. But the Minister is substituting a. procedure which is very cumbrous and difficult, and which, although it might do for large industries, is not applicable to small industries, such as the growing of sisal hemp, flax, and other things. If a claim is made for bounty in respect of, say, cotton, the Minister is to inquire first whether there is any Commonwealth award applying to the industry, and then whether there i i any State award. If he finds that no award applies to the industry, he must discover whether the employers and employees in the district have registered under any Commonwealth or State Act, and if he finds that they have not, he must then refer the matter to a High Court or State Judge. The claim might come from some small farmer, say, on the Victoria River in the Northern Territory, and in such a case the procedure would be absurd. Indeed, in many instances persons would not bother about the bounty, even though on perfectly tions, because of the trouble that this procedure would involve. There will be small industries claiming bounties all over Australia, and the application of this machinery will hamper administration, and may make the boundaries useless. I suggest to the Minister that it would be sufficient if he would satisfy himself that the claimant for bounty has' paid the rate of wages prevailing in the district, or a reasonable rate. It is useless to make rigid and cumbrous conditions. The honourable member for Moreton has always shown the keenest interest in primary production, and in his district more cotton has been grown than in any other in Australia. I am sorry that attention was not paid to his request for a bounty on the manufacture of cotton-piece goods. In Ipswich there is the only cotton mill in Australia, and we were informed that a duty of 10 per cent, would have enabled it to keep going, and to give a large amount of employment; but as the duty was refused by this Parliament, the mill operated for a time but had to be closed down recently. To my mind, there is as much justification for the granting of a bounty for the production of cotton as for the granting of a bounty for the manufacture of wool tops, cotton being as natural to Australia as wool. country in the world can produce better fotton, Queensland cotton having been pronounced by eminent experts to be of the highest quality. tea the other day which had been grown near Melbourne, but we cannot produce tea in Victoria. in Australia where, if the labour were available, we. could produce tea. should be an Australian industry, and, no doubt, will in time become one. initial stages that industry will require assistance, and although it is excluded fromi consideration now, I hope that when another opportunity arises, attention will be given to it . myself sympathetic towards though, of course, we must be guided by ' practical business considerations. ought to have more information regarding the bounty on wool tops. replies given by the Minister to very important questions which I asked relating to the bounty on wool tops, were really no replies at all. My first question was1. Is it a fact that the bonus on wool tops of £10,000 per annum is about double the amount paid in wages in the industry? The reply was, "" No . "" I admit that on the figures which have been given by the Minister ,the. amount of the bounty is not anything like double the amount .paid in wages, but the bounty goes a long way to pay wages in the industry. According to the Minister, 304 hands were employed-by Messrs. F . W. Hughes and Company Ltd.', their wages amounting to £ 3 1 , 5 9 6 , while the bounty received was £15,2.70. Of course, all the hands are not employed in the combing work for which the bounty is paid, but are engaged in other branches. The bounty, however, amounts to £ 1 5 for every person employed in combing or in other operations,which is an enormous assistance to the firm. My second question was'2. Is it a fact that the effect so far of the bonus on wool tops, amounting to over £30,000 of public money, has been threefold, viz. :(«) Cheap tops to the Japanese? (0) Dividends at 10 per cent, and 6 per cent, to combing mills and meat company shareholders? (c) Girl labour with odd overseers in one or two combing mills? "" The answer to the first part of the question was "" No , "" and I find that the price Indeed, no other paid by the Japanese averages 2s. 2d. and 2s. 3d. a lb., so that apparently they do not get wool tops more cheaply than any one else, every one paying about the same price for them. The Minister says that I tasted some magnificent no information is available regarding dividends, and that the two firms getting bounty employ 70 females and 305 males. But since these firms are drawing public money, the Minister should make it his business to obtain information regarding Cotton their dividends. The third question was3. Is it a fact that one top-making companv during the twelve months ended 30th June last In its received something like £10,000 or £11,000 of ' this bonus, and at the same time guaranteed to buy a subsidiary company's (the Colonial Meat Export Company) sheepskins at such a price as would pay a dividend to the meat company of 10 per cent, per annum ? I have always shown bounties, It is important that we .should know whether the firm uses the bounty to guarWe antee a 10 per cent, dividend to a company which is not manufacturing wool tops. An examination of the names on the share list shows the two companies to be almost identical. The Minister says that information is not obtainable as to whether the bounty is being used to guarantee a dividend of 10 per cent, on the operations of the Colonial Meat Export Company. That is information that we ought to have. company, having earned the bounty, is entitled to spend as it pleases the money soobtained. We have no more right to ask",40,Second Reading

When people ask for the expenditure of public money to assist them in their business, it is our duty to see that money so paid away is carried along those channels in which it is expected to flow. I also asked the further pertinent questions4. Is it a fact that a portion of the 10,000 or ;£r 1,000 bonus by the Federal Government has been applied indirectly to pay the dividend ' in the Colonial Meat Export Company? 5. If so, is the effect of this to place the guaranteed meat company in a position to crushingly compete against any (and, in fact, all) small buyers of sheep at Flemington, Sydney, New South Wales? Surely the Minister should have obtained a ful l reply to this question. Instead of doing so, he simply told me that the information could not be procured.

The Minister has at his command resources that should enable him to supply the House with the fullest information, but he has seen fit to leave the whole matter in a most unsatisfactory position. I think that he might well, have placed us in possession of more facts before asking us to grant an extension of the bounty on wool tops. the whole, I feel inclined to support this Bill, although, like the honourable member for Darling Downs, I regret that .the cotton industry .has been overlooked in connection with it. The cotton supplies of the world are not keeping pace with the demand, and in the very near future the price of cotton will be much higher than it is at present. I desire to draw the special attention of the Minister to the position of the cotton industry, since I regard him as being personally responsible for its destruction in Queensland. It is hardly reasonable to ask the whole of the people to submit to a heavy duty on cotton piecegoods to assist an industry which, for all practical purposes, is as yet in its infancy. But while that is so, there is no reason why we should not encourage by means of the bounty system those which we desire to see established in Australia. In 1907 the Minister opposed the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, on cotton hosiery yarns. He asked to have hosiery yarns free, and that request being acceded to by the House, practically all the cotton that has since entered Australia has come in free. The cotton industry ,was established in Queensland abouti860, cotton mills then being erected at Ipswich, as the result of a bounty offered by the State Government. Owing to the want of capital and other difficulties, however, the proprietors were forced to close it down as soon as the bounty lapsed. The matter was brought under the notice of the Minister some months ago by the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce and myself, but although the honourable gentleman promised to consider whether steps should be taken to save the industry, I have not yet received any intimation as to his decision nor, so far as I am aware, has any communication been sent to the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce.

324,Mr Sinclair (Moreton) [4.5],"Oncotton seed can be claimed depends upon the establishment of a mill for ginning cotton. By wiping out the cotton industry as it existed until a few months ago at Ipswich, we did away altogether with the growing of cotton, since the bounties payable under the Act are in respect of ginned cotton andcotton seed delivered at the factory for manufacture into oil. The only means of ginning that produced in Queensland was removed by the closing up of Messrs. Joyce Brothers' mill at Ipswich. Judging by an interjection which he made while the honourable membei for Darling Downs was speaking, the Minister seems to doubt the possibility of cotton being grown in commercial quantities in Queensland. produced there. in Queensland in fairly large quantities. A memorandum issued in connection with the Bounties Bill of 1907, sets forth that a conference reportedWe find that in the year 1882-and under the stimulus of a bounty and high prices-4,71 7 acres of cotton were planted in Queensland, the yield being 212,370 lbs. of ginned cotton, or a return, at ordinary market price, of £ 8 per acre. That is not a very high return. area under cultivation. of labour involved in picking cotton, and that is one of the difficulties associated with the establishment of the industry in Australia. We have in the tropical parts of Queensland, and also in the Northern Territory, large areas of land suitable for growing cotton and it would be a good thing if all that land were returning to the tillers of the soil even £ 8 an acre. As the Minister-has seen fit not to include in this Bill a bounty on the production of cotton-piece-goods I hope that he will give the matter favorable consideration, and, in the near future, submit a proposal to stimulate the cotton industry in the Commonwealth. I regret very much that the Ipswich cotton mills should have been closed down for* want of a duty of 10 per cent., or an equivalent bounty. Coming to the bounty on tobacco leaf, I have only to say that we can produce in Queensland, and in certain parts of New South Wales, some of the best tobacco leaf to be found in the world. There appears to be a difficulty, however, in the way of obtaining the bounty, since it is provided that the leaf in respect of which it is claimed must be of such a quality as to command a price of is. per lb. Unfortunately for the tobacco growers they find themselves in the hands of the monopoly, the market value of the leaf being fixed by a trust. I have spoken on one or two occasions against the bounty on wool tops. Since then I have made personal inquiry into the operations of the firm that is now drawing the greater portion of the bounty, and I find that so far as the Australian woollen industry is con-' cerned, its efforts are a mere drop in the ocean, and are not likely to have any effect on the Australian market. I am pleased to hear that we have a wool-top making industry of the magnitude described by the Minister. I have always contended, howbe ever, that the bounty on wool tops should not be confined to exported wool tops. I do not know why that limitation was proposed. protective duty to assist manufacturers of tweeds and hosiery in Australia. bounty on wool tops that are exported, if in that way we can assist the industry. One of our largest exports from Australia is wool. That export business has been worked up without the aid of any bounty. To subsidize the export of wool tops and not the local manufacture of them seems to me to be conferring a benefit upon the foreign buyer of those tops. I would like to see all our woollen goods manufactured in Australia. have the honourable member's vote in favour of protective duties the next time the Tariff is re-opened. ber always had my vote in such circumstances. honourable member to support a duty of over 20 per cent. ever, I have no desire to be drawn on Tariffproposals.

The adoption of that policy would help our local industries, and afford them a further measure of protection without increasing the burden of protection.",43,Second Reading

If he had shown that the firms engaged in the export of wool tops would be unable to carry on operations if the bounty were withdrawn, there would be some excuse for continuing it . they would be unable to continue operations. M i . RYRIE -Does the Minister think that if the bounty were discontinued, Messrs. Hughes Limited, who are paying 10 per cent, dividends, could not carry on? carry on at the wages they are paying. the firm in question obtained more by way of bounty than they paid in wages to their employees. According to the Minister's own figures, 177 hands were employed in the combing mills, and a few whom he said ought to be counted were engaged in other branches of the industry. Roughly speaking, there were 200 hands employed in the combing' of wool tops. company received £15,270 by way of bounty, or the equivalent of £ 7 6 per employee. a period of two years. get the bounty during the previous year was that they did not produce sufficient tops. I say again that last year they received in bounty the equivalent of £ 7 6 per employee\ I do not think that they paid more than that sum in wages. whole of their employees should not be counted. ployed by Messrs. Hughes Limited, but some of them are employed in other branches of the industry.' have closed their establishments. statement that this company is able to compete unfairly owing to the subsidy which is being granted to it by the Commonwealth. There is no warrant for a continuance of this bounty. It was. granted in the first instance to enable the industry to get upon a sound footing. We were assured that at the end of five years it would be able to stand alone. It cannot be fairly urged that Messrs. Hughes Limited cannot profitably carry on operations in the absence of the bounty. Why then should we be asked to contribute another £20,000 to their shareholders? There is not the least doubt that the firm is a wealthy one which could well carry on without the assistance of the public. Last year it had to pay no' wages to its employees. The whole of those wages were paid by the people of Australia. I do not see that the public are deriving any very great benefit from the payment of the bounty. It is true that it is providing employment for 200 hands. But that is not sufficient. It will require to be shown that the public are receiving some other benefit. If the bounty were granted for the production of wool tops something might be said in its favour."" If the bounty were paid to our woollen mills for the manufacture of tops used in their business, there would be some warrant for it. But this bounty is payable only upon the export of wool tops, and I fail to see any special virtue in that policy. I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs did not make clear the reason which exists for the continuance of Last year the the bounty. [4.27] -The honourable member who has just resumed his seat said he would not object to this bounty if it could be shown that it conferred a benefit other than the employment of 200 hands, upon the people of Australia. I would point out to him that the wool-top industry is not the only industry which is benefited by the payment of the bounty. The honourable member must be as conversant with the real position as are most people. What is the reason of all the antagonism which is exhibited to the payment of this bounty? It is to be found in the fact that the operation of the bounty is injuring the Meat Ring in Australia. While the grower of meat is receiving as much for that commodity as he used to do, the people of Australia are to-day getting it cheaper. We know that the Meat Ring went so far as to "" corner "" sheepskins, so that Messrs. Hughes Limited for a time could not obtain the wool with which to manufacture wool tops. But the company then entered the market, and purchased sheep in competition with the Meat Ring. I would also point out that the industry affords employment to a large number of hands.

Hughes Limited were forced into the market to purchase live stock because they could not obtain the sheepskins with which to manufacture wool tops. In one year 9,000,000 of those skins were exported, when they should have been manufactured into leather locally.

Who is making all this fuss? The Meat Ring. As Messrs. Hughes Limited can produce wool tops to the detriment of those who previously handled them, the latter have been obliged to pay better wages. In the absence of this industry the wages paid for the production of wool tops would fall 50 per cent. Wages Boards base wages on the ability of the employer to pay, irrespective of the living wage consideration. benefits Australia, inasmuch as Japan is now using Australian tops in preference to Bradford tops. the raw material here. tops, which they get cheaper here than at Bradford; and, if they buy Australian wool, let them buy it direct from here.

The honourable member is afraid that if a farmer produced 2 cwt. of tobacco or sugar, we might have to put the whole of the machinery of the High Court into operation. down. ter may make application to the Court, or The honourable member for any industrial tribunal; but surely it is reasonable that, if there is a Wages Board in the district, the Government. should, in making conditions, ascertain what is the usual and fair rate of wages paid. I can assure the honourable member that there is no intention to use a steam hammer to crush a walnut. ' As time has gone on, and Bounties Bills have been introduced, the industrial conditions have been improved; and, moreover, may claim the bounties should know what the conditions are before they go into the enterprise, and not, as in the harvester case, find out twelve months afterwards, when the products have been made and sold. The honourable member for North Sydney asked why this bounty was given on the exports of tops, and not on the wool produced for home consumption. I would point out that the woollen manufacturers enjoy a duty on their finished article; and the desire is that the wool should be sent out in a more highly manufactured state than previously. would give reasons for extending the time for the operation of the bounty. The bounty ployers represented to me that there is necessity for granting the bounty twelve months ahead; and in this connection the following sworn declaration giving extracts from letters written by the firm's representative in Japan, by the secretary to F. W. Hughes and Company Limited, will explain the situationSelling twelve months forward I must again say that if you want to sell in Japan you must be prepared to do as the Bradford and German people do, viz., make contracts up to twelve The mills here make twelve months' contracts for their output of cloth with the Government, and with distributing merchants. To protect themselves they must cover by purchasing their raw material-woo l tops-and so make certain of supplies. If the market rises then it does not matter to them, but if it did rise and they had not covered they would stand to lose heavily. I know that it is very worrying to you to have to sell so far ahead, but you have either got to make up your mind to dp this or run the risk of being shut out of all the orders here. I suppose financing, would be a heavy item, but you can of course always insure yourselves by buying your raw material ahead. The Bradford and German woolcombers, as you know, buy their twelve months' supply in Australia during the season, so that it suits them also very well to sell far ahead.",45,Second Reading

I trust there will be no demand for any further extension, or, if there be, that it will be in a modified form. The workers pointed out to me that the yearly export of sheepskins from Australia amounted to 9,000,000. In 1909 the export was 8,380,000; in 1910 it was 9,673,000; and in 1.911 it was 8,832,000. The complaint of the fellmongers is that they cannot get into the market to buy the sheepskins, and F. W. Hughes and Company have had to kill sheep in order to obtain skins. The workers recognise that, with an increase in wages amounting to about 35 per cent., it is impossible for the industry to go on without a bounty. out a bounty the industry cannot compete in the foreign markets? opponents of tfie bounty realize the situation, ancl are anxious, by dispensing with the bounty, to get rjd of a competitor. If they had not come to me, and so made their object clear, I should, not have been prepared to advocate the introduction of this Bounties Bill twelve months beforehand. Personally, I should like to see Australia turn out not only wool tops, but the yarn or the cloth; and I trust that, on the next occasion, we may be proposing a bounty with that object in view. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee: Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause3 (Conditions of employment and rates of wages).

It is not a nice position for a Minister to be called upon to act as arbiter in a matter of laying down a standard rate of wages; these questions are much better settled by authorities outside. I have no doubt that the Bill, in operation, will prove satisfactory; but, if it asking Parliament to amend it. provides that if the Minister finds that the rates of wages and conditions of employment are below the standard rates and conditions prescribed by any Commonwealth or State authority, or below those agreed upon between representatives of associations of employers and employees registered under a Commonwealth, or State Act, or below the rates and conditions declared on application by the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, he may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty. Apparently, although the claimant of bounty may comply with the conditions prescribed in paragraphs a and b. he may fail for want of compliance with the conditions in paragraph c. The scheme of the Bill seems to be that the Minister shall apply to the President to declare what ought to be the wages ruling in any industry. I suppose that the Minister will take advantage of any machinery provided by the States, because these bounties will be claimed over a very wide area, and it would be difficult for the President to visit all the districts in which the supported industries were being carried out. The Bill enables the President to take advantage of State agencies in obtaining a report as to the wages which should obtain in any district, and he also has that power under the Conciliation and Arbitration law, but apparently if the President paid a lower rate of wage's than that prescribed by a Wages Board the claimant, by paying that rate, would lose his claim to the bounty.

Trade and Customs) [4.52] -The bounty is given on wool tops produced for export, and I cannot accept an amendment to make it available for all wool tops. The woollen' manufacturers here are protected by the duties on finished goods. understand that most of the wool tops on which bounty is paid are exported to Japan, and I commend the Minister for his friendly attitude towards that great Power, but in view of the fact that the main advertised purpose in life of the Labour party is to secure the payment of high wages, it seems ridiculous that the money of Australian producers should be spent in giving employment in Japan to workmen-getting a shilling a day or less. The object of Protection should be to secure the manufacturing of our raw materials within the country, and their exportation in a finished condition. .Wool tops are required by the Australian makers of tweed, and the exportation of wool tops whose manufacture is assisted by the bounty, penalizes the makers of cloth. The public is taxed to provide dividends for a very successful company, and the productions of the company cannot be used by local manufacturers. Why should we say what is to be done with these wool tops? manufactured in Australia, what does it matter to the Minister what becomes of them? Why should he be zealous to provide occupation for the sweated labour of Japan? Cheap, wool tops might well be supplied to our own manufacturers. sold to the Marrickville mills. production is exported to Japan. kept going on the local demand, and without a bounty it could not compete with the cheap labour of other countries. without compelling the exportation of the manufacture. If they must export, they will do so. woollen goods is protected. in primary industries does not get as much -advantage from Protection as he would probably get from absolute Free Trade. The industries most protected are the slopclothing industries, which depend on the introduction of cheap raw material. These duties on clothing and other goods raise the cost of living. If the Minister were a Protectionist, about which there seems doubt now in some quarters, he would not object to the omission of the word ""exported,"" and would allow the manufacturer of tops to make what use he liked of the product of the work of his machine, and the girl or boy who looks after it. Bill would be within the order of leave if the amendment were made. increase the burden on the taxpayer. for South Sydney tells us that the manufacturers of wool tops have to export, and, therefore, will export whether this word is retained or not. I think it would be deplorable if the Minister allowed to go uncontradicted an insinuation that has been made that a certain company has issued a misleading prospectus.

The Act which it is proposed to amend relates, like that with which we have just been dealing, to some four items. The original Act, which was introduced in 1908 by the honourable member for Hume, provided for the payment of a bounty of 10 per cent, onGalvanized sheet or plate iron or steel (whether corrugated or not) made from Australian ore. anil for a like bounty onWire netting, not being prison-made and being made from Australian ore or from wire manufactured in the United Kingdom. Those bounties expired on 30th June last, and it is now proposed to renew them for a further period of two years. The Act authorized a total payment of £30,000 in respect of these bounties, and of that iimount £16,828 has been absorbed in respect of wire netting, whilst only £674 has been paid by way of bounty on galvanized iron. engaged in the manufacture of wire netting interviewed me on the subject of an extension of the bounty, which, under the original Act, they are not entitled to claim unless the wire netting manufactured by them is made either from Australian ore or from wire the produce of the United Kingdom. I ' think they have to pay about J £ I per ton more for British wire than for that produced in Germany, and they desired to know what I suggest were the intentions of the Government in regard to the matter generally. After consideration, the Government decided, as was stated in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of this session, to bring forward this measure, as well as others providing for the payment of certain bounties. The bounty on wire netting has, so far, been paid to only one company, that of Lysaght Brothers Limited, who, for the financial year ending 30th June last, received £5,968. The wages received by the employees of that firm ranged from is. 8£d. per hour down to not less than is. per hour in the case of adult males. A few youths receive less; but, broadly speaking, the I object. position is that no adult male in the industry receives less than is. per hour. Those engaged in the manufacture of wire netting state that they could not carry on without the The position of the manufacturers of galthere is a duty on imported galvanized or corrugated iron. of duty? I think that it is £.1 per ton on plate iron and 30s. per ton on corrugated iron. As I have said, £30,000 was made available in respect of these bounties over a period of five years, but, as a matter of fact, the Bill was not passed in time to enable them to be claimed in respect of more than four years' operations. During that time, a total of £17,502 has been paid. The payments have been increasing every year, and the output for 191.1-12 of wire netting was valued at £56,684. The Government are practically bound, so far as this measure is concerned, since they promised to introduce a Bill providing for the extension of these two bounties for a further period of two years; but it remains for Parliament to determine whether or not that promise shall be honoured. We certainly led the manufacturers of wire netting to believe that if About 30th June last, those they used only British wire in manufacturing wire netting, we would be prepared to propose a continuance of the bounty. measure to be retrospective ?",48,Second Reading

The greater the cost of production and the higher the price of the article, the larger the bounty paid. For instance, in the case of wire netting, on the Minister's own figures, the bounty paid amounts to £ 1 6 per annum per man and boy employed, and this, I take it, would' more than cover any increase in the wages, seeing that it represents 6s. 8d. per week. of wages has been more than that, and I think the average is higher. No boy is paid less than £ 1 per week. was that the bounty had been swallowed up by the increase in the wages. wages during last year must have been 6s. 8d. per man and boy per week, and I doubt whether it was anything like that. However, we will let that pass, because this is not only a wages question.; it involves many considerations, including the overcoming of the insane prejudice against local manufacture. I am sympathetically inclined towards the bounty, and my object is to show the need on future occasions of the kind for a detailed statement or balance-sheet.

Bounties Bill, which he had the honour to introduce some years ago, made no provision for bounties in respect of the subjects dealt with in the Bill covered by this message. It is proposed to set apart a sum of £75,000 for the payment of bounties and rewards extending over a period of five years. It was originally intended that the payments should date from the ist July last, the belief being that the Bill would be introduced at an earlier date, but in the circumstances that point will have to be reconsidered. A bounty at the rate of 15 per cent, will be paid in respect of wood pulp, and also a bounty of 10 per cent, on the market value of rock phosphate. [247 ] offered for the discovery of rock phosphate ? some time ago offered a reward for such a discovery, but we have not, so far, found in Australia a rock phosphate to be compared with that obtained from Ocean Island. On three different occasions the Senate has passed a resolution urging that a reward should be given for the discovery of a deposit suitable for making phosphatic manures. The matter is of considerable importance to the farmers of Australia, beread a first time. deposit of rock phosphate in payable quantities, would have the effect of decreasing the price of superphosphates. It would be absurd to offer a reward for such a discovery unless we provide at the same time for the payment of a bounty for its manufacture into a marketable commodity. We therefore provide that the bounty on rock phosphate shall be payable only where, phate has been manufactured into marketable phosphatic manure in Australia. the discovery of a deposit? £1,000 to the discoverer of any deposit of rock phosphate suitable for making phosphatic manure. ter assume that such rock phosphate has not been found in Australia? covered in South Australia has not proved to be as good as was anticipated.

This Bill provides for a bounty on the manufacture of wood pulp and rock phosphate, and for rewards for the discovery of rock phosphate deposits. .£75,000 is to be appropriated for a bounty [247]2 extending over a period of five years, commencing on the ist January next. It was first intended that the Bill should come into operation as from the 1st July, 1912, but it is now proposed that the bounty and rewards shall be made available from the beginning of next year. The clauses of the Bill and the schedules explain clearly the conditions on which the bounty and the rewards can be earned. The production and manufacture must be by white labour, and the wages and conditions of employment must not be below those prescribed by Commonwealth or State industrial authorities. The reward provided for I the discovery of a phosphate deposit, during five years, is £1,000 for any deposit or vein suitable for making phosphatic manure, We have wood which is emia product which is most desirable in the interests of the farming community. It is quite possible that a vein or deposit will be found within Australia.. At. present, I am told, the best rock prosphate has to be obtained from Ocean Island. In South Australia some rock phosphate has been discovered, but, as under the Constitution only the Commonwealth can give a reward of this kind, this measure is introduced.

No doubt such a deposit would be available in more localities than at present. I cannot lay my hand on the statistics just at present, but honourable members may see for themselves that large quantities of rock phosphate are imported every year to the extent of between 250,000 and 300,000 tons. Consideration has been given to the question of making the bounty payable on the percentage of phosphoric acid contained in the raw material, and that percentage could easily be ascertained by analysis.

The honourable member for Darling Downs asked whether any assistance would be extended to those who produce pulp for papermaking from the prickly pear.

The only bounty which is fixed at a higher rate is that for the production of jute, and, as I stated earlier in the day, the quantity of artificial manure used being I believe that it was fixed at a high rate because jute is produced now wholly by lowpaid Asiatic labour. If we gave a higher rate than 15 per cent, for wood pulp, we should have to increase some of the other bounties. According to the latest figures, '64,000 men and over 10,000 women are employed in the United States of America in connection with the manufacture of wood pulp and paper. The capital invested in the business is over ,£55,000,000. Iween 1900 and 1905, £25,000,000 was invested in it. We have an enormous quantity of the waste product from which wood pulp is made. At present, when a tree is cut down, the merchantable timber is taken away, and what remains is piled in heaps and burned. wood pulp it will be a great gain to the community. The industry has been successful in Canada and in Newfoundland, as well as in the countries that I have named. I trust that these proposals will, when effect has been given to them, prove of great benefit to Australia. The Minister is to be commended for these We import between proposals.' The great problem of the agriculturist to-day is how to increase production and to decrease the cost. In the United States of America they are devoting much attention to bringing more ahd more land under profitable cultivation. By the application of scientific methods and the use of fertilisers a great deal of poor land has been practically reclaimed. This is going on in Australia, too, notwithstanding our large areas of rich virgin soil. We shall do well if we can obtain supplies of manures within our own boundaries. During the first nine years of Federation our importation of fertilizers increased over 100 per cent., phosphates making the The freight would degreat bulk. According to Knibbs' Year Book, No. 4, page 416, in Victoria, in Wood pulp 1901, 11,439,farmers were using artificial manures, and in 1910 26,690, the quantity of artificial manure increasing from 23,535 tons in 1901-2 to 77,579 tons in 1909-10.

He is to be commended for his action in introducing this Bill, which I hope will serve to impress upon the people of Australia their responsibility to posterity in respect of afforestation. I hope that the Bill will realize the best anticipations of the Minister, and that there will be found in Australia suitable supplies of rock phosphate to assist in encouraging an enterprise which must become a valuable aid in the growth and development of the primary industries of the Commonwealth. -congratulate the Ministry upon the particular form of bounty enterprise now proposed by them, and I wish especially to thank them for the evidence this Bill gives of their belief that the Government assistance of private enterprises is immensely superior to Government enterprise itself. The Bill proposes to grant a reward for the -discovery of deposits of rock phosphate by individuals who have the energy and persistence to set out on their own account in search of such deposits. -evidently recognise that a sum of money spent on a Government expedition would necessarily prove unproductive, and, indeed, a failure. For this evidence of their real belief in the superiority of Government assistance to private enterprise over Government enterprise itself, I tender them my immediate thanks. The remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs regarding the necessity of preserving the timber resources of Australia were peculiarly timely. Every Government instrumentality in Australia to-day pays too little attention to the possibilities of induswill materially help some of our principal try that we have within our borders; but as that question is so vast and complex, and is really an international one, I do not propose now to enter upon its discussion. So many kind things have been said of this Bill that T think it well to call attention to one particularly wooden provision in it, which I would like to see turned to pulp. I refer to clause 6, which provides thatThe employment in the manufacture or production of the goods, of any aboriginal native of Australia nr of any coloured person born in Ausposits upon which we can draw freely. In tralia, _ and having one white parent, shall not prejudice the claim for bounty in respect thereof. I am a little puzzled when I read this clause to know what are the intentions of the Ministry. Do they seriously intend to encourage mixed marriages? Do they desire to encourage the marriage of aliens with the white Australian population? If they do not deliberately aim at the employment of half-castes in this industry, and are aiming only at conserving the rights of citizenship which birth in Australia gives, why should not this clause embrace every person who happens to have been bom in the Commonwealth? Why should the Government make it essential that the parents of the worker shall have committed what I regard as the racial offence of a mixed marriage between an Asiatic or African and one of European stock? I commend this provision to the earnest consideration of deep thinkers opposite, such as the honourable member for East Sydney; and I hope that some way will be evolved to get honourable members out of the false position in which the clause in its present form will undoubtedly place them. As to wood pulp, I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the bounty would probably be held to cover the product of any vegetable substance, and in those circumstances would, of course, embrace the prickly pear. As the Leader of the Opposition The Ministry points out to me, that is a rather prickly thing to embrace. I hope that, if there be any doubt on the question, this Bill will be amended in Committee to permit of the bounty being paid on the products of any such substance. In conclusion, I congratulate the Government 011 the introduction, of the measure, and I hope that the administration of it will be as satisfactory as the Bill itself leads us to hope it will be. congratulate the Government upon bringing forward this small measure to encourage the growth of a primary industry which primary industries. All those who have watched the course of agriculture during the past few years must recognise that the use of artificial manures, coupled with the better cultivation of the soil, has resulted in an enormous increase in our agricultural products. It has been unfortunate that so far we have not been able to discover any rock phosphate in Australia which could be used, with advantage.

533,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [8.46],"Iorder to give honourable members an idea of the increased use of phosphatic manures in the Commonwealth, I propose to quote the following passage from Mr Knibbs' Y ear-BookA marked increase in the proportion of cropped land treated with manure is in evidence in all three of the States for which returns are available. Thus in Victoria the area of manured land represented in 1901-2 only i 8 | per cent, of the area under crop, as against 65! per cent, in igog-10. Similarly, in South Australia the percentage increased from 69^ per cent, in 1907-8 to 8oJ per cent, in 1909-10, and in Western Australia from 64 per cent, in 1904-5 to 84$ per cent, Crown to the Pacific Phosphate Company, which: in 1908-9. That tremendous increase indicates the general recognition by our agriculturists of the value of these artificial manures. As a matter of fact, they are being more or less used in all classes of agriculture, viticulture, and horticulture, but more particularly in our great wheat-growing areas. Nevertheless, the quantity which is now being used represents only a small percentage of that which will be used as cultivation is pushed further out into the continent. We believe that Australia is destined to become one of the biggest wheat producing countries in the world. Consequently, there is an opening for the use of enormous supplies of phosphatic manures, and it would therefore be of great advantage if we could discover large deposits of rock phosphate. The Minister mentioned during the course of his speech that most of the supplies of rock phosphate are now drawn from Ocean Island, an island situated some 600 or 700 miles north-east of the Solomon Islands, in somewhere about the same latitude as the north, of Queensland. It would be to the advantage of Australia., probably, if the Minister would institute inquiries respecting the possibility of opening up further deposits of rock phosphate in some of the groups of islands of the Pacific. I believe that we have paid too little attention to those islands, of which Australia must sooner or later become the guardian. population is increasing, but, so far, the Empire has not realized their vast importance to Australia. It may be possible in the New Hebrides, and in other groups of islands in which we are interested, to discover large deposits of rock phosphate, which could be treated so that artificial fertilizers may be supplied to our farmers at the cheapest possible rate. Artificial manures are now used, so extensively that every 5s. per ton by which their price can 3fr. Sam-ts6tt. be reduced to the agriculturists of this country must mean an enormous advantage to the Commonwealth. In a report by the Radio-Telegraphic Conference, which was held in Melbourne in 1909, when the honourable member for Bendigo was Postmaster General, there is a description given of Ocean Island. That Conference described) it thus: About 700 miles to the north-east of theSolomon Islands, and almost under the equator, lies lianaba, or Ocean Island. Almost entirely composed of phosphate rock, it is leased by theexports from the island an increasing quantity of this fertilizing commodity. From Ocean Island alone in 1908, 220,000 tons were exported, and increased facilities for shipping, which are being provided by the company on Ocean Island and on the neighbouring Pleasant Island (Nauru), where they also control an almost equally large deposit of phosphate, will enable the company to . export about one-tenthof the annual world's sunnly of phosphate (5,000,000 tons). Although Ocean Island is itself small (area, 1,500 acres), it attracts a surprising, amount of shipping, and exports phosphate to. all quarters of the world. The report goes on to show how trade might be facilitated between that group of islands and Australia by the establishment of wireless telegraph stations, and, incidentally, reference is made to closer shipping communication between those islands and Australia. It would be to the interest of the Commonwealth if the Minister would ascertain whether it is not possible to open up further large phosphate deposits in that group of islands, or in other groups over which the Empire holds some sort of suzerainty. The question of granting a bounty upon the production of wood pulp,, which brings in the question of afforestation,, is one with which we cannot adequately deal in a Bill of this kind. The importance of it has been paramount for some time. The States, although they recognise the importance of re-afforestation throughout Australia, have not moved in that direction as quickly as they might have clone. The supplies of some of the finest of our timbers,, In most of them, such as redgum and ironbark, are being depleted, so that any encouragement which we can give to the growth of those timbers in the Commonwealth will mean an advantage, not only to present, but to future, generations. We have merely to look at. Germany, France, Switzerland, and Russia?, with their magnificent systems of re-afforestation, which are conducted on thoroughly scientific botanic principles, to realize this. Under those systems enormous profits are earned foi the State. But, in my opinion, the immediate question with which we have to deal in this Bill is the granting of a bounty upon rock phosphate. If the payment of such a bounty will be the means of -discovering phosphatic deposits of any extent, this Bill will be more than justified, and will pave the way to the further encouragement of an important industry. deal of phosphate is already produced in South Australia. I have seen some contracts under which phosphatic manures are produced. I know that some land-owners nave entered into contracts with the manufacturers of phosphate, and I think that the deposits are worked on a royalty system. As a matter of fact, the prospecting has been carried on without any encouragement from the Government at all. Works have been established at Port Adelaide at both places for treating the rock phosphate. Contracts have been entered into between the owners of these establishments and land-owners, under which the former treat the rock phosphate, and acquire certain rights of prospecting for it. Upon the rock being obtained, a royalty is paid upon it in proportion to the amount of phosphoric acid that is produced as the result of treatment. So that really there is no occasion for the granting of a bounty for the mere discovery of rock phosphate, though it may be expedient to grant the bounty if phosphoric rock of a more merchantable character-that is, rock containing a high percentage of phosphate of lime, which, when treated, will yield a high percentage of phosphoric acid-is discovered in any part of the Commonwealth. It is stated that the imported article averages about 30 per cent, of phosphoric acid. The imported commodity, which the Minister said contains about 50 per cent, of phosphate of lime, yields, when reduced, about 25 per cent, of the material desired, namely, phosphoric acid. The Minister has in his mind a bounty on rock phosphate manufactured in the quantity prescribed, so as to give, according to the regulations-becaus e it is not laid down in the Bill-2 5 per cent, of phosphoric acid; and I am sorry that he is not able to inform us as to the percentage of phosphoric acid found in the rock discovered and. worked in South Australia. It is said that the rock phosphate of Kapunda is not of the desired quality, and that may or may not be the case; but, as a matter of fact, and it is evidence of quality, I do not believe that the supply is anything like equal to the demand in the immediate district. The figures given as to the actual effect of phosphates on the land do not, in my opinion, adequately represent the position. It is stated that land which formerly yielded 8 or 9 bushels now yields 15 to 16 bushels; but the fact is that land, which is now rendered productive by the use of phosphates and other artificial manures, did not previously yield more than 2 or 3 bushels to the acre. In the very district of Kapunda, ten or twelve years ago, land could be bought at £ 2 an acre; but now, even, allowing for the all-round increase in values, it cannot be had for less than £ 4 or £ 5 an acre, owing to the fact that it can be treated by phosphates. proved cultivation. of phosphates land has been enhanced in value three or four fold; but the chief benefit is that land which was formerly regarded as poor has been rendered excellent in its productive capacity. I hope that the Minister will pursue his inquiries, and find out the value of the phosphates which are being produced in, apparently, the only district in which it is found in Australia, and which I happen to represent. As to the bounty, one must be particular to see that the right person gets it ; and I am not so sure that the provisions in regard to the reward for discovery are as clear as those in. regard to the bounty. That, however, is a matter that can be dealt with in Committee. There are two parties to be considered-the man who produces the rock phosphate, or allows others to produce it, and the manufacturer of the marketable product. We must see, when a bounty is granted on a marketable commodity, that the primary producer, who is the person we desire to assist, gets his due share. Very often the results are not what we anticipate, as the report of the Sugar Commission may suggest. I hope, also, that this Government, or whoever in the near or remote future may be on the Treasury bench, will also consider the associated, and much larger, policy of re-afforestation, in regard to which 'Germany affords an excellent model. There a policy has been successfully developed for over ninety years of planting where ever trees are destroyed or cut down. In this connection British communities have been particularly careless; and a Committee which inquired into the subject in the",60,Phosphate Bounties Bill Second Reading

538,Mr Glynn,"Of course. By the useUnited Kingdom some three or four years ago, made some recommendations, which Mr Bryce referred to in a speech as of national and pressing importance, in regard to the gradual replacing of trees that are destroyed. If we are under any obligation to posterity-a matter about which the Minister of External Affairs seems rather disquieted-there is one here. believe that in the United States of America much has been done in; this connection. Two or three years ago a report was presented to Congress on the question of the conservation of the national resources, and amongst the subjects treated were the improved navigation of connecting rivers and re-afforestation. The navigation of connecting rivers is a matter of vital importance, on which Australia mayhear something in the next fortnight or three weeks. The South Australian Government have obtained from Captain Johnson, one of the chief engineers in the employ of the United States Government, a report on the best methods of locking rivers. This is in connection with a proposal by the State Government to provide for the improvement of the River Murray from the mouth up to the Darling; and a Bill, I believe, was finally settled last week, and will be introduced next session. The report ofCaptain Johnson was, I think, laid on ""the table of the State House of Parliament yesterday, and it may be helpful to us here. As to re-afforestation, the report presented to Congress was very illuminating; and on it criticisms have appeared in, amongst other periodical's, the Annals of ihe American Academy, a year or so ago. I hope that a matter of this sort, which does not appeal to our direct and proximate interest, and is, therefore, the more likely to be neglected, will be taken in hand by the States and the Commonwealth in co-operation. It is a serious consideration that the granting of a. bounty on wood pulp may have the effect, perhaps, of furthering the gradual destruction of our forests, without replacement. I hope however, that the bounty will be productive, for, if it is, the benefits given to agriThe Minister may be interested to know culture right through Australia will be perceptible. In my childhood I remember that, for a poor class of manure, Irish farmers, who were under pretty stiff rents, had to give from £4 to £5 a ton; indeed, they used to work from morning to night, and pay even as high as £13 ios. a ton for Peruvian guano. What has been done successfully in the Old Country under Mr Glynn. deterrent conditions ought to prove an immense stimulus to our agricultural development in Australia. impossible to over-estimate the importance'of the subject-matter of this Bill. On general principles I prefer rewards for the discovery of natural resources to a bounty, I because of the difficulty of insuring that the latter gets into the proper handsI hope the Minister will be careful in his regulations to provide for a proper percentage of phosphoric acid. Before the use of artificial manures in South Australia, the agricultural industry was in a very poor way, but since the employment of superphosphates there has been, not merely an evolution, but, practically, a revolution, and during the last ten years the use of artificial manures has been quadrupled. The State Government of the day saw that it was important that every effort should be made to discover, if possible, rock phosphate within the State, and a reward was offered as under this Bill. In the Year-Book of South Australia, which has just been published, there is the following :The existence of mineral phosphates in South Australia has only been lately demonstrated. In order to stimulate the search for deposits of phosphate rock within the boundaries of the State, a reward for its discovery in workable quantity was offered by the Government. This bonus was successfully claimed for the Clinton discovery at the north-eastern end of Yorke Peninsula, and since then phosphate has been found in many other places. This rock is found almost invariably in connection with the crystalline limestones and other rocks belonging to the Cambrian system. In some cases it appears in deposits apparently filling in cavities in the limestone, and in others it is partly interstratified with the soft argillaceous rocks which accompany the limestone. In all cases it occurs in segregated masses, boulders and nodules. Numerous deposits exist, and the occurrence of rock phosphate at intervals has been demonstrated for about 200 miles along the main range from Mount Magnificent in the south, lo Bendelby in the north, the average of the highest and lowest analysis being 69 p.c. to 42 p.c. tricalsic prosphate. These deposits are already of economic valuethat already 49,000 tons has been marketed within tbe last ten years as the result of the reward offered by the State Government. At the same time these local mines are not able to compete successfully with the imported commodity. The writer in the Year-Book goes on to sayThey are not yet able, however, to successfully compete with the imported rock from Christinas and Ocean Islands, but we may with every confidence look forward to the time when they",62,Phosphate Bounties Bill Second Reading
539,Mr Gordon (Boothby) [9.10],"It is-will be of the greatest importance and value, not only to the State of South Australia, but to the Commonwealth generally. This information indicates that the Minister in offering a reward is moving on right lines. If the discovery in South Australia has resulted in producing nearly 50,000 tons of marketable phosphates, it is quite possible that this Bill .may have similar results in other parts of Australia. If rock phosphate can 'be discovered in payable quantities, the deposit will be better than a gold mine to Australia. I hope that the Minister will be called on to pay, not only the reward for the discovery, but also the full amount of the bounty. The whole community must benefit by the providing of cheaper manures for the purposes of agriculture. As for the proposed bounty on wood pulp, the time is rapidly approaching when this National Parliament must consider the question of afforestation. A few weeks ago I addressed the Chamber of Manufactures in Adelaide on the conservation of natural resources, and information that I had obtained from all parts of the continent warranted me in then making the statement that only one-third of the timber that is felled in this country is used, the remaining two-thirds being wasted. The conservation of resources is of supreme importance in a country like Australia, and I congratulate the Minister on having taken the first step by encouraging the discovery of phosphatic rock and the manufacture of wood pulp. What has been possible in South Australia as the result of a small reward should encourage the National Parliament to do still more in the same direction. [9.18] I join with the honourable member for Boothby in congratulating the Minister on. the Bill, and endorse what he has said about the value of rock phosphate deposits. Were we fortunate enough to find an inexhaustible supply, it would be worth more to us than the best coal mine ever known. The proposed reward will stimulate prospecting, and, I hope, will lead to the discovery of deposits sufficiently large to remove the fear that many agriculturists harbour that the supplies of artificial manure are becoming exhausted or seriously diminished. At the same time, nothing should be done to prevent the importation of rock phosphates from Ocean Island, Christmas Island, and other places, because we shall need all we can get. It is not only the Australian farmer who has discovered the value of this fertilizer, the application of which has, in South Australia, practically doubled the production of wheat within the last few years. We should look ahead, and protect what supplies we have. In this matter the United States of America are very wide awake. It is only a year or two since their Agricultural Department or Bureau sent one or two officers to South Australia to examine the land for supplies of manure which they could procure and ship to America. They could not discover large deposits of sufficiently high grade to be worth the cost of transport, and it is a fortunate thing that they were not able to lay their hands on a supply in Australia. I understand that the works of Wallaroo and Port Adelaide have to use rock containing at least 65 per cent, of phosphates, but no doubt when outside supplies shrink and become more expensive, and recourse has to be had to the local deposits, it will be found possible to work lower-grade rock. I hope that the Commonwealth and State Governments will look ahead, and secure what supplies there are for our own people, preserving them if necessary for future requirements. I join with other honourable members in expressing the hope that large deposits of rock phosphate will be found in Australia. Land has been increased in value by -£a and £ 3 an acre through the use of phosphates. As to the proposed bounty for the production of wood pulp, I was struck when passing through Canada and the United States of America to see the manner in which timber is there converted into paper. There are very large mills at Ottawa. Apparently we have in Australia timber which is now wasted which could be similarly used. As a rule, I am not in favour of paying public money in bounties, but in this instance the Government are on the right track. No bounty can be obtained until the wood pulp has been produced.

559,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"ships to engage in our trade at their own sweet will, and an Australian ship that is not licensed under the Act will not be able to do that which a foreign ship may do. The amendment is not satisfactory, and I , as well as certain members of the Senate, believe that it will not give effect to the object that we have in view. I therefore propose to move that after the words "" bill of lading,"" the words "" in the same ship"" be inserted. That would make it clear that a foreign vessel would not be deemed to be trading in Australian waters as long as such cargo was'not transhipped, but that if it were transferred, such a vessel would be deemed to be engaging in the coasting trade. Then, again, with a view of bringing the trade between Australia and Papua under the conditions imposed with regard to the coasting trade of Australia, I propose to move several amendments. The Bill at present provides thatA ship shall be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade within the meaning of this Act, if she takes on board passengers or cargo at any port in a State, or a Territory which is part of the Commonwealth. . . . I understand that Papua is held not to be a part of the Commonwealth, and I therefore propose to move that the words "" which is part of,"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""under the authority of."" When I brought this matter before the House on a previous occasion, it was said that the clause if so amended would seriously interfere with the coasting trade of Papua-that under it the conditions required in respect of vessels engaged in the Australian coasting trade would have to be observed in respect of vessels trading along the Papuan coast. In order to overcome that difficulty, I propose, at the proper time, to move the addition of a new paragraph as follows(d) Passengers or cargo between ports of the Papuan native pay the greater part of the Territory of Papua. That will make it clear that ships engaged only in the coasting trade of Papua will not have to conform to the conditions required in the case of vessels engaged in the Australian coasting trade. I also propose to move a further amendment under which Papua will be treated as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, so that the shipping trade between it and Australia will have to conform to the conditions required in respect of the rest of the Australian coasting trade. In connection with this matter, there has been something in the nature of a newspaper Mr Mathews. controversy between Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company and the Dutch Royal Packet Steam Navigation Company. I have no special concern for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, who, like every one else, are out for the almighty dollar, and I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not hold a brief for them. I do not desire that the change that I propose to make in respect of the trade between Australia and Papua shall be brought about immediately. I do not want to place the white residents of Papua in a prejudicial position, and if the clause be amended in the way that I desire, it may be brought into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. In other words, effect could be given to it when there is a better service between Australia and Papua than now exists. I do not think that I am asking too much of the Minister in urging him to consent to that proposal. Residents of Papua say that at present there is only a five or six weekly mail service between Australia and the Territory, that they have toavail themselves of the facilities for reaching the mainland supplied by the Dutch and German steamers, and that it would be unfair to curtail those facilities. Up to that point I am in agreement with them, but as soon as a better service between Papua and Australia is provided there is no reason why the trade with Papua should not be carried on under the same conditions as apply to the Australian coasting trade. A petition has been presented from residents of Papua protesting against anything of the kind, complaining that they have no representation in this Parliament, and that they are, therefore, forced to pay taxation without representation. I do not wish to be too hard on them, but the true position is that they pay very little taxation. They make the taxation that is imposed, and the Commonwealth gives them a substantial subsidy. Since we subsidize a mail service for their benefit, surely it is not too much to ask that the conditions that we require in respect of shipping on the Australian coast shall apply to the trade between the mainland and Papua, as long as we do not interfere With their own coasting trade. Letters have recently appeared in the newspapers from Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company and a gentleman named Werner, who, I understand, is secretary of Messrs. C. R. Baldwin Limited. Mr Werner says that whilst Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company object to the competition of the Dutch steamers on the Papuan coast, the fact remains that they receive a subsidy, while the Dutch mail-boats do not. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have entered into a contract with the Commonwealth Government for the carriage of mails to and from Papua, and under that contract they have to observe certain conditions of labour and to pay certain rates of wages on their vessels. Another point is that they are not permitted to charge more than certain freights. Mr Werner writesSo far as the subsidized foreign companies are concerned, and upon which so much stress is laid, I would like to point out that, so far as the Royal Packet Steam Navigation Company (the principal competitor in Papua) is concerned, it receives no subsidy, and therefore that for this particular trade it has to compete with the subsidized service of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. I wish it to be understood that I am putting up a fight, not for Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, but for those who have to go down to the sea in ships to earn their living, and many of whom reside in my constituency. This statement has also been communicated to meMr Werner, Secretary of C. R. BaldwinL t d . , who are the agents for the Dutch Company at Port Moresby, denies that any subsidy has been received, but we have all documents relating to same translated from the Dutch, and cable advices received from Hague to local press, 18th March and 28th of June last year, confirm. Probably the Dutch Company consider subsidy misnomer, as Bill passed is more an agreement for payment of loss sustained by competition of Australian line, and certain indemnifications to cover sinking fund, depreciation, interest, insurance, and other expenses up to ^12,500 annually for ten years. We are endeavouring to improve the conditions of Australian shipping, and yet we are encouraging, not only at our expense, but at the expense of the Empire, a foreign fleet between Papua and Australia to compete with our own shipping, in which Australian seamen receive better pay and better conditions. ber suggest that the Dutch ships are constructed for mounting guns? know that Germany-and it is not very far from Germany to Holland-is building only convertible ships. Only yesterday, a question was asked of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence relating to the Japanese in the Pacific Islands trade. I submit that we have no more, right to object to Japanese interference in that trade than we have to object to Dutch or German interference with it. Mr Werner saysThe Royal Dutch Packet Company, practically speaking, pay wages amounting to ^300 per month upon a steamer of a net register of 1,886 tons, which is much higher than what an English boat would pay. I am not talking about English mail steamers, but about Australian mail steamers. The boat which carries our mails to Papua has a register -of only 1,080 tons, and yet it pays in wages £408 per month. So that Mr Werner's statements are not correct. I may also mention that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company have just made a voluntary agreement with the Seaman's Union of Australia to pay a rate of wages which satisfies the demands of that union. Members of the Opposition, therefore, must admit that that company are paying fair wages. I have no desire to be charged with delaying the progress of business, or with placing the Government in a false position But, seeing that we are endeavouring to improve the conditions which obtain in Australasian shipping circles from every stand-point, and seeing that we have supreme control over our coastal trade, I contend that it is our duty to do all that we can in the interests of that trade. If we insist upon the vessels which are engaged in that trade conforming to conditions to which other vessels do not conform, surely the former ought not to be placed at a disadvantage by reason of the competition of the latter. I do not ask that my proposal shall be brought into operation immediately. honourable member wishes in the manner suggested. His proposal in paragraph b is more far-reaching than the person who drafted it imagines. It absolutely involves the whole Bill. If a ship over-carried anything from Melbourne to Svdney it would have to be left in Sydney until she returned there.

But I cannot accept his amendment, seeing that the persons engaged in tlie industry in Papua unanimously petitioned admit that a large number signed the petiuon. tion presented from the other side. were carried, it* would considerably reduce the number of steamers which now call at Papua. The Dutch line and other lines of steamers would not call there. At the present time, the outward calls number fiftyone during the year, and under the honourable member's proposal they would be reduced to nine. The inward calls-that is, calls by vessels coming from abroadnumber thirty-one during the year, and these would also be reduced to nine. I do not desire my proposal to be brought into operation at once. sible to do what the honourable member suggests in the form in which his amendment has been drafted. give an absolute monopoly to one shipping company. I have consulted the Attorney General, who has taken as keen an interest in this Bill as he has exhibited in any measure which has come before the House. The amendment would not have the beneficial effect which -the honourable member anticipates it would have. On the contrary, it would constitute one of the strongest reasons why the Imperial Government should hang up the Bill. authorities would say that we have dealt with a matter with which the people in the Territory affected had no means of dealing themselves. here; and the honourable member has been on the spot, and knows the conditions under which they labour. how we can leave the trade open to allcomers until such time as there is another service. terested in Papua; and if in the future it be proved that such an amendment would not throw the whole trade into the hands of one company, it would, I am sure, receive favorable consideration. The worse feature is that this shipping company is also a trading company, and it would be open to them to conveniently or accidently leave competing goods behind. When there is genuine competition will be the time to act. Government desired to do anything to I favour the local shipping industry, where the connection or communication is so useful, the proper step would be to increase the subsidy to the existing company rather than impose a ban on others. I am afraid that the proposed amendment of the honourable membei for Melbourne Ports would, if carried, render the clause absolutely senseless. The definition of "" coasting trade "" means practically that if a vessel takes on board passengers or cargo in Australia, and delivers it in Australia, it is in the coasting trade; but it is doubtful whether a vessel coming from abroad, and transhipping cargo to another vessel j is within the definition. I do not think it is; and the proviso is there to declare that such a vessel is not within the definition. As a matter of fact, it is not within the definition according to the decisions in maritime law, and, if the proviso were omitted, the clause would have the same effect. The case is similar when a vessel takes on cargo in Australia and His proposal would transfers it to another vessel going abroad; and the proviso is only there as a greater precaution. The amendment suggested declares that there must not only be a through bill of lading, but one vessel for the whole voyage-the very thing the proviso is intended to prevent. Not much harm would be done if the Senate's amendment were struck out. The Senate seems to desire that in transhipping cargo, which comes under a through bill of lading, The Home from, say, England, there must not be transhipment into a .vessel that is violating our coasting trade law-that is, a vessel trading exclusively in Australian waters, and not licensed under the Act. But a They have no representation vessel cannot so trade unless it is licensed.

But his desire now, apparently, is to shut out the ships of a Dutch Company from trading between Papua ancl Australia. If he is to be logical-if we are to be alarmed about the appearance in these waters of a Dutch flag once or twice a year-if the supremacy of the Empire in these waters is to be menaced by the occasional visits of a Dutch ship-the n why is he silent about the fleets of other foreigners, from which we receive almost weekly visits ? We have never heard a word ab§ut the German steamers which appear here far more frequently than do the vessels of the Dutch Company.

I leave him with the hope that he will explain his contradictory attitude to his constituents. Hindmarsh advocates the adoption of restrictive measures in order to encourage some prospective company which is to start in the sweet by-and-by. If we do anything of that kind we shall be acting quite contrary to the precedents, legislation, and practice of this House since I have been here. It is our duty to legislate for actualities and not for possibilities, and when the grand new company, forshadowed by the honourable member, comes into being it will be time to ask this Parliament to protect it . . I hope the Government will consider the position of the isolated settlers in Papua. He does not appear to I am one of those who journeyed to that Territory in order to ascertain the conditions prevailing there, and I had the honour of presenting a petition signed by practically every white man in Papua protesting against any restriction being placed upon ships calling at their ports. Surely people isolated as they are, and cut off from all the conveniences of civilized life, are entitled to every consideration we can give them. Surely we are not going to add to the manifold difficulties which beset them in a hand-to-hand struggle with nature, and cut off their means of communication with Australia and other countries which are most valuable to them. If this were proposed to be done on behalf of a shipping enterprise of our owna Government line of ships-it would be understandable ; but the concern to which this amendment gives a monopoly, is a cormorant not.content with shipping profits. Yet not one It is a huge trading concern. Givei t a monopoly of the shipping and it would crush out every competitor it has in Papua, leaving the entire population at its mercy. It is known all over Papua as "" the octopus "" and while it had the trade in its own hands it dictated the most outrageous terms to the settlers. That firm have enormous stores at Port Moresby, Woodlark Island, and Samarai, and if T h is is an extraordinary there were no competition they would charge the settlers the exorbitant prices I have done with the levied by them in the olden times. Hence the Government should do nothing to discourage shipping companies from calling at Papuan ports. If they do so they will throw the whole of the settlers into the hands of the monopoly.

The honourable member for Wentworth has put the case very clearly and fairly. I do not hold any brief for the Dutch Company, the New Guinea Company, or Messrs.

This year we are spending £50,000 in developing New Guinea, and we have sent out a party to search for oil, and now that the trade of the country is assuming profitable proportions the Dutch Company, who have not put in any pioneer work, and the German Company, are trying to take it away from Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. So far from injuring the residents of Papua, we are assisting them in every possible way. We have erected a wireless telegraph station for the purpose of providing them with a ready means of communication with the Commonwealth, and I say that, having done so much to develop Papua, it is not unreasonable that we should desire to secure the trade of the Territory for the people of Australia. We have in Burns, Philp, and Company a shipping company registered in the Commonwealth, and compelled to carry white crews, and pay white men's wages. member knows well they do all their work at Port Moresby with black labour. doing their work in Papua with Papuan labour.

When at Thursday IslandI made many inquiries, and I found that no one there desired that Burns, Philp, and Company should have f u l l control of this trade. I have had some correspondence with the firm, which was conducted in a friendly way. I was taken to task in connection with statements made concerning the Dutch Company, which has been referred to. Higgins to the effect that the Dutch Company paid white men double the wages paid by any company trading on the Australian coast, not even excepting the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, the Orient Steam Navigation, and the Nord-DeutscherLloyd Companies. In addition to paying these high wages, the Dutch Company permits a captain or chief engineer to retire at the age of 45 years on a pension of £500. seamen ? pear that we should level up the Australian wages to the Dutch standard. the wages paid to officers. We know that in the past shipping companies engaged in the Australian coasting trade frequently sweated the officers employed on their ships. I have to admit that the Malay and other coloured labourers employed on the Dutch Company do not receive half the wages paid to white men engaged in our coasting trade. I know that at one time Burns, Philp, and Company used to tranship their white crews at one port, and take on coloured crews for a portion of the round voyage. It was claimed that at that time the subsidy paid for the carrying on of the mail service in which the company was engaged did not permit of the employment of white crews for the round trip. I may inform honourable members that the Dutch Company, when their ships come on to Melbourne, enable their coloured men to attend a theatre free. They also make proper provision for the protection of those in their employ from the. two deadly diseases which are a disgrace to the . human race, and which neither Kings nor Governments have yet been able to control.
