There is no matter concernments of the ten secret men. In order to make sure that ample time shall be given to the employers to bring about turmoil and strife in an organization, the Attorney-General has brought down an amendment which provides that if within 21 days, ten members, whether individually or collectively, lodge an application for a secret ballot, the applications shall be treated as constituting a single application. There is no intention to call evidence in support safeguards to protect an organization of the application for the secret ballot. The new amendment provides that the application for a secret ballot shall be enclosed within an envelope, which shall be marked, "" Secret Ballot."" Any person other than the registrar who dares to open that envelope shall be fined Â£100. Groom) -Order!

I confirm the statement of the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that this party does not object to secret ballots. It is the estabsonation to take place, and no safeguard lished custom of the trade unions of this country to have secret ballots on most industrial questions. But we do object to this Government, through the agency of the Arbitration Oourt, taking secret ballots of this nature, impoverishing the unions and assisting to smash instead of belp industrial organizations. Under the provisions of this bill an employer can, with the assistance of ten or more members, keep a union in a continuous state ing the members of a union upon which a secret ballot cannot be demanded, and the judge can, and I have no doubt will, on many occasions, grant an application for a ballot without consulting the officials of the organization concerned. Any system which allows a judge to arrive at a determination without taking evidence is immoral, and should not be tolerated. This legislation provides that evidence may be dispensed with, and there are no from personation by members. tant, and a plank should be inserted to cover the omission. a character that no matter how many planks were inserted it could not be made efficient, particularly against personation by members of a union. When an application is received for a secret ballot the registrar opens the envelope containing the application. The application is signed by ten alleged members of a union. It is shown to the judge, and only he and the registrar are to know the names of the applicants. How can they certify that the applicants are bona fide members of the union? There should be a provision that the judge must send an officer of the court to interview the applicants, take their signatures and compare them with those on the application. Otherwise there is no means of indentification. It is possible for a lawyer representing an employer to get any Tom, Dick or Harry to sign ten names, which appear on the list in the court which is utmost available to any employer, and send the application to the judge, without guaranteeing that the applicants are bona fide members of the union. [Extension of time granted.'] That permits peris granted to the organization. The judge can not only take possession of tbe books of a union to assist him to take a ballot of the members, but an officer of the court may go into the union office and practically take control of it.

Lack of knowledge' on the part of tbe Government has caused it, before the bill has been discussed, to propose to omit quite a considerable slice of clause 47. There was a stipulation that no alteration of the rules of . an organization should be made unless approved by a vote of the members of tbe organization. That was one of tbe most ridiculous clauses in the bill, and I cannot make myself believe that it was drafted by the Attorney-General. Whoever drafted it shows a complete lack of knowledge of the conditions of large organizations in Australia. It would be an absolute impossibility to adhere to that clause and conduct an organization. I am pleased that the good sense of the Attorney-General has prevailed, causing him to modify the clause. It is a great pity that he does not allow his good sense to prevail and omit practically the whole of the bill. clause provided that, upon deregistration, an organization shall be wound up. Evidently some of the Attorney-General's enthusiastic employer friends convinced him that the funds and property of the organization should be apportioned among the remaining members of the union, or that they should be handed over to a reformed association of the remaining members. spoke in favour of the provision but, before it could be discussed, his better judgment prevailed and he decided that it should not be proceeded with. One wonders whence such clauses emanated. Evidently they come from people who have no knowledge of the workings of industrial organizations in Australia. Provisions are set out which cannot be administered. If a community regards a law with contempt and refuses to abide by it, no government in the world can enforce it. From time to time, laws of an intolerant character have been passed and the people have disregarded them. Mr Blakeley. When a government realizes that tbe The people disregard and hold a law in contion and native wit not to endeavour to administer that law The Government should see that this legislation is not brought into operation. The bill allows vindictive attacks to be made on trade unionism. It allows interference with the domestic affairs of trade unions, which have hitherto been properly conducted, their rules and regulations being registered either in the Federal or State courts. If this bill is administered, it will compel such organizations to work underground, to carry out their operations in secrecy and endeavour to evade legislation of this character. In addressing myself to this subject, I wish to express my surprise at the lack of cogent reasons advanced by members of the Opposition to show that the bill should not be passed. For some weeks the Opposition has been fulminating against it, yet neither in the speeches which I have read, nor in the two which I have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader, has any structural alteration of importance been sugThere was also a gested. I maintain that the bill is an honest attempt to improve the present system of arbitration, and deal out evenhanded justice, not to one section alone, but to every section of the community. Not one word has been said to-day by honourable members on the other side to show that there is anything in this bill that is unfair to the unions, the general public, or to the consumers, who have The honourable gentleman for too long been forgotten when the subject of arbitration was under discussion. Let me preface my remarks on this bill with a few observations on trade unionism itself. It is true that many years ago trade unions in England and other countries had to hold their meetings in secret, but it is grotesque to say that anything in this bill, would compel the same sort of thing to be done in Australia. It is exaggerated statements of that kind by responsible labour leaders that deceive the workers, making them believe that things exist which have no foundation in fact. I do not suppose that there is an honourable member on the other",44,Setup

In England trade unions ""were suppressed all through the centuries u n t i l the dawn of the manufacturing era in the eighteenth century. By the acts of 1871 and 1876 trade unions were allowed to assume a character which has remained fundamentally unaltered to the present day. There are still only 4,190,000 workers belonging to trade, unions in England, and when this is compared with the total number of workers, it is evident that unionism is not so strong in the Old Country as it is in Australia. TJnited States of America trade unionists number 4,443;000. In both of those countries trade unionism has been -until recently entirely industrial, as it should be.

The article continuesIn a vigorous article contributed .to an evening contemporary, and entitled "".Fighting has failed"" Mr Phiilip Snowden said-""Both the great body of employers and trade unionists have no sympathy with the reactionary .elements in their ranks.

"" I do not agree with peace at any price,"" says Mr John Bromley, "" but I am not going out of my way to denounce every approach made in that direction."" The redoubtable Mr Ben Tillett, who has had as much to do with strikes as any other trades union official, in a speech at Barrow-in-Furness expressed his pleasure at His sucthe fact that "" The great combination of employers were seeking an understanding with the mighty factors of Labour.""

Walkden, Robert Smillie,. and Miss Margaret Bondfield, have at various times proclaimed their desire for industrial peace. In another paragraph the writer of the article statesThe first paragraph of the Emergency resoNothing of that lution framed by the General Council as a reply to the Prime Minister's appeal to the leaders of the unions to give a lead towards peace, reads as follows:-""This congress, having noted the repeated appeals of the Prime Minister to the leaders of Labour on the subject of collaboration for industrial leaders of peace, points out that no section of the The following is an extract community is -more desirous of peace than the "" Industrial workers."" In moving the resolution, Mr Ernest Bevin declared emphatically that the unions did not exist for warlike purposes, and Reviewthat "" such machinery for conference and conciliation as existed had sprung up out of the demands of the unions."" In the debate the general secretary, Mr W. M. Citrine, stated that; "" He believed more was to be gained by the leaders of industry on both sides--by men who understood the problems-tha n by the interference by politicians bent on playing the party game."" If the two speeches by members of the opposition this afternoon indicated anylevy contributions for political purposes. thing at all, they indicated that the speakers were politicians bent on playing Union Act of 1913 was passed. This gave the party game at the expense of the unions in Australia. In the history of trade unionism in England, two very important cases have come under review: wereOne is the Taff Vale case, which was heard in 1901. At that time the law in England laid it down that when a union inflicted irreparable damage on an indusmade out of a separate fund. try, it was a fair thing for a court to give judgment for damages against the union. When the case was heard, the court awarded Â£42,000 damages to the Taff Vale Railway Company against the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants for damages caused through a strike. That was the state of the law until 1906, when the Trade Disputes Act was passed by Parliament exempting the unions from having their funds attached in that way. thing that ever happened. the honourable member, no doubt it was; but Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chief Justice of England, described the bill as the most outrageous measure that was ever attempted to be placed on the statute-book. Mr Justice Darling said that "" it placed trades unionists in England in the the political fund of a trade union unless humiliating position of being different, from all the rest of His Majesty's subjects."" Yet my friends opposite say that what was done on that occasion was a very proper thing to do. nized tbe unions in England until after the Taff Vale case. That was the turning point. them some years before that. I desire to refer now to the Osborne case, which was decided in 1909, when the House of Lords interpreted the Trades Union Acts of 1871 and 1876, as to the powers which those acts conferred on trades unions. The facts of the case were briefly that a noted capitalists, with the object of exunion had made a rule compulsorily levyploring the difficulties which confronted ing upon its members for the purpose of subsidizing a member of Parliament to speak and vote according to instructions. industrialists? It was not. On the The House of Lords held that the Trades Union Acts did not confer any power to In consequence of this decision the Trades power to unions to apply funds for political purposes, subject to certain restrictions therein laid down. The restrictions 1. The political objects had to be approved at a ballot by a majority of members. 2. Payments for such objects had to be 3. Any member might give notice that he objected to contribute, without loss of any of the benefits of membership. 4. Payment to the political fund was not to be made a condition of admission to the union. The political objects to which these restrictions applied were, inter aliaPayment of election expenses of any candidate-; expenses of political meetings or literature; maintenance of a member of Parliament; enrolment of electors; selection of candidates. The law remained thus until the Baldwin Government passed the Trade Disputes and Trades Unions Act in 1927. This act alters the 1913 act in one important respect. In place of the provision that any union member might signify his objection to contribute, the law now provides that I t shall not be lawful to require any member of a trade union to make any contribution to he has, at some time, . . . before he is first required to make such contribution, delivered . . . . notice in writing of his willingness to contribute to that fund. The result is that whereas formerly a unionist was presumed to be willing to contribute unless he said he was not, he is now presumed to be unwilling unless he says he is.

14,Mr Parkhill,"An important inI trast tbe attitude of British industrialists with that adopted by the leaders of Australian, industrial unionism when they received an invitation from the Prime Minister to attend an industrial peace conference. The Labour movement in Australia could find time to send an accredited leader to attend an Asiatic communist conference at Shanghai; but not one prominent Labour leader could be found to advocate the desirableness of appointing representatives to attend a conference here to investigate the economic problems which the nation is facing. munists hold a good deal of authority in Australian trade unionism to-day the recognized leaders of labour are too timid to express their convictions. Their attitude is that of the noted French cynic who said, "" I am their leader, therefore I must follow them."" For many years there has been legislative provision in Great Britain* to oblige trade unions to keep separate accounts of contributions for political and industrial purposes. That legislation was deliberately retained a short while ago. It must appeal to all fair-minded persons that it is wrong to compel a working man who has to join a trade union in order to retain his employment to contribute towards funds for conducting labour propaganda with which he is entirely out of sympathy. If I were a struggling workman faced with the necessity of obtaining regular employment in order to support my wife and family, I should protest most vehemently at having to contribute to funds to propagate labour principles which were repugnant to me. It is very well known that thousands of trade unionists in Australia contribute by compulsion to Labour funds, but religiously vote for National candidates. It is just as unfair to compel working men with Nationalist sympathies to contribute to the Labour party funds as it would be to compel Nationalists with Labour sympathies to contribute to the funds of the Nationalist party. I suggest that a provision should be inserted in the bill to oblige unions to keep a separate account of contributions received for political purposes and to make it optional for trade unionists to contribute to a political party. ask honourable members to conThe Nationalist party is by no means out of sympathy with the legitimate aspirations of organized labour. If I were asked to define the attitude of our party on this subject. I should say that it recognizes that the trade union movement is a perfectly legitimate factor in industrial life. As a matter of fact many of the 850,000 trade unionists in Australia vote for the Nationalist party. We hold that it is just as reasonable to permit the working men and women of Australia to combine their forces to secure shorter working hours, better pay and more leisure as it is to permit employers to Because a handful of comcombine in order to protect their interests. The Nationalist party-and I make it perfectly clear that these are my personal views, although I have no doubt they would be endorsed by the great body of National supporters-woul d be the last to place any obstacle in the way of trade unions performing their legitimate functions. It would be folly for us to take any other stand, for many honourable members on this side of 'the chamber receive a considerable number of votes from the workers. Many of us, myself included, are workers and the sons of workers, and have every sympathy with the wage earners. In my opinion there is not a clause \a the bill which will do any harm to legitimate trade unionists. On the other hand there is a great deal in it which is calculated to increase their industrial power, though perhaps it may to some extent reduce their political power. It can hardly be argued that the Nationalist party has no right to point out to trade unionists that they are in danger of marching along the wrong road, seeing that their so-called leaders are afraid to do it. It is my firm opinion that the time is not distant when trade unionism will look to the Nationalist party and not to the Labour party for support. Some empty-headed honourable members may laugh at that statement, but I make it dn all seriousness. When tbe communists, the foreign agitators, the bolsheviks and the self-seeking politicians have finished white-anting tbe trade union movement, the Nationalist party will be urged to stand by the unions and enable them to discharge their proper obligations to the sections of the community which they represent. I cannot remember a single piece of industrial legislation whicli has been introduced into the various parliaments of Australia in the last decade or so by Liberal or Nationalist governments which has not met with violent opposition from the Labour party. hardly to be expected, therefore, that this bill would be an exception. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) referred this afternoon to the Industrial Disirate3 Act passed by the Wade Government of New South Wales. measure was roundly condemned by Labour when it was before Parliament, but Labour advocates who are to-day ap; pearing in the arbitration courts of the country readily agree that it is one of the best instruments ever forged by a State government for maintaining industrial peace. I believe in the 'days to come similar admissions will be made in respect of this bill. This measure seeks among other things to prevent the overlapping of Commonwealth and State awards. Surely no reasonable objection can be offered to that. It will be wholly to the advantage of the general community to prevent either side from playing off a federal award against a State award or vice versa. for the co-relating of all awards of the courts and foithe taking into consideration of economic realities. One would imaeine from' the remarks that have been made on this aspect of the bill that this was an entirely new departure in industrial legislation, but that is not so. The 44-Hours Week Act, passed in 1925 by the New South Wales Parliament, contains the following provision:The ordinary working hours in any industry may be increased beyond those prescribed in this section it tlie court or board is of opinion that in the public interest such increase should be allowed. The words in "" the public interest"" mean neither more nor less than thateconomic realities should be taken into consideration. The New South Wales Eight Hours Amendment Act of 1922 contains the following provision :The ordinary working hours in any industry and the number of days upon whicli they are to be worked may be increased beyond those limited in this section if the court or a board is of opinion that the public interest requires that such increase should be allowed. Mr Parkhill. That also indicates that economic realities should not be overlooked. These measures were passed by Labour governments. A similar . provision was contained in certain industrial legislation passed by the last Puller Government. It was It has been suggested that if the provision in this measure that . economic reality shall be taken into consideration is agreed to, the minimum wage will be in danger. I totally disagree with that view, and suggest that the honourable That members who have expressed it have not been honest. No honourable member on this side of tbe chamber believes for a moment that anything in this bill will endanger the minimum wage. But there is one aspect of this matter which should be borne in mind. The Labour party years ago advocated what it called "" The New Protection,"" the main object of which was to insure that when manufacturers obtained an increase in the price of their commodities they should grant a similar increase in wages ' to their employees. We hear very little of that-to-day, for the reason that the tariff is being inextricably bound up with our arbitration court system. That was never intended. The position has become so serious that the Tariff Board has The measure also provides felt compelled to draw attention to it. This is an instance in which economic realities should be considered. The provisions relating to voluntary arbitration and conciliation are prominent features of this measure. For many years I have held the opinion that in this country compulsory arbitration has developed to an extent never intended. At first it was intended merely for .the settlement of disputes, but to-day we find -that it has resolved itself into nothing more nor less than a subordinate form of government. We have, on the one side, employers armed to the teeth, and on the other side employees equally armed, and they are fighting one another without the least regard for the industries from which the employers' profits are drawn and out of which the employees' wages have to be paid. I am not one of those who believe in the scrapping of compulsory arbitration. There are many of us on this side of the House who believe that the present system can be amended by the development of provisions relating to conciliation and voluntary arbitration. In that way, we believe, many of the difficulties that are now embarrassing industry because of compulsory arbitration may be minimized. It is only the extremists on both sides-the extremists on the Nationalist side and the communists on the other side-wh o advocate the scrapping of compulsory arbitration. That the Nationalist party stands for compulsory arbitration is evidenced by the introduction of this bill, and it is therefore clearly wrong for honourable members opposite to lay the least charge against the Government that it is endeavouring to subvert or undermine the principles of compulsory arbitration. At the same time. I am firmly of the belief that the voluntary system is the best basis for the solution of the difficulties confronting industry to-day. That it is a system which is acceptable to honourable members opposite was demonstrated a few moments ago, because they were contending that the settlement of industrial disputes should be left to the people who are engaged in the industries and know all about them. In my opinion, that is the position to which we should revert in our industrial legislation. "" There are provisions in the bill relating proper way, so that no man compelled to to voluntary agreements between employers though these agreements may seem advantageous, source of considerable the community as a whole. Agreements have been drawn up by representatives of capital and representatives of labour, without the least regard for the interests of the consuming public. They have arranged for the placing of fictitious prices on commodities and for the payment of wages entirely out of proportion to the value of the work done. Two results have followed. The prices of commodities havo been raised to an extent that has been burdensome to the people who buy them, and no protective duty has been able to afford any benefit to the industry affected, simply because it could not be raised sufficiently high to prevent the importation of articles similar to local manufactures. count we find in some industries a willingness on the part of capital to give up a portion of its profits; but at the same time labour, rightly or wrongly, will not consent to a reduction of its high wages. The provision in the bill for an examination of these voluntary agreements or determinations, in the interests of the consuming public, is a wise one, and one that should have been made in industrial legislation many years ago. Reference has been made during this debate to the responsibility of officials of unions. Pictures have been drawn of insignificant officials in far distant parts of the Commonwealth doing things which the unions cannot control. If that is the way in which unionism is conducted to-day, it is time some alteration was made. That which is made by this bill is not a blow at unionism, as it has been described by honourable members opposite; it may be said to be a blow at the management of unionism. All the penalties for which provision is made may be avoided by having efficient management and control of unions. Isi t not reasonable to expect the efficient management and control of unions? To-day, when every man is compelled to join a union to earn a living, it is only right that the Government should see that the union he joins is carried on, not by a small coterie of officials doing as they like, but in a join it may be prejudiced. Is it reasonand employees. But alable for an official of a union to prevent tbe sailing of a huge mail-boat and inflict tbey may be a a terrific amount of inconvenience on danger to thousands of people on the boat and on shore, and for the union later to repudiate what he has done, and say, "" We do not know anything about it ?"" It is all very well for the unions to get what they want done, and then repudiate the man who has done it. I agree with the provision of the bill that compels the union to accept the responsibility for what its responsible official does. The bill bas met with very little real objection on the part of the Labour party. Honourable members opposite have taken no exception to any of the principles involved. Their opposition has been directed towards details. If they will meet the Government in a reasonable On that acspirit, with a view to making the measure a suitable instrument for the control of industry, I am sure the Government will be prepared to meet them half way, Take, for instance, the proposal for secret ballots. Tbe Labour party has, and can have, no objection to secret ballots. The secrecy of the ballot is a matter for which happened since to remove that impresit fought for many years, and is a principle that should be sacredly safeguarded. Provision for holding secretballots has been incorporated in the constitutions of all democratic countries. Quite recently, at meetings of the Bread Carters' Union of New South Wales, blows were struck and recriminations were freely exchanged, the meeting resembling a brawl. the union were not fighting for any principle; they were merely having a dispute among themselves as to who should be the paid secretary or paid advocate and similar matters. Eventually, Dr. Evatt and a strong bar were briefed, and the court was asked to order a secret ballot to be taken. Had there been provision in the New South Wales arbitration legislation for the holding of a secret ballot, the members of the Bread Carters' Union could have taken their ballot without going to all the trouble and expense of asking the court to order one. Many unions in Great Britain have rules providing for the taking of secret ballots. again I defy honourable members opposite For instance, the Miners' Union has a rule providing for the holding of a secret ballot before a strike can be declared. Its party, has ever attacked the workers of rules provide that a strike cannot be declared unless it is agreed to by a two-thirds majority. The provisions in the bill before us relating to secret bailors are, therefore, no new feature. If our friends opposite have any information to give as to the way in which ballots could be properly taken, I have not the least doubt the Government will readily listen to their views, and, if they are of any value, incorporate their suggestions in the bill. During the course of his remarks, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) referred to what he described as ""the hostility of the present Government to the workers."" members who say ""Hear, hear,"" to cite any instance in which the Government has displayed antagonism to the workers of this country. The fact that thousands and thousands of workers voted for the Bruce-Page Government at. the last election is unassailable evidence that they did not regard the Government as antagonistic to their interests; and nothing has sion. A great deal has been said about the attempt to deport Messrs. Walsh and Johannsen. It has been said that the Government was tyrannous in its attitude towards .those men, but I claim that it took up a very reasonable attitude. When the court was against deportation those two men Avere not deported, and later on, when the law would have permitted their The members of deportation, the Government took no steps to deport them.' Had it done so there would bave been a cry to heaven about its tyranny. It is my opinion that a good many honourable members opposite would have been only too glad to see Messrs. Walsh and Johannsen deported, and that all their talk is merely to hide their disappointment that these two men have been left in Australia as a disturbing factor in politics. We know that they are causing considerable unrest and uneasiness in the ranks of labour. Reference bas also been made to the Prime Minister's speech about the proposed industrial peace conference, but to cite a single instance in which the Prime Minister, the leader of the National this country. On the contrary, it can be shown that he has said harder things about the capitalists and employerswhether rightly or wrongly is another matter-tha n he has ever said about the workers. The rank and file of labour in Australia realize this, and for that reason they are prepared to support him. They regard him as being absolutely disinterested, and only desirous of doing what he thinks is best in the interests of all sections of the community, and not of one section only. If Labour ever occupies the Treasury bench, it must be absolutely disinterested, and must act on behalf of all sections of the community. To-day the Leader of the Opposition says that he I defy honourable "" stands for the men,"" but if he becomes Prime Minister he will change his views, and stand for all sections of the community. At least he will declare that he is doing so. I suggest that he might make an early effort in that direction, and consider the bill from the point of view",47,Setup
15,Mr Parkhill,"of the whole, community, and not in the interests of one section only. The honourable member for Darling( Mr understood him to refer to the penalties Blakeley) said a good deal about the penalties to be imposed under this legislation. I pointed out previously that those penalties can be avoided by efficient management of the unions. I have before me an article written by the honourable member and published in the Worker under the heading, "" Sinister attack on Trade Unionism."" It looks very wise, and no doubt the honourable member's supporters regarded it as a highly intelligent contribution. On analysing it, however, I find that it consists mostly of extracts from the bill, supplemented with a few misconstructions. great wisdom in confining his article to quotations from the bill. not necessary for him to display much knowledge, but when he departed from the extracts he revealed the weakness of his case. The honourable member sought, this afternoon, to show that the bill imposes a number of new penalties, and the Attorney-General, who attempted to correct him, was howled down by honourable members opposite. The first penal provision quoted by the honourable member was thisNo person shall hinder or obstruct the president or any person authorized as aforeusual stuff which he feeds to his elecsaid in the exercise of any power conferred by the last preceding section.

The last one he mentioned was that providing for a penalty of Â£100 for wilfully insulting or disturbing the court, or interrupting the proceedings of the court, or using insulting language to the court. That also is contained in the 1904 act. I acquit tbe honourable member of a deliberate attempt to mislead the House. ber for Barton( Mr Ley) said that this bill made certain remissions.

But having heard the Attorney-General's explanation and the very unconvincing replies of honourable members opposite, I am convinced that the bill will be hailed by all reasonable trade unionists, the great middle-class, and those with least personal interest in .this type of legislation, as the finest instrument for industrial peace that has ever been introduced in any parliament. Kr. LAZZARINI (Werriwa) [8.34] At one stage of his speech the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) must have thought that he was on a platform in bis constituency. He spoke of bolshevists, self-seeking politicians, revolutionaries and communists-al l the tors. The fact that they returned the honourable member upon such political claptrap says little for their intelligence. I am often tempted to wonder if the honourable member is not one of the self-seeking politicians. ' Does he not"" aspire to a seat in the Cabinet? . The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) spoke at great length of the old Labour party that did wonderful things of which he approved. The Labour party of today, he said, is not as of old; we are all revolutionaries. That sort of stuff has been told to the Australian people for many years. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was at one time the Leader of that old party. Mr W. A.

I haveMartin, was also a member of tbe old Labour party, and in a debate with tbe late Sir George Reid proclaimed himself a believer in more advanced socialism than the party advocated. He was obliged, he said, to tone down his idealsÂ«to conform with the platform of the Labour party. Upon these and other men, who were at one time accused of desiring to abolish the marriage tie, introduce free love, and let loose the socialistic tiger, the Nationalists depend for leadership. The wild men of a generation ago are today amongst the most'trusted leaders and champions of Nationalism. The man who no doubt will be elected to represent Martin is identical with him whom the conservatives in New South Wales tried to railroad into gaol and whose photograph, even after he had won his case, was kept in the rogues'"" gallery for years until a Labour Government came into office and removed it. Yet, when he enters this House honourable members opposite will listen to him with bated breath. So much for the labour men of the good old days. The Labour party of to-day is the saint as it was when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and Mr Holman were members of it. Its ideals and aspirations are unchanged, and it intends, as opportunity offers, to give effect by safe constitutional means to every plank of its platform. The honourable member for Warringah complained that no honourable member ou this side of the House has offered any constructive suggestions for the amendment of the bill. It is not our intention to do so. Our attitude to tbe bill is one of unqualified and unremitting hostility at every stage. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Blakeley) stated that on the whole trade unionism was well managed, guffaws came from honourable members opposite. A man would be foolish to deny that huge aggregations of assorted human beings will make mistakes and reveal failings. Until human nature becomes perfect, no organization of men will be infallible. But that is no excuse for introducing a drastic measure of this kind to crib, crab, and confine the industrial unions. How does the management of private enterprise compare with that of the trade unions? What of the bankruptcies and frauds, watered stocks Mr Lazzcrini. and fictitious balance-sheets, faked balance-sheets and bogus prospectuses? Conditions more rotten, corrupt, and chaotic than would be thought possible at this state of our civilization are the characteristics of capitalistic management; these are the hallmarks of individualism im excelsis. Over such practices this Parliament has no control. But honourable members opposite who will fight to the death to maintain private enterprise and all its evils have the effrontery to talk of the failure of trade unionism, and to allege corruption amongst unionists as a justification of this measure. Any workers' organizations in the world will compare more than favourably with any capitalistic organization engaged in private enterprise. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) lauded the industrial unionism of America and said that more of that sort of thing was wanted in Australia. Yet he described as bolshevists and revolutionaries the men who are endeavouring to establish industrial unionism in Australia. There is a direct cleavage between two distinct schools of industrial thought-that which still believes in sectional or craft unionism, and that which seeks to organize the workers on the basis of one union for each industry. The agitation for industrial unionism as distinct from craft unionism is used on every platform to flog the workers and prove that they are revolutionists seeking to attain forcibly the control of industry. I welcome the honorhill) into the ranks of the revolutionaries. Anybody acquainted with American industrialism knows that a few skilled men who are able to hold up an industry are able to obtain from the employers high wages to the detriment of the masses of unskilled men who are not able to exert the same pressure. The masters do not mind, paying high wages to a few men, so long as they can get the last ounce of effort out of the unskilled workers for the minimum consideration. Because the Labour party long ago realized that that kind of unionism enabled one worker to be played off against the other, so that the unskilled masses paid hy their economic degradation for the high wages of the skilled few, it sought to bring",52,Opposition Members Hear Hear
22,Able Member For Warringah ( Mr Park,"about a re-organization of the workers, and by political action to have industrial problems solved in a constitutional way. The honourable member for Warringah declared also that trade union organizations should not be obliged to vote funds for the support of the Labour party's platform, and suggested that the present was a terrible state of affairs. Cannot the same be said of chambers of manufacturers, chambers of commerce, and employers' federations, as well as of shareholders in big limited liability companies? Can the honourable member for Warringah guarantee that all members of such organizations and companies are supporters of Nationalist political aspirations? How can he or any one else know the political views of shareholders of companies or members of employers' organizations? If Labour were in power and if a Labour Ministry brought down legislation to prevent employers' organizations from subscribing to the funds of the Nationalist party he would be the first to rise in his place in this House and squeal in protest against it. The honourable member referred also to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that we, on this side of the House, stand for the workers, and he endeavoured to make it appear that the honourable member for Yarra had declared that the Labour party was indifferent as to the interests of other sections of the community. What the honourable member for Yarra said was that in the ultimate analysis the Labour party stands for the workers who, we claim, represent the great mass of the people in this country, but that it also believes in a fair deal to all sections of the people. In his references to the position in the showed immense losses in the coal-mining coal mining industry the honourable member for Yarra stated that, in the main, the coal pits in New South Wales were working on only three days a week. Honourable members supporting the Ministry at once challenged his statement. Actually he erred on the conservative side. I say without fear of successful contradiction that not one coal pit in New South Wales has worked three days a fortnight over any length of time. trade ? ing the war. ago. member for New-castle has stated, the Commonwealth coal export trade was destroyed during the war, and the coal owners have not recaptured it. When speaking on this subject some time ago I quoted figures, obtained from an authoritative source, showing that under the sliding scale for wages laid down by the coal tribunal during the war the higher prices charged by mine owners returned to them Â£11,000,000 in excess of the increased wages paid to the men who cut the coal. This is my answer to the honourable member for Swan, who suggested just now that the miners were chiefly responsible for the loss of our coal export trade. Australia's position in this matter is due to the avarieiousness of the mine-owners who, like Oliver Twist, are continually asking for more. All those who have any knowledge of the industrial position in our coal mining districts know that almost without exception the mines are worked intermittently. In some mines in my electoral division the whistle has not blown for a fortnight. The honourable member for Warringah stressed the importance of keeping the wheels of industry moving. If he is sincere in his attitude will he support a proposal to force mine owners to keep tbe mines open and allow men to cut the coal, irrespective of whether it is being sold or not? If he will not, then it is useless for him to endeavour to put all the responsibility for industrial depression in the coal-mining industry upon the shoulders of the miners. Although the honourable member for Yarra quoted official statistics which industry due to stoppage of work, it should be borne in mind that, as the mines, in the ordinary course of operations, are worked not more than three days a fortnight, the official figures were to some extent misleading, because of the suggestion that, but for the stoppages the mines would have been working full time. The position is entirely different. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley) had something to say concerning the rise of trade unionism. The Attorney General also dealt with this subject.

The movement is not, as the honourable member for Barton suggested, in the kindergarten stage of economics. It knows all about the doctrine of economic pressure. member further assured us that he was entirely opposed to extremists in the ranks of the Nationalist organizations, as well as in the ranks of Labour. He declared, of course, that Messrs. Walsh and Johnson should have been deported years ago for their participation in certain industrial movements. W ill he now advocate the deportation of extremists in the Nationalist party, and in the employers' organizations? W ill he advocate the deportation of John Brown, the coal baron of New South Wales-the racehorse proprietor, the man who spends so much money on racehorses and gives more thought to them and to his prize roosters than to the conditions of the men who delve in his coal mines; the man, in fact, who declared that if the coal-mining industry is to prosmember for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), per the owners must get back to the wages of 1914? that he does. I was merely invitin g an expression of opinion from the honourable member for Barton, who declared that, if he had his way, he would get r i d of all extremists irrespective of their political views. I am sorry that he is not now in the chamber, as I should like to hear what he has to say concerning this suggestion. There are many others of John Brown's way of thinking. They, also, would like industry to get back to the wages of 1914. Possibly they pray in secret that it may, but they have not the courage to declare themselves openly. The honourable member for Barton stated further that he had no time for those who did not support the principle of compulsory arbitration. On that point I should like to quote briefly from a little pamphlet sent, T presume, to all honourable members opposite through the post by the Metal Trade Employers' Federation. This is what Mr John Heine, the president of that body, said at the annual meeting in New South Wales a short time agoThe result is that there is a great deal of unemployment in the metal trades-unemployment for which the manufacturers refuse to take any particle of blame. The employers have told both the arbitration judges and the unions that there can be no expansion Tbe honourable in the metal trades industry, while it is shackled to old-fashioned ideas and the fetish that all machinery and metal parts must be "" made"" by a skilled mechanic in opposition to the "" manufacturing "" methods adopted by Australia's competitors beyond the seas. This mean3, of course, that skilled meu employed in the Australian metal trades should be satisfied with the pay of unskilled labour. There is a definite move on the part of this powerful employers' organization to get back to low-wage conditions. W it h regard to their attitude towards arbitration, I should like, also, to quote from an interesting little booklet entitled Nationalist Notesf o r Speakers, edited by Mr Archdale Parkhill, now the honourable member for Warringah. Wheni t was published the Nationalist and Country parties were in bitter opposition to each other, and the honorable then leader of the Country party, but now the Treasurer in this Government, had declared war on the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was then ber forBarton wishes to get r i d of all those who are opposed to arbitration, he should, in view of the statement of the honourable member for Warringah, immediately take 3teps to get r i d of every Country party member in this House. This is what the honourable member for Warringah stated, when secretary of the Nationalist movementOn broad principles, the platforms of the National and Country parties agree in many respects. This fact alone would make the action of the Country party in coquetting with Labour inexplicable if it were not for the selfishness of the members whose only ambition is to gain the Treasury benches. One important difference in the platforms of the National and Country parties, however, is that the Country platform proposes to dispense with the force of law behind all industrial settlements. This is a conservative reaction from the acknowledged principles of liberalism for many years. To call such a policy liberalism is a farce. It is not even conservatism masquerading as liberalism.",54,Opposition Members Hear Hear

28,Mr Lazzarini,"I did not suggest Prime Minister. If the honourable memThat, in 1922, was the Nationalist party's considered opinion of the Country party. The two parties have now combined, otherwise the fight between them would be more bitter and the abuse more vitriolic. Barton says that the workers to-day view arbitration as a means for obtaining, not a living wage, but more and more of the profits of industry. I remind him that on nearly every occasion that the employees have placed their claims for increased wages before the Arbitration Court, they have had to give detailed evidence respecting their bare living expenses. In one instance the shop girls and typists had to give sworn evidence before the court respecting the prices that they paid for intimate articles of apparel. I wonder if honourable members supporting the Government would like their wives and sisters to be placed in a similar position. According to the press, these girls, when giving evidence, were the subject of jokes and laughter. I wish to know from the honourable member for. Barton whether he considers that those girls are receiving some of the profits of industry or a wage barely sufficient for their needs. A living wage is usually prescribed by the Arbitration Court except, perhaps, in highly skilled trades, for which a margin for skill is allowed. I wish now to deal briefly with the bill itself. In the first place, it postulates a country seething with industrial unrest. This applied to Australia is untrue. If we were to-day in the throes of a violent industrial upheaval, while I should not support the measure, at least, I might admit that the Government had some justification for introducing it. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 30th December last published an article containing these words"" There were few strikes of importance in New South ""Wales during 1927."" Indeed, there were few in the Commonwealth; but according to honourable members supporting the Government, New South Wales is the storm centre of industrial unrest, and is the gatheringplace for the revolutionaries of the world; that, in fact, some day it will be the startall very well for honourable members being place of a revolution throughout Australia. This bill can be considered only as an instrument forged by the Government to destroy trade unionism as an [184] effective weapon for improving the conditions of its members. It is a hostile move by a hostile Government, with a vicious desire to destroy. The Attorney-General, by his speech, proclaimed himself a man The honourable member for blinded by bias and actuated by malice. "" blinded by malice."" Groom) I ask the honourable member for Werriwa to withdraw those words. With the illogical enthusiasm of a bitter partisan, the Attorney-General sees nothing good in trade unionism, and nothing bad in the employer. He mentioned lock-outs here and there as a matter of form, but during the whole of his speech, which was a denunciation of trade unionism, there was not one word of blame for wrongdoing that could be laid at the door of the employer. Tbe words "" general good will,"" so frequently used by him, were so much humbug. member must not use the word "" humbug."" member read my speech he would have noticed that I said many things about the employers. speech carefully, and what the Attorney General said about employers was well sugar-coated. With reference to the proposed industrial peace conference that has been referred to during this debate, the action of the Prime Minister and of the Attorney-General can be likened to that of a sabre-rattling junker who opens his so-called peace negotiations with a straight out declaration of war. Proposed new section 25 repudiates arbitration by reversing a universally-accepted principle, and makes it an instrument to legalize sweating. This provision makes it impossible for industrial organizations to accept arbitration if it ceases to be a guarantee of a mere living wage. It is hind the Government to say that the bill makes no attack on the basic wage. It means what it says, and the Government intends to carry out its purpose, with the",55,Opposition Members Hear Hear

35,Mr Lazzarini,"I have read theassistance of the judges of the Arbitration Court. The provisions of the bill are watertight, and in many cases the judges will be compelled to give awards below the living wage. Mr Justice Higgins, twenty years ago, laid down the principle that an industry, to justify its existence, must at least be able to pay a progressing living wage. The position that the Labour movement takes up is that industries that cannot pay a living wage are of no use to Australia. member has voted for the'granting of bounties to such industries. matter. I am always prepared to assist an industry by protection or by bounty to enable it to pay a living wage. ber said that such industries should not exist. clear and definite. If the Government refuses to assist an industry and it cannot pay a living wage, it is of no use to Australia. Under the proposed new section 25 (D) such au industry will be able to appear before the Arbitration Court and force the employees to accept a sweated wage. able member consider is a living wage? the Arbitration Court. In any case, the living wage should be fixed in accordance with the cost of necessaries of life, and should provide at least the reasonable oomforts of life. In New South Wales the basic wage is fixed for a man and his wife, and therefore must be subsidized by child endowment. That has been the contention of the masses of our workers ever since the system of arbitration was instituted in this country. As a trade unionist in this House, I should not have subscribed to arbitration had there been no guarantee of at least a living wage. The Government wishes to return to the conditions of industry which existed in the past. Mr John Brown, a prominent member of the Nationalist party, who has used his money in trying to secure the election of Nationalists to Parliament, said recently that we must get back to the conditions and wages of 1914, which, on present-day prices, would mean a return to the conditions of the 80's and 90's. The spirit of those days is still living. The President of the Shopkeepers' Association, when giving evidence before a royal commission in Victoria, on the 17th April, 1901, saidNo nation was ever built up by legislation of this character. Unrestricted sweating has been allowed in England, and we have there a nation built up unparalleled in the history of the world. A great deal of sweating goes on, but though it is unfortunate to the individual, I fancy it is beneficial to the nation. You cannot get the extreme benefit out of a man without breaking some up. You cannot win a battle without killing a lot of men. That was the frame of mind in which the representatives of the employers approached the matter. Tbe Employers' Federation knew the opinions be held, and sent him there to give evidence on their behalf. That was also the attitude of a large section of the employing class in 1901. If unionism is destroyed, the only weapon which the worker now possesses for fighting his battles will have been taken from him. Clause7 can have no other effect than to increase industrial unrest, and I can conceive of no reason for its insertion in the bill other than to create a psychology similar to that which was created prior to the last Federal elections, and resulted in the present Government being returned to office. Under its provisions, if a few men in a small clothing factory in Goulburn were to go out on strike, the employers could ask the Arbitration Court to declare that a strike existed in the industry; and in spite of the endeavour of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) to prove the contrary by interjection while the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) was speaking, the judge would have no option but to make such a declaration. It would be a matter of fact, not of law. The employers could then bring about a lock-out in the whole of the industry. The bill does not provide that before the judge declares the existence of a strike he shall be furnished with proof that the workers concerned in the stoppage are unionists, or are controlled ""by industrial organizations. Everybody knows that certain industries are not organized, and that in many country towns there are thousands",56,Opposition Members Hear Hear

If a few men choose to strike because of a local dispute with their employer, that bas nothing to do with the industry as a whole; yet under the bill it will be suffito broaden that measure. The induscient to lead to a lock-out in the industry and industrial turmoil throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Honourable members who sit opposite would then be able to stampede the electors into the belief that the Labour movement had been responsible, and that it was necessary to return them to the national parliament to preserve law and order. That provision has been inserted purely for political purposes. included in the bill in an endeavour to blackmail trade union leaders to remove from office and from membership of their organizations some of tbeir officials. I use the term "" blackmail"" in a wide sense. What other construction can be placed upon a provision which reduces the penalty against an organization if it agrees to practise victimization? This is characteristic of the legislation which, throughout the ages, has been passed by other countries for the repression and suppression of workers' organizations. Whenever an individual has shown greater courage than his fellows, and has been prepared to advocate their cause, he has been subjected to victimization. The Attorney-General, in his second-reading speech, enlarged upon the provisions which relate to voluntary associations and the adoption of conciliation measures. They are not worth a snap of the fingers. It is childish to endeavour to persuade the people of this country that those provisions will benefit either the employers or the employees. worker now meet his employer at a roundtable conference; can he not make agreements independently of the Arbitration Court; and is there anything to prevent those agreements from continuing, so long as both sides honour them? It appears to me that the Attorney-General haB endeavoured to make it appear that he is giving something away. The honourable gentleman had an opportunity to display magnanimity when the industrial organizations throughout Australia wanted him to amend the Industrial Peace Act. Deputation after deputation, headed by the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr this provision the Arbitration Court can Charlton), and accompanied by the honorkins), and myself approached the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and requested him trialists would have assisted the Government to make it a powerful instrument for the preservation of industrial peace. If the principles which it enunciated had been broadened the confidence of the industrialists would have been secured. The Prime Minister said that the action then proposed was unconstitutional. If it was unconstitutional then it is equally unconstitutional now. When the right Clause8 has been honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), was Prime Minister, he promised quite definitely to have local boards established. That was either in 1920 or 1921. Since that time the miners have continued to agitate, by every means in their power, for the constitution of those boards. On at least two occasions they made that request to the present Prime Minister, but he would not agree to it. Now the Government comes along with a measure which will lash them into fury. It is designed to irritate, and its effect will be similar to that which a red rag has on a bull. There are many provisions which I believe the High Court will declare to be unconstitutional. I do not think the Attorney-General will be prepared to argue that those provisions which deal with the over-Tiding of State arbitration laws are constitutional, and can be enforced. The advantage which the honourable gentleman claimed would accrue under the voluntary arbitration Cannot the provisions has been nullified by a subsequent clause. After the employers and employees have come to an agreement, the court has to say whether it will have any effect on the economic conditions of the industry. If it determines that the industry is likely to be affected detrimentally, it will not allow the agreement to stand. That provision appears to have been devised for no other purpose than to bring the more tolerant and humane employer down to the level of the gentleman referred to by the honourable member for Barton, ( Mr Ley), as the vicious man who wishes to sweat his employees.

Many references have already heen made to the penalties that are fixed, so I shall not labour that matter further. I believe that the principle of appointing inspectors to police the act is a good one; but we cannot expect the employers to he embarrassed by inspectors who are appointed by a department which is controlled by the gentleman who is responsible for the introduction of this measure. is making a mistake. The period of appointment is to be determined by the Minister, as it is rather in the nature of day's work to stand at tbe pit head and an experiment; but the appointments are to be made by the Public Service Board in accordance with theprovisions of the Public Service Act. periment in Commonwealth arbitration legislation, but for as long as I can remember the States have made that provision in connection with their Arbitration Courts and wages boards. Por many years union secretaries had the right to police State awards. A similar course should have been adopted in connection with this legislation. The representatives of the trade unions ought to be afforded facilities to exercise a check over the inspectors, and to see that they are carrying out their duties in a proper manner. about the belief of the Laboiir party in the principle of a secret ballot. I do not intend to argue the relative merits of the secret and the open ballot; but I do say that the unions should have tbe right to determine in what way their domestic affairs shall be conducted. That is the whole point. As a trade unionist, I am not prepared to accord the Government the right to say that a secret ballot must be held. That is a purely domestic matter for a union itself to decide. The unions are voluntary organizations; but I realize that they are made compulsory to some extent owing to the granting of preference to unionists under some awards. It has been pointed out by both speakers who have preceded me on this side of the House that in many cases secret ballots are held. In the important mining industrial area in my electorate, the miners have a small lodge at every mine, and when their central council places certain proposals before them, each lodge votes for or against them. If they are defeated by a majority of the lodges, they are not adopted by the organization; but if , on the other hand they are accepted by a majority of the lodges, they are adopted as part of the policy of the organization. Some of these lodges are separated from one another by many miles, and one has no influence over another. If the Miners' Federation had to take a secret ballot it could only be done at the pit's mouth. Two men would have to be paid the full record the votes of the men. Ballotpapers would have to be printed, and a returning officer would be required. A ballot of that character, in the small section of the south coast mining district that falls within my electorate, would cost, I should say, from Â£40 to Â£60 on a most conservative estimate. If ten members of an organization could secure a secret ballot, as proposed by tbe bill, this could be demanded on almost any matter. Not only would it bring about turmoil in a union, but it would also make the cost of operating the organization prohibitive and it would cease to exist. Why does the Government insist upon this secrecy? Is the Attorney-General afraid that sometimes it would be impossible to find ten members of an organization A great deal has been said willing to apply for a secret ballot ? The bill savours of the dark ages, the In quisition, the Star Chamber. WhyI ask again, should there be all this secrecy ? some of their own comrades. does nothing to save tbe small business man from being browbeaten by his big competitor and being forced to subscribe to "" gentlemen's agreements "" which are of no use to him, and which he does not wish to sign. More men are victimized in one year by the employing section than in ten years by industrial organizations. In substantiation of my statement, let me remind honourable members that, despite the turmoil and bitterness caused by the 1917 strike, we find unionists working to-day side by side with men who on that occasion were classed as "" scabs.""",58,Opposition Members Hear Hear

The honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook), the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) and one or two others on the opposite side talk about victimization by unionists but they have nothing to say concerning victimization by employers. This bill makes no attempt to control the employing section or to require them to take a secret ballot. The heavy penalties provided in this bill are reserved entirely for trade unionists. Then we are told we must take into consideration the economic condition of industries. No inquiry is to be made as to whether an industry is hampered by over-subscribed capital or watered stock, whether it is well managed or mismanaged, or whether it is overloaded with fees to parasitic boards of directors, who do nothing to carry on the industry. Under this bill the employer can go into court and make a statement, and his word will be accepted without question. No provision is made for the books of employers to be inspected. Why should not his balance-sheets and his profit and loss accounts be open to examination? If , by any chance, what is termed a trade secret is devulged by an employer, and a unionist dares to mention it outside, he will be prosecuted, and may be fined Â£500. That is what the Attorney-General calls fair legislation that deals equitably with both parties to industry! Let me add a word regarding strikes and lockouts. I differ from those who say that this measure can even hit at the employer on the ground of his having caused a lockout. The Attorney-General stated in his speech that lockouts could be easily proved. I wish that the Minister would prove one, but he could not do it. If an employer decides to shut down his works he attributes his action to a falling off of business, and no inquiry can elicit any other cause for the workmen's loss of employment. In New South Wales there is a Masters and Servants Act on the statute-book, and it is supposed to operate in the same way towards employers as towards employees. the whistle does not blow on a mine on the South Coast, or when a business in the city is down, it is impossible under that act to"" force the employer to give work to hia men. If he wishes to brow-beat unionists, he closes down, on the ground of lack of business, and it is impossibleto prove that he has been guilty of creating a lockout or of victimization. If an employer desires to get rid of an employee, who would be described by the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Barton( Mr Ley), or the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) as a ""Bed,"" because he was prepared to spend some of his leisure in organizing his fellow workers in the industry, he puts off several men for a few days, including the individual who is in special disfavour, on the ground that trade is slack. Later on he says that trade is brighter and takes back several of the men, but not tbe unionist with "" red "" tendencies. This bill contains no provision to deal with an employer who practices that trick. It is impossible to bring an employer before the court and make him liable to one penalty for creating a lockout, practising victimization, or committing any similar offence. That is one reason why the industrial unions, their leaders, and political Labour generally refuse to countenance penal provisions in legislation of this character.

50,Mr Atkinson,"Every honorabledo bis duty in Parliament. listened to the speeches of honourable members opposite, and it seems to me that they have greatly exaggerated the prob.able effect of the bill. If the unions take .a reasonable course and do their duty to --the community, which, has every right to -expect that of unionists in common with . all other members of society, there will be nothing to fear from this measure. If the Opposition can advance good reasons why some of the clauses should be amended, there are numbers of honourable members on this side of the House who have an open mind on the subject, and -if they can be convinced that such amendments are needed, they will be ready to -help the Opposition to give effect to them. party opposite has made up its mind. opposite have their instructions. I have read the bill carefully, and I consider it a tribute to the capacity and skill of the Attorney-General. The industrial position to-day is a most difficult one to deal with, and, in view of the rejection of the referendum proposals submitted to the country some time ago, the Government's scope under the Constitution is limited. Therefore, I think that the Ministry has met the situation excellently. Both this bill and the Crimes Act, for which the Attorney-General was largely responsible, furnish monumental evidence of the skill and capacity displayed by the honourable gentleman and those associated with him. Irrespective of whether or not honourable members agree with the contents of this bill, if they have regard for the difficult position with which the Attorney-General and those helping him were faced, I think it will be agreed that they bave carried out the intention of the Government of the day in a masterly manner, and that the two bills I have mentioned will stand to their credit for a long time. I do not know why the Opposition complain bitterly about the contents of this measure. They know quite well that it is to give effect to part of the Government's policy as announced at the last election. Surelyi f the Labour party came into power they would be the first to claim the right I have to put their policy into operation, and its supporters would expect that of them. Some honourable members have said that those opposed to our present industrial system are extremists. I am opposed to compulsory arbitration. I claim no one can regard me as an extremist, yet, believe that our present arbitration machinery must eventually break down under its own weight. I cannot see how we can secure industrial peace under the industrial system now in operation. The parties to a dispute are frequently compelled by it to go to the Arbitration Court, and this puts them at arm's length and makes them feel that they are bitter opponents. The employers on the one hand secure all the evidence The available in support of their case, whilst the representative of the employees on tbe other hand puts the position as strongly as he can for those whose interests he is paid to protect. A case beat all; fore the Arbitration Court cannot be regarded in the same light as an ordinary law suit, where the difference is between two individuals and where the verdict given affects only those immediately concerned. An award of the Arbitration Court affects not only the employers and employees in an industry, but very often the whole community. It is the responsibility of the employers to make an industry profitable. It is easy for the court to make an award for the payment of a certain wage, but wages so awarded cannot always be paid by the industry. When an industry languishes in consequence of the compulsory payment of wages which it cannot afford, unemployment necessarily follows. In some instances employees, as the result of the award of the court, receive higher wages for the time being, but when the cost of living is increasing at a greater ratio, their position becomes worse than it was. The increased cost of living is still following wages in a vicious circle, and. its effect is being felt by the whole community. It is not so much a question of a living wage as a real wage. It is the duty of employers to treat their employees well; and it is the responsibility of the employees to do a fair day's work for the remuneration they receive. It is more a . matter of what an employee produces for the wages he receives than of the actual",60,Opposition Members Hear Hear

53,Mr Atkinson,"Notwages paid. If the employees in an industry do not produce sufficient for the money they receive, the industry must cease. In many instances that is not done. Our present arbitration system is also cumbersome and expensive. There is so much delay in reaching the court that by the time an award is given, the union representative, who is paid to protect the interests of employees, and who is anxious to hold his job is very often ready with another list of grievances. I am not condemning all union representatives, because I know many of them do their utmost to prevent strikes. They have, however, to show the employees that they are working in their interest; and in doing so, do not always consider whether the industry is able to pay tbe wages, demanded. secretary is sometimes between the devil and the deep sea because he-knows that if he does not support the claims of the men, whatever they may be, and whatever may be his views concerning them, there are others willing to take his job. Conciliation conferences are often unsatisfactory, because the union representative is afraid of the consequences if he agrees to a reasonable proposal submitted by the employers. When a conference fails, disputes are referred to the court, and when an award is made the men sometimes receive more than was offered for which the union representative receives the credit. Perhapsi f I were a union secretary, I would pursue a similar course; but the attitude of such men is not always fair to the industry or to the community. We have to face tbe position as it is, and see if we can bring about industrial harmony and prosperity in Australia. Under the present system, employers pay for eight hours' work a day and a higher rate for overtime; the employee receives his remuneration irrespective of what he produces. High wages are not necessarily a solution of the high, cost of living problem. In Australia the cost of living must be reduced or we must produce to such an extent that the wages at present ruling can be paid with advantage to industry. I wish to see wages on the highest possible level and a fair return given for the remuneration received. High wages should be an indication of prosperity. It has been said that there is an inherent desire on the part of workmen to-day to do as little as they can for the money they receive, so that the job will last longer. the workers. member may regard it as such, but the' statement is frequently made. If the' workers are of the opinion that it is to their advantage to make a job last as long as they can, all economists aire against them. The only remedy for the present position is greater production and efficiency. Recently an industrial delegation visited the United States of America, and presented a very valuable report, which was signed A union by all the members of tbe delegation. In the report reference is made to tbe good relations which exist between the employers and employees in America, and to the extent to which modern machinery is used in production. The report also states that the best scientists available, bring their knowledge to tbe aid of industry, and that the workers are willing to assist in encouraging labour-saving devices. They realize that the introduction of more efficient machinery may result for the time being in unemployment, but they have sufficient foresight to see that it leads in the end to more extensive production and development, additional employment, and greater prosperity. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) quoted from a statement circulated by certain manufacturers in the metal industry, in which they complained that the unions had objected to an award of the court providing for tbe employment of certain skilled labour. I do not think that the employees need be afraid that modern appliances will cause unemployment. We cannot expect to progress if we do not employ the most efficient means of production. It is only by the adoption of the most modern methods of manufacture that employers will be able to pay real wages. If Australian manufacturers and their employees were as keen on this matter and on working together as are the American manufacturers and their employees, our industrial position would be much more satisfactory than it is to-day.",61,Opposition Members Hear Hear

55,Mr Atkinson,"The honorable member think that the American system should be adopted in Australia? delegation to -which I have referred mentions several systems in operation in the United States of America, and I do not know to which system the honourable member is referring. It is evident, however, from the information contained in this valuable document, that in America the employers and employees confer, and, as a result, solve many of the industrial problems confronting them. not always at loggerheads as they are in Australia, for which our present arbitration system is largely responsible. Australian employers and employees should be brought together. advantage to industry, and would be the first step towards economic success. A f t e r all, we have to face the economic facts. On page 10 of the report of tbe Indust r i a l Delegation to the United States of America there appears the statementAbout 1922, manufacturers and employees realized that both had to live, and tliat each must consider the other's point of view-that the manufacturer'was not going to work without profit and that a workman must get sufficient from his earnings to enable him to live decently. Later, there appears on the same pageI t was early recognized that increased earngranted, tbe employer passes more than ings meant greater purchasing power, and that cheaper production meant a wider range of buyers. Tn America they appear to look at things from a common-sense point of view. It is no use honourable members opposite talking slightingly of the American system. This report is the product of all the delegates who went to the United States of America, not of one or two only, and it is enthusiastic about the system that prevails there. readsProduction has increased in a remarkable manner in the United States, chiefly due to the development of power research and the invention of labour-saving machinery, in combination with a greatly improved management, with which labour has acted as 'a real eo-opcrator. Such co-operation may occur in isolated instances in Australia, but it is not gsueral. The report continuesThe ever-increasing home market, the development of large-scale production, standardizing products, together with efficient transport, have tended to lower costs. We need to increase the purchasing power of wages, and so make them real wages. Those who receive Â£6 a week to-day are The report of the not as well off as they were ten or fifteen years ago, when they were receiving only Â£4 a week.

I have offered suggestions whereby the profiteer That would be of may be laid by the heels, but no one has yet been able to do that. I do not think that profiteering is so rif e as some one would have us believe, although, when I pay my bills, I often think that it exists. A t present its existence is merely hypothetical, and cannot be proved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). If he thinks he can prove its existence he should, in the public in terest, make tbe endeavour. Tbere bas been too much passing on of costs in Australia. ""Wnen a worker makes a demand for additional wages, and his demand is the wage increase on to the cost of his goods. That is where profiteering may occur. If the honourable member for Maribyrnong can devise a way in which to prevent the practice he will have my whole-hearted support. Both the employer and the employee are wrong, when they ignore the third party, the public, who, after all, is the most important party to consider. Just as the On page 21 the report punter keeps the bookmaker going, so the public keeps employer and employee going. An endeavour should be made to effect a greater output, which would reduce costs and increase the purchasing range of wages. I do not wish honourable members to misunderstand my position. I refuse to be termed an extremist merely because I am prepared to abolish the compulsory side of arbitration. I wish to replace it by something better. It would have been much better for Australia had it adopted, 24 years ago, a system similar to that. which now prevails in Canada.",62,Opposition Members Hear Hear

59,Mr Atkinson,"It is all very wellI am confident that this bill w ill tend to promote goodwill between employer and employee. Clause 14, providing that employers and employees may get together and effect a voluntary arrangement, is an excellent scheme, and I congratulate the Government on the innovation. Honourable members opposite who have spoken during this debate have really not expressed the view of the of the workers of Australia. I believe that when the workers learn the real effect of this bill they will recognize that the olive braneh is being held out to them and w ill be very ready to grasp it . If honourable members opposite speak to their constituents as they speak in this House, the electors w ill never learn from them the true position. But there are other means of acquainting the electors with the facts; and judging by the result of the 1925 election, the workers of Australia are prepared to listen to what those opposed to the Labour party in politics have to say. The proposed new section ISBA (1) providesAny employers iu an industry and any employees of those employers may apply in writing to the Registrar for the determination by a judge or a conciliation commissioner by voluntary arbitration of any industrial matter relating to that industry.

Should the employees not agree with the recommendation, they are at liberty to strike; similarly, should the employers be dissatisfied with the recommendation, they may order a lockout. controls the situation. Should a union secretary in Canada cause strikes of which the people generally do not approve, he soon finds himself in trouble. When its provisions are understood by rhe workers of Australia, this legislation will be acclaimed by them. The bill also provides for .conciliation committees. MrE . RTLTSY -That is nothing new. it appears in this bill is new. In the. principal act the court may temporarily refer any matters which are before it to a conciliation committee consisting of an equal number of employers and employees, whose duty it is to endeavour to reconcile the parties. Clause 28 improves the position, and materially alters the procedure. majority Should the parties to a dispute come to an agreement, the agreement can be registered; thereafter it has the effect of an award. Australia's great need is industrial peace. Withouti t disaster is in evitable. Every report issued by banking institutions and large commercial organizations during the past two or three years has contained the warning that Australia is d r if t i ng quickly towards financial disaster. One of the chief causes of that d r if t is our unsatisfactory industrial position. industrially than are many other countries. solve our difficulties. It is not sufficient to say that the number of strikes in Australia is less than in other countries. The fact remains that there are f a r too many strikes in Australia. Before we can attain permanent industrial peace, there must be a change of heart, a greater desire for co-operation. No industry can succeed when employers and employees are seeking to take advantage of each other. U n fortunately, that is the position in many industries in Australia to-day. If much of ' the arbitration machinery were scrapped, the parties would come together more quickly. The scrapping of that machinery would not jeopardize trade unionism, because it is so firmly entrenched in the minds of the people of Australia that no undue advantage could Eventually public opinion be taken of the employees in industry. If Australia is to prosper, employers and employees alike must recognize their obligations to each other and to the public. They must be made to realize that their interests are identical, and that only by working together can they hope to make their industries prosper. I am not a great believer in penalties.

63,Mr Atkinson,"T h a t does not.bring employers and employees closer ^together. Honourable members opposite haye exaggerated the position so far as penalties are concerned. No union which keeps reasonably within the law will be penalized by this legislation. I am not opposed to trade unionism. I know of the struggle through which the workers have passed, and what trade unionism has done for them. uses its strength to exploit other sections of the community it does that for which it condemns others. Democracy is not consistent with the existence of any privileged class in the community. Unionism if true to its principles will not make of itself a privileged class. Trade unions are entitled to justice; but when they abuse their powers they become as tyrannous as any other section of the community. IfI were an employee in industry, I should not lightly relinquish my right to strike. That right is the best weapon the worker has. But it is a dangerous weapon, and should be used only when all other means of obtaining justice have failed. I have no desire to take from the worker his right to strike. might be prepared to accept something It is one of those things which, if used rightly, can be very good, but if used badly, as has been the case in Australia during recent times, it can be a tremendous evil. Strikes have been called for very trivial causes, and stoppages of work have occurred for no proper reason. Personally, I have always advocated the secret ballot. There will be some disappointment among the public when it is learned that we are providing for the. holding of a secret ballot only on the initiative of members of the unions. I think that the impression in tbe minds of -the public was that there should be a secret ballot before a strike was declared. One hears very often that in a given industrial dispute the majority of the members of a union are against a strike, but they cannot make their voices heard because of intimidation. It is only fair that an opportunity should be provided these men to express their -opinions through a secret ballot. In no other way is it possible to obtain the real -opinion of the majority of the members of the union. The ballot should not be -conducted by officials of the union, but should be as secretly and fairly managed Mr Atkinson. as is any ordinary election. However, I do not propose to press this matter, and I shall accept what the Government has given to us as the best that it is possible to do at the present time. I heartily agree with that clause which makes it compulsory for a judge, when a dispute is before him, to take into consideration the But, when trade unionism economic effect of any award which he may make. My friends opposite claim to have all the sympathy and love for the workers, but I dispute this. There are many on this side of the House who have just as much regard for the workers as they have, and who have just as many friends among the workers as they have. It sounds unsympathetic to say that men are not in all cases entitled to a living wage. Of course they are entitled to a wage that will enable them to live decently; but I do not think that it is right that an industry should be wiped out because it is not able to pay a wage of, say, Â£5 a week. It might be possible for the industry to manage if it could pay a smaller wage, and the workers less rather than be out of employment altogether. After all, half a loaf is better than no bread. Perhaps when a judge has to give regard to the economic effects of an award he will not be so ready as in the past to grant everything asked for by the unions. There is more likelihood of his making an award that will create employment rather than unemployment. Under this clause the public interest will receive consideration. In the past awards have been made in which the public has never been considered at all, and this has led to a greatly increased cost of living. I remember the time when it was possible to get a steamer ticket for 30s. that to-day costs Â£2 10s. At that time it wa3 also possible to obtain a return ticket available for six months for Â£2 10s. Now return tickets cannot be obtained at all, and the full fare has to be paid each way. Yet the men are not actually any better off now than they were before. I am not complaining about the workers any more than I am about the ship-owners. The owners have been inclined to say, "" Oh, let them bave what they ask, and we shall pass it on to the public."" In the United States of America there is always plenty of money available for investment in industry, but it is very hard to get money for this purpose in Australia. This is because investors here do not possess confidence in the industrial future of the country. Tbey prefer to invest their money in war bonds rather than put it into the promotion of business enterprises. member does not disapprove of the investment of money in war bonds? complaining about the disinclination of investors to put tbeir money into business concerns. At the present time it is impossible to get a building contractor to give a straight-out estimate for a building. He makes all sorts of allowances for contingencies, such as new labour award, and allows himself a. very safe margin on which to operate. We cannot carry on in Australia unless a better industrial spirit is displayed than that prevailing at the present time. Australia should be a magnet for people in all densely-populated countries. Our wonderful potentialities should be sufficient in themselves to bring migrants here; but, unfortunately, our industrial conditions are such that there is no spontaneous flow of migrants to Australia. As a matter of fact, we are spending millions in trying to encourage people to come here. New settlers in Australia do not have to face the hardships that the pioneers had to face 50 years ago; but, notwithstanding that, we are not getting the right type of migrant. British people seem to show a reluctance to come here, and Australians do not appear to be satisfied with other nationals who are arriving. If we could stabilize our industries we should be able to increase our population much more rapidly than we are doing. I trust that the Opposition will not more than Â£4 perweek ten years persist in its unreasonable opposition to ago. the bill, but will give the industrial moveend to the vicious circle; but if honourable ment a lead in the matter. Unfortunately members opposite would do a little.propapolitical Labour leaders appear to be ganda work for the good of their country afraid to speak their minds on industrial the industrial atmosphere would soon matters in these days.

Our present Prime Minister, has often similarly accused the Labour? leaders of the present day. I admit that-, all the faults are not on one side... Matters could be improved greatly if the employers would take more pains to enlighten their employees upon the financial; side of the businesses in which they are engaged; but they do not do it. It would be easy for me to take a few balance-sheets into a successful factory and inflame the minds of the workers with the idea that they were being sweated;: but it would be wrong for me to do so. Honourable members opposite could do a good deal to encourage the adoption of profit-sharing and co-partnership in Australian industries. If other than Labour members attempted to do it they would be subjected to all kinds of unjust accusations. At various times the Government has sent promising young officers abroad to study industrial methods. When these men have returned and have been asked to indicate how conditions in industry in Australia could be improved, they have frequently suggested that piece-work should be adopted. Several public officers did so when they gave evidence before the Public Accounts Committee during the period I was a member of it. But, whensueh proposals were placed before union secretaries they were roundly and unreasonably condemned. I believe that 75 per cent, of the working men of Australia wish to do the fair thing by their employers. They are not socialists and have no desire to adopt revoluntionary measures. But it is natural that they should be annoyed when, even after their increases in wages, they find themselves worse rather than better off.

Who but the Government and their supporters in this House represent the political views of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufacturers, and the Employers' Federation? It cannot be said that the Labour party has any affection for those associated with the institutions I have named. Those bodies do not come to the members of the Labour party to secure any of the political advantages which no doubt they seek in other political spheres. It is true, therefore, that honordustrial strife instead of eradicating the able members opposite have a special cause to plead, and that is the cause of the Employers' Federation, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Manufactures. That being so it is natural that they should desire to engraft on our arbitration system these coercive and despotic powers. It would appear from what honourable members haye to say regarding the position of organized labour in Australia to-day that it is solely responsible for all industrial unrest, and for all the disruption that has prevailed from time to time in the community. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whilst honourable members opposite have accused members of the Labour party of looking at this legislation only from the point of view of the workers, and of not taking them to task for their part in industrial troubles, nothing has been said by them in criticism of those employers who fail to recognize their obligations towards their employees, and their responsibility to contribute towards the maintenance of industrial law and order. We readily admit that the worker is not free of responsibility for some of the stoppages of work that occur. No doubt, mistakes are made, and bad counsel is acted upon, but one may be sure that in the majority of instances the workers have a real grievance before they take the extreme step of leaving their employment as the only effective means of expressing their resentment or sense of injustice. It is not easy for a workman to take a step that jeopardizes the bread and butter of himself and his dependants. Rarely does he strike without due consideration of the consequences. Usually the strike is resorted to as the only rer maining means of asserting his rights, conserving his manhood and self respect, and preserving reasonable standards of living for himself and his family. Therefore, I hope that honourable members opposite will look a little more deeply than they have done into the causes of industrial trouble, and realize the factors that are responsible for them. Unfortunately, the Government is endeavouring to deal with the effects of inroot causes. The first action to be taken is to make the wages of the worker more effective, and to assure him of a ready means of redressing his wrongs. If , instead of having to wait two years for the hearing of their plaint, unions could haye their claims dealt with by the court promptly, there would be less irritation opposite and more continuity of goodwill between employer and employee. There is, however, a mischievous tendency to coerce the worker, and force upon him conditions which he resents. I warn the Government, in all seriousness, that the imposition of unjust conditions by legal coercion will only breed hatred, and when the opportunity comes, the worker will take the law into his own hands in order to retaliate upon his oppressors. Infuriated by a sense of his wrongs, he will be deaf to all pleas for mercy. We should not legislate in such a way as to breed sentiments of hatred and vindictiveness, which are the seeds of revolution. We should inspire the workers with confidence in the legal tribunals as the speediest and most effective means of redressing their wrongs, and in all the instruments of constitutional government, so that no one who is aggrieved will feel called upon to take the law into his own hands. We wish to avoid those outbreaks of disorder and lawlessness which have become too common in other countries, damaging the national prestige, and causing untold suffering.
