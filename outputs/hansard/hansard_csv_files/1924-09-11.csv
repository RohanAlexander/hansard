If the honourable it was shown by the tellers' lists that the member desires to open up the question, number what constitutes a quorum in committee, can be regarded as of any effect.

The question, what is a quorum in committee, is the important one. It would appear at first sight that, under Standing Order 216, a quorum in committee is 26. That Standing Order readsThe quorum in committee of the whole shall consist of the same number of members exclusive of the chairman, as shall be requisite to form a quorum of the House. The quorum in committee would, therefore, appear to be 25 plus the chairman.

The Braybrook station is under the control of three firms in Melbourne and one in Sydney. We, on this side, object to any private concern having the control of wireless communication, as we believe that, like our telephone system, this service should remain in the hands of the Government. suggesting that the Government should provide musical and other programmes? and others are desirous of having their programmes transmitted throughout the country, there is no reason why the Government should not make the necessary arrangements. ample of the British Government, private enterprise would not be allowed to take hold of this public utility. in Great Britain is in the hands of private concerns, except so far as long-distance wireless to the dominions is concerned. withstanding the ""slight variation by the late Government, successive British Governments have insisted that, so far as Empire wireless was concerned, it should remain in the hands of the state. Even now, the British Government retains the right to compulsorily acquire any private plant. I have been informed on good authority that it is possible for the Braybrook station to transmit messages at the present time. The plant there is about three times as powerful as that at the a'Beckettstreet station; but it is stated that the company is withholding the transmission of concert programmes and other entertainments until such time as it is posof the services of sible for a large number of receiving sets to be imported. I hope that the Prime Minister will see that the Braybrook by the honourable memstation commences transmission at as early a date as possible, so that those people who have obtained receiving sets, and have paid their licence fees, may get some return for the money they have expended. I should like the Minister to say whether Amalgamated Wireless Limited will receive any royalties from the Braybrook station, and,"" if so, whether the Government will participate in them. Apart from its possession of the Marconi patents, Amalgamated Wireless Limited is a big manufacturer of broadcasting and .receiving sets. Some powerful influence seems to have been at work to cause regulations in favour of long wave lengths to be adopted in Australia. This is the only country jm the world to adopt such long wave lengths for general broadcasting. I believe that time will prove that the Government acted unwisely in permitting private companies to control wireless communication in Australia. I have great faith in the future of this means of communication, and believe that, together with the telephone system, it will continue to grow in popularity, and that it will be of great benefit to the people outback.

I suggest that the Government set aside, annually a certain sum of money to provide bursaries and scholarships to enable the children of poor parents to enter upon professional careers. doing something in that direction at present. Some of them have a bursary system, under which the most brilliant ""of our boys and girls whose parents are unable to afford to send them to high schools may be there educated. There are grave defects in that system. It is inadequate, because it is limited to a few. I have been a teacher, and I know something of the circumstances. Boys and girls are selected because of their superior ability and because their parents cannot afford to educate them. They are -granted bursaries, which give them four years' education at a high school. When that is completed, their parents are often compelled, because of their poor circumstances, to send them to work, and the students are, therefore, unable to complete their education at the university. That applies particularly to children of fairly large families, the older members of which are compelled to work to support the younger children. Quite a number of such cases have come under my notice. the Commonwealth set aside a large sum of money each year to supplement the bursaries given by the different states. Tbe students can then be trained in the different sciences connected _with our various industries as well as medicine. The scheme would be similar to that under which the lads are trained at the Jervis Bay College. would enter a bond to serve the Commonwealth for a certain number of years at a stipulated salary. would then have at its disposal the services of a number of professional men skilled in all branches of science. would be of great advantage to this country. Of course, we look forward to the day when we shall have our own university at Canberra; but until that time we can work in conjunction with the states. Research work in the different sciences has been entirely neglected, because the time of our scientists is usually occupied in making a living for themselves. Imagine the number of scientists who could be pngaged under this system Mr F. on research work connected with the problems confronting us in the Northern Territory and New Guinea! These will remain with us for a long time. Under the scheme that I have suggested We know that the states are a great many men would be engaged in the study of such problems at very small cost to the Commonwealth. The scheme would be different from that at Jervis Bay, because lads .are trained at the naval college irrespective of their parents' financial circumstances. Under this scheme bursaries would be available to the children only of parents who could not afford to give them a professional education. My experience amongst schools is that comparatively poor children have as much ability as others who are born in much better circumstances. I ask the Government to give serious consideration to such a scheme as I have outlined. forgets that many university graduates find it difficult to obtain a position. tinually stated that too many students are taking the medical course.

The Government wishes to emphasize the fact that' it has always recognized the importance of this matter, and especially tlie. importance of prophylactics and preventative measures. problems cannot be separated by federal and state boundaries, and that .the whole machinery for dealing with them must be provided for by some properly coordinated scheme which takes consideration the be played by local-governing, state, and federal authorities. Let me consider, for instance, the very.real problems that are arising in connection with the settlement of the M u r r a y Valley, which runs through three states. This area is being densely settled, and the prevention of the pollution of the surface waters is under the,control of three different health authorities, without any attempt being made at co-ordination. Unless a proper policy of public health is adopted, we may see in the M u r r ay River settlements outbreaks of the most virulent epidemics imaginable. A t the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in May, 1953, the Commonwealth Government raised this subject, and suggested that the states should join w it h the Commonwealth in the appointment of a royal commission to thoroughly investigate public health administration w i th a view to determining and co-ordinating the sphere of action of the local-governing authorities, the medical profession, and the state and the federal authorities, and to consider especially how the funds provided throughout Australia could be most economically and efficiently used. U nfortunately, however, the suggestion of He was almost immediately this Government met w it h a cold reception. It was evident from the speeches of the state Ministers that they imagined that some inroad was being attempted on state activities. The matter was discussed at length, and finally the State Premiers agreed to meet the wishes of the. Commonwealth Government to the. extent that, instead of supporting the suggestion for a royal commission, they consented to a conference of the various' public health officers of the states and the Commonwealth. For a considerable period an effort was made to convene such a conference, but in November of that year it was found that the State of Queensland would not permit its medical officer of health to attend, and finally the idea had to be abandoned. The Government has written to the various state authorities suggesting the appointment of a royal commission, and asking them to It is recognized that health nominate representatives, so that an examination of the whole field may be made, especially for the purpose of preventing duplication of effort. Following upon a motion I submitted at the Australian into Medical Congress, in 1920, the Commonpart that should wealth Government adopted a policy for the establishment of laboratories in country centres. This resulted in a further duplication of federal and state activities, and, consequently, the Commonwealth Government has decided to wait unti l the proposed royal commission lays down the lines on which each Government shall proceed. It is proposed that the commission shall inquire into the relationship of health administration to other activities of government, the extent to which medical research is necessary in the interests of public health, the distribution of responsibility as between Commonwealth and the states which would give the most efficient public health system, and the de, sir ability, in the interests of efficiency, of decentralized public health administration. But, especially is the commission to be asked to deal with the matter which was stressed by the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse), and the honourable member for Darling-the treatment and prevention of venereal disease. A t the present time, owing to the",69,Department Oe Health
48,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treainitiative of the Commonwealth Government during the war years, there is a certain amount of co-operation in regard to this disease, but unfortunately only five out of the six states have been willing to .co-operate with the Commonwealth, even to the point of accepting the money it is willing to advance. The royal commission will be asked to investigate the subject of venereal disease, and, as soon as its recommendations are available, the Government will put them into effect as far as possible. If Parliament is not sitting at the time, it will endeavour to make the necessary financial provision to bring about an amelioration of the conditions under which disease is now beiug treated. Calare pointed out, the Government recognizee the enormous toll of health and life that various diseases are taking to the detriment of present and future generations. beginning towards the of research. which Estimates sumcient for the preliminary work.

The amount made available for this year is Â£124,480, or Â£2.494 more than last year's vote. That sum is altogether inadequate. By the appointment of a royal commission to deal with this important question, the Government is shirking its responsibility. will probably be that, after the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, the Government will fai l to take any action to give effect to the commission's recommendations. By insuring the health and vigour of the nation, we shall do a great deal for our defence. To spend money in research work in connection with cancer, venereal disease, and tuberculosis is better than to spend it on research work in the hope of finding a poisonous gas for the destruction of life. is provided in these Estimates for the -treatment of venereal disease. but the amount is totally inadequate. Eveni n time of peace we have an army council; it is still more necessary that we should have a health council. But the Government is more concerned with convening conferences of its naval and m i l i tary chiefs, and with the designing and improving of means to destroy life, than in convening conferences of health experts to devise means to prevent loss of life and to lessen the in fantile mortality in our midst.

A former member of the Corner party,' who is alleged to owe large sums in land tax, has holdings in Bawra which have approximately increased to the extent of the sum he is alleged to owe m land tax.

I am prepared to accept his opinion in face of all others. A great deal of indignation was shown i u this chamber in connection with the subject of the payment. The Prime Minister suggested that because I said that presents were made to certain officers of the Crown by the Central Wool Committee, one of the directors of which was also the "" big wheel "" in Bawra, I did something which was improper. In view of the numberless decisions which have gone against the Government in connection with legal matters, I con-' sider that the Government has been badly informed by its legal advisers. During the discussion the honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley) pertinently interjected that there were rumours that certain gentlemen who were called upon to give advice to the Government on this matter, and said that it would create "" good feeling,"" had received presents from an organization of which Sir John Higgins was a member. Even if servants referred to did was done with the permission of the Government, that does not lessen the offence in the slightest degree. When the PrimeM in -. ister was contending -that no influence had been brought to bear on the head of the legal branch of the Commonwealth, the honourable member for South Sydney interposed that the present might at least paid over. Honourable memhave created a good feeling towards the organization in the mind of the officer concerned. The only person who could enlighten us in this ^matter is the gentleman himself. It is not for me, or for If there was any the Prime Minister, to say that he have was, or was not, influenced. We can only state the facts, and leave the the High Court of Australia, public to judge whether it was right that a paid officer of the Crown should receive payment for services rendered to outsiders, and afterwards interpret a promise made to those people involving Â£375,000. The Public Service regulations provide that a public servant is not allowed to work for outsiders. If this work was done for the Commonwealth, the officer concerned should have My view is that M in been paid by the Government for it , and should not have received an honoT h e honorrariu m from ' the Central Wool Committee. It was entirely wrong for the officer to place himself in that position, especially when he was a highly-paid official who. acted practically in a judicial position. If his services were made available by the Government, he should have been paid by the Government, and not by the Central Wool Committee. The gentleman 1 who received this present from the Central Wool Committee afterwards advised the Government to pay the money over, which was done. This action on the part of the Government shows the a w f u l position into which the administration of the C o â¢ o n w e a l th has fallen since a m Labour Government was last in oflice and anti-Labour influence made itself f e l t in the government of the Commonwealth of Australia. Irregularities have arisen which no business man would tolerate for a moment in connection w it h his affairs. No honourable gentleman on the other side would trust his legal adviser if he knew that that legaladviser had received presents of money from an opposition source.

SinceI certain disasters in the coal-fields, a new and a serious development has taken place. Hadi t not been for a merciful Providence, another mining disaster, involving the lives of 200 or 300 men, might, in all probability, have occurred a few days ago. That is a further argument for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire exhaustively into the whole of the conditions applying to the coal industry, with the object of making it compulsory for mine-owners to provide safety appliances and other essentials, so that the mines shall be worked as scientifically as possible. I wish to quote an article of news from Newcastle which was published in the Sydney newspapers. Industrial trouble was involved, and the proprietors of the mine gave noticeto the men to return to work at a certain time, which they refused to do. article readsI t is a good thing, from one viewpoint, that the Borehole Colliery is idle, owing to the expiry of the proprietor's notice to the men. District Check Inspector, MrJ . leeton, has these matters are important, but the imsubmitted a report to the executive officers of the northern miners, which shows that on a recent inspection he found gas in the mine sufficient, had it been ignited by unlucky chance, to have blown hundreds of workers into eternity. "" We examined No. 10 rise district,"" says the report, "" and found a volume of gas coming from five of third north slope; also No. 5 and third north slope, which fouled all working places in this district. "" We found the deputy, and he was immediately instructed to erect hurdles to dilute the gas in these places. Some time later we inspected this part, and found the hurdles had been erected. "" There is not sufficient supervision by those in charge in this district. There is ample ventilation to convey gas away if properly looked after. "" There is no shot firing on the day shift, otherwise the places would have been stopped."" "" We have previously drawn attention on more than one occasion,"" said Mr Hoare, president of the northern miners, to-day, "" to the fact that the obsolete oil safety lamps in use at this colliery have exploded. "" Fortunately none burst into flames on the day this gas was present, otherwise there would have been no one left to tell the tale. "" I u all probability the mining experts would have attributed the appalling result to a cigarette butt."" (Werriwa) [5.2 The miners have repeatedly called the I wish to refer to the coal indusmine-owners' attention to the fact that obselete gas lamps used in that mine have frequently exploded, and it is very fordealt some weeks ago with tunate indeed that on this day an explosion did not take place. In the Bell Bird disaster, about twenty men were killed, and two bodies were left in the mine for six or eight months, unti l it was safe to break the seal that had been placed on the mine. That explosion occurred on a Saturday when only a' few men were in the mine. Hadi t occurred on an ordinary working day, 300 or 400 men would have been killed. An inquiry was held and the jur y made the following statement:That the evidence did not prove how the disaster occurred, and the jury, therefore, recommends that gentlemen of mining experience be appointed and vested with-the powers of a royal commission to ascertain the real cause thereof. I urge the Prime Minister to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the conditions of the coal industry. Only the The other day a royal commission was appointed to investigate certain charges that were made against a public servant of high standing. A royal commission on health is also"" to be appointed. I admit portance of establishing the good name and integrity of a public servant cannot be compared with that of saving the lives of thousands of miners. Nearly every week mining disasters happen, the news of which shocks the nation. The Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government granted an amount of Â£500 to aid ""the widows and orphans of the men killed in theBell Bird disaster, but it would have been much better to spend Â£2,000 in appointing a royal commission, so lhat proper safety appliances might, as a result of its recommendations, be installed in the mines. If the tremendous sacrifice of miners ceased, because of the work of such a conunission, any expenditure incurred on it would be not a loss, but a great saving to the Commonwealth. The jury that inquired into the Bell Bird disaster strongly recommended that a royal commission should be appointed toi investigate mining conditions. Another article headed, "" A Sensational Report from Check Inspector Barnes,"" was published in a Sydney newspaper This man absolutely refused to enter one",79,Tempora Ry Chairman Mahony W G Gregory H
115,Mr Lazzarin I,"or two mines, because of the danger from gas. 1923, r e a d s Having read the various requests made to the Government since the Bellbird disaster for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the disaster and the future working of the South Maitland coal-field regarding safety and best method of working the seam, and the Government having refused to grant a commission, I would like to make a statement of facts concerning the actual necessity for such commission. Having had eleven years' experience as district check inspector, nine years in the Newcastle district, two years in the Maitland field, and 30 years of practical coal-mining, I am of opinion that the conditions prevailing in the Maitland field and the modern necessity for additional clauses in the Coal Mines Regulation Act warrant the demanding of a royal commission. I venture to state that if it is not granted greater disasters than Bellbird are liable to occur in the near future. Seeing that there are insufficient precautionfrom 12s. to 15s. a ton, which gave them ary measures in operation to give the required protection to human life, though not pessimistic, I am of opinion such conditions exist in the Maitland field that at any time we might hear of one of the greatest disasters that has ever occurred in a coal mine. Those are alarming statements by a man with practical knowledge. It is of vital importance to appoint a commission to consider the best means, to .adopt for the protection of human life, and the improvement of the conditions in the coalfields from the economic and humanitarian stand-points. I hope that the royal commission to be appointed on public health matters will be asked to take exhaustive evidence in regard to the obsolete oil lamps used in the mines to-day. There has been an alarming increase in the South Coast mines of miners' nystagmus, and the hook-worm disease, owing to the absence of proper sanitation. It is often stated that the mining industry could not stand the additional economic burden that would be imposed upon it if more money had to be expended on the provision of safety appliances, rescue stations, and the improvement of the sanitary conditions. Let me point out that although the price charged by the coal vend is 21a. 9d. per ton at the sea-board, there is a state coal mine in New South Wales that is producing coal at 10s. 9d. a ton at the pit's mouth, and also giving its employees a fortnight's holiday with a free railway pass. I believe that that is the only mine in New South Wales that has adopted a sanitary Mr Lansmrini. system. I shall give some figures to show H is r e p o r t , dated 11th December, that the coal industry can afford to provide the improvements desired. Theminers' representatives in the New South Wales Parliament declare that inquirywill show that all coal could be produced at from 4s. to 5s. a ton less than the present price, while providing for propersupervision and safety appliances. Thecoal vend controls about 90 per cent, of the industry, and the commission should inquire why it is that coal costing 21s. 9d. a ton at the ship's side at Newcastle costs 40s. a ton delivered to the manufacturers in Sydney, and 60s. a ton when it reaches the small consumers. In 1916 the coal tribunal increased the miners' wages to the extent of about Â£390,000. The owner* immediately put up tbe price of coal an extra profit of Â£1,400,000, the net profit over the wages increase being Â£1,010,000. In 1917 the coal tribunal further increased the wages of the miners by approximately Is. 9d. a ton, and the coal-owners replied by putting up the price 2s. 9d. a ton, giving them a further profit of Â£500,000. In 1920 the coal tribunal gave the miners a further increase of approximately 17 per cent., which worked out at an increase of about 3s. a ton on the cost of production. To meet this the coal-owners put up the price of coal 4s. a ton, from 17s. 9d. to 21s. 9d. This gave an extra profit over and above additional cost of production occasioned by increases to the miners' wages of Â£1,000,000 in 1916, Â£1,500,000 in 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920, and Â£2,000,000 in 1921 and 1922. Prom 1916 to 1922 the mine-owners grabbed Â£11,000,000, extra profit. These figures only apply to profits made at the port of shipment, and do not cover the intermediate profits made by the distributing agents of the Coal Vend. A glance at the disclosed profits of the coal companies will verify them. The August issue of the Australian Investment Digest shows that the coal companies increased their profits 36.66 per cent. A coastal shipping company, with large interests in coai, furnishes a good example. Its original authorized capital was Â£780,000. In 1920 it re-valued its assets, including Â£561,000 in disclosed reserves, and it reconstructed as a Â£3,000,000 company, preseating its shareholders with three shares for every cne held, without taking in one penny of new capital. In the three-year period succeeding the watering, this company paid equal to a return of 150 per cent, on its initial share capital. Another company controls an output of about 3,000,000 tons of coal per annum. Its profits for the five years from 1918 to 1922 totalled Â£1,718,009, or Â£200,000 more than its issued capital. Another company which, fourteen years ago, was registered with a nominal capital of Â£11,000, was reconstructed for the second time in 1920, when its books disclosed a surplus of Â£150,000. In 1920 it made its shareholders a present of six additional shares for every one held, and on this inflated capital it paid a dividend of 15 per cent., or 105 per cent, on its original capital. In the same year another company, when reconstructed, gave its shareholders four shares for every one held, and it paid a dividend of 8 per cent., or 42 per cent, on its original capital. In 1920 another company reconstructed with an authorized capital of Â£1,000,000. Its original, capital, in 1908, was Â£200,000. I am taking this action because I claim that these huge profits are made at the risk of the lives of the thousands-of men engaged in the industry. In the south coast district of New South Wales, there are thousands of men who, because of miners' nystagmus, are unable to do hard work, and are getting a mere pittance to support their affliction. A few weeks ago, two lives were lost in a coal mine in Yictoria, and honourable members will recollect the awful disaster which occurred in Queensland some years ago. These dangers are not confined to any one state, but exist in all the coal mines of the Commonwealth. Any tribunal to deal with this matter should be appointed by this national parliament. These men are asking only for justice. They do not seek favours. They are prepared to accept the verdict of any tribunal which may be appointed, because they know that their claims are just. No nation can afford to neglect this industry, as it is the foundation of many other industries. It is not right to ask men to work in mines under the existing conditions. BecauseI believe that this is a matter on which a vote should be taken, I intend to test the feeling of the committee. We have been told repeatedly that any attempt to alter the Estimates in any way is equivalent to a vote of no-confidence in the Government. I have no desire to move a vote of no-confidence, but consider that this is a matter which should be decided on its merits, and without any political bias. I believe that if honourable members would look at this question fairly and honestly, the sound judgment of this Committee would grant a royal commission to inquire into jit. With the view to rendering the operations of the Industrial Peace Act more effective, I move That in division 134 the item Â£3,000 (Attorney-General's Department) be reduced by I submit this amendment as an instruction to the Government to appoint a royal commission to exhaustively inquire into the coal industry, having particular reference to conditions of labour, the safe and efficient working of the mines, and a comparison of the cost of production with the retail price of coal. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [5.35 a.m.] I think that all honourable members appreciate the motive that has prompted the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) to take this action, but I suggest that it will not accomplish what he desires. As the honourable member knows, matters respecting safety in mines, and legislation in relation to mining generally, are under the control of the State Parliaments. , If the Commonwealth Government were to say that it proposed to appoint a royal commission to inquire into a matter which is really one for the states, we should immediately antagonize the states who, with a considerable measure of justice, would claim that we were usurping their powers and interfering in matters over which they had complete control. Tribunal overrides the states now. only one phase of the question. The Commonwealth has its arbitration courts, and enjoys the right to determine some of the conditions under which men shall work; but the Commonwealth has not the right to legislate for safety in mines, or to deal with the questions involved in tbe major",80,Tempora Ry Chairman Mahony W G Gregory H

A royal commission is about to be appointed to bring about co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the states in regard to health matters, and to prevent duplication and overlapping. That commission w ill have to consider the vita l question of the health of the people, of Australia as a whole. I can imagine no subject in connection w i th that inquiry which w ill be of greater importance than that of industrial health. When the reference to that commission is framed, it w i ll undoubtedly embody the consideration of questions affecting industrial health. A royal, commission on insurance has already taken a great deal of evidence in regard to the subject. Obviously, any scheme of national insurance would be dependent on the statistics obtainable in relation to industrial health generally. When the report of that commission is presented, we shall probably find that it w ill contain a great deal of information in connection with this question. I trust that the honourable member w ill not press for a vote to be taken.

If the Prime Minister would give more consideration to members, he would not have them discussing such subjects as this at this hour of the morning. He looks displeased, but I am not here to please him , but to state my views, and I put the case for the cotton growers. The amount provided for research should be increased to about Â£20,000. As the cotton industry is still in its infancy, a lot of research work w ill for the Government. I admit thab the have to be done to discover means for combating pests. This is not only a Queensland, but an Australian question, and I want the Commonwealth Government to be generous in its grants for the fostering of the industry. There are certain parts of Australia other than Queensland, notably the Northern Terri tory, that are suitable for growing cotton, which, as it is a dry weather crop, may be grown there in other parts assistance that the Government can give in co-operation with the states to carry out research work should be given willingly. The Government should be prepared not only to assist in the growing of cotton, but also to encouragement of the establishment of cotton-spinning and weaving mills. It could assist the secondary part of the industry by providing adequate tariff protection. ber read the report of the conference of representatives of the Commonwealth and the states held about a week ago ? it will do much for the cotton industry, because it will result in the cotton-growers getting control of the industry and purchasing the plant now owned by the Australian Cotton Growing Association.. deal merely with the question of ginning plants, but it laid down a basis for doing all the things that the honourable member suggests should be done. the Commonwealth Government doing its part. I want the Government to treat the industry generously, particularly in the matter of providing substantial grants for experimental plots and other research work. The possibilities of cotton growing in Australia, particularly in Queensland, are very great. The people engaged in the industiy in that state are proudly endeavouring to do their part to make the Empire independent of outside supplies of cotton. The factors operating against supplies being obtained from outside the Empire are such to-day as to give Queensland a unique opportunity to establish a new and important Australian industry. The Queensland Government has not been slow to realize this, and i h 1919 it decided to guarantee a price of 5^d. per lb. for raw cotton. That involved a risk Commonwealth guaranteed to pay half of any loss that might be incurred in guaranteeing a price of 5d. per lb. in 1923-24 and 1924-25, and of 4Â£d. per lb. in 1925-26. The Commonwealth has refused to pay the loss of Â£22,000 incurred in the 1922-23 season. In Queensland alone there ie an area of approximately 50,000,000 acres suitable for cotton-growing, and the climate even ""better than has beendemonstrated to be eminently of Australia. An y suitable. Manufacturers in Great Britain pay approximately Â£200,000,000 annually to other countries for raw cotton. Of that sum approximately Â£150,000,000 goes to America, Â£30,000,000 to Japan, and the balance to India and other countries. There is every prospect of Australia being able to obtain a large share of that Â£200,000,000. It is worthy of note that while the output of raw cotton in the world, particularly in America, is decreasing, the demand for cotton is increasing. The Mexican bell weevil destroyed 35 per cent, of the American crop last year, and the area now affected is 85 per cent, of the total cotton-growing land. As a result, America requires all her raw cotton to keep her own spindles working. We in Australia should be thankful that we are not afflicted with the pests that have ravaged the cotton-fields of America. This is an island continent, and if the not Commonwealth and states co-operate in assisting the industry in its in it i a l stages, I believe it w ill become the second greatest industry in Australia. Queensland is growing 90 per cent, of Australia's cotton crop, and I believe it w ill continue to grow that high percentage. In 1919, when the Queensland Government first guaranteed a price, the total value of the crop was only Â£ 8 5 3 . Last year, in spite of the very severe drought, the value of the crop was Â£256,579, and next year, if the growers are fortunate, its",83,Pairs

Although the Australian Cotton-growing Association did, in the initial stages of the industry, give it a great impetus by putting money into it, I am afraid that if the association is allowed to retain control after the expiragenerally, but I protest against being retion of the present agreement, it will become in the cotton industry what the Colonial Sugar Refining monopoly was in the sugar industry. That is why I am pleased to note that as a result of the recent cotton conference in Melbourne, which was attended by representatives of the Pederal Government, the State Governments, and the cotton-growers of Queensland, a tentative policy was formulated to give the growers representation on the board of directors of the Cotton-growing Association, with a view to their purchasing the whole of the plant now owned by the association.

This method of conducting business is unfair to honourable members, and makes it quite impossible for us to deal adequately with the matters brought before us for debate. Ministerial, supporters must be taking their responsibilities very lightly when they are prepared to allow this division to pass without a word of criticism, helpf u l or otherwise, of the Repatriation Department, which deals with pensions and other matters affecting the welfare of soldiers, for whom they lately evinced such warm regard.

A royal commission, composed of medical men, and representative of all In districts where we have the states, is at present sitting to assess war-service disability. I hold firmly the view that its powers are too narrow to satisfy reasonable requirements. Protests have been made-and they voice the view which honourable members on this side hold-that if the commission is to serve a useful purpose, it must investigate the whole field of repatriation administration. The point of immediate concern to me, however, is that I was informed that yesterday the*-r,epresentatives of the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League presented themselves before the commission to give evidence in regard to particular cases in their own state and were refused a hearing on the ground that to hear them would be unfair to the-soldiers of other states.

I ask the Treasurer to inquire into this matter, because yesterday's refusal to hear the Victorian delegates caused considerable annoyance, and even indignation, amongst the soldiers. I leave the royal commission and turn to the permanent commission that administers repatriation. It does not matter what evidence is brought before the administration if the members of it wilfully falsify that evidence and persist in supplying incorrect information to members of this Hotisei as to particular cases which have been dealt with. ber say that the commission is doing that ? trovertible evidence in respect of the case of the commission or its omcers had deliberately misled members of the House, the former Prime Minister( Mr W. M . Hughes), the late Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), and myself. I stated to the Minister, when discussing this matter previously, that I was not making any charge against the Government, but was definitely making a charge against the members and officers of the commission in terms which I had carefully prepared. Unfortunately, the Government has assumed responsibility for what happened in that case, and, through the Treasurer, has expressed its entire satisfaction with the defence local and intimate knowoffered, by the chairman of the commission, and also with the separate replies by Mr Teece, one of the commissioners, and Mr Ryan, a deputy commissioner. Those gentlemen replied to my strictures, and, if it were not so tragic, it would be amusing to read their defence. They make no answer to the charges worthy of any serious consideration. So far as Mr Teece is concerned, the reply accentuates the unctuous' hypocrisy of that gentleman.

This unfortunate man-William Holland happens, the body to -enliste d when he was over age, having represented his age as being less than it was for the purpose of rendering service. He was embarked on board the Ballarat, which was subsequently torpedoed. He was cast into the sea, suffered in his health, and eventually contracted tuberculosis. He is now in an advanced stage of that disease, and is clamouring fruitlessly for admission to a hospitalunder the control of the Repatriation Department. When ho offered himself for enlistment he was a strong man, engaged in hard manual laboura man with no record of tuberculosis in his family as far as has been ascertained. This man of unimpeachable character has been represented by the members of the commission as unreliable in his statements, and doubts have been cast-withou t any evidence whatever-o n his story of whati happened to him. He is to-day an outstanding example of harsh a man named Holland that treatment at the hands of the commission. I previously charged the members or omcers of the commission with lying, and I then proved that they had lied about this case.

The members of the Repatriation Commission in the case quoted have acted with a lack of candour, and have displayed scandalous dishonesty. will have no effect so long as the permanent commission acts in a dishonest manner. The chairman of the commission, giving evidence before that royal commission, and if they are correctly reported in the Age of 10th September, the following is an example of their evidence:What are the functions of the commission?As far as pensions are concerned, to lay down the principle under which the act shall be administered ; to receive and decide appeals from the state boards, and to deal with certain classes of claim which it is desirable one body shall adjudicate upon for the sake of uniformity. In the great majority of cases the decisions of the state boards are adhered to, but not always. The advice of the medical boards is of great assistance. assessing pensions, first of all the eligibility of the claimant had to be established, and then the connection between the disability he was suffering from and his war service. thoroughly investigated by medical men. His own statement, his army medical history, and, of course, his present condition, also anything which happened between his discharge from the army and the medical examining date are fully examined. I call attention to the closing words: "" His army medical history, and, of course, his present condition, also anything which I tell Mr Semmens that he may live long happened between his discharge from enough to find some day that the activithe army and the medical examinties of members of Parliament have ing date are fully examiued."" case of Holland none of those conditions ashamed to lend any support to a governwere complied with. A thing that stood ment that countenances for a single out conspicuously in their reply was that moment the conduct of Messrs. Semmens they were influenced almost entirely, by and Teece. I shall not include the other Mr Brennan. a casual report of a medical man who, I think, in 1917, declared that Holland was medically unfit. They abI solutely rejected the individual medical opinions and the reports of the boards of inquiry, which in various capacities under the Defence administration dealt with this case. With unblushing effrontery they continued to represent that there was no evidence that Holland's disability either in origin or by aggravation was attributable to his war service. In the face of that contention, I put on record evidence from not only reputable but even eminent medical men and boards, who declared that Holland's war service was either the aggravating cause or the originating cause of his disability. This mass of evidence was entirely disregarded on an absurd technical ground by the members of the commission, and they relied upon the evidence of the medical man Tho new royal commission who had examined Holland years before, disregarding the fact altogether that his tubercular condition had not then developed. This is a very grave scandal. It is an amazing thing that a member of this House is able to stand in his place and take the ful l responsibility for the statement that the members of the Repatriation Commission had lied, either actually or by implication, about this case, and had deceived members of Parliament, including the former Prime Minister, the late Leader of the Opposition, and myself. It is lamentable that the Treasurer should step . behind them, evidently believing it to be his duty to defend them merely because they are in their present position.

The persons interested said nothing u n t i l I dragged out from them their excuses. They never asked for them to be printed or published. They sat down, and will continue to sit down, under this charge that I make against them. Apparently they dare not have it investigated. They know that they are convicted in advance by the evidence. There has been no uprising On the ministerial side as there was in the Case of the Commissioner of Taxation, when Mr Scullin was told that he had gone too f a r in making charges-which , by the way, he had against a responsible officer of the department, and a Royal Commission was appointed. Of course, Mr Scullin was quite correct. There is to be no inquiry into the charges that I have definitely made. The Government is behind the Repatriation Commission, and has expressed itself as satisfied. It has taken the responsibility upon its shoulders, and must carry it . I stand by what I bered that a man making an application for benefits under the Repatriation Act is, according to the law, liable to a heavy penalty if he makes a false statement. Yet these highly-paid members of the commission make false statements about this man's application without the slightest fear of being called to I obtained from the Treasurer the statement that on the whole he was satisfied with the reply given. That is the only answer about the inquiry that has been made. Mr Ratcliffe, the secretary of the Fairfield branch, who worked up the case for the returned men, was informed by the royal commission now sitting that he could not be heard, and that the case would have to be presented through the secretary of the Federal body. The Government has taken the responsibility for what has been done, and, flattered by that useful knowledge, the chairman of the commission insolently boasts, if the report in the Melbourne Age be true, that representations of members of Parliament have had no effect. I presume the inference to be that members of this House have been ignored. These gentlemen apparently can rest quite secure for a while in their positions, but after all, the records remain. I m ay be able at some future time to drag them before some independent tribunal and face them with the documents that make prevaricators of them.. The subject is certainly one for a searching investigation. Evidence should be called to show how the Repatriation Commission has treated individual claims, and has ignored members of Parliament and members of a former government. What will be our position if we cannot trust responsible officers of the Public Service on questions of fact? Some fourteen months ago I brought under the notice of the Treasurer a number of cases concerning returned soldiers, not madewho had either received war pensions and had had them cancelled, or had been denied pensions from the' time of their discharge from the Australian Imperial Forces. The Treasurer agreed to appoint a committee of returned soldiers who were members of this House. The committee has been in existence, I understand, for about seven months, but so far as I am aware little progress has been made. The Government realizes that the committee have said. It must be rememhas proved futile, and owing to the strong pressure brought to bear by honourable members on both sides, and by the Returned Soldiers Association, it has decided to shelter itself by the appointment of a royal commission composed of medical men to deal with such cases. Such a commission composed wholly of medical account. men will not satisfy the great majority of the returned soldiers who are deserving of some representation on the commission. of the members of the commission. of the members of the Australian Imperial Forces 45,587 appeals have been dealt with. The number of men discharged in New South Wales is 144.253. and in Victoria 95,216. Practically the whole of these men would be entitled to repatriation benefits. The number of persons for whom war pensions have been claimed in New South Wales is 120,787 and in Victoria 124,846. The total number of war pensions granted in New South Wales is 100,168, and in Victoria 111,795. In New South Wales 49,037 more soldiers were discharged than in Victoria, but 11,000 fewer claims were granted in New South Wales than in Victoria.

No doubt a considerable number of the men whose claims have been rejected are the victims of shabby treatment. In one case the soldier received a full pension for four years, after which the pension was stopped. I asked to see the papers, but the Treasurer refused at that time to allow me to peruse the file. As a result this case, along with others, was referred to the soldiers' committee, but after waiting fourteen months, I have not yet received a final decision. The commission refused to review its determination or to grant a pension. AlthoughI wrote to the Treasurer a month or six weeks ago asking him to make the files available to me, I have so far had no reply. I do not care what reasons are advanced for the refusal togrant these pensions, honourable members have a right to see the files and to ascertain whether unfounded reports are contained in them. member been unable to see the files? ter about six weeks ago, and about a fortnight ago I spoke to him in this chamber regarding the matter, but I have not yet seen the files. I am not satisfied with the information that I have received from the Treasury. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) said that he had been misled by the department in connection with one case. That was the case of ex-Private William Holland, in which both Mr W. M . Hughes and the late Mr Tudor were misled by the department; and there is a grave possibility that in connection with other cases also honourable members have been misled. opened in regard to that department. I would not trust it with a dog. Mr 0. RILEY -As these men were accepted as fit when they enlisted there is every reason for their cases being treated sympathetically. they were again examined and found fit. In the case of Sampson, a pension was granted for four years. This man went away fit, but returned unfit. If he was not entitled to a pension, why was it paid to him for four years? I have in mind the case of another man concerning whom I made representations to the commission. Eor two years after he returned he received a f u l l pension, but it was then reduced to 60 per cent. That meant that his living allowance was denied him, because his incapacity was not 65 per centThat man had been a member of the Manchester Unity Lodge' for twenty years, and the lodge, records showed that during that period he had had only one week's illness. Yet he was denied his rights under the Repatriation Act. There were scores of other cases in connection with which I hoped that the Soldiers' Committee which was appointed from this House would do something. I am informed by the honourable member for mittee did grant a pension in one case. If there was justification for the granting of a pension in one case, the question arises: In how many other cases was an injustice done? The Repatriation Commission state that many of the disabilities from which these men are now suffering were aggravated not so much by their war service as by venereal disease and I wrote to the Minisalcoholism. Many of these men made great sacrifices and rendered great service to their country. The commission in dealing Avith them should realize the service that they have rendered to their country, and should endeavour to estimate the extent to which the privations they endured were' responsible for their condition. A number of cases have come under my notice of men suffering from chronic rheumatism, bronchitis, tuberculosis, and heart trouble, who have been refused a war pension. As one who has some knowledge of active service conditions, .1 consider that their present ailments are to a very large extent due to exposure, and to the privations' of war. The Government should accept its responsibility in regard to these men, and insist upon the fullest and most sympathetic consideration being given to tlieir cases. Although almost six years have passed since the cessation of hostilities, pensioners are, for the Before embarkation most part, still required to report for examination every six months. These frequent examinations are undesirable, and in the case of men suffering from nervous troubles the effect is anything but good. Surely the time has arrived when the com-",88,Pairs

The largenumber of medical omcers required for these examinations adds to the cost of repatriating our soldiers. I hope that the cases that I have placed before the Treasurer will receive his personal attention, and that something will be done to enable these unfortunate men to get pensions commensurate with their disabilities. A good deal of my time has been taken up w i th matters affecting soldiers' pensions, and in a great number of cases I have not secured that measure of success in my dealings w i th the Eepatriation Commission that I am convinced the claims deserved. I know of cases which were treated most unsympathetically, and I have protested repeatedly to the commission and to the Government. I recognize that it is humanly impossible for the M in tralia, enlisted for active service. He was ister, with his multifarious duties, to give personal attention to all these cases, but the facts referred to this morning by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) constitute so serious a charge against the members of the commission that the Minister should himself inquire into the case. The Government must acoept its f u l l share of responsibility for what is done. ber for Cook( Mr C. Riley), has given us some of his experiences in connection with these cases. that the fame is overdue when some responsible Minister should be set apart to deal solely with repatriation matters. A t present, too much delay occurs. I thought that when a committee of members of this House was appointed to deal with these cases, we should receive satisfaction from such an independent tribunal. For some time. I was in communication with the department in connection with a returned soldier, who I felt deserved greater consideration than he had received. 1 was dissatisfied with the decision given by the Repatriation Commission in his case, and, therefore asked that it should be referred to the Soldiers' Committee. A f t e r some considerable time had elapsed, and I had almost given up hope that the matter would receive attention, I received an in timation that the committee had seen this soldier's file, and considered that there was no reason why I should have access to it , if I so desired. I made no request to peruse the file, for I was familiar with the facts of the case, but I desired that the committee should do something to alleviate the circumstances of this man. Upon further investigation I found that the Soldiers Committee was mere camouflage. The Govern^ ment made these returned soldiers believe that the committee would be a tribunal for the redress of their grievances. It ' has proved, instead, a hollow sham. It could very well have relieved the Treaing these cases. Even at this late hour, I suggest that the committee should be clothed with power to make decisions, and to review effectively cases in which the commission has failed to mete out justice. The tribunal should at least be open for honourable members to make their representations to it . I wish to refer to two other cases I have in my mind. A man named A . Moon, of Keswick, South Ausa labourer on the wharfs at Port Adelaide, and, according to his references, he had lost very little working time, and certainly none through illness. The department is in possession of a form stating that Moon admitted that he was. suffering at some time' from asthma and bronchitis. He returned .to this country, and became so ill through the development of chronic asthma The honourable memand bronchitis that he found it necessary to seek not only medical treatment, but also an adequate pension. The department I feel would give him treatment only as an outpatient, and refused to admit him to the military hospital at Keswick. His disease developed so seriously that he was unable to attend the hospital, and ultimately died. I make a serious charge against the Government and the commission regarding this manI say they murdered h i m , and that it is impossible to. justify their callous indifference. His case, moreover, is not an isolated one. I have the particulars of the case of a man named Gathercole, who returned to this country as a "" cot case."" He does not live in my electorate, but I was called upon to interview him by way of Â« assisting the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), whose interests I represent at the present moment.

These are, no doubt, cases of a special nature. Returned men have suffered severe injustice, and in the instance to which I have referred, a life has been lost. to hold in high esteem certain officials who are associated with the Repatriation Department, but they know my view-that they have not interpreted the Repatriation Act as sympathetically as they might have done or were expected to do.

Surelyi t is reasonable to demand a t r i bunal, from which these men will receive the consideration due to them.

In saying that I do not wish to be disrespectful to the commissioners. Let me give one instance of an injustice in what is called a pre-existent ailment case. A man named Williams, of South Australia, was recorded as a "" T . B . case."" He was receiving the f u l l pension, and he claimed a special pension. He was informed by the department that his application had been before the proper authority, and t h a t his claim had been refused. Being unable to understand how the section quoted in the communication could apply to his case, he referred the matter to me. I came to Melbourne, and secured from the department the reason for his disqualification, which was that the disease was pre-existent. When I I have reason conveyed that information to the soldier, he said, "" Y o u know that I was quite healthy -before my enlistment."" I asked him if he had a medical certificate, and he said, "" Portunately, before enlisting, I consulted the f a m i l y doctor, and I have a clean b ill of health from him , and also from the medical officer of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, w i th which I took out a policy."" I brought his certificates to Melbourne, and in due course the T h a t interjection shows commission granted a special pension to him; but if I had not interested myself in his case, and he had accepted without a protest the bald statement that he was ineligible under a certain section, he would have been deprived of what was rightly his due. No doubt there are hundreds of men throughout the Commonwealth who have been similarly disqualified on the ground that their disease was pre-existent, when, as a matter of fact, they were perfectly healthy before their E v e n if they are special war service. A t any rate, if * there was any doubt as to when a disease originated, the .soldier should receive the benefit of it. The cases I have mentioned proved the need for the creation of a furthe r t r i bunal, and I hope that, as a result of the is mean and miserable. The speeches which have been delivered this morning, the returned soldiers w ill be secured against wrong decisions by the ReBecause of patriation Department, and that such decisions will not be considered final.

On the few occasions on which they did meet they did valuable work, and materially assisted me in separating tbe cases which might be discussed in the Houso from those who, by reason of the intimate nature of their dehonorable members could report the cases tails, could not be discussed publicly. I think everybody has recognized that practically all the cases remaining to be dealt with by the Eepatriation Department, and which need a good deal of consideration, are medical, and I disagree from the contention of the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Eiley) that the royal commission should not have been composed of doctors. Probably 99$ per cent, of the remaining cases are "" problem cases,"", and the royal commission, because of the calibre of its members,, is the body best qualified to adjudicate upon them. The soldiers nominated Dr. Sanford Jackson, of Queensland, as their direct representative, and all the other members, with the exception of Dr. Anderson, are returned soldiers. Even Dr. Andersondid a good deal of work in connection with soldiers during the war. Chairman( Sir Neville Howse), will admit that doctors do not acquire the military spirit as rapidly as you, when Director of Medical Services, desired. For my own part, I never learnt to distinguish one King's regulation from another, and I think that you had the same experience with nearly all the doctors under your control. They never developed any of the spirit that has been said by some to characterize the oflicer class, or desired to deal harshly with the. men under their care. In fact, the doctors [171] who have been examining and treating the soldiers in the hospitals have shown greater consideration to them than they ever extended towards their civilian patients and friends. I see no evidence The of the economies that are said to be practised in connection with repatriation. The pension list is being increased, and an attempt is being made to reach that ideal condition when all the applications for pensions will be completed, and the pensioners will not be called upon to report periodically for review. I recognize that The parliamentary committee that review keeps the patient continually disturbed in his mental outlook. Over fifty pensions are being completed every week, and it is hoped that before long the whole of the cases that can be finalized will have been dealt with. A lot of them are automatic, and will not come up for review. As to the suggestion that a Minister should be always available to whom that are referred to them, the Prime Minister has already stated that a Minister will be allotted to that ""work. A t the present time Senator Crawford is available, and I have no doubt that as soon as the royal commission reports, as I hope it will do within a few day3, this work may be satisfactorily allotted. There is no need for honourable members to be as pessimistic as they declared themselves to be in their speeches this morning, ""because the administration of the Repatriation Department, and the handling of the problems in connection with pensions, is improving every month.

In the list which was supplied previously several kinds of cloth were included, but they were only short lengths for sample purposes. which is now imported is that which is very sparingly used for the full-dress uniforms of the omcers.

I picious, but I know that sometimes highly-placed omcers who come from the Old Country are more favourably disposed towards men from England than towards Australians. There is a tendency to displace the Australians by these men from England, or to retain them in preference to Australians. To bring in men from outside is unfair to Australians, and causes discontent. I hope that the Minister will watch this matter very carefully. I should like some information from the Minister regarding the vote for the Royal Military College at Duntroon. During its investigations the Joint Committee on Public Accounts ascertained that for an expenditure of approximately Â£40,000 twelve staff omcers were being turned out from the institution per annum. That number represented the requirements of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces. In view of the world tendency towards peace and a better understanding between the nations, it is probable that that number will not be needed in the future. The expenditure in connection with this institution is so great that we should consider whether is is necessary I have made a recommendation in a minorit y report of the Public Accounts Committee. Is the Minister prepared to accept the advice of either the majorit y or the minorit y of that committee? There is no justification for the expenditure of so much money for such a small return. no doubt, instruct a larger number of students at very little extra cost. If it is necessary to train men for the defence forces, some arrangement should be made with the University of Melbourne or Sydney to give them a preliminary training, aftei which they could receive technical and military training at the permanent land establishment. for Defence) [8.18 a.m.] I have given very careful attention to the reports of the Accounts Committee, and I agree w it h the majority rather than the minority report. The majority report is endorsed by experts inside and outside the permanent and citizen forces. I admit that the Duntroon College is very expensive. In reducing the number of do not want to be unduly susstudents to twelve, I have gone too far , and the number w ill probably have to be increased to sixteen; but, even on that basis, the college will be very expensive. Three proposals are being considered by the Government. The first is that additional men shall be trained at Duntroon for civilian positions in the mandated territories. The second proposal is to use the college as a secondary school when the Commonwealth administrative staffs go to Canberra. Thet h i r d proposal, which was submitted by Professor Maccallum, is to establish ' Duntroon as a Commonwealth university, which would issue degrees upon examination. The Government is considering those proposals, and hopes, by the adoption of one of them, to increase the usefulness of the college 'and to employ to better purpose the services of the excellent professors and lecturers we have there. forward are supported by eminent authorities, and are contained in the recommendations of the David report. very strongly favoured the continuance of the colleges, but stated that if we did to train so many omcers. abolish them the only other possibility was to send the boys to a university for two years, and then take them into the permanent forces for two years.

We realize that a big expenditure is involved. Duntroon, this year, including the amounts mentioned in the footnotes, w ill cost Â£45,694. I had in my mind the idea that Duntroon would soon be in a fairly closely-settled area, and that educational facilities would have to be provided in the Federal Territory.

200,The Whole Of. Mr Mahony,"No ; but it is respecific inquiry was addressed to the Admiralty upon this'very matter, with the result that a cablegram recently received irom the High Commissioner gives the English price for this armament at the unexpectedly high figure of Â£810,000, implying a completed cost in Australia for same of roundly Â£900,000. Sir John Monash rushed into this matter, and, not being an expert, he accepted the figure of Â£810,000 as the armament cost for one vessel, whereas it really applies to both vessels. The original estimate of the Shipping Board was approximately correct. That shows clearly that on this one point Sir John Monash's report is not reliable. In it he implied that the Navy Board has over-estimated the overhead charges, and did not have any reliable data before it upon which to base its estimates. He roundly condemned altogether the estimate of the N a v y Board. In reference to the Shipping Board, be saidBy reason alone of the evident care and completeness with whicli these estimates have been prepared, they are entitled to very great respect, and could,, in my opinion, be regarded as acceptable continuedexcept for tlie underlying doubt as to whether the general character and type of tlie cruiser envisaged by the Shipping Board corresponds with tlie latest Admiralty designs."" different complexion upon the matter. the sort. The type of vessel was known to certain experts of the Navy Office. However, I shall deal w it h that subject later. Referring to machinery, Sir John Monash said""The Shipping Board has assumed that, based upon that of the Glorious class, 90,000 horsepower would be requisite to give the desired speed of 33 knots; although that board claims that its estimate of the cost of such machinery has been liberal enough to provide, if necessary, for at least 120,000 horse-power. As against this, it is known that a modern Italian 10,000ton cruiser is being built with engines of 160,000 horse-power; and a Washington cruiser is said to be similarly provided. It is well-known that in naval and ordinary merchant ship construction, vessels are built to a certain balance. A boat of 10,000 tons would have its various parts apportioned in percentages, otherwise it might be top-heavy -The bow might be liable to dive or be too high out of the water, or it might have a decided list. Shipbuilders and.naval contractors are well aware of this. They know the displacement of a 5,000-ton or 10,000-ton vessel, and the same proportion of balance as f a r as the hull, the superstructure and the internal fittings are concerned must be kept, otherwise the vessel would be a failure. If the percentage of weight in the hull were reduced and increased on the engines, the engine power would be so groat as to force the vessel to dive or to shake itself to pieces. When Sir John Monash speaks of horse-power he does not know what he is talking about. The shipping authorities know exactly what horse-power is required to drive a vessel at a certain number of knots an hour. Sir John Monash obtained some inkling of the fact that if weight is taken off oome part of the vessel it has to be made up on another. He admits that in his report. The estimates of the shipping board, which is composed of experts, are, in his opinion, worthy of the greatest respect. It is well known that if we wait for plans and specifications we shall be in no better position Sir John Monash when they arrive than we are in to-day. Sir John Monash made a minute examination of the estimates prepared by the Shipping Board, and he complimented it on its work. It went into every detail of the cruiser, and gave a price for every part, and a reason for fixing the price. On the other hand, the Naval Board failed It does nothing of completely to: justify its estimates. Sir John Monash attempted to make another point in his report, when he mentioned that if the Â£1,000,000 extra, which a cruiser built in Australia would cost, were saved by having the vessel built in Britain, it could be usefully employed otherwise for defence purpose. We can appreciate that statement, knowing Sir John Monash as we do; but surely* even he perceives that money spent on a cruiser is expenditure for defence. Does he hope that if this money is not spent on an Australian-built cruiser, it will be spent to provide more "" cushy "" jobs at Victoria Barracks for men who wear a little bit of red on their shoulders? He, and the Government also, should remember, when thinking of this matter, that if the Â£1,000,000 is spent in Australia, it w ill be paid in wages to Australiau workmen, and will circulate here.",98,Special Defence Provision
201,Mr Bbuce,Read on.,99,Special Defence Provision
202,Mr Mahony,,99,Special Defence Provision
203,Mr Bruce,That puts a somewhat,99,Special Defence Provision
204,Mr Mahony,"market for our primary producers. John Monash says of this Â£1,000,000It is, in fact, the sum which would provide wages at standard rates for an estimated period of about three years, to some 1,300 workers. If these 1,300 men were engaged i u the construction of a cruiser, sufficient work for another 1,000 men could be found in other activities in the dockyard, so that in all 2,300 men would be employed. Taking the Australian average family of a man, his wife and two children, it will be seen, therefore, that if this amount of money were spent in building a cruiser in Australia, work and maintenance would be provided for 9,200 persons for thi'ee years. Sir John Monash also says. in his reportThe aspect to which I desire to draw your attention is that this Â£1,000,000 would be permanently withdrawn from the whole population of the Commonwealth, for the immediate, but very temporary, benefit of a negligible percentage of its population. He apparently forgets that it would circulate in Australia and would be used to pay storekeepers' bills, rates and taxes, rents, and other costs of living. It can, therefore, hardly be said, that if, would be withdrawn. I dispute his statement that only a negligible percentage of the population would reap "" very temporary benefit "" from the expenditure of it . If the cruiser were built here, work and maintenance would be provided for 5,000 people outside the dockyard altogether. That is a conservative estimate. So that if we have the cruiser built here at least 14,200 people w ill benefit. That cannot be considered to be a negligible factor in the case. My estimate is based on the number of men who would be employed on the work in and out of the dockyards, and I have attributed to them the average Australian family. I think that that is fair. I ask honourable members .of this committee who are protectionists where there is an industry in any constituency whicli maintains 14,200 persons which has not appealed to the Government for protection. Yet, notwithstanding that this industry is vital to Australia, some honourable members do not seem inclined to be sympathetic to it . The Prime Minister has said that the safety and prosperity of Australia depend upon the honourable member turn the agent out of carriage of our goods over sea to the marthe gallery? kets of thÂ© world. Surely we cannot expect to rely for ever upon Great Britain to do our shipping and build our ships. It will, indeed. Sir We should begin to do something for ourselves. The Prime Minister has announced that he proposes to call for tenders for the construction of these cruisers in the following manner:-(1 ) The building of the two cruisers in GreatB r it a in ; (2) the construction of one in Great Britain and one in Australia; and (3) the construction of one in Australia. British shipbuilders are to be given three opportunities to secure the work; but only one is to be given to those engaged in the industry in Australia. I submit that the tenders should be invited on similar conditions in both Great Britain and Australia. The Prime Minister has said : "" I can give my assurance that the Cabinet is unanimous in its desire to have this work done in Australia, provided"" There is always a proviso. The conditions under which the Australian ship-builders will be required to submit their tenders make it almost impossible for them to get the work. The Government, before calling for tenders, requested one of the prospective tenderers, the Commonwealth Shipping Board, to submit a price for the work. That price has been made public. All honourable members know that an armaments ring -controls the price of armaments. That ring is now acquainted with the price that tiie Australian Shipping Board will want should it be entrusted with this work, and it will take all care that the price of the armaments required by that board will be prohibitive, so that it w ill be impossible for the work to be done in Australia. That -is quite clear from the information that we already have, for the Australian Shipping Board, after making, inquiries in Great Britain, estimates that the cost of the necessary armaments will be Â£810,000, which is double what ib ought to be. Agents of the armament ring have been haunting the corridors of this building for the last few weeks, and last week, when the Prime Minister rose to make his statement of the Government jjolicy on this inatter, the agent of one of the biggest armament firms in Great Britain was seated in the gallery.

The courts have decided the wages to be paid to workmen engaged in . different branches of industry; but, although the Government have given our workmen the right to go to the Arbitration Court to secure f a i r wages and conditions, they say, as in this case, that they w ill send the work out of the W h y is there so country because, in their opinion, the cost is excessive. The whole thing is absurd. To show the extent to which a l l sections of the community are interested in this matter, I shall quote a resolution passed at a meeting convened by the Lord Mayor of Sydney, and held in the Sydney Town Hall.

214,Mr Mahony,"The Minister shouldThe meeting was a most enthusiastic one, and, as tbe resolution clearly shows, the people are strongly against the proposal of the Government to send the work out of Australia. We have ship construction experts in Australia; practically every man at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, from the Director down, has had experience in the great shipbuilding yards in Great Britain. I have gone to the trouble to prepare a return showing the experience of these men; but, without wearying honourable members by quoting it, I am able to say that practically every employee has worked in the shipbuilding yards of Vickers Limited, Armstrong and Company, or others in the Old Country. We have highly skilled experts in Australia. We also sent a number of young Australians to Great Britain to receive instruction in the work of shipbuilding, and they are now available in Australia when their serThe officer who submitted the estimate of vices are required. The Government have expended thousands of pounds in sending young men to Great Britain to receive instruction in submarine and other forms of naval construction, but when they return work is not available for them, so that Australia does not receive any return for the money expended. It is a most suicidal policy. The work these men' have done speaks for itself. The Ferndale, which is the latest vessel constructed in Australia, will be undergoing her sea trial within the next fortnight, and will be placed in commission in about six weeks' time. When the work on this vessel is completed hundreds of men will be thrown out of employment. I ask honourable members opposite in all seriousness if they are prepared to assist in throwing these men to the wolves. Honourable members supporting the Government are sent here not to represent only one section of the poople, but to protect the interests of all. I wish now' to deal with a very serious aspect of this subject. I believe a deliberate attempt has been made to prevent this workfbeing given to Australian workmen. I am sorry to find that such an attempt has been made by the Navy office. Sir John Monash roundly condemns the estimates submitted by Engineer-Captain Sydenham. the Naval Board. that information from the Minister. In the Navy Department there is a well known expert ship constructor who was brought from Great Britain to prepare plans and estimates. He computed an estimate and handed it to Engineer-Captain Sydenham, but the price did not suit that officer or the Navy Board, and nothing more was heard of it . charge. prove it if necessary. This expert submitted an estimate of Â£3,000,000. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) interviewed this officer, and he therefore knows of whom I am speaking. His estimate was so strongly in favour of the construction being undertaken in Australia that the anti-Australians in the Navy office ""sat on "" it, and refused to make it public. Â£3,000,000 was Mr Leask, and his figures should be produced. that estimate increased by the Navy Department ? about Â£700,000. down two cruisers proportionately cheaper than one. estimate for two cruisers? one. Mr Leask submitted his estimate to his superior officer, Engineer-Captain Sydenham. I do not know if EngineerCaptain Sydenham, or any one else, was responsible, but I do know that Mr Leask's estimate was suppressed. Sir John Monash did not see it, neither was he given an opportunity to discuss its details with the naval expert. there be that the vessels would be built at the price estimated? have we that the vessels would be built at the prices estimated by other authorities?

Did the Minister ever get in touch with the expert ship constructor in the department? No. The' estimate was suppressed because the price was in favour of Australia. The price did not suit the Royal Naval omcers in our Navy Office to-day, and it is about "" time we started to root out some of them and replace them with young Australians who have the interest of this great Commonwealth at heart. In their deliberate anti-Australian policy they have gone further. Perhaps the Minister will recollect that on the 13th August of this year, when thousands of deserving men in Australia were seeking employment, the Minister signed a minute giving approval to the conversion of the HMAS. Silvio into a survey sloop for service in the Australian Navy at an estimated cost of Â£68,000, the work to be carried out in Great Britain. This astounding decision was reached notwithstanding the fact that thousands of unemployed were in our midst. In case there may be any doubt concerning .the accuracy of this statement, I shall give the number of the file so the minute can be traced. file number is GA 603/231/31. That is clear and definite. The Minister can see Avhere his approval was given for the expenditure of Â£6S,000 in Great Britain. The point is that the alterations were necessary. would not materially affect the vessel, and could have been made in Australia. Thus the money spent would have provided work for Australian people. Sitting suspended from 9.S0 to 10.S0 a.m. been done just as well in Australia. the Adelaide. prised that another anti-Australian should have said that. The honourable member but one of these days the people of this country will put him where he ought to be. The Prime Minister has stressed the point that an order for the construction of the vessel could not be placed in Australia because plans and specifications were not available. If he had been sincere, he would have seen that plans and specifications were available long ago, because the necessary documents could have been obtained. Technical journals which I have consulted show that, early in April of the present year, orders were placed by the British Government for the construction of cruisers in the Mother Country; and as those vessels will be similar in type to the proposed cruisers for the Australian Navy, the Prime Minister could have cabled for plans and specifications in December last. But, apparently, the right honourable gentleman was not sufficiently interested, otherwise the necessary plans and specifications would have been made available, and the work could have been done in Australia. It is evident that the Prime Minister, and his lieutenant, the Treasurer, are so busy patching up the pact that they cannot find time to give attention to proposals for the development of shipbuilding in Australia. An order should be placed immediately with the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for one cruiser. Then, if the Government wishes to make a comparison The of costs, tenders could be invited for a second cruiser, and preference, to the extent of at least 60 per cent -as is done in connection with other industries-be given to the Australian tenderers. I am quite satisfied that if the Government will allow its supporters an untrammelled vote in this matter, there will be an overwhelming majority of the committee in favour Those alterations, however, of the construction of these cruisers in Australia. If honourable members are allowed a free hand, they will not be shielding themselves behind the party cry, but will vote for Australia. This dockyard should be maintained for defence purposes. The British. Government realizes the importance of providing employment for men skilled in naval construction.

The vessels at present in hand will be finished within six weeks, and unless continuous employment is provided, hundreds of highlyskilled men will have to seek work elsewhere. What would be Australia's position if , as the Prime Minister has suggested, this country were attacked by a hostile naval power? we had a naval dockyard in ful l operation, the necessary repairs to naval ships could not be undertaken perhaps for months, and we know that delay in the repair of naval vessels very often is the turning point in decisive naval action. Evidently the Prime Minister is not very much concerned about that. schemes to provide employment for people at the other side of the world. To me this is a strange doctrine. So far as I know it is not preached in any other -country. How can we develop our industries if , whenever we can get a commodity 2Â£d. cheaper elsewhere, we refuse to encourage Australian workmen? A very important principle is involved in this question. We should do all that is possible to build up an Australian sentiment and make Australia a nation. That is the spirit we should endeavour to foster. We all remember how we were thrilled when the first vessels of the Australian Navy, created by the Fisher Labour Government, entered Australian waters. Aa intense feeling of patriotism pulsated through the veins of every man, woman, and child in Australia. want cheapness we can get our work done in China or Japan. It is not fair to compare the work of Australian workmen with that of low-grade workmen of -other countries. ber suggest that the workmen of Great Britain are low-grade? the workmen of Australia are better than the workmen of Great Britain. This has been proved time after time. When the last Australian-built ship arrived in the Mother Country, experts in shipbuilding were astounded at the class of work that had been put into the vessel, and stated they would not have dreamed of putting such high-class finish into a British-built ship. I appeal to the comThe position at mittee to give Australians a chance to do this naval construction work. All sections of the community are asking for it. Mr Ludowici, chairman of the Chamber of Manufactures, presiding at a great meeting in the Sydney Town Hall last week, declared he had been in consultation with the unions concerned, and was quite satisfied that they would do the work satisUnless factorily. I am certain that if the Government gives the Australian workmen a chance they will respond magnificently and deliver the goods. Mrâ¬ . RILEY (Cook) [10.43 a.m.] This All-Australian Government which, when it was formed, prided itself on the fact that all of its members were AusHe is more concerned with tralian-born, is now showing how to support Australian industries by placing a contract for the building of a cruiser outside the 'Commonwealth. The Government, together with its supporters, and many anti-Australians outside the House, suggests that delay in construction is a deciding factor against the building of these ships in Australia. In this respect Australia does not stand alone. The Governments of other countries have to putup with delays. I have a return showing what is the position in the Mother Country. In the House of Commons, on the 27th February, Mr Amnion, replying to a question submitted by Viscount Curzon, as to the time occupied on the construction of certain cruisers in British dockyards, gave the following information:Frobisher, laid down August, 1916, to comI f we plete end of June, 1924, eight years. Effingham, laid down April, 1917, to complete end of March, 1925, eight years. Enterprise, laid down June, 1918, to complete end of July, 1924, six years. Emerald, laid down September, 1918, to com-, plete end of March, 1925, seven years. It will be seen, therefore, that considerable delay has occurred in the construction of those four cruisers in Great Britain, which, as the Minister for Defence informed me some weeks ago, are to a great extent similar to the 10,000-ton cruisers the Commonwealth proposes to have built. The Frobisher was laid down during the war, when rapid construction was vitally necessary, and the delay in its completion is inexplicable. As a matter of fact, the time occupied in constructing the Adelaide and Brisbane compares very",103,Moloney Has The For Swan Never Ceases To Decry Australia
234,Mr Mann,Does the honourable mem,104,Moloney Has The For Swan Never Ceases To Decry Australia
235,Mr Mahony,"No, but I say thatfavorably with the time occupied in building vessels of a similar type in Great Britain. I have a little knowledge of the costing in the construction of cruisers. I was in charge of the labour costs at Cockatoo Island some years ago, and quite recently I had occasion to point out to honourable members one of the many reasons which were responsible for the high cost of war-ship construction in Australia. Labour and material used on repair jobs of all descriptions were charged up to the torpedo destroyers and cruisers under construction. Orders were .issued by the Naval Board that all establishment charges were to be spread over jobs costing more than Â£1,000, and as the only jobs costing more than Â£1,000 were the cruisers and destroyers these vessels had to carry the burden of the whole of the establishment charges at Cockatoo Island. This Government only a few months ago agreed to pay Â£275,000 to Bawra when there was absolutely no legal liability to make that payment, and allowed half of the amount to be paid to the Imperial Government, which had made no claim for it . It authorized the payment of Â£309,000 to the Imperial Government in connection with the sale of ex-enemy vessels, notwithstanding that the previous Prime Minister and his Government refused to make such a payment, and was also prepared to remit land taxation amounting to Â£1,300,000. Yeti t croaks about the exorbitant cost of placing an order for cruisers with Australian dockyards. Ministers will not give Australian workers a chance to demonstrate what they can do, and will not allow the shipbuilding industry of Australia to profit by this most excellent opportunity to strengthen tlie Commonwealth from a defence point of view. Some honourable members have referred to what they describe as the "" goslow"" tactics at Cockatoo Island. I was on the island for a number of years. was there when Donald Grant, the famous I.W.W. man, was employed on the island. I can say from my own observation that no man gave a fairer day's work than did Donald Grant. The other workers, too, all did honest work, and if they are given the opportunity on this occasion I can assure honourable members that they will ""deliver the goods."" By interjection, the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Wrongful charging of material and labour Afr. O. Riley. Seabrook) asked the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) what guaranteecould be given that the cruisers would be turned out within a reasonable time if built locally. No such guarantee can be given any more than the Prime Ministercan guarantee that cruisers built in Great Britain will be completed within a reasonable time. I have just shown that many of the cruisers laid down in 1916 and. 1917 will not be completed until next year. The extra cost of building the Adelaide and Brisbane, and the delay involved in their construction, were largely brought about by the many alterations in design authorized by the Naval Board. As much as Â£60,000 was authorized to be spent on alterations on the Adelaide. It is well to remember that these cruisers were not constructed in a private dockyard, but'were built in a Government dockyard controlled by the Department of the Prime Minister. Many naval experts and supervisors were appointed to supervise the work, and honourable members can realize that when a man has a fairly comfortable job he is not too anxious for it to come to an end. Therefore, there was considerable unnecessary delay, as the longer the vessels were on. the stocks, the longer these naval supervisors retained their jobs. It is just as well for honourable members to know the factors that helped to delay construction and increase the cost of the war vessels that have been constructed in Australia. Some months ago I brought under the notice of the House the fact that when Mr King Salter, the general manager of the dockyard, had a motor garage built at Balmain, material and workers were dispatched from the island to Balmain to build it . I handled the costing cards on the island, and, consequently, know what I am talking about; yet when I asked a question in the House some I months ago with regard to the 'cost of this garage I was told that the Commonwealth had not been charged with it . Owing to the way in which the costing system at Cockatoo has been manipulated private work and country orders, as many people have described them, have been debited to cruisers and other vessels under construction. No establishment could stand charges of that nature. â_ is detrimental to the success of the ship'building industry. In bis ' report, SirJ o h n Monash refers to the information originally obtained by the Prime Minister, that cruisers, of the type desired could be built in Great Britain for Â£1,900,000. .After analysing that information, Sir John Monash says that he is definitely of opinion that there are no reliable figures of the prices in Great Britain of a modern 10,000-ton cruiser to guide us in this matter. The Naval Board has submitted an estimate of the cost of local construction, and Sir John Monash, i h commenting upon that estimate, which was pre-sented by Engineer-CaptainE . D . Sydenham, R . N . , the Director of Engineering <of the Royal Australian Navy, says: Unfortunately, during the discussions, it -emerged clearly that a number of the data and -factors employed by him could not be accepted as accurate. Later on Sir John Monash says: Specifically, Captain Sydenham has assigned the sum of Â£171,000, i.e., 24 per cent, of Â£712,500, as representing the mere cost of -transportation from England to Cockatoo Dock of some 10,000 tons of miscellaneous materials, raw and fabricated! This is an average of Â£17 a ton. In my opinion, which is based upon -documentary information supplied by the Shipping Board, and confirmed by my own experience of considerable importations of structural materials during the past three years, the figure set down for transportation charges is certainly at least Â£130,000 in excess of the -truth. What reliance, therefore, can be placed on advice tendered by the Naval Board to the Government or embodied in any. .report to Parliament? It is absolutely valueless. My experience of naval men is that their attitude is absolutely anti-Australian. They have been brought up in an atmosphere quite foreign to Australia, and they have no time for anyone unless he has the brand "" R . N . "" on his coat. Captain Sydenham, according to the report of Sir John Monash, spoke of the very heavy overhead charges at Cockatoo Island. In my opinion, these should not be used as a justification for not affording the shipbuilding industry of Australia, a chance to make good. Captain Sydenham assigned 35 per cent, as the correct ratio of overhead charges at Cockatoo Island, and Sir John Monash, who is prepared to accept the figures supplied by the Ship-. ping Board, namely, 28 per cent., commenting upon this estimate, says:I consider that the Naval Board has overestimated these overhead charges. Reading Sir John Monash's report, one must come to the conclusion that the Naval Board is determined, as far as possible, to crush Cockatoo Island. If the present Government is prepared to do its duty and continue the good work laid down by the great Australian Imperial Porce a few years ago in giving the Australian people confidence in themselves, it will not hesitate to place orders for the construction of the cruisers in Australia. Officials at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, men with considerable experience, gained in shipbuilding yards in Great Britain, and men for whose opinion I have every respect, have informed me that if an order for the building of two cruisers is given to the dockyard it w ill mean a saving of Â£500,000, and that the second cruiser can be launched nine months after the first cruiser. We have recently built at Cockatoo Island the steamers Fordsdale and Ferndale. There is jno comparison, so far as workmanship is concerned, between these . vessels and vessels built in British dockyards. I have been able to closely scrutinize the work put into the cruisers that have been built in Australia and that put* into the construction of the battleship Australia. The riveting and much of the hull work in the Australia were a disgrace. I have been over every part of it , and I could, if necessary, bring evidence in proof of my statement. The Australian excels in his workmanship. Although the labour cost would be considerably higher if a cruiser were constructed in Australia, it would be worthwhile to have the work done here, because employment would be provided for our own people, and a struggling industry would be given a helping hand. During the early hours of this morning the committee dealt particularly with the estimates in connection with the naval establishment. I asked the Minister what were the duties of the ship constructor, who is receiving Â£656 per annum. The Minister informed me that he was engaged at Garden Island upon repair work. Whilst listening to the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) this morning, I ascertained that this officer, at the request of the Naval Board, had submitted an estimate for the construction of a cruiser in Australia. That estimate amounted to Â£3,000,000. It was apparently too damaging for the Naval Board. because the matter was not carried any further. those facts when the committee was considering the matter, I should have had something further to say about the withholding of this expert advice from the committee. Whilst in England some time ago, Sir William Clarkson, who is a member of the Naval Board, selected this man on account of his expert knowledge of naval ship construction. I dare say that this expert in ship construction went to considerable trouble to prepare his estimate, and was careful to be accurate in every detail. has been thrown into the waste-paper basket! I am forced to the conclusion that, because he was selected from a private shipbuilding yard, he is not acceptable to those who have been reared in the atmosphere of the Royal Navy. The time has arrived when we should cultivate an Australian sentiment. When the matter of Australian woollens was being discussed this morning, the Minister for Defence informed us that practically the whole of the serge required for the Australian Navy was of Australian manufacture. That was very pleasing news to honourable members, especially to those who are particularly interested in the texvessel then under construction. I do hot tile industry, and who are aware of the depression that exists in that industry at the present time. Yet we find that in August of this year the same Minister gave authority for the conversion of the Silvio into a surveying sloop. As far as I have been able to ascertain, no external alterations were necessary, but work costing Â£68,000 is to be done on this ship outside Australia. I am not surprised, because I formerly the Comet, which was captured in New Guinea by the Australian Navy in the early stages of the war-was in Mort's Dock a few weeks ago undergoing repairs. Work which the Government should, and could, put in the way of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard is be. ing given to private enterprise. We can only conclude, therefore, that the Government is not actuated by a desire to further the interests of Australia, but wishes to foster private enterprise. I hope that the Government will not allow the excessive costs that were associated with the construction of the Brisbane and the Adelaide to prejudice it in considering the important matter of placing an order for the construoti-T'if of these two new Mr C. Riley cruisers. Delays have occurred in cruiser HadI been acquainted with construction in Great Britain. The naval gentlemen who strutted round Cockatoo Island whilst the Brisbane and the Adelaide were being constructed knew that the longer the ships were on the stocks the longer would they retain their jobs and their salaries. The Government should hesitate before placing an order for the construction of the cruisers outside Australia. If it were equal to its responsibilities, it would decide to build both cruisers in' Australia. I do not say that they must necessarily be built at Cockatoo Yet his estimate Island. I am prepared to see private shipping yards spring into existence. If one cruiser is given to Cockatoo Island to construct, perhaps the same old story will be repeated, and many other jobs will be charged to it that do not rightfully belong to it. We have had incompetent officers who have estimated that from Â£5,000 to Â£7,000 would be required for certain naval repair work, but when that work was nearing completion they found that the cost would he in the vicinity of Â£10,000. Instead of admitting their blunder, they have issued instructions for the cost above the estimate to be borne by the Brisbane or some other stand for that. I am keenly anxious that the Government should investigate 'the complaint I have made with regard to the general manager's motor garage that was built at Balmain, with dockyard material. The Commonwealth Investigation Bureau should inquire into the matter,, and thus render a service to the taxpayers and to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I trust that this work will be kept know that the Unain Australia, and that the Government will inculcate in the people a. spirit like that which animates the American people, by placing a duty upon foreign-built vessels, and imposing a penalty upon ships that are repaired in places other than Australia. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [11.10 a.m.] I thought that the Minister( Mr Bowden) would have made a statement that would have cleared up one or more of the points that have been raised during the debate. But since he has not done so, I must deal with the matter as I find it . I differ from some who have spoken. I think that this question is one of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth, and must be considered from the stand-point of national' defence, and from that stand-point only. I part company, therefore, with those who think that it should be considered as an economic or financial proposition, though I do not deny that such aspects have to be taken into consideration. The question is not whether money should be spent in this or in any other country tr> relieve unemployment, but whether the committee is assured that these two cruisers are necessary for the safety of the Commonwealth, and suited to form an integral part of our scheme of defence. I assume, of course, that the Government approaches the matter from this standpoint. By those who look through misty Utopian spectacles, and see a world beating the sword into the plough-share within a very short while, this matter is regarded, of course, quite differently. W it h their view I cannot be expected to sympathize, and I do not do so. As for world peace, I suppose we all pray most earnestly for it . I do not really think that there is any difference between parties in that respect. A t the bottom of their hearts all men want peace. Mr W. M . HUGHES proach our objective by different paths. I am not one who thinks that the reign of peace is to be hastened by a complete disregard of the teachings of history, _of the promptings of human nature, and of these deep passions which have existed in mankind from the beginning, and are likely to last to the end. peopled by man as we know him, there w ill always be danger of Avar. being so, aud because we, above all people in the world, are in a position in which it is imperative that we should be able to defend ourselves, I have always favoured a vigorous and adequate defence policy for this Commonwealth. therefore, that I view this matter. A great deal has been said about the encouragement of Australian industry. shall have something to say about that; but I declare at the outset that unless 1"" was firml y convinced that these cruisers are necessary for the safety of this Commonwealth, and are to be regarded as an integral part of the defence policy of the Commonwealth, I would not vote for the expenditure of a penny upon them merely to provide work for unemployed artisans. I cannot conceive of a worse way in which money could be spent than in the building of war-ships that are not necessary for the national safety. This is perhaps the only part of the British Labour party's policy with which I totally disagree. The British Labour Government, whose head was a notorious pacifist during the war, has put forward as a pretext-as I conceive it to be-for the building of cruisers, the excuse that their construction will provide work for Britain's unemployed artisans. I do not agree with such a policy. I cannot believe that Britain is building cruisers to find work for its own unemployed. I know very well that Mr. Thomas, Mr Clynes, and other members of the British Ministry hold totally different views in this connection fro m those held by Mr Ramsay MacDonald. I suppose that he, when brought face to face with the facts, had to follow the lead given by Mr Thomas and Mr Clynes, and travel along the road -vvhich the English people were resolute to take. To build cruisers in order to find work for unemployed men at a time when Britain is at its wits' end for money, at the very moment when the nations are considering But we apwhether all war-ships should be scrapped is not a sensible policy, or one consistent with the Labour party's platform. But once it is agreed that the building of these cruisers is necessary for the safety of the Commonwealth, the whole superstructure of the arguments against the proposal disappears; objections against In a world the expenditure must be regarded not as vital elements in the-problem, but merely That as incidental. If it is necessary to assure the safety of the country that we should have these cruisers, how utterly f u t i l e is the argument that we might save Â£500,000 by having them built in B r i tain ! I cannot accept that kind of argument at all. Either the cruisers are It is from , that stand-point, necessary for the safety of the country, or they are not. That they are necessary is the only reason why we should contemI , too, plate their construction at a time when by all accounts it is not easy to obtain money-althoug h certain events that have happened recently would seem to indicate that the opposite is the case. We should not contemplate the expenditure of this money unless it is absolutely necessary, as necessary as for a man to pay the premium for his fire or life insurance, no matter how difficult it may be to do so. I assume that the Government has assured itself that these cruisers are essential for the safety of this country. sidering, and what have we to go upon which will help us to form an opinion as to whether the proposed is justified? the Government of the British Admiralty experts on this vital question as well as upon the type of ship to be built, and that it is a type which will fit into any scheme whether it has been formulated circumstances will compel to take a certain definite shape, clearly enough known to the men whose business it is to concern themselves naval strategy. vessels being necessary for our we have to ask ourselves what are the arguments in favour of their being constructed in any other country but this. I submit most emphatically that the onus is upon those who wish to construct out of the country to make out a case in favour of such a^course. it difficult to do so. On what does their objection rest? Is it not an admission that at the bottom of their hearts those who make it regard this country as immature to a degree that makes her almost in comparison with other nations, and incapable of compassing this work which is necessary to its own safety ? This Australia of ours, which has long been admitted by the nations as entitled to sit as an equal with them in the councils of the world, is evidently regarded by the Naval Board in a very different The board approaches this question its mind already made up.

The manner in which its estimate was compiled, as any one can see very plainly from Sir John If this is not so, what are we conMonash's report, is one calculated to give offence to any Australian. I think I have in my career shown plainly enough expenditure that I am a believer in Empire, and I I assume, therefore, that have not been slow to say how much is following the advice we owe to Britain. I have never hesiand its own tated to champion her cause; but we are Australians, and the best service we can render Britain and the Empire, after all these years, is to show that we are fit to of Imperial defence, which, govern this country, to develop and deor not, fend it .

We can, we ought to, build these cruisers. There are men in this country and in this chamber who can say nothing good of Australia, despicable but under the pretence of cheapness prefer that the machinery and plant necessary for our development and safety should be brought from Britain. But that is not their real reason for their preference. They prefer it because it is British and not Australian. I am not that kind of Britisher at all.

But the defence of a country is not assured by ships, cannon, aeroplanes, or poison gas, and depends on its men and the spirit animating the community. Germany did not go down merely because she was beaten on the field, soldier against soldier, by the Allied Forces, but because her spirit failed her, her morale had broken. D i d 'we not realize during the war. that the great thing was to keep up the spirit of the country, to inspire it to fresh effort when it was beaten down?

There is only one way in which to build it up. selves nationally in our works; words are not enough. sign. They must see something in which the spirit of the country is embodied. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) spoke of the entry of the Australian Navy into the Sydney Harbouri n 1913. also on that day, that the spirit of Australia had taken shape. It was the very incarnation of the spirit of this great wide land. the only national symbol in which Australia has expressed herself. If we are to inspire the people of this country with national sentiment, and to prove to the world that we are a nation in something more than name, we cannot allow this time to pass and weakly hand over to an elder brother work which we are well able to do ourselves. . We have shown onr capacity. It is not as though we were I asked to do something incredibly difficult which we have never attempted. We built the Adelaide. I havo no doubt of the capacity of the Australian workmen, or of the experts who are in our -service. Buti t is not enough to build the ships. Thoy must be manned, and they must be supported by the spirit of the citizens. When the people of Australia see theee . vessels being built-the formless, inanimate pieces .of metal taking shape, and becoming animate with a great purpose moulded into instrumentalities for "" ensuring the safety of the Commonwealth,"" potent and terrible repositories of mighty power, a symbol of our nationality, the outward and visible sign to the world that we are resolved to defend ourselves -nationa l sentiment will be awakened, and breathe into them the breath of national life. Of all nations in the world we are most entitled to be regarded as a Pacifio power. We are set in the Pacific Ocean, and our policy is peace. We are, I hope, chastened a little by experience, and we realize that we live in a world in which it is necessary for us to defend ourselves. I ask the Ministry why it hesitates, if it is hesitating-and I have, no information which would lead me to believe it is-to stand its ground? It . has been suggested that the element of expense should sway our judgment and Some people seem to think decide our .. policy. But there is no evidence that theee vessels would cost more to construct in Australia than in EngWe must express ourland. In all human probability they would cost more. Sir John Monash, rn The people must have a his report, states that there is a strong assumption-amountin g almost to a cer..tainty-that thoir construction in Australia would cost a great deal more than if they were built in Great Britain, but the amount of that excess cost we do not It seemed to me, and to others know. But there is no evidence to show that the excess cost would be relatively more for ships of war than for other things needed by the country. Australia The navy was then, and is now, has a different standard of living, and different rates of pay from other countries, but beyond that there is no evidence that, man for man, unit for unit, and Â£ 1 for Â£ 1 of capital, Australia cannot t u rn out vessels as cheaply as Great Britain or any other country. Given the same plant, and those adventitious aids which enable labour to exert its power most effectively and economically, Australian men need not be afraid to with any workmen in the world. suppose the vessels would cost more to build in Australia; would cost so much more that this country could not find the money, they should be built here.

It has been known for many months that the cruisers, were wanted, yet nothing has been done. Why? there is any evidence that six months would make a vital difference, nor is there evidence of which I am aware that Australia would take longer to construct a vessel than Great Britain. is such evidence, it can only arise out of the difference in thc quality of the plant available for the work of construction. If this Government is satisfied that the construction of thc cruisers is essential to the defence of this country, it should, as part of a great national policy, equip our Mr W. it. Hughes. yards with the most up-to-date p l a n t ' in workthe world. If there is no doubt in the compete minds of Ministers as to whether cruisers But are the best means of defence, and not relatively submarines or airships, that is the posiunless they tion they should take up.' I know the difficulties that confront the Government. I am not so insensible to them tiiat I would ask this Government to do anyfor there is thing that I would not be prepared to do myself.

There is Australia only one possible tenderer in Australia, and that is practically a government in Shipping Board are of a strumentality. We have, therefore, a reductio ad absurdum.

It is high time that we' shook off this ancient tradition that no good thing can come out of Australia. This tradition lies heavily upon some of the newspapers of this country, more particularly on certain reactionary newspapers in our great cities. papers could see no good in this country, and their comparisons were always to the detriment of Australia and to the advantage of Great Britain. But lately, since the advent of a Labour Government in Great Britain, these journals have been a, little chastened, and, no doubt before long, they will be prepared to admit that good can come out of Nazareth. I am quite certain that this country is becoming more and more determined every year to assert and express its nationality. That assertion to-day is not only compatible with a loyal determination* to remain in that glorious partnership of nations that make up the British Commonwealth, but declares the only way in which the Commonwealth can endure. I hope the Government will see its way clear to have thesecruisers constructed in Australia. for Defence) [11.48 a.m.] -The honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) is at a disadvantage in being unfamiliar with the history of this matter, and the action taken by Parliament. He asked whether these cruisers were necessary for the safety of Australia, and whether all advice that could be obtained in that regard had been' obtained. We have received advice not only from the British Admiralty, but also from the Council of Defencei n Great Britain, that the cruisers are necessary and that they should be of the 10,000-ton type. I shall not now detail the reasons for that advice; the committee has already had that information. The question of time comes in to the extent that the Melbourne and the Sydney are practically obsolete, but, by the carrying out of extensive repairs, they have been made serviceable for another two or two and a half, or. at the most, three years. The Sydney will probably be quite obsolete in two years, and the Melbourne in about two and a half years, when they will not be worth spending any more money on. The necessity for replacing these two cruisers at the same time created the difficulty about where the ships should be built. The Government felt it undesirable to have two shipbuilding yards in Australia, one at Walsh Island and the other at Cockatoo, each building one of these cruisers. That would have meant organizing two .staffs when thereappeared to be no possibility, after the one cruiser had been built, of keepU n t i l recently, those newsing both of them together. Consequently, after a very f u l l discussion, the House decided that one of the cruisers should be ordered in England. Then arose the question of where the other should be built, and before any order was given the Government used every means available to ascertain the probable cost of building one of the cruisers in Australia. The Government was to some extent at a loss, because, since the making of the Washington Treaty, constant changes have been made in the designs of the cruisers. The cruisers mentioned by the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Biley) were of 9,700 tons, and were as near the 10,000ton l i m it as possible. A f t e r the Washington Treaty had been signed, the different nations tried to design for the greatest possible striking power and the highest attainable speed within the limits of 10,000 tons. The armament was changed from time to time, and the horse-power of the engines was constantly increased. The Government had great difficulty in ascertaining the probable cost of building one of the cruisers here. There was then no possibility of getting plans and specifications, because designs were in a state of flux. It is only quite recently that the plans and specifications haye been sufficiently advanced to enable reasonably accurate estimates to be made. When the Government got into that position it asked the Shipping Board and the Naval"" Board to estimate from the information available the cost of the cruisers. The basis of the calculations was the figure of Â£1,900,000 given to the Prime Minister when he was in England as the cost of building a vessel in England, but even on that basis the estimates were very divergent. It was thought undesirable to proceed further unti l a more definite price had been ascertained. The suggestion was made that a representative of the Naval Board, a representative of the Shipping Board, and Sir John Monash should meet together and t r y to form an opinion of the approximate cost. When they met it was found that the two parties",111,Honourable Members Hear Hear
238,Mr Bowden (Parramatta,"Ministe rthat furnished the estimates adhered to their statements, arid that the Shipping Board had carried the matter farther than it had done previously by trying to visualize the vessel. On that basis the Shipping Board made a detailed estimate, and supplied specifications, setting out what it thought would be included it i the estimate, and what the ship would cost if built in that way. The estimates were very carefully prepared. Board's estimate was not prepared in the same way. MrE . RILEY -The Naval Board jumped to conclusions. It s estimates were haphazard. hazard, but were based on the estimate of the cost in England. The board made inquiries, and prepared careful estimates of the additional cost of the materials and labour in Australia. out that estimate. several factors that have to be taken into consideration. Sir John Monash spoke of his own experience, but the material that the Victorian Electricity Commission, of which he is the chairman, has imported, is in a very different class from the machines, auxiliary engines, and electrical equipment required for the cruisers. The Naval Board estimate included not only cost of freight, but took into consideration the total increased costs of material in England and Australia, including the costs of packing, & c , in England, and the additional cost of Australian material. I am not defending the estimate of the Naval Board; I am not able to say whether it is correct. I am -merely tryin g to state exactly what happened. The board estimated that the additional cost of labour in Australia would be 2.25 per cent., and Sir John Monash estimated that it would be 2 .04 per cent. 1 The percentage of 2.25 was used in the calculations made for the contract obtained by a large firm carrying out an important contract in New South Wales. The Naval Board has not at any time expressed an opinion whether these cruisers should be buil t in Australia, and it is not a fair representation of the facts to say that it has. The board was asked for an estimate of the cost of building the cruisers. freights. did not time alone can prove. It is worthy of note that subsequently the amended estimate of the Shipping Board amounted to practically the same figure as the original estimate of the Naval Boardy but when the amended estimate of the Shipping Board was put in the Naval Board amended its estimate also. Sir John Monash found himself in the same diffiThe Naval culty as the Ministry was in . I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to two paragraphs in his report, in which he speaks of the difficulty of making the estimate. Because an agreement could not be obtained between the. three parties, Sir John Monash submitted a report based upon the statements of both sides. In it he saidI desire to preface my remarks with an expression of opinion that it is a most difficult,, if not entirely impossible, task to formulate, at the present stage, and with the meagre information yet available, a thoroughly reliableestimate, in. the sense desired. This arises in no degree from any lack of capacity on the part of the several authorities who have attempted to prepare such an estimate, but entirely because of the absence of reliable information as to the number of fundamental characteristics of the design of a modern cruiser. Then he pointed out that the Washington treaty profoundly affected those characteristics, and later saidMy conclusion from these considerations is that no estimate, however skilfully and carefully, prepared, can be regarded as absolutely reliable in the sense which you desire. The report then went on to point out the changes that had been made in regard to armament and machinery. The honourable member for Dalley referred to an armament ring. But even if there be such a ring the question of relative costs is not affected thereby, because whether the ships be built in England or in Australia, the armament w ill have to be purchased from the same people. The honourable member also quoted an extract from an English Sunday paper, and upon that evidence declared that it was doubtful whether the Government, intended to call for tenders at all, notwithstanding the assurance by the Prime Minister that the Cabinet hasdecided to do so. in order that the Government may get into recess, and then place an order in Great Britain.

I would remind honourable members that there are two other things that are urgently necessary for the naval defence of Australia, namely, a seaplane carrier and a dock large enough to accommodate any vessel of the Royal Navy that may visit our coast. Government must consider whether the building of a seaplane carrier and a dock would give employment to the same number of men as would the construction of a cruiser, and whether those conveniences could be obtained for the same amount of money as would be saved in building both cruisers in GreatB r it a in . If , with a stated sum, we could buy still have enough money lef t to build the seaplane carrier and the dock, such a policy must receive consideration. Government has come to no determination to build the second cruiser abroad. H o w did that English Its only desire is to ascertain the facts as to the cost of local construction, and Goodness knows to give other shipbuilding yards besides Cockatoo an opportunity to tender for the vessel if they so desire. An application has been received from the Walsh Island shipyards to bo given a chance to tender for the construction of a cruiser, and it should be allowed to do so if Cockatoo Island is afforded, that opportunity. The Government has wisely and logically decided that it will ascertain what the cost is likely to be before it enters into a contract for the construction of a ship in Australia. The suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley that the work should be carried out locally regardless of cost could not be adopted by any governI t --was held up for a ment. I have been for 30 hours on deck, I shall not speak for long. In the course of this discussion there has been some reference to universal history, national prestige, the sentiment of a people, and the relative capacity of Australian and other workers.

I will not discuss the details of these cruiser construction proposals; they have been clearly set out by the honourable a shipping dinner in member for Dalley. I can quite understand the diversity of opinion amongst experts studying from different angles theprobable cost of these vessels and the Our flag flies on problem of whether they should be built in Great Britain or Australia. Upon such complicated questions there might be an honest conflict of opinion. I can understand that even experts might differ as to the relative productivity of labour in two than countries. A man thinking of the dockyards and huge shipbuilding establishments on the Clyde River, in Scotland,, We hear a lot of talk about might wonder how the comparatively small, plants of the kind in Australia, could successfully compete with them sentii n economic production. One would naturally think that the greater mobilization and organization of labour in Great Britain and their long experience would give her naval contractors a great advantage over Australian contractors. But if you feed human beings, and i m prove their conditions, you develop not only their bodies, but their minds, too, Before the war, the Peninand you increase the value of their labour. If you take men from the Clyde and bring had them to Australia, they develop greater productive capacity in the more congenial, surroundings.

The freight to England on meat, butter, And so rapidly has and meat carried in refrigerators is from Â£1 4 to Â£ 1 7 a ton. The average freight on general cargo from Great Britain to Australia is about Â£ 5 a ton. The freight on iron and steel products is from 70s. to but by the 140s. a ton. Where the British manufacturer is in competition with the Australian manufacturer in no case does the freight on the goods exceed 140s. a ton. Yet the So much for nationality and the Naval Board had the audacity to tell this sentiment. Parliament that it would cost an average -of Â£ 1 7 a ton to ship British raw material out here for the building of a cruiser in Australia. Surely we are not so stupid and ignorant as to believe that. HadI been the Minister, I would have said to the official responsible for such an estimate, "" Do you take me for a fool that you put such an absurd statement before me?"" If Great Britain is paid Â£2,000,000 or Â£3,000,000 for a cruiser, we send that amount not in money, but in products, and these are used to feed the workers there. But although we believe in international brotherhood, we cannot support this ideal at the expense of our own people. We must first of all build up our own industries, and extend the hand of fraternity to our own poor and destitute. whether men should be engaged on the work either here or in Great Britain. If we have to choose between those alternatives, we say let them be engaged here. If these instruments of war are built here, whether it be a good or a bad thing to build them, they will at least be built under conditions congenial to the sentiments of our people, and their construction will help to develop the nation. There is no article that our workers consume that cannot be made in Australia. If the two cruisers are built in Australia, we shall stimulate the iron and steel industry, which is essential to the existence of a nation. In Australia these cruisers would be built by highly paid, well equipped, well-clothed and well-housed workmen, but in Great Britain they would be built by poor, miserable, impoverished men We or because of the degradation of the workmen, black, brown, yellow, or white, engaged in the mailing of it . Regardless of party feeling our aim is to develop our own industries, and if we do that the population will naturally increase, and Australia will become a great nation. But, although we are determined that these cruisers shall be built in Australia, we look forward to the time when, instead of building instruments of destruction, we shall apply our efforts to the increasing of means of production, to providing better homes and better living conditions for our people. Although we must adapt our ideals and sentiments to the particular environment in which we find ourselves, we live in the belief that with greater educational facilities and wider knowledge, we shall soon have a community living in comfort and contentment. A l though the Naval Board may jeer and gibe at the Labour party, the time w ill come when it will have to adapt its policy to the sentiment and ideals of the people we represent, and must recognize what this party stands for. In tlie blackest hour, when we were defeated and disappointed we were told that the sun of labour would never rise again, but it is rising again, and rising fast. The Labour party is in power in five states of the Commonwealth. Those controlling the Naval Board must remember that when the Labour party gains office it will have The question may be asked to conduct the naval branch efficiently, and frame its policy not in accordance with British ideas, but in accordance with of constructing cruisers, the sentiments of the people of Australia, and the ideas and conceptions of this party. The speech of the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) this morning has justified that attitude that has throughout beeu adopted by .members on this side of the chamber respecting the building of thc two cruisers. We have stated that if they are to be built they should be built in Australia. The Government has evidently determined that they shall be built, and the Shipping Board and the Navy Board were asked to submit estimates for the cost of these cruisers if built here. No employer of labour carrying out constructive work would submit tenders amounting to Â£2,000,000 or Â£3,000,000, without having before him the specifications and working under high pressure. plans of the work proposed toi be carried do not want a man of war out. The Government denied, for a conanything else that is cheap siderable time, that information was beiug hidden from honourable members. The Prime Minister stated that he had been requested by the British Government to give it an order for one cruiser to provide work for the British unemployed, and this he refused to do. Although he made that statement, he told the public of this country that the Government had determined to build one cruiser in England irrespective of whether it could be built here or not. If Australia can build one cruiser, she can build two. The Prime Minister told us that the Government proposed to place an order-for one cruiser in Great Britain, but that there was a prospect of building the other cruiser in Australia. But, as has been pointed out by",114,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Australian firms will not be given an opportunity to build one of these cruisers. The Government is not only unpatriotic, but anti-Australian. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has shown the difference in the treatment meted out to the artisans and seamen of Great Britain in time of peace and in time of war. In peace-time, British ships are very often in charge of a British captain, the rest of the crew being of other nationalities. were form anywhere I must -say for other nations, to some of whom we have been opposed, that whilst their Governments demand patriotic conduct from their people in time of war, they are themselves patriotic in their regard for their people in times of peace. If one goes aboard a foreign ship he will not find Britishers on it, but the people of the nation to which it belongs. Government said that it waa useless to talk at random, and that it could not give an estimate of the cost of the cruisers until it knew the facts from the official standpoint. It was informed by the managers of the ""Walsh Island Dockyard prior to this that there was no data available upon which to found a reliable estimate. practical man would risk his reputation by saying what it would cost to build a modern warship unless he had before him complete specifications of material and equipment considered necessary. number of capital ships which a nation is permitted to build has been reduced as a result of the Washington Conference, and this has led to the nations building 10,000-to.n cruisers with as much of the armament equipment and speed of the battleship as they can put into them. When the Minister for Defence told us that he had an estimate of Â£1,900,000 for the building of a modern vessel of this description he showed that he did not know anything of the matter, or that he had been misled by those who advised Mr Watkinn him. A reference to the Naval Gazettewill show that the estimate to which the honourable gentleman referred was for a vessel of the old Raleigh class, which canOne order has already been not in any way be compared with the -cruisers that are being built to-day. We. are determined to defend Australia, but when we ask our men to fight in its defence we say that they should be given the employment provided by the manufacture of the weapons of war with which they will be equipped. The policy of the Government is to buy abroad our ships of war, our guns, and the shells to be fired by them. The Government professes to desire to build up the sentiment of nationality whilst, we are 16,000 miles away from the source of supply of In war-time, the crews the materials we require for defence. So wholly British. That cheap far as the capability of our artisans to of patriotism does not exist build ships is concerned, although. such else in the world. comparisons are objectionable, we say that our artisans Compare more than favourably 'with those of any other part of the Empire. It is the opinion of employers-and , amongst them, of one who is not an Australianthat our workmen are pre-eminent in any employment they take up. The Government causes the words ""Buy AusThe tralian Goods"" to be stamped on every envelope sent through the post, and no doubt the Prime Minister, when he opens the Manufacturers' Exhibition, will tell those present what a good thing it is to establish manufacturing industries to give employment to the people. Yet, when it is a question of spending the people's No money on the construction of cruisers, he gives the work of building one to the shipbuilders of Britain, and imposes conditions for the building of the second such as render it impossible for Australian The shipbuilders to tender for it successfully. The Government has broken the pledges it gave to the people at the last election. It was returned as a Nationalist Government in favour of protecting the industries of this country. Yet its policy has been to damn everything Australian and to buy all it could outside this country. The people will take notice of what it has done. We are prepared to do our part in the defence of the country. We should know the best and most economical way to do so, and we have a right to demand that patriotism shall guide ua in times of peace, as well as in war. A -contented people are best fitted to defend tbeir country. Discontented nations are beaten by numerically weaker, but contented people. The nations that have survived against odds have been those whose governments have fostered love for their country by the care taken of its citizens. to deal with this question oratorically I could, I suppose, work myself up to phrases both perfervid and acrimonious. member think that he could emulate the honourable member for Bourke( Mr sible.

We have heard a great many eloquent expressions this morning, but it has appeared to me that few of them have really gone to the heart of the matter. There is a tendency in this Chamber, in dealing with questions of this sort, to consider that they are answered by general phrases and wide generalizations that do not get down to hard facts. I have been rather surprised at the way in which the question has been handled this morning, because it would appear from the attack which has been made that the Government has already decided that the second cruiser is not to be built in Australia. cided not to build the first in Australia. sion of a majority of the members of this House. rather have the honourable member's pity than his approval. The House has already decided that one of the cruisers shall be built in Britain, but it would appear from the debate that the Government had decided to build the second cruiser in Britain also The true position is that the Government refuses to come to a decision upon the matter until it is in possession of definite data. would appear that it is expected by the -Opposition to give an order for a cruiser to be built in Australia-in fact, honourable members opposite have said so-re gardless of what it may cost, and without knowing what it will cost. I have been somewhat surprised at the adoption of this attitude by honourable members opposite, because, if there is one principle which the' Opposition frequently enunciates, it is that war is a wicked waste, and that all expenditure on warlike preparations is uneconomical, unnecessary, . and -Wer e I disastrous. When some expenditure on preparations for war has been decided on one would have thought that the Opposition would have endeavoured to provide that that wasteful and uneconomical expenditure should be as little as posdecided that something must be spent on the very undesirable purpose of preparing for war, members of the Opposition say, ""Although we consider all such expenditure wasteful and wicked, we should make this preparation regardless of cost, and without even knowing what it will amount to."" Could anything be more illogical or unreasonable? How can men profess to absolutely disapprove of this kind of expenditure, and at the same time recommend that it should be undertaken regardless of any limitation ? There are very good grounds for the Government hesitating to comply with the request of the Opposition. I take this opportunity to read some figures, so that honourable members may understand what it would mean to have these cruisers constructed in Australia. These figures apply to ships actually built here, and have been supplied to me by the Defence Department. Some ships have already been built in Australia for the Royal Australian Navy, namely, the destroyers the Torrens, the Swan, and the Huon, and two light cruisers, the Brisbane and the Adelaide. The estimated price for building similar vessels in England was, in the case of the light cruisers, Â£450,000; and for the destroyers, Â£80,000. The actual cost of these vessels built in Australia wasTorrens, Â£158,600, or Â£78,600 over the estimate; . Swan, Â£160,900, or Â£80,900 over the estimate; Huon, Â£148,300, or Â£68,300 over the It estimate; Brisbane, Â£746,600, or Â£346,600 over the estimate; Adelaide, Â£1,271,700, or Â£821,700 over the estimate.",116,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Those longer periods are of great importance from more points of view than one. the time, as there was no war on then. the extraordinary view of the position held by the honourable member. Possibly, the workmen went specially slow because there was no war on. loses no opportunity to malign the Australian workmen. money expended on the construction of the vessels lay absolutely idle, bearing a high rate of interest. Possibly, the worse feature of the case is that, because of the long time taken in their construction, the effective life of the vessels was considerably reduced. By the time that they were launched they were, to a certain extent, obsolete, and had before them a shorter period of effective life than should have been the case. If figures like that are to be ignored, I maintain that this Parliament is lacking in its duty to the people of Australia. It is very easy for honourable members to say that I am maligning the Australian workmen, and that I am an anti-Australian because of my attitude in regard to this matter; but I entirely repudiate such charges. ""We hear a great deal about the men who will be paid the wages if the vessels are constructed in Australia, but very little about the people who will have to pay them. I consider that it is my duty to defend the people who pay the wages. It tations to have these vessels constructed in Australia have been made by all sections of the community. That is a very difficult thing to prove. It certainly has not been proved up to the present. I tion which waited upon the Lord Mayor of Sydney recently to urge that these ships should be constructed here. It consisted of representatives of a number of bodies whose importance and authority were not such as was indicated by their names. Some of those bodies represented very close groups of special interests, groups of interest which honourable members opposite have combined to malign in this House, but which, on this occasion, they regard as important sections of the community. Many of the representations made were prompted by the self-interest of those making them. It is the duty of honourable members of this committee, so far as they can do so, to protect the public from exploitation by any section of the community that desires to take advantage of their position. I do not malign-and I refuse to be represented as maligningthe ability of the Australian workmen; but we have heard so much about giving the workmen a chance that I consider it is time that we thought of the interests of the general taxpayer. An important portion of Sir John Monash's report has not been referred to in this debate. I therefore propose to read it. It was suggested by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) that that report indicated that the ships should be built here. My reading of that report is very different. I shall read the last paragraph of it : The aspect to which I desire to draw your attention is' that this Â£1,000,000 would he permanently withdrawn from the whole population of tlie Commonwealtli, for the immediate, but very temporary, .benefit of a negligible percentage of its population; whereas if this large sum could be saved by the outright purchase of this cruiser from a British ship-building firm, it could be made available, in its entirety, for the immediate benefit of the same industrial class, for reproductive works from which the whole of the people could .permanently benefit; or, alternatively, could otherwise be usefully employed for defence purposes. that report, went outside the terms of his appointment. not, his report has been quoted to show that he was in favour of the vessels being built here, but the paragraph that I have read does not suggest that.

268,Has Been Said That Represen,"Mr MANN -Whethe r that was so ora matter of this nature, honourable members must form their own opinion, and make their own judgments. I am not quoting Sir John Monash's report because I have no opinion of my own to express, but I have quoted it to show that the tenor of that report was misrepresented this morning. One other statement has been made to which I feel that a reply should be given. It has been said that if it is considered necessary to build these ships hi England, because they could be obtained more cheaply than in Australia, they might as well be constructed in Japan. That is a ridiculous argument, as a moment's reflection will show. We would not reveal to a possible enemy the details of the means of defence on which we should have to rely in case of war. It is unfortunate that one side of the case was presented to the House this morning by the Minister only. I am sure that the opinions which have so far been raised do sent the opinion of the majority in this chamber, or of the people of Australia as a whole. Many of our people believe that defence is necessary; but, because of the present economic conditions, they feci that they cannot do much at this juncture. They consider, however, that what is done should be done on sound lines. There are many who feel that the problems Ave noAv have to face are evidence that, in the past, Ave have not always proceeded along sound Hues. In stead of constantly resorting to declarations of our superiority and supremacy, and taking up the attitude that no one can teach us anything, we should do well to examine the past to ascertain whether we have been proceeding along right lines, and Avhether it might not be better for us to alter our methods, and, perhaps, retrace our steps in some directions. Most people are surprised to know that so great a difference exists between the estimated cost of constructing the cruisers here and in England. I should much prefer to see the ships built here, but because of the system which Ave have built up it ie impossible to do that. We are UOAV faced with the consequences of our past actions. Instead of saying that the vessels must be built here at any cost, we should examine our past conduct to see Avhetheri t has not been responsible for many of our present troubles. The time may yet come when those Avho today indulge in the cheap gibes of antiAustralians and little Australians concerning those who try to guide public opinion aright, will realize that we were the better Australians and the truer patriots. Sitting suspended from 1.8 to 2.15 p.m. Mr W. M. HUGHES I desire to make a personal explanation. The other day, when an item relating to exenemy ships was being considered, I addressed the committee and subsubsequently left the chamber. I understand that after I had left a division Avas taken. In one at least of the newspapers of this city-and , I presume, in others-som e comment Avas made on the fact that I did not vote in the division which was taken on the item, and it was asserted in one newsnot reprepaper, at any rate, that I deliberately refrained from voting because I was apprehensive of the consequences of taking part in the division. There is no truth whatever in the assertion. When the item Avas called on, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) moved an amendment. The item, was delayed by a discussion that arose on other items in the votes for the same department. I had an appointment to keep at 5 o'clock, and I notified the honourable member for Yarra that unless the subject was called on soon I sliould have to leave without speaking. The item was called on about twenty minutes past five, and I spoke, and then left to go to a medical man. As I told the honourable member for Yarra that I should not be back until after the dinner adjournment, I assumed that a division would not be taken until after my return. I Avas not informed AvhenI came back that there had been a division, although I knew,of course, that the discussion had terminated. I did not see the reference to my absence until Wednesday,' and I did-not know, even then, what were the numbers in the division. When I left the chamber I felt reasonably certain that' a division Avould not take place. I regret that I was not here to vote, and I now desire to state that had I been here I should have voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra. I cannot discuss the building of the cruisers w i th any enthusiasm. I deeply regret that the Government has decided to proceed w i th the building of them, because two honourable members of this Parliament are attending the Assembly ef the League of Nations at Geneva, and are participating in the carrying of resolutions in favour of international arbitration and the holding of another disarmament conference. It is to be earnestly hoped that the result of the meeting of the League will be a better understanding slackening in the race for armaments. Australia is a member of the League of Nations, and one of the principal objects of the League is to end that.

The Labour party opposed the proposal and advocated "" an Australian Navy, built in Australia and manned by Australians, and paid for with Australian money."" Por that we were stigmatized as disloyal and opposed to the Empire, but our policy was endorsed by the people, and we were returned at the general elections of 1910, with the largest party ever returned to support a Commonwealth Government. sent Government is reversing Labour's policy, and to be logical it should man the new ""ships when they are built with men from abroad and purchase their o i l ' and coal in the cheapest foreign markets. I hope that the Government w ill reconsider its decision, or at least give the committee some assurance that both cruisers will not be buil t outside Australia. much has been said on this important subject that a statement is due from me regarding my attitude towards defence. I do not pose as a naval or military expert, and certainly not as a strategist. I have been a member of this House for twenty months, and have not yet been able to learn how to be of service to my constituents or the Commonwealth; so my strategy counts for nothing. We have heard a great deal about pacifism. I claim to be a pacifist as far as I dare. After what I have seen of the grief and misery caused by war I would be an inhuman, monster if I were not prepared to makealmost any sacrifice for the sake of peace. Throughout my life the principle of tolerance has been inculcated into my mind. In my youth a man whom I dearly loved policy ? Industries would said to me, "" You are too intolerant and we should be troubled impulsive, and too ready to resent what unemployment, and the proyou consider a wrong. You should study and practice patience and tolerance. Never be the cause of a fight, and doeverything possible to keep out of one. You may be called a coward, but tolerate Such conditions breed bolshevism even that. But there may come a day The way to make when thÂ© honour of yourself and those you love is at stake; then fight with all your might. In brief, never fight if you A saving of Â£1,000,000 can help it , but if you have to fight never yield until you cannot help it . "" I followed that advice, and it sometimes brought me some terrible drubbings. Some honourable members have said that human nature does not change; others say that it is always changing for the better. Tha trouble is that human nature changes too much and too quickly. An honourable member may be a pacifist to-day, but events may so shape themselves that to-morrow he will be no longer a pacifist, and want to fight almost anybody. OftenI have started out in the morning chock f u l l of good intentions, and have felt peaceably inclined towards everybody and everything, and have returned home with a cartload of The prebroken resolutions, and a feeling of bitterness towards everybody. I have entered this House believing that everybody was my friend, and that I could not have an uncharitable thought towards any honourable member, and I have left the chamber in the same afternoon feeling as hitter as gall. It is idle to say that human nature does not change. The biggest drubbing in my -S o lif e I received at the hands of a pacifist; at least, he said he was a pacifist, and I believed him. The man who cheated me worse in a deal was a socialist. In that instance, too, my credulity betrayed me. And the greatest rogue I ever met in business was a perverted professor of Christianity.

We should all try to be sincere and genuine. Every man in this House may be a pacifist, but let us be honest with ourselves. I was born in Australia, and have never been out of it; no man is prouder of this country than I am. habit of saying, "" This is our glorious heritage. Who dare impugn our rights?"" Australia is our heritage as long as we are worthy of it, and people it, and are prepared to defend it. But let us drop cant and hypocrisy, and realize hoiv we became possessed of the continent. Thank God, our forefathers, who made the country fit for our occupation, were real pioneers and honest workers. They came to Australia, and said, "" This is a glorious country that is worth having. It has abundant resources, a beautiful climate, and everything that God could bestow. Yet it is peopled by only a few nomadic blacks."" So they took possession of the land and peopled it. We are very glad they did, because the aborigines were not effectively occupying it, could not defend it, and consequently had no right to it. In that our forefathers were right. But suppose that in the future some Mohammedan or Confucian or Buddhist leader were to say to his people, _ Go you, and take Australia. is occupied by a mere handful of people who are always quarrelling amongst themselves, and have made no preparations for its defence. glorious land. We want room for our people. _ Take it from them. They will not resist very much, because they are divided amongst themselves, and are not able to defend their possessions."" I will support any effective measures for the defence of our glorious country. I would not vote with any Government for a policy of aggression. I would say, as the adviser of my youth said to me, ""Never cause a fight. Do all you can to avoid trouble, but be ready to defend yourself if you are attacked."" In regard to the vexed question as to where the new cruisers should be built, I am not a free trader. I desire to be a fair trader, but fiscal considerations do not apply to this matter. The money with which the cruisers are to be built has been taken from the nocA/r. Watson. e kets of our own people. I am glad it has not been borrowed. The cruisers , should be built in Australia, if the conditions are at all reasonable. Sir John Monash has, in his report, estimated the overhead charge at Â£600,000. I cannot understand how that total is made up; it seems to be altogether too large. Let us encourage thrift and self-reliance amongst But we have an unfortunate our people. Those who would get a big "" cut"" out of the local construction of the cruisers should be more reasonable and agree to do the work more cheaply. It is not the workmen alone who takes down his country. Sometimes the workers say, "" The bosses are getting a big cut out of this business, and there is no reason why we should kill ourselves with overwork."" Then both employer and employee are at fault, and the country suffers. I believe that if the controllers of industry would be reasonable and tolerant they could induce the men to unite in demonstrating that Australia can build ships at a reasonable price. We cannot expect to build them as cheaply as they are built in England. A great deal of the material for ship construction must be imported, and our shipyards are not as advanced as are those of older countries. But there may come a time when we shall have to depend upon our own resources. Therefore, if we can possibly build our own warships, let us do so, unless the cost would be altogether excessive. ItI f it were proved that our workers would go slow on their job, regardless of .the expenditure incurred by Australia, I should vote against the construction of It is a the cruisers here. I myself have never known this to happen. Very often workmen do not work to the utmost of their capacity because those in charge of them are greedy and avaricious. It is all. very well for a man to say that the workers go slow, but he is not always in a position to judge fairly"". Let me give a case in point. In the heat of a summer's day I was standing in Spring-street under the shade of a building. I was talking to a friend, and I looked across the road and saw three old men who were using long-handled shovels in repairing the road. I have been a navvy, and have done that kind of work, and know what it means. I was thinking what an awful pity it was for those men to be working there in the heat of the sun, and I said to my friend that it was not fair, as younger men should be doing it . conditions I was surprised at the quickness with which they worked. I am a strong man myself, but in that heat I should not have enjoyed working eight hours a day on that job. I thought it was a pity that our civilization could not evolve some more equitable system. Then along came a couple of young fellows dressed to k ill , cne of them particularly so. He wore spats, had a diamond ring on his finger, and a diamond in his tie-pin. ing stick in the orthodox fashion. They stood alongside of me and commenced talking. "" Charles, you have here an illustration of this notorious go-slow policy which is so prevalent in Australia. doubt these men receive 12s. 8d. or 13s. 4d. a day, an impossible wage for such a menial service. They are not even trying to earn it . How can a country progress under such conditions? "" This young man may have been a most valuable citizen, and worth to the country a great many like me, but he was an unfair critic, because he could not get the other man's view-point. I do not blame him for making those remarks, as he evidently did not see things in the right focus. He did not know what it was to stand iu the boiling sun for eight hours using a long-handled shovel. I did not insult him, but walked away. Honourable members there have an illustration of what often happens. ""We at the top very often want too much for our service, and we expect too much from those at the bottom. We should t r y to be human, aud to obtain a truer focus in order to see the other man's case properly. If we did that, then these cruisers would not cost too much. It is easy for a man getting Â£2,000 a year to say that his employees are not doing their duty. I do not say anything derogatory about any one, but we should set our employees an example by using all our energies in the work we undertake. reasons for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) were ably stated by him, and forcibly supported by other honourable members on this side. I also support it . If we are to build cruisers, they should be constructed in Australia. It is truly foolish that honourable members should not hp unanimous on this point, but the [172] Under the trying position is that the Government and this party are at daggers drawn on the question of supporting Australian industries. Although, in the opinion of many, it may be idle to talk of the peace of the world when the world is at war, and although it may be deemed foolish to talk of disarmament when other nations are arming, I believe that Australia is in accord with other countries in thinking that, if possible, peace should be brought about. We have now a unique opportunity to He carried a walkincrease the fame of Australia by striking a note for universal peace in accord with that struck elsewhere in the world. One said to the other, The Government should let it be known to our representatives at the Geneva Conference and to the world at large, No that we are staying our hands in the construction of instruments of war, the expenditure of money on war-like preparations, the extension of hours of training, and the building of war-ships, and that.we, at the outposts of the civilized world, are making a gesture of peace. I commend the Government for one thing it has done this, session. It has sent representatives of both sides of the House to represent Australia at Geneva. This is the first time that such an action has been taken. And it is not too late at this juncture to pursue a line of conduct that, even if it does nothing else, will encourage the Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), who are representing us at the Assembly of the League of Nations. This should be done even if only for the encouragement of the delegates from the small nations of Europe and other parts of the world, so that they may realize that Australia, although small in numbers but vast in possessions, a country that has led the van in the progressive lfjjislition of the world, takes its stand for disarmament. If we stayed our hand in building instruments of"" destruction, it would be a fitting recognition of the splendid decisions that have already been arrived at at Geneva. They are leading to something that, will be unique in the history of the world. If we increase our defence expenditure and do not accelerate disarmament, we shall be treating that conference and its decisions with contempt, declaring to the rest of the world that we have no faith in them.

I now desire, sir, to briefly ask your ruling upon it . In connection with the payment of Â£137^000 to Bawra, which, I take it , is a g if t to the company, I point out that in a list of names of share-holders of BawraI find those of the following members of this House:-The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes), the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), the honourable memberf o r Calare( Sir Neville Howse), the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), the honourable member for Darwin( MrW h it s it t ) , the honourable member for Brisbane( MrD .

Order 296 has a direct bearingon this matter-. No member shall be entitled to vote in any division upon a question in which he has a direct pecuniary interest, not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown, and a voteof any member -so interested shall be disallowed, but this shall not apply to. motions, or public bills which involve questions of public policy. I claim-, that under that standing order no other interpretation canbe placed; upon this payment, than that it is a direct g if t toa public company, thab every shareholder inthat company will benefit from the distribution of that g if t , and that pecuniary interest in that g if t , a pecuniary interest. not> held in common with, the rest of ' the subjects? of the Crown-. On a previous occasion -a motion by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) was submitted, in connection with the vote of the honorThe Chairman of Committees able: member for Riverina( Mr Killesn), which challenged his right to vote on the question of the remissionof taxation on Crown leaseholds.. Having gone through your ruling on t h a t occasion, the interpretationthat I placeupon it' might as well. be. stated here. I gathered from your, ruling on that occasion that ^occasion, but participated in the debate,at the request of the House. drew a distinction when you spoke, in pointing out that the interest of the honourable member for Riverina was one which was held in. common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown. I should say that, strictly interpreted, that opinion would hold good, because a question of taxation would be a matter in which the honorable member for Riverina, and other honourable members, as well as people outside, would be similarly interested. The case in connection with this company is an entirely different matter. I have referred to the payment as a g if t .

283,Mr Speaker,"Order! I remindvote when the question of the payment of the eum of Â£137,000 to a company in which they had a direct pecuniary interest was before the committee. not feeling disposed to give a ruling upon it , directed me to submit the question to you for a ruling. Standing Order 296 applies in this case. Por my part, I cannot see that it is possible to place any other interpretation upon it than that these members come directly under the heading of persons who have "" a direct pecuniary interest, not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown."" They were interested in this company in a way in which other members of the community were not, and I consider that their vote should not have been allowed. In any case, I think that they should not have voted. That opinion is shared by honourable members on this side of the House. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) admitted that he was a shareholder of the company, as did also the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson). members, and honourable members generally, will be glad to know exactly where honourable members stand in a matter of this kind. ruling. sonal explanation. sonal explanation u n t i l the point of order has been disposed of. have been a shareholder of this company, and do not know where the honourable member obtained the information that I was a shareholder. ber for Hume has stated a question of order, and asks me to rule upon it . He has made reference to a case that was dealt with in this Housei n the early part of this session, that is, on the 23rd August of last year. He does not claim that that case is similar, but he claims that it may illustrate the point in which the House is interested. member was in error, I take leave to suggest to him, in saying that I ruled on that occasion; I was careful to follow the ancient practice, and not to rule but, with the concurrence of the House, I was permitted to participate from the chair in the debate. Expressing no definite view-agai n following the Speaker's tradition in all British ParliamentsI gave the House the benefit of whatever research I had been able to make into the history of such matters during the The Chairman of Committees, preceding day or two. I then endeavoured to show that questions of this kind have a very long, interesting and I submit that important history. But the one thing I tried to make plain on that occasion was that it has never been regarded as the right, privilege, or power of the presiding officer-whethe r the Chairman of Committees or the Speakeri n open House --to rule on and decide such matters as this. The British House of Commons, and many of our Australasian Parliaments, have decided, since the inauguration of such questions, to hold the decision of them in their own hands, for reasons which will be obvious to honourable members on reflection. It should not be competent for a Speaker, with or without party bias, to disqualify or disallow the votes of one, two, or more members in any particular division, and the Houses of British Parliaments have jealously held the right to determine whether a vote Those honourable should be allowed or disallowed when challenged in the proper way. The immemorial practice is that such questions become questions of privilege, and not I , therefore, ask for your of order. A question of privilege, as honourable members know-althoug h they will not, I am sure, object to the. j e 4 minder-mus t be dealt with on a subI cannot hear a perstantive motion by the honourable member who raises it . t If honourable members w ill , in their leisure during the week-end, read the observations 1 was permitted to make some thirteen months ago, they will see all those principles laid down, and I suggest for the consideration of those interested in this matter, that if it be deemed important, the House might be prepared at some suitable occasion before we separate, to entertain, as a matter of privilege, the question raised on a substantive motion in respect of this particular matter. sonal explanation. I .was not in the The honourable chamber when the point of order was raised. I am neither directly nor in directly pecuniarily interested in Bawra to the slightest degree. I was one of the original shareholders, but disposed of the wholp of my interest. Speaking from rnnrn'ifv. T believe that took place over three years ago.
