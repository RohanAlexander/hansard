Monday, 18 June 2012 Mobile Phone Towers example of how the Bonner local community came together, with bipartisan help from all levels of government, to achieve a balanced outcome for all stakeholders. In late 2011, Optus proposed a new mobile phone tower right next to Guardian Angels Primary School in Wynnum. After some concerned parents looked into the tower's location, they came to the view that, to be on the safe side, an action group should be formed. The action group was called No Tower Near Guardian Angels. Community engagement on the project revealed that the local community overwhelmingly opposed the tower. This was evidenced by over 3,500 local signatures on a petition to have a more appropriate location found. From my personal dealings with Optus, I know that they work hard to find the balance between community concerns and demand for increased mobile coverage-never an easy balance to achieve. Thankfully, in this case, the balance was achieved. I thank Optus, on behalf of those in the local bayside community who had their say on this issue, for listening to them and, most importantly, for really hearing them. I particularly thank Rowena Gilbertson, Manager of Government Affairs at Optus, for her sensitivity and professionalism in dealing with this matter. I also acknowledge Natalie Von Hoff, Nathan McNamara, Michelle Evans, Kristy Gilchrist, Raff Foniatti, Kylie Vigen, Sam Johnson, Kellie Sommerville, Paul Caton and Stephen Sherrard-just to name some of the many local heroes who worked hard behind the scenes to achieve this stellar result for the community. I found the group to be very fair and professional. Special mention should also be made of the new state member for Lytton, Neil Symes, and Councillor Peter Cummings for their care and attention to this matter. This result could not have been achieved if the three levels of government had not worked together. I also acknowledge my friend and colleague the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull for his interest in this issue and for his advice and work behind the scenes, as well as Deidre Thomson. I, along with my state and local colleagues, will continue to work constructively with Optus as they investigate other locations to install the proposed communication infrastructure. We acknowledge that we must continue to ensure that balance is found between community interests and Optus's need to deliver better services to the local community and to businesses.

He has been involved with Basketball Country Victoria's IAP program, receiving the athlete of the year award last year. Hayden Gardner this summer competed in the under-18 national youth baseball championships, representing Baseball Victoria. This is the culmination of being selected for Victorian state junior teams for the last five years. That is a great achievement for any sportsman. Angus Wiseman, at 15 years old, is already representing Victoria in junior athletics. In March this year, he went to the Australian Junior Athletics Championships at Homebush in Sydney, at the 2000 Olympics Stadium. Angus's passion is for the triple jump and he hopes to one day represent Australia at that event. He is working a casual job on top of school and athletics to fund his way. I hope that the cheque helps him fund a little bit of the costs involved in competing at the elite level. Jessica Adams has already reached her goal of many years to attend the age championships, as well as qualifying for nine individual events this year in swimming. She was named Swimming Victoria's age champion for 2011 and again in 2012. She holds a Swimming Victoria butterfly record and 23 northern metro records. Jess has also been awarded a Leader Newspapers sports award for her three gold and four silvers at the 2011 championships. At such a young age, she has achieved a lot and this grant is a well-deserved recognition of that. Another Jess, Jessica Tatarskyj, swims with the Epping Aquajets and has been in swimming training and competition since aged seven. Jess's dream is to one day represent Australia in swimming and she knows that realising that dream means a lot of hard work. The recognition and support of the Local Sporting Champions grants acknowledges all those 5 am training starts and the sacrifices that her mum has made towards that goal. Jess gained nine qualifying times across all strokes and distances to be able to attend the Australian Age Championships. She was recently named the Swimming Victoria State Age Champion with six gold, three silver and one bronze medal at the state championships. Jess said that one of her reasons in nominating for a Local Sporting Champions grant was her wish to help mum out with the costs of training and competing. I want to put on the record that when these guys all become Olympic champions that I recognised them first. Midland Information, Debt and Legal Advocacy Service organisation in the community of Midland, the Midland Information, Debt and Legal Advocacy Service, which is more commonly known as MIDLAS. It won the media and promotional category for its outstanding achievement in raising the profile of community services in Western Australia at the Community Services Excellence Awards presented by the Department of Communities in May this year. MIDLAS won the award for its social innovation program. This has seen MIDLAS implement a highly effective social media campaign involving YouTube, Facebook and Twitter for the purposes of raising awareness about the difficulties faced by some of the most disadvantaged families in our communities, distributing relevant and up-to-date information and advocacy options to residents and in forming and building stronger relationships with the wider community.

188,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (10:37,"I rise today to congratulate a local non-governmentservice to the community. They offer six free services to disadvantaged and vulnerable people within our local community. The services provided include a disability services, financial services, tenancy services, legal services, information and referral and emergency relief. I know that they are very successful in offering those services. I constantly hear about the exceptional work that they do for our local residents. My office and I are confident in referring people to MIDLAS as we know that they will provide an excellent service, follow up issues promptly and act with compassion and integrity. This is an incredibly important service for the residents of Hasluck, who have to cope with continually increasing cost-ofliving pressures. They will certainly be hit by the world's biggest carbon tax on 1 July. Currently-and this is taken directly from their website-MIDLAS is now preparing for any repercussions that may arise out of the impending carbon tax. Like most NGOs that provide invaluable support to some of the most in need residents, they find the current grants system difficult to work with and very short sighted. Annual grant requirements and applications take up a lot of their time, time that would be best directed to serving our local community. Every organisation should have the opportunity to serve their local community effectively, no matter what industry they operate in. The government needs to support our community service organisations such as MIDLAS, which will be witnessing first hand the effects of this disastrous carbon tax. The Prime Minister will not meet the people directly affected by her policy. The people who work in this industry, like the staff at most certainly be disadvantaged. I call on this government to support out local community service industries and review the red tape burden imposed on them by the inadequate grants systems. El Dana, Mrs Faten Faten El Dana of Mount Pritchard on receiving the Medal of the Order of Australia as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours List this year. The Medal of the Order of Australia is a traditional and highly significant way of honouring those in our society who provide outstanding and invaluable service to their local communities. Faten is one of those Australians whose service has indeed been worthy of particular recognition and praise. She was nominated by her fellow citizens for her hard work, dedication and exceptional service, particularly to the local Lebanese community. The Lebanese community makes up a significant portion of my electorate, with over 2,100 residents being born in Lebanon and another 4,500 having one or both parents born in Lebanon. For the past 17 years, Faten has dedicated her time to assist newly arrived migrants, particularly those coming from her country, Lebanon, to successfully settle here in Australia. In addition to raising four children, she has been a volunteer at a number of charitable organisations, focusing primarily on encouraging young migrant women to gain an education and contribute in their local community. Faten is a strong and positive voice for the Arabicspeaking community of the south-west of Sydney. She currently serves as head of the Arabic department at Al Amannah College in Liverpool and is participating in the 2012 MuslimAustralian reference group designed to encourage constructive dialogue throughout our diverse community. In the past, Faten has used her role as a presenter on 2MFM Muslim radio",201,Midlas Are To Be Commended And Congratulated For Their Hard Work Dedication Passion And
189,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (10:40,"On behalf of this parliament, I would like to congratulateto reach out to the community that she represents. Her own experience as a migrant coming to this country in 1989 and the challenge that she faced in settling into her new country have provided inspiration to others facing this difficult transition. People coming to Australia need the support and guidance of those who know our legal and social systems in particular. As a consequence, Faten has been a tremendous source of support and knowledge to a number of newly arrived migrants as they settle in their new homeland, Australia. On behalf of a very grateful community, I would like to thank Faten for the invaluable contribution that she has made to her community and congratulate her on being awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Nambucca Show attending the 100th Nambucca Show at the Macksville Showground. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have worked so hard over more than 100 years to build the show into the thriving institution that it is today. It was in 1906 that the Nambucca Dairy Company decided to set up an agricultural society to help improve the quality of stock and produce. The world was a very different place in 1906. Information was much harder to come by than it is today and so much more was exchanged face-to-face rather than by phone, the internet or even the written word. What better than to create an annual occasion when farmers and their families throughout the region could meet, exhibit their animals, show off their successes and set a benchmark for others to aspire to, and all for the common good? The first show was held the following year, in 1907, in the paddock behind the Nambucca Hotel in Macksville. According to the book produced to mark the 100th show, there was a large crowd and the show was 'a distinct success, clearing around £35', which would have been a lot of money in those days. At this point I should say that in the forward to the bookand the book was written by the show secretary, John Harris-thanks go to Betty Trisley for her research and Donna Gaddes for formatting the words and photos, as well as to the members of the 100th show committee. The book chronicles the steady growth of the show and the occasional financial reversal due to bad weather. It relates the formation of the Nambucca River District Agricultural Association, the sale of the original showground to the department of education for a high school, the purchase of the current site on Rodeo Drive and the raising of a loan to build a pavilion and other facilities. While the show remains very much about improving stock and produce, from its early days it was always seen as a social occasion. Even though we have vastly improved transport and telecommunications, isolation and loneliness remain issues for those working hard on the land and the show remains an occasion when the whole community can get together. I mentioned earlier the current secretary, John Harris. John took that office in 1976 and therefore has now served as secretary for some 36 years. It was quite appropriate that the 100th show was opened by John and, I think, a very strong tribute to his long service to the show. His dedication is typical of all those who have given their time, energy and community spirit for more than 100 years to build the show into the valuable and healthy institution that it is today. I would like to congratulate Michael Ettelson, president of the show committee, and the hard-working volunteers for all of their efforts over so many years to continue to produce such a great community event.",202,Midlas Will Be The Ones Providing Real Help And Hope To Those In This Community Who Will
190,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (10:42,"I recently had the pleasure and privilege ofNational Financial Literacy Strategy Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, financial literacy falls into my portfolio area and I believe it is one of the most important areas of work for me. The government's National Financial Literacy Strategy aimed at giving people the skills to take control of their finances, make the most of opportunities and attain their financial goals while also protecting themselves from poor decision making. A key plank of the National Financial Literacy Strategy is the MoneySmart program run by ASIC. The MoneySmart website aims to help people make financial decisions that improve their lives. MoneySmart provides not just information and tools, but also the motivation to take action. It takes visitors from simply acquiring knowledge to setting goals and implementing those goals themselves. It recently won award for the Best Service Delivery Website at the 2012 Excellence in eGovernment Awards and in 2011 the MoneySmart website was named Best Government Website at the Australian Web Awards. It is used by around 120,000 people a month and over 2 million people have used the website since its launch, which demonstrates the need for but also the desire of people to get this sort of information about their financial situations. The best part about this website is that it sells absolutely nothing. It is all about information. It is credible and it is very important. The most popular tool is the budget planner. It is used by more than 28,000 people per month. Another excellent tool is the retirement calculator. People to enter the income that they hope to have in retirement and, based on their current situation, it calculates the income that they are likely to have. This can put into stark clarity the discrepancy that exists for many people between their wishes and their likely income and gives them the opportunities to make changes today that can help them achieve their goals in the future. RecentlyI conducted a forum in my electorate in Forest Lake for the Over 50s Club about financial literacy and also about avoiding scams. This was a great opportunity for me to speak to a group of Australians about financial literacy. They were a very interested group from a demographic that is often overlooked, as we sometimes assume that people who have attained 50 years or more of age have accumulated all the knowledge and all the skills to manage their finances. But it is often the case that they are the very group that we need to focus our attention on. In the era of financial literacy, learning never stops. In fact, when people reach middle age, it is often the ideal time to have a financial health check and stop and examine your financial health and make the necessary changes to help ensure that you do have long term financial well being. I also want to congratulate the regulator-the Australian Securities and Investments Commission-for their very hard and good work in this area. It is a fantastic collaboration between this federal government and the regulator in delivering a tool and a resource for ordinary people that really does work. Australian Defence Force federal budget cuts of $5.5 billion from Defence over the forward estimates. Despite Labor's rhetoric, these cuts will have a long-term impact on our nation's defence capabilities. Next year's Defence budget has decreased in real terms by 10.5 per cent, which is the largest yearon-year reduction since the end of the Korean War. As a percentage of GDP, defence funding will be 1.56 per cent-the lowest since 1938.

192,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (10:48,"Today, I rise to voice my disgust at Labor's 2012-13trashed, with the announcement that Labor has cancelled recreational leave travel for single members over the age of 21. This will affect around 22,000 ADF personnel, many of whom are based in my electorate of Solomon. When they joined Defence, these members were told that, if they were posted interstate, they would be able to go home a couple of times a year as part of their employment conditions. Now this employment condition has been breached. Mr Paul Potter, a constituent of mine whose son is now posted in Canberra, told my office that he was outraged that Australia's defence personnel were having their employment conditions slashed without any consultation whatsoever. He also said his son is keen to come home to Darwin and see his family but now he will not be able to afford to do so. Paul said he does not want these budget cuts to result in other families having breakdowns and falling apart. Surely we should not be discouraging any family reunions. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel should be ashamed of themselves. In terms of budget cuts there is no doubt that my electorate will be impacted by the Defence funding cuts. Based on public information and letters from the chiefs of defence, in conjunction with industry analysis, we have determined where cuts and projects will be impacted in my electorate. At the RAAF Base Darwin, the first 12 JSF aircraft, AIR 6,000 phase 2A and phase 2B, have been delayed by two years and phase 2C has been delayed by one year. At Robinson Barracks 15 of the M1A1 Abrams tanks and 100 of the M113AS4 armoured personnel carriers are going to be mothballed. Also at Robinson Barracks the Tiger helicopters are having their flying hours reduced. To add to this, the Robinson Barracks redevelopment has been delayed by three years and the Larrakeyah Base redevelopment This Labor government does not understand the detrimental impacts of its decisions on electorates like mine. Only the coalition offers hope, reward and opportunity. We are committed to rebuilding defence and we will not treat our service men and women with the contempt(Time expired) Agriculture Ms SAFFIN (Page) (10:51): I had a very productive visit last Thursday from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, whom I hosted in my electorate of Page. We began at a breakfast at Brookfarm. You would have seen some of their products for sale in Parliament House and offered on various plane flights. Brookfarm is run by Martin and Pam Brook, and they run a really good show. They launched a new product, called Porrij, of which there are three different varieties. Who would have thought that porridge could be relaunched, rebadged and remarketed? There were great chefs there-the Byron at Byron chef, Gavin Hughes, and Fin's Steven Snow; two really eminent chefs-cooking Porrij, the humble porridge. We all tried it and it was wonderful. I brought some down to Parliament House with me and had it for breakfast this morning. It is a great local product. It just shows that small business can do great things when they are creative and innovative. We then had a productive meeting with a whole range of representatives broadly from the red meat industry. There were about 24 of them. Some of them came to my office and some of them spoke over the telephone from all around Australia. They raised concerns that their voices were not being heard in Canberra because they were not speaking with one voice on clear strategies and clear issues, and I have talked about that in this place before. In responding to concerns they expressed that peak bodies such as MLA and Cattle Council of Australia were not representing them well enough, the minister said he was 'all ears' to suggestions as to how the job could be done better. However, he also said it was up to producers to drive any change, based on long-term strategy for the sector. He said, 'It doesn't matter sometimes whether it is a single voice or multiple voices. What matters is that they clearly articulate what their top 10 issues are, what their goals are and what their overall strategy is so that we can then work with the industry.' I also had a meeting with the Chairman of the Northern Co-operative Meat Company, George Bennett, and the CEO, Simon Stahl, and talked about some of the stresses that the meat-processing sector was under. I got some good assistance with that and heard some good ideas. I finished up at Primex, the premier national primary industries exhibition. It showcases the industries and is a great boost to tourism and our local economy. It is held in Casino, the beef capital of Australia, which hosts the biggest Beef Week in Australia. I congratulate the Wright family, particularly Bruce, and Primex staff and volunteers for organising Primex, our largest regional trade and commercial exhibition. (Time expired) Grasso, Mr Douglas a suburb in Cowan. For most of its existence it was known as Girrawheen Primary School, but it was in recent times renamed Hudson Park. The children of Hudson Park Primary School are challenged by the lower socioeconomic circumstances of the suburb of Girrawheen. However, it is fortunate that the staff at the school are totally committed to the children and believe that each one of them has a great future. As is usual with schools in these situations, despite the challenges that the schools face you will often find long-serving teachers that have devoted themselves to providing opportunities for the children. Dedicated teaching together with understanding and patience provides positive learning environments. It is about one such teacher I would like to speak. At the start of July 2010 the school underwent a dramatic change. It was the retirement of long-serving principal Doug Grasso, who had spent 16½ years at the school as principal. His retirement was at the end of 41 years as an educator. When asked about his retirement, Doug Grasso said: “I love being able to watch kids grow and develop as individuals … I found with teaching, the more I did it, the more I liked it.” TodayI wish to speak of former principal Doug Grasso. Unfortunately, Doug passed away yesterday after a fairly short illness-a tragic illness. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his profound influence on the lives of thousands of students that passed through the school during his leadership. I asked for comments from those who knew him well, or knew him better than I did. It is heartening to appreciate how well he was regarded. Terri Reid, the principal of the Karrinyup Primary School and a former colleague, said of Doug that he was a true gentleman, always solutions focused, an absolute pleasure to work with and an inspiring role model as a great principal and a great human being. Janet Straker, a teacher for 10 years at the school, said of Doug that he was always kind, fair and compassionate with children, staff and parents. He never showed anger or frustration with even the most challenging of students. He was extremely supportive of staff professionally and personally. He also had a wicked sense of humour. Former registrar Barbara Blake said that Doug always worked hard to get all the difficult students to be the best they could be.",204,Midlas Will Be The Ones Providing Real Help And Hope To Those In This Community Who Will
193,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (10:54,"Hudson Park Primary School is located in Girrawheen,Barbara informed me that Doug gained the respect of all students, including those who had been suspended from other schools or who had difficulties, because he demonstrated that he cared for them and believed in them. The result was children that were better behaved, learning more and liking their school experience. It is little wonder that a couple of years ago, when Doug left Hudson Park and full-time leadership as a principal, the children made and donned hats that reflected Doug's diminished hairline. That was reported in the local newspaper. The guy was simply a legend in Girrawheen-a great role model and a brilliant educator-and his educational legacy will live on for a generation to come. The community most certainly salutes his influence. Geelong Mayoral Election Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (10:57): Australia's future broadband was an issue that was a big part of the 2010 federal election. In the 2007 election, Work Choices loomed large. In the 2010 Victorian election, health and education were hot topics. In each of these elections, the state of the economy was central. Yet who in Geelong could answer the question as to what were the big issues in the 2008 municipal elections? What were the issues that dominated the news coverage and had every candidate talking? The answer is that there were none, because this is just not how our local government elections have worked. Yet central to the democratic process is not just choosing our elected representatives but also having a debate around issues and having ideas tested at the ballot box. This is not to say that past council elections have been undemocratic. In each ward, there have been key issues which have been debated. But, with no overall Geelong election, what we have really had in past municipal elections is 12 separate ward elections with separate issues and separate debates. Having a Geelong-wide debate about the multitude of Geelong-wide issues and having Geelong-wide agendas tested is what I believe is the real opportunity that comes with the first direct mayoral election later this year. For the first time in a meaningful way, we will have one election for one position across the entirety of the city of Greater Geelong. A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting about how to energise the Geelong cultural precinct project. My advice was that this is an issue that must be aired in the upcoming mayoral election. It is an issue at the heart of the Geelong debate. Each of the mayoral candidates should be required to express a public view on the issue. There should be public meetings about it. It should be an election issue. I call on every interest group and concerned citizen who has a burning issue to make it a part of this year's Geelong election. While the cultural precinct is important for me, what the city does about jobs and the cost of living and not just what it does about planning and garbage collection-in other words, how we turn our local government into a true regional government-is the really big issue for the Geelong election. The Committee for Geelong and G21 have been important catalysts for debate, but it is this election that must be the most important moment in which to generate a Geelong agenda. Mandates for action around this agenda must be earned. When we look back at the 2012 Geelong election, it must not only be about who ran; more importantly, we must be able to answer the question as to what they ran about. Ensuring that the 2012 Geelong election is not just about 'who' but also that it becomes, for the first time, about 'what' is an opportunity that the Geelong community itself must take.",206,Norforce Redeployment Has Been Delayed By Two Years
194,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Torres Strait Flooding Debate resumed on the motion of Mr Entsch: That this House: (1) notes the motion agreed to on 18 August 2011 in relation to the severe flooding of Torres Strait Islands; (2) acknowledges the commitment the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government made on behalf of the Government to address the problem; (3) condemns the Minister for reneging on the promise to restore and rebuild the damaged sea walls on the outer islands of the Torres Strait to protect the island communities from further devastation; and (4) calls on: (a) the Minister to publicly comply with the resolution that this House passed on 18 August 2011; and (b) the Government to investigate: (i) any remediation works required to bring the affected sea walls to a standard high enough to prevent tidal flooding; (ii) the maintenance of sea walls to a safe standard; and (iii) how these works might be funded. that I have for the second time to move a motion of this nature in relation to the Torres Strait seawalls. Last year in MarchI had a motion prepared and I was ready to have it submitted to this place for debate. I was asked directly by the Minister Crean's office not to put it up, that the government had made a decision that they were inclined to support that motion but they needed more time. They could not take the money out of the RDA funds because it was totally inappropriate and the minister was looking for an opportunity to identify funds from another source. In the interest of bipartisan support, I agreed to delay putting the motion up until August to assist the minister in his endeavours to locate the money. In August, I still had not heard from the minister and I advised him that it was my intention, as per our agreement, to put the motion up. The motion was put up and the government supported it. The motion asked that the issue of seawalls be addressed immediately, that infrastructure be put in place so that we do not start to lose existing infrastructure. We have $1 billion worth of infrastructure that is being damaged every single year. We had lost over half the Saibai Island's cemetery which had been washed out to sea. I was pleased that the government supported the motion. In fact in AugustI wrote to the minister and congratulated him, thanking him on behalf of the Torres Strait Islands community because he was prepared to support us. I then asked when the money could be expected to flow and where the money would come from. I had to wait until December, and, after many subsequent follow-ups was told by the minister that he was no longer going to support it, that it was not really a federal government issue but an issue for the state and for the local council. Why didn't he tell me that back in March when I was putting that motion up?",207,Norforce Redeployment Has Been Delayed By Two Years
195,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas,Order! In accordance with standing order,208,Private Members Business
196,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Chief Opposition Whip) (11:00): It dismays me immenselyIn that period, I have to say, more graves were lost; more graves were washed out to sea. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, how would anybody in this place, whose mother or father, brother or sister, grandparents or whomever was interred in a cemetery, feel when they went there the next day to visit them to find that they had been washed out to sea, never to be found. Anywhere else in the country it would be absolutely outrageous and the matter would be fixed immediately, but up there, it seems, from this minister's perspective, it really does not matter. Like many other things in Indigenous issues, it is all about the politics. It is not about finding real solutions. But it is also a very, very stupid decision. There is $1 billion worth of infrastructure on the six affected islands and every year there is a couple of million dollars worth of damage. Yet every year they are prepared to fix up that damage but not to fix the cause of the problem. It is not about climate change, it is not about rising sea levels, it is about failing, ageing, 50-yearold infrastructure. That is the problem, and it is easily fixed. It is a $22 million to $24 million fix. This government can find $240 million to give to the UN to give to micro-Pacific nations to address issues pertaining to climate change. They can give that money-$240 million; it is not much when you say it fast-to these countries to build their sea walls. But they will not give $22 million to fix a small Pacific community that just happens to be in Australia. You have to pose the statement: maybe it is about buying a place on the UN for a thorn in this government's side, rather than trying to address the genuine issues that are facing this community every year. We are right on the front line of Papua New Guinea. A couple of kilometres away there is tuberculosis, HIV, meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, cholera. I recently came back from Daru, and when you walk past the cemetery you see grave after grave of people that have just died of cholera. You understand just how real it is, but this mob down here does not give a damn. More recently the RDA funding came out-this is the second round we have had-and the only money to be given north of Mackay was $5 million that was going to the sea walls in the Torres Strait. Lo and behold: $5 million for a $24-million fix. That is the only RDA money that was given over two rounds, and that $5 million is for a $24-million job. They go up there-Senator McLucas, Minister Macklin, Minister Crean-patting themselves on the back and saying: 'Hallelujah, we've found a solution, but there is a catch. We are going to put another $7 million in, but we don't know where we are going to find that yet. But the whole lot-the whole $12 million or so that we are going to put up-is conditional on the state government finding the money.' Now we know that the Bligh government left the Campbell Newman state government with a debt that is going to rise to $100 billion. Where are they going to suddenly draw $12 million out to put in there for something that should have been fixed by this government several years ago? This is a problem that has been going on now for six years. It is all smoke and mirrors. You have people up there in the community thinking, 'Wow, it is going to happen.' I have news for them-it is not going to happen. The reason that they did it this way is that it is a guaranteed way that they do not spend a cracker. I was talking to Ron Enosa, the chairman of the Saibai community. He knows that it is a lie. He knows that it is not going to happen. He is bitterly disappointed. I was talking to Fred Gela, the Chair of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, only yesterday. He said, 'I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the more I speak to them, the more I realise that this is never going to be a reality, because $5 million is not going to fix it and it is conditional on the state government putting $12 million up that they do not have and they did not budget for, and another $7 million that is going to materialise out of thin air; Simon Crean has not yet decided where it is going to come from.' It really made me wonder if the criteria for being a cabinet minister in this government is the ability to continue to mislead the Australian public, the same as the Prime Minister has doneMr Perrett: Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask the member for Leichhardt to withdraw that suggestion about the cabinet. I find it unparliamentary and offensive. chamberfor Leichhardt will withdraw that statement for the resumption of the debate to take place. Mr Entsch: I withdraw, but I find it offensive that I was promised-call it what you like-in March that Simon Crean, the minister, would support it. It took till August. I complied 100 percent and it took till August, and the government came out and voted and supported it. There was no argument about it. Now we find, almost a year later, that we are no closer to having it happen. What they have done is totally inappropriate. They have definitely misled me. There is no question about it. They have misled me and they have misled the Torres Strait people, who are sitting there waiting for the next king tide, which is in a couple of months time, when more of the cemetery is going to be washed away and more of their ancestors are going to disappear into the sea. More infrastructure is going to be destroyed, and it is going to raise the risk of cholera, dysentery, meningitis and Japanese encephalitis. It is a cruel hoax. It is a disgusting trick on the Torres Strait people. The minister and this government should stand condemned for their appalling treatment of these people in their deliberate attempts to avoid, in any way they can, fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities. These people are Australians. They may live in the Torres Strait, but they are very, very proud Australians and they are entitled to have a government that steps up to its responsibilities and takes the appropriate action to ensure that they have security of their own communities. on the flooding of communities in the Torres Strait. My electorate is a long way away from the Torres Strait, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the passion of the member for Leichhardt about this topic. I know he has got credibility and the respect of his community for representing the needs of his constituents. However, I will point out a couple of things in response to his speech. This problem did not begin on election night 24 November 2007-as the member for Leichhardt acknowledged. He indicated that it had been a problem confronted by the Howard government beforehand. He said that it had been going on for six years, and obviously we have only been in power for less than five years. So this has been an ongoing issue for a long time. It did not commence on 24 November 2007. That is the first thing that anyone with common sense would understand.

200,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (11:10,"I rise to oppose the member for Leichhardt's motionPolicy and Legal Affairs; and I note that the member for Bonner is in the chamber. We have a bit of familiarity with the Constitution. When I look through the Constitution, I cannot see a reference to the Commonwealth government having responsibility for local graves. That is not in any way to take away from the heartbreak that it must be to experience the graves of your ancestors and loved ones being washed out to sea. I am not in any way minimising the heartache that is associated with that. But, when I read the Constitution, I cannot find a Commonwealth constitutional head of power to look after every single grave in Australia. For Commonwealth war graves, whether they be in Gaza or Thailand or Flanders, we do have a responsibility. However, the 720 local councils in Australia have a responsibility to look after their local graves. That is the first bit of law that I am sure the member for Leichhardt would agree with. I remind the member opposite that there is actually another level of government between the local government and the Commonwealth government, and that is the state government. The Queensland state government has some additional oversight over local governments and their ability to look after the tasks that they do. As the member knows, with the DOGIT lands in his part of the world, state government and local government interaction is much closer than the interaction between the Commonwealth government and local government. These are some of the facts that we need to get out there. The member for Leichhardt seemed a little bit ungrateful about the federal government's announcement of $12 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait, but it seemed to be more about the delivery rather than the actual policy. This is a complex issue that has required extensive consultation. I am not shying away from the Commonwealth responsibility for that. It has been part of the Labor Party's responsibility since election night 2007. But, I am sure if I look through the member for Leichhardt's webpage, I will see his great press releases commending the Labor government for delivering for the Torres Strait Islander community in all those other areas. Mr Entsch interjectingLeichhardt said: 'It is all about the politics, not about finding solutions.' They were his words. He said that the cause of the problem has nothing to do with climate change. I also think he seemed to be drifting away from the bipartisan support of the parliament for our aid policy in looking after Pacific nations. I am not sure if that was a frolic of his own or a new departure in foreign policy. I will have to explore that later. The reality is that the Labor government has invested $12 million through this $5 million grant to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council because we know that the Torres Strait has particular problems with their funding base. The nation turned its eyes to the Torres Strait recently on the 20th anniversary of Mabo. We looked at the member for Leichardt's area and the contribution that people there have made. We know about the connection of Torres Strait Islander communities to their land and how, from that, the High Court was able to extrapolate that the mainland Indigenous community also has a long standing commitment to their land. The $12 million investment will be provided to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council and the Torres Strait Regional Authority to work in partnership to deliver seawalls in six island communities and repair the damaged infrastructure. As Commonwealth parliamentarians we well know that the local government area is where the rubber meets the road, where the",210,Private Members Business
201,Mr Perrett,"I will take that interjection that, no, I will not! The member forshovel meets the road. The local people know the concerns of their community, and the opposition's suggestion that climate change has not had an impact on rising sea levels flies in the face of 99.9 per cent of scientists. Most right-thinking people understand. They can see the tracking. If we look at the Keeling curve and the rise in parts per million of CO2 recorded scientifically around the world, we know that there is a greater cause and that it did not somehow, magically, become a problem on 24 November 2007. On this side of the House we are a lot more serious about taking out the politics and finding the solutions. We are investing $200 million in projects right across Australia in the second stage of a five-year regional funding program. In Queensland alone, eight projects have been funded under the RDAF round 2, with the Australian government contributing $33.67 million to projects worth more than $134 million. I note the member for Leichardt stood up and said-I assume with some authority, after consultation with his state member and his LNP premier-that the Queensland state government would not give a single dollar to this project. I am not sure whether that was what he was suggesting and whether he had the authority to say that the state government will not match the Commonwealth. Or was he saying that it is too hard? I thought the member for Leichardt had been meeting with Premier Newman. I wish he had talked about his meetings with Premier Newman to request that the Queensland government match the federal government's contribution of $12 million to build seawalls in the Torres Strait. I would hate to remind the member for Leichardt that if Premier Newman cannot even commit to protecting permanent workers in the Australian government after the election, as he did before the election, he might shy away from committing any funding to protect seawalls in the Torres Strait. I ask all Queensland federal members of the LNP to call on Premier Newman to match this $12 million funding commitment by the federal government and to make a commitment to provide coastal infrastructure to protect people in the Torres Strait from destructive tides. Premier Newman has been the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, but I hope he will be the Premier for all of Queensland and make sure that we are looking after these people, who are a long way away from George Street. The member for Leichardt is very proficient in describing problems, but I would suggest that he is not necessarily being part of the solution. I seem to recall that he was the member of parliament responsible for the Torres Strait for about 12 years. I do not think that these tides magically appeared at midnight on 24 November 2007. If we go back to 3 March 1996, when he became responsible for the Torres Strait, the reality is that king tides were starting to become a problem even then. Mr Entsch: No, they weren't! 24 November 2007. When it comes to addressing the hard issues, the Leader of the Opposition says that he cannot fix anything. Things like the Murray-Darling Basin are complicated processes and you need people to sit down to discuss them. This is another classic example of where we can get all three levels of government on the same page and take the politics out of it. The member for Leichardt said it is all about politics and not about finding solutions. I think it will be best resolved if we can sit down together. The reality is there is a rates base in the Torres Strait that is not able to fund all of these issues. Mr Entsch: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member made a comment which is blatantly untrue. The reality of the situation is that in the 2002 election-",211,Private Members Business

There is an opportunity for him to move that substantive motion and we will see whether this motion is all about the politics or whether it is actually about achieving solutions. I know that Simon Crean's door would always be open to him to achieve real change. (Time expired) Strait communities brought before this House by my friend and colleague the member for Leichhardt. It is with some sadness that I speak on this today as this motion has been before the House before and has had bipartisan support, but what we have here is a fundamental breach of faith. I have a great deal of time for the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, but he has let down the very people about whom he should be most concerned. As the member for Leichhardt has already stated, there are six Torres Strait islands heavily affected by king tides, particularly over the last four years. These king tides inundate the low-lying islands which causes roads to flood and we see seawater through houses, businesses and even cemeteries. The cost to repair the seawalls that exist to protect these assets and infrastructure and personal spaces from flooding has been estimated at between $22 million and $24 million. The minister backflipped on the government's support for Mr Entsch's 2011 motion stating that it was the responsibility of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council and the Queensland government to fund and that it was not appropriate for it to be paid for from the Regional Development Australia Fund, or RDAF. If that was not bad enough, Minister Crean backflipped again, allocating $5 million for the project through the RDAF this month. So the previous speaker saying that there are not constitutional grounds for the federal government to do this would seem to fly in the face of what the government has actually done. That there is no plan in place for the other $17 million to $19 million beggars belief. They have stated that there should be $12 million from the state government, which has never been involved in this process, and do not even outline where the other $5 million in funding will be found. Perhaps if the Torres Strait islands were declared an independent nation our government would be all over them, like it was 102 degrees in the shade and they were prickly heat, to give them the money. Our government will spend more than $160 million over five years in funding especially to help the Pacific island nations deal with the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, yet if you are an Australian citizen this government will walk away from you. What do the people of the Torres Strait do here? Australia's full aid budget for East Asia and the Pacific in 2012-13 is $2.5 billion, and yet we cannot support these people at home for $22 million to $24 million. For that I say: shame on this government. This government always talks a good game when it comes to Aboriginal and Islander affairs, but at every turn it walks away from commitments and opportunities to show that very support, be it in public housing on Palm",212,Private Members Business

206,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (11:21,"I rise to support this motion relating to TorresIsland or help in the brave efforts of the community radio station 4K1G to keep an Aboriginal voice over a huge part of North Queensland and Cape York. It is true to form at every turn. The problem with this government is that every time there is an opportunity to do something it simply rolls out the platitudes and starts conversations recognising the traditional owners and then walks away thinking the job has been done. From the first Australians of my electorate and on behalf of those people in the Torres Strait who have been left behind by this government's platitudes, I say, 'Thanks for nothing.' I will digress to give an example. On Palm Island we build houses not much bigger than a garden shed at a cost of over $600,000. And we build them with the toilet pan below the waterline so they cannot be flushed properly and are therefore uninhabitable. There is no use of the licensed builder and the five licensed plumbers and electricians or even of unskilled labour from the island's residents. The end result could have been so different, but I still have houses on Palm with over 20 inhabitants and that is no good for anyone. With 4K1G, you will see every manner of government minister ringing Lloydy Wiles to get their message across; but when they receive a call from the station that they are struggling with cash flow but are asset rich, they disappear. They disappear even though you have the Attorney-General, the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, and the minister for communications physically in Townsville for the best part of a week. And yet they cannot spare 4K1G 20 minutes for a meeting. Instead they send a staffer along to tell them which government departments they could possibly write to. It simply is not good enough to come in here and sprout a good game; we must actually do something and have an ability to get behind this thing to fix the things in the Torres Strait and to show the people at home that we actually care about them: the people in the Torres Strait who are without the services and the people in the Torres Strait who are being inundated by health concerns from Papua New Guinea. The people of the Torres Strait are citizens of Australia and deserve better than not having a $22 million wall replaced and not funded. That the government-the member for Moreton-can sit there and say that it is not in the constitution beggars belief. It absolutely beggars belief, and it is pretty much chump change to the people of the Torres Strait. I call on the government to back this motion and actually deliver for the Torres Strait. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11:26): Sitting here listening to the contribution from the honourable member for Herbert, you would think that there was nothing happening. I am sure they have either deliberately or mistakenly not read what is happening. The motion itself is actually redundant, if it was ever needed, because all of the work was actually going on, and it was clear there was a commitment from the Australian government-from the Labor government-to fund and support the Torres Strait Islanders from the severe flooding that they experience. There has been a $12 million allocation of funds-but I will come to that. If the motion actually took out things like 'condemns the minister'-because it has been the minister and the senator for Queensland, the Hon. Jan McLucas, who have been doing a lot of work on this with locals and with local authorities-then it is something I could get up and speak in support of. But as it is, there is no way that I could give support to it because it is just simply put there as an attack. It is easy to do that; it is easy to put words on paper and it is easy to come in here, speak big and act as though nothing is happening when in fact the opposite is true. Talk about trying to alter reality to fit your perceived political notions of the world! I would recommend that all the speakers here reflect on the importance of the work being done in the Torres Strait and right across the country-particularly through the Regional Development Australia Fund. Many members would have seen that there was RDAF round 1 and RDAF round 2, which has just been announced across Australia, and quite a lot of members would have seen wonderful projects get up in their area. I will come to my electorate of Page, where a great project got up under Regional Development Australia Fund 2-I had the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government in my electorate, announcing that in conjunction with Ballina Shire Council-but this motion is directed to Queensland. Some of the things I want to put on the record here that are important with this nonsense motion is that two weeks ago the ministers for Indigenous affairs and for regional Australia, and senator for Queensland, Jan McLucas, announced up to $2 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait. I am told that we are still waiting to hear from the Queensland government what they are going to announce and what their contribution would be. Also, if this motion included talking about the Queensland government and what they could do, it would have more integrity-and it does not. It is a glaring omission. The $12 million funding I just referred to includes a $5 million grant to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council from round 2 of the Regional Development Australia Fund and up to $7 million in additional funding. It shows that the government is doing all that it can to support the local council, the regional authority, the communities and people living on the islands to protect their homes. I acknowledge the strong advocacy and support provided by Senator Jan McLucas from Queensland. From her Cairns base, she has travelled many times to Torres Strait to work towards finding a workable funding solution to address the community need. That is what local members or senators with a particular interest in an area do-we work to find solutions. We do not just come in here, throw a few words down on paper, have a bit of a dummy-spit in the chamber and then walk out and say, 'Job done,' before putting out a media release saying, 'AmI not wonderful?' That is how I read this motion from the member for Leichhardt. You can come in here and describe a problem, but it is more difficult to actually put up part of the solution. I come back the point that the Queensland government must surely have a role in this and that it should come to the party. Earlier, I mentioned the biochar project in my area. It is an $8½ million project being funded to the tune of $4.3 million under RDAF round 2 and being run through Ballina Shire Council. This project is a first in Australia and it is something the shire council have worked on for a number of years. There has been a huge amount of work done in the community, which has provided great support. As a result, when the grant came through, all the groundwork was done-they are ready to roll. This project means that they will be doing their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as saving money. on the flooding of communities in the Torres Strait. I commend the member for the determination and passion he has shown in bringing this issue to the attention of the House. I know Western Australia is a long way away from the Torres Strait, but, as the member for Shortland and the member for Hindmarsh would recall, we visited the Torres Strait Islands back in 2010 and ran a health inquiry up there. We saw some of the degradation of the islands while we were there.",213,Private Members Business
207,Mr Irons (Swan) (11:31,"I stand to support the motion of the member for LeichhardtDuring the last sitting, I spoke in this place about the importance of maintaining river walls in my own electorate of Swan. My electorate shares a large section of its boundary with the Swan River and I understand the importance of river walls in maintaining the foreshore and protecting existing infrastructure along the river. Despite several requests, local councils-a group of 21 of them-have received no support from the federal government in dealing with the logistical and financial challenge of maintaining this critical infrastructure. As those affected in the Torres Strait well know, this is not a problem that can just be tucked under the rug by this government. With every delay in action, the problem becomes worse and the solution more expensive to implement. As I said, the member for Leichhardt showed considerable passion in his speech, during which he said that this is about fixing the problem and not blaming local or state governments-which is just what the member for Moreton, who followed the member for Leichhardt, did in his speech. He started going back to the blame game, something this government promised years ago it would not indulge in. Just yesterday, we read about the latest example of reckless waste by this government, with the Sunday Telegraph website and Tim Andrews from the Australian Taxpayers Alliance describing the $3.27 million blown by jet-setting bureaucrats at the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. In the last year alone, officials from the department racked up more than 6.5 million kilometres of travel, producing 1,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, while going to talkfests about the warming planet in locations such as the Maldives, Vanuatu and the Caribbean. This extravagant travel expenditure is just one more in a long line of examples of wasteful spending by this government-wasteful spending being incurred whilst critical projects are being neglected. Officials appear to have significantly less enthusiasm for visiting the affected communities in the Torres Strait than they do for travelling to five-star resorts around the world. This is behaviour that, unfortunately. we have come to expect from the government. The government is happy to organise summits and committees and send bureaucrats to luxurious talkfests, but, as the member for Leichhardt pointed out, when it comes to the critical task of actually taking action on issues or actually solving problems-even when the solution is as obvious as it is in this case-this government falls short time and again. Simon Crean, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, made a commitment but reneged on his promise, shifting responsibility to the state and local governments and leaving locals with a commitment from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency which represents only a small fraction of what is needed to fix the problem. Instead of fixing the problem, the government is content to shift responsibility while the locals continue to suffer from flooding events and resulting damage. I note that while local council applications in my electorate are rejected and the damage bill to coastal infrastructure in the Torres Strait continues to mount, this government has spent over $328 million on international climate change initiatives to fund upgrades to infrastructure and coastal resilience overseas. That is the real crux of the matter: the government focuses on overseas projects before it focuses on Australian projects. As my colleague the member for Leichhardt has said, Torres Strait Islanders have every right to feel neglected and offended by the government's response. However, I do see hope at the end of the tunnel. The Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change listened to my recent speech on the river walls in Swan. He said that he would be happy to look at the issue and meet with some of the people from those councils, who are in Canberra at the moment, including the Mayor of the City of South Perth, Sue Doherty. He has said on a couple of occasions that he will make himself available. I applaud him for giving consideration to meet with the people who have been putting in submissions for river wall projects on the Swan River. I will finish by again stating my support for the Torres Strait Islanders. I support the member for Leichhardt. The huge commitments overseas should be matched in Australia. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (11:36): I rise to talk about this motion and to note the differences between those opposite and we as a Labor government in our understandings of what leadership means. The Labor government wants to make sure that we lead in the local regions. As a Labor government, when we see a problem we get on with the job and move towards a solution. We see in this motion that is before the chamber today the classic strategy of the Liberal Party and the National Party: describing a problem, whinging about the problem, whinging about any offer of a solution to the problem and continuing in that same vein indefinitely. We have seen incredible, aggressive negativity from those opposite, with the Leader of the Opposition as the leader of those who oppose everything in more ways than one. The reality is that the issue of the management of the sea wall in Queensland is one that the Labor Party is very much dealing with. I want to acknowledge in particular the work of Senator Jan McLucas, who has announced $12 million help fund the coastal protection works in the Torres Strait Islands. We know that she is a passionate advocate for her state of Queensland. Obviously, I believe that New South Wales is and always will be the premier state. But while I take my responsibility as a representative in the national parliament seriously, I am happy to be pleased at the success of others in making sure that those who need assistance receive it. We understand that sea walls and other coastal management measures are vital to this nation and particularly to the vulnerable Torres Strait Island communities in their battle against king tides. That is why our commitment to this region through this $12 million is a very significant one. The question is now whether Mr Entsch will approach his Liberal-National Party colleagues in Queensland and get them to get on with the job of pulling their weight. We know that they have the classic capacity to whinge, but what are they going to do? When are they going to put some money towards meeting the needs of the community? When are they going to get on with addressing the hard issues? When are they going to address the material threats facing the people of the Torres Strait Islands? In the time that is remaining, I want to speak about Labor's commitment to the regions through the vehicle of our regional development authorities. In my own region, I want to acknowledge the former head of my RDA, John Dawson, and his CEO, Anthony Dow. They were instrumental in helping us achieve success in our bid for funds in the first round of grants from the Regional Development Australia Fund. That round provided $890,000 for my local community. I am pleased to say that it added to the over $1 million gathered by the local community. This money has gone to the coast community centre, a vital piece of infrastructure. This refurbishment means that this centre is going to be able to function much more effectively, offering assistance to those most in need. The new premises are expected to be opened before the end of this year, on time and on budget. The centre will then have the capacity to offer meals, shower and laundry facilities and food parcels. It will provide a community meeting room and a conference room and there be a site to make referrals for people who need help in getting that sort of advantage. It is obviously a critical piece of infrastructure in terms of building the capacity and developing the confidence of individuals. It would not have been able to be delivered under the regional rorts system that was run under the Howard government. This was a transparent process. The best bid went forward. This will have a profound and positive impact in my area, again showing Labor's leadership in getting on with the job. I am also pleased to put on the record that in the second round we were successful in getting $2.5 million in funding for the Narara Valley sporting precinct. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the new chair of our board, Dave Abrahams, and his very hard working assistant and CEO, Andrew Roach, who made sure that we put in a fantastic bid. We have matching community funding for this money from the federal government. This $2.5 million is for a project worth $5.18 million. This project will incorporate the construction of new sporting fields, floodlighting and recreational facilities, bringing a much-needed capacity to our area. (Time expired) member's motion. I thank the member for Leichhardt for his ongoing dedication to ensuring that the sea walls in the Torres Strait Islands are maintained. There are six particular islands in the Torres Strait Regional Council area which every year are heavily affected by king tides, the islands of Saibai, Boigu, Masig, Iama, Warraber and Poruma. These islands are some of the worse hit in the world. The king tides inundate roads, homes and businesses and, in a further blow to the local communities, its cemeteries. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council commissioned a report which showed that at least $22 million is required to rebuild the sea walls in the region. On that issue, the government and the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, the member for Hotham, have not done enough. Frankly, the locals are fed up. On 18 August 2011, this House passed with bipartisan support a motion proposed by the member for Leichhardt. This motion called on the government to commit to restore and rebuild the damaged sea walls on the outer islands of the Torres Strait. On that date, the government publicly committed itself to providing funds and the Torres Strait community took that undertaking in good faith. They were excited that there would be action-until November 2011, when the minister reneged on his promise, claiming that the issue was suddenly one for which state governments and local councils should be responsible. The minister's most recent announcement, which was on 4 June 2012, was yet another example of this government pronouncing that they are going to fund an important cause and take action on it while carefully leaving out critical details, such that the so-called funding will not be directed to where it is needed most. The member for Leichhardt noted that the announced $5 million is a cruel hoax. Firstly, as we all know, that is simply not enough funding to adequately address the issue of the failing sea walls. They do not know where the other $7 million will come from. On top of that, the minister said that the Queensland state government has to put in $12 million as well. Perhaps if the minister visited my home state more often he would understand that after 20 years of the Australian Labor Party there is no money left. As former federal Treasurer Peter Costello",215,Private Members Business
208,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (11:41,"I rise today to speak on this very important privateadvised last Friday, Labor sent Queensland almost bankrupt. It is now not in a position to commit to funding this. The Labor government did nothing in their 20 years. The federal government must recommit itself to fixing this problem now and deliver real solutions. Yesterday, I spoke to the Mayor of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, Mr Fred Gela. Fred was locally born and educated and is passionate about the future of the Torres Strait Islands and surrounding areas. As the mayor-he is in his second term-he highlighted to me the absolute urgency of getting funding to restore the dilapidated sea walls. The situation is so serious that Fred has previously pleaded with the Prime Minister, unfortunately to no avail, for adequate funding, saying that if it is not given Torres Strait Islanders could become displaced refugees. Therefore, I speak today because it is an important opportunity to remind the government that they are overseeing serious failures in this policy area, and in many others. The minister's announcements in June came days after the member for Leichhardt tabled this motion. SoI am pleased that the coalition has been able to finally pressure the government into acting, even if their announcement was insufficient. I would also like to thank Mr Fred Gela as well as Mr Ron Saisa, the Torres Strait Regional Authority member for Saibai Island. While Ministers Crean, Macklin and McLucas have made various announcements taking credit for issues in the region, the only two people, as the member for Leichhardt has mentioned, who should receive credit and acknowledgement are Fred and Ron. They are to be commended on their hard work and dedication, and their advocacy for land and sea matters in the region. This motion calls on the government to provide funding and further investigate remediation works for the affected seawalls. I remind the government that people in the Torres Strait Islands region need to see action. They need action now not weasel words, and we need to see action quickly. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (11:45): I think I might have come into debate the wrong motion because I thought it was about the Torres Strait Islands seawalls and remediation works that are needed to combat serious erosion and inundation-the same seawalls that the government have provided $12 million for in the last couple of weeks. In fact, we are now calling on the member for Ryan's colleagues in the LNP government in Queensland to match that funding and come on board, and be part of the solution, not continue to carp about the problem. I might also point out that, while the member for Ryan and others on her side of the debate are right to point out the very proactive approach of the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Torres Strait Regional Council on this very important matter, the submission by the Torres Strait Regional Authority to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts inquiry into the effects of climate change on coastal communities pointed out that it was in fact the Queensland Labor Senator Jan McLucas who made a very impassioned plea back on 10 October 2006 to the former Howard government to take action on this issue. SoI just point that out to members opposite, and I now return to the motion. I was driving through my electorate a couple of weeks ago back from a terrific event at St Lawrence when I heard a report on the radio of the projects that were to be funded under this latest round of Regional Development funding. While I was a little disappointed that a project I was very supportive of in my own electorate had not been funded this time around, I was absolutely thrilled to hear that such a significant amount of funding was being made available to the Torres Strait Regional Authority. I mentioned the inquiry back in 2008 and 2009 when our climate change committee looked at the problems facing coastal communities, and in this case particularly Indigenous communities facing the impacts of climate change and possible sea level rise, and we heard at some length from the Torres Strait Regional Authority about the very serious issue of coastal inundation and erosion in all of the Torres Strait Islands. Six in particular were identified in their evidence. The Torres Strait Regional Authority did a terrific job of putting their case and outlining the extent of the problem, and urging remedial action. The government have come forward with $12 million towards this program of works. It is estimated that the entire program to safeguard those islands would come to $24 million, but any fair-minded person would recognise that $12 million pledged by the federal government is making a very serious attempt to play a positive role in addressing these problems. The $12 million will go to rebuilding or building seawalls and wave return walls, particularly on the most vulnerable islands of Boigu and Saibai. They were amongst the six islands that the Torres Strait Regional Authority described in evidence to our climate change committee. There has already been some significant damage to those islands. What comes up most often is the damage that has been suffered by the cemetery and to marine facilities on those islands. These seawalls will go a long way to reassuring the residents of the islands that they can continue to live safely and securely and that their community assets and their cultural heritage will be protected. It is an example of how regional funding from this government can be made available to communities to meet their priorities. I call on the LNP government in Queensland to match this funding as a matter of priority. (Time expired) Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (11:51): It is a great pleasure to rise for the second time in this 43rd Parliament to support a motion on this issue by my very good friend and colleague, the Chief Opposition Whip and member for Leichhardt. The member's passion and interest in this problem cannot be doubted. I congratulate him on the way he represents his constituents in this place, particularly those that reside in the Torres Strait. Of course, we are here debating the rebuilding of seawalls on the two Torres Strait Islands of Saibai and Boigu. This is a terrible story that has been going on for four years. My colleagues have comprehensively covered the background of this issue. Effectively, the seawalls that protect the villages on these mud islands have deteriorated to the extent that, when the king tides occur, intense flooding occurs and the communities get severely damaged. The member for Leichhardt has previously relayed terrible stories in this House about graves in cemeteries in Saibai getting washed out into the ocean after the terrible flooding. It is a tragedy that in the 21st century in Australia we are still seeing instances like this. I also take intense interest in matters pertaining to the Torres Strait, particularly as they relate to my shadow portfolio areas of international development assistance. I have been working with the member for Leichhardt on issues relating to AusAID funding for tuberculosis treatment for PNG nationals, which affects the people who reside in the Torres Strait Islands. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council Mayor Fred Gela put out a press release on 1 February this year which said: Mayor Gela said that Warren Entsch’s achievement was great in gaining Federal support when the Private Members motion received bipartisanship in regards to funding the restoration and construction of seawalls in our affected communities, only to be advised by the Federal government that it was State’s obligation to fund such issues. ""Stop passing the buck between Federal and State Government,"" Cr. Gela said. ""We are all Australians and we are calling upon the Federal Government to put their money where their mouth is. ""They supported the private members bill, so it is in fact their responsibility to determine how and where the funds will come from. Then surprise, surprise, after Minister Crean reneged on a commitment-after the Labor Party supported the private members' bill-the member for Leichhardt put this motion on the Notice Paper and, guess what, the federal government announced some funding. This announcement came just a few days after the member tabled the motion but, again like so much of what this government does, there is a twist. There is always a twist. You can never take an announcement by this government on any face value. The announcement-and I have the press release in front of me-was made that the government would commit $5 million from the Regional Development Australia Fund plus up to $7 million in additional funding, which apparently comes out of thin air because nobody knows where that $7 million is coming from. If they were genuine they would announce $12 million, straight and upfront, for the Torres Strait coming under the Regional Development Australia Fund. But now there is a catch, and there is always a catch. The Queensland government must match it with $12 million worth of contribution. What a sneaky, underhanded way of saying that you are going to provide funding. This government knows full well that the Queensland government has been left in a financially unviable state by the former Labor government. The incoming Treasury brief to the Newman government stated that the levels of spending and borrowing were unsustainable. Then we have seen the interim report of the Commission of Audit, headed by my distinguished former colleague Peter Costello, which has revealed the Queensland government debtMr Neumann interjectingMs GAMBARO: You don't like the word 'debt'; it really upsets you. The debt is $100 billion. Let me repeat that: $100 billion. You hate that word 'debt'. Well, your previous state government colleagues put us in this situation, yet this government makes an announcement that it is dependent and hinges on the funding by the state government. As the member for Leichhardt said, this is a cruel hoax. Mr Neumann interjectingMs GAMBARO: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. That was very timely. As the member for Leichhardt says, this is a cruel hoax. It is smoke and mirrors, and every federal Labor member from the great state of Queensland should hang their head in shame for the damage that their party is doing to our great state. I fully support the member for Leichhardt, and I fully congratulate him for his tireless efforts, for his never-ending work and particularly for putting this motion. I commend the motion to the House. million across eight projects with a value of more than $134 million in my state of Queensland.

210,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11:56,"This federal Labor government has committed $33.6Somerset Regional Council received a second round of funding of $500,000 towards a $1 million Kilcoy Showgrounds facility development, and the Ipswich City Council received $5 million towards the $15 million Robelle Domain stage 2 parkland development. I also noticed $5 million going to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council towards the $24 million Torres Strait coastal protection works. I then decided to have a look at the application and what the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government Arts and Sport said on their project fact sheet, which I would like those opposite to have a bit of a look at from time to time, because it talks about the Torres Strait coastal protection works helping to protect low-lying island communities in the Torres Strait from destructive coastal erosion. Then there is the matter of how the project will be funded. The application was made by the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, which asked for $5 million from the federal government and made the point that they could leverage a further $19 million in partnership funding. That is what they said, and the project was to be completed by 30 June 2015. We have come up with $12 million: there is $5 million from Regional Development Australia, and Senator Jan McLucas announced up to $12 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait. I have heard those opposite from Queensland waxing lyrical about the member for Leichhardt, but the Regional Development Australia fund and the money we are rolling outover $1 billion-is funded under the minerals resource rent tax. Every member opposite, including the member for Leichhardt, voted against that legislation, which provides the funding source from which we have given money to the Torres Strait council in relation to this particular Torres Strait coastal protection work. So the member for Leichhardt really has a gall to come into this chamber and say to us that we should be providing all this money when he and all those opposite voted against the very $5 million that is being funded under the Regional Development Australia fund, opposing every last dollar and cent for the Torres Strait coastal protection works. They are not acknowledging the fact that the Torres Strait Island Regional Council actually put a proposal to the federal government asking for the $5 million. Those opposite say we should be providing $24 million. There is no recognition of the fact that their governmentthe LNP state government-has not put a brass razoo towards this project, or of the fact that the regional council said that they could get partnership leveraging funding assuming that they could get some money from the LNP state government, as we expected. But no; the LNP state government have just gutted road funding, by hundreds of millions of dollars. All those members opposite who say that we should be putting more money into infrastructure in Queensland should take note of the fact that their state colleagues are gutting road and infrastructure funding in Queensland. We called on them to put the $12 million into this project in the Torres Strait at the same time as we have doubled funding for infrastructure in Queensland: $8.5 billion for road, rail and port infrastructure. But those opposite not only voted against that in terms of the Regional Development Australia Fund that we are providing for the Torres Strait Island Regional Council they voted against every last dollar and cent that we are putting into Queensland in that regard. If anybody should hang their heads in shame, it should be the member for Leichhardt and all his LNP comrades and colleagues from Queensland, who opposed this funding. We are happy to work and provide funding for regional Australia and the Torres Strait to take action in relation to the damaging effects of climate change in the Torres Strait and all of Queensland. We are prepared to do it. We are partnering with the local councils, whether it is the Somerset Regional Council, the Ipswich City Council or the Torres Strait. Those opposite are opposing every dollar and cent. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. As we now understand from the report into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which was tabled earlier this morning, the public is ready to do the right thing and remove discrimination from our marriage laws. Sixty-four per cent of the people who responded to the survey conducted by the committee supported this bill, and over a quarter of a million people responded to the survey, the biggest ever response for a House of Representatives inquiry. The Australian population has moved on. The Australian population is relaxed about someone marrying the person that they love. But we should support this bill not just because it is popular but because it is right. Love is a powerful force. Love knows no boundaries. It knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts throughout history to limit love, and all have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail yet again and that full marriage equality will become a reality. It is important, not just because we can no longer continue to discriminate against people just because of who they love it is also important because who are we in parliament to tell people in this country that the person they love is not someone they can celebrate their love with in front of their friends and in front of their families simply because of their sexuality? That ultimately is the issue. The arguments against this bill ultimately come down to an argument against same-sex-attracted people themselves and their relationships. It is more than just preserving people's individual rights, though. It is more than giving effect to what the Australian public wants. It is also sending a very, very important message, from this parliament out to the community, that we believe that love is equal. As we speak, there is no doubt a boy in a country town who is working out who he is attracted to; there is a girl at high school who is wanting to invite her partner to the school formal and has been told she cannot do it because her partner is a girl. When we have same-sex-attracted people in this country more than four times as likely to commit suicide and when we know that increases the further out that you get from the cities and into the rural and country areas, then we have an obligation in parliament to send a message to every member of the Australian community that you are valued, and that your love and the person that you choose to spend your life with are just as valuable and just as respected as anyone else's. We need to end the situation where we say that in Australia there are two classes of people and some have greater rights than",221,Private Members Business
211,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (12:01,"I move:others. It is time for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way and allow history to take its course and for parliament to give effect to the will of the Australian people. Unfortunately, we have a situation where one side of the parliament, the Labor Party, has a policy in favour of equal marriage but their members are not obliged to vote for it. Given that, and given that we have the Prime Minister, with a group of MPs, opposing change, to see reform in this parliament we are now going to be reliant on coalition members of goodwill. I know that there are members of the coalition who support this change, but we are in the situation where Labor members are able to have a free vote and the coalition, the party of freedom of choice and the party that is, supposedly, about giving its MPs the right to vote as they wish, is restricting its members from voting according to their conscience. This is the party that says that individuals should be able to do as they choose, so long as it does not harm someone else, and that freedom of choice should be paramount. It seems that stops at someone's door and you are not allowed to marry the person that you love. I hope that we see reform in this parliament. I will not be pushing this bill to a vote quickly, because at the moment that would fail, but I am confident that in this parliament we can see reform if the Leader of the Opposition allows a conscience vote. Mr Murphy: In order to allow the debate to proceed I second the bill and reserve my right to speak. the bill in its entirety. I rise to speak against the bill and to reaffirm my long-held and firm views that marriage is between a man and a woman. I rise also to acknowledge the coalition's view that we will vote on this issue as a matter of policy. We went to the last election with a firm view expressed to the Australian people that we would not be looking to change the definition of marriage and that we believe a marriage is between a man and a woman. More importantly, we believe in holding our election promises and keeping our word. Our word was that we would vote on it as a matter of policy and, despite the remonstrations of the member for Melbourne, we will not be changing our view on that. We will not be altering our view that this is a matter of policy. In line with our firm commitment to the Australian people that we made solemnly at the last election, we will adhere to the view given at the last election and we will vote against this bill and against any bills that seek to achieve the same thing by watering down in any way the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman. The marriage equality campaign has been driven by elements of our society includingand not the least being-the Greens, of which the member for Melbourne is the deputy leader. That marriage equality campaign has, deceptively, given the public the impression that discrimination still persists in Australian law for same-sex couples. Let me categorically make a statement: it does not exist; there is no discrimination at all. As family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said in his submission to the senate inquiry: In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved. I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown.

212,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Rishworth,Is the motion seconded?,224,Bills
213,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12:06,"Thank you, Madame Deputy Speaker. I rise to opposediscrimination against same-sex couples. In 2008 I was here, in the House, and I voted for the removal of 85 laws. That was supported unanimously by both sides of the House and it removed all discrimination against same-sex couples from Commonwealth law. State law was generally ahead of the Commonwealth on this, as a matter of interest, and relationship registers or their equivalents existed in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT to ensure there was no discrimination at a state or territory level. The issue that has been disingenuously pushed in our community-that this is somehow about discrimination-is patently and utterly false. No discrimination currently exists in law against same-sex couples: all have been removed. I am equally concerned about the freedom of speech aspects that have been driven by the Greens and others in this campaign for marriage equality. It has been driving a whole range of alternative voices in the debate. There has been public demonisation. People have used a whole range of dreadful labels against the likes of the Australia Christian Lobby and other supporters of marriage. In fact, Victoria's Deputy Chief Psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as a commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he simply participated in a submission to the Senate inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne Park tennis centre because she disagreed with same-sex marriage. In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in the law as the 'same as marriage' has been given, this sort of situation has arisen. Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure the church that it will never be forced to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. Yet Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. Everything that the Greens have driven out there in the public purveyance in terms of this bill has been wrong. No discrimination exists. Their campaign forcing people to move away from their jobs, forcing views to change because of this, is disingenuous at best. The coalition will not be supporting this bill in its entirety or in its piecemeal. Bill 2012. One of the lasting results of second-wave feminism in the 1970s is marriage equality. That term was used to mean equality of the sexes within marriage-something I believe we in this House all support. Some people still think that is what marriage equality means. But this seemingly innocuous term has been hijacked by those who want to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples-for the simple reason that this will maximise support. Most people support marriage and almost everyone supports equality. It sounds so reasonable. Speaking at the recent Sydney Writers' Festival, early gay-rights activist and author, and now Director of the Institute for Human Security at La Trobe University, Professor Dennis Altman, made some very candid and very revealing points in a panel on same-sex marriage. First, he correctly pointed out that marriage was established to deal with issues related to the procreation of children. Second, he wants the entire Marriage Act to be abolished, saying that marriage sends 'dangerous signals' to people who are not in long-term relationships. Same-sex marriage therefore diminishes the cultural achievement of most gay people, in particular gay men, who are actively non-monogamous and, as Altman said, 'do not need the sanctity of state",224,Bills
214,Mr Murphy (Reid) (12:11,"I rise to speak against the Marriage Equality Amendmentor church to legitimise their relationship'. He added that same-sex marriage is 'a conservative form of winning respectability'. Supporting Altman's call to remove the words 'a man and a woman' as a first step to abolishing the Marriage Act, prominent gay writer Masha Gessen attacked those who claim that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will not diminish the importance of traditional marriage, saying: 'It is a lie to say the institution of marriage won't change … We want to abolish marriage.' Her words confirm my previous speech in this House, when I said redefining marriage would change the meaning of marriage for all Australians. Effectively, it would make marriage meaningless. Given my public stand that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, I have received much feedback. Some same-sex couples have spoken to me directly of their desire to get married. But other gay individuals, echoing Dennis Altman's view, said they cannot understand how any gay person would want to embrace an unambiguously age-old heterosexual institution. I have found that most of the support for same-sex marriage has come from people who are heterosexual, particularly young people, including teenagers, who have abstract and less developed notions of equality based on inexperience. Some supporters of same-sex marriage were downright abusive and intolerant of my view, and made it clear that they will never vote for me unless I support their view. That is their right, of course, and I do accept this. However, I do not accept that the move to change the Marriage Act to accommodate same-sex couples is a matter of equality or human rights. It is not about equality for all since there has never been marriage equality, as I outlined in detail in my previous speech on this matter. Marriage, in my view, is therefore only possible between two people of the opposite sex. Marriage as a legal institution corresponds to the reality of what marriage is: the unique sharing by a man and a woman in all aspects of life. However, the purpose of marriage as a legal institution relates specifically to the distinctive biological possibilities of this union. Some people say, wrongly, that this means couples who do not produce children are not really married. Whether or not children are produced does not change this, as I can attest from my own circumstances on this very day-the 29th anniversary of my marriage to Adriana. Happy anniversary, Honey. People who want to redefine marriage claim that this will affect only a small number of Australians. In fact, the opposite is true. The definition of an institution determines the way society relates to that institution. Without children, there is no need for marriage. Marriage serves the public interest by connecting mothers and fathers and their children, and holding biological parents accountable for raising their children. That is the crux of this matter. very respectful and moderate manner, which is the tone that I believe is required in our community on this very sensitive issue. For the record, I support the recognition of legal rights within same-sex relationships, but I do not support proposals to change the Marriage Act. I am also on the public record in the past as having expressed my support for all political parties to actually grant their members a conscience vote on this issue. My view of a conscience vote may be different from some other members, but it is my view that a conscience vote is not that straightforward. I believe that members should examine their own",225,Bills
215,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (12:17,"In joining this debate, I do intend to participate in apersonal views on a topic but also recognise the views of their electorates, and recognise their role, duty and responsibility as members of parliament. I think in all good conscience, as a representative of a particular seat, we need to recognise that different electorates have different views on this issue and we need to balance those two issues-our personal views and those of our electorates-and, if there is a conflict, maybe face a tough decision as an individual. I have previously sought the views of my electorate in relation to this issue in a community survey. Like other members, I have received petitions both for and against this topic. My own survey attracted about 700 responses. But I do point out that the survey was self-selecting; it appeared in a newspaper so it should not be regarded as a scientific opinion poll by any stretch. I did receive strong feedback and 64 per cent of respondents to that survey in my electorate were opposed to the same-sex marriage. I am not using that today as a reason to justify my position; I am just putting it out there as a matter of course that different electorates have different views. The Gippsland electorate, overall, is opposed to same-sex marriage as it stands today, and they support the current system that is in place. I have received many emails both for and against the topic. The majority of emails from within my electorate have been supportive of my position-that is, to continue with the current system and to oppose to same-sex marriage. But that is not the sole basis of my opposition to the changes to the Marriage Act. I believe that as a matter of political consistency and as a reflection on my own role here and my own personal integrity, it would be inappropriate for me as the member for Gippsland to support any changes in this current term of parliament, because I expressed a view in opposition to same-sex marriage in the lead-up to the last election. Unlike the Prime Minister and her breach of trust in relation to the carbon tax, if I intend to change my position the only fair thing to do for the people of Gippsland would be to take a principled course of action and campaign on that basis in the lead-up to the next election, and then adopt that position in a future parliament, just as the member of the Melbourne has done in his own seat. The member for Melbourne, who has put forward this bill today, to his credit had a principled view. That is his view. He took it to his voters and they voted for him, so I have no grudge to bear against the member for Melbourne for taking his position forward. But the position I took forwardand I will be principled in that position for the people of Gippsland-is to remain in opposition to changes to the Marriage Act. There is only a short amount of time to examine the issues here today, and I am sure there will be future opportunities to debate this issue, but I want to refer to one area of concern that bothers me in relation to these proposed changes, and that is this issue of retrospectivity. I believe there is an element of retrospectivity in the proposals to change the definition under the Marriage Act, and that is because there are millions of Australian couples today who signed up to marriage under the current definition. If we change the definition of marriage under the Marriage Act, we are fundamentally altering the nature of the contract that they have entered into, so I think there is an element of retrospectivity to this debate and to the legislation that is proposed. I know that for a lot of people that is of no consequence whatsoever, and I acknowledge that. They are completely comfortable with such a change, and that does not affect their definition or their own relationship. But for others in the community this is a very big deal indeed, and they have expressed that opinion to me quite strongly. They signed up for marriage under the current definition, and they believe in the sanctity of that definition and the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman. I also do not accept the view put forward by others that it is some form of discrimination against same-sex couples to maintain the consistent approach of the current definition and protect the position of couples who have already been married under the existing Marriage Act. I also do not accept the view of some people who have contacted my office, who try to infer that being opposed to same-sex means you are bigoted or homophobic. I do not believe that is a fair assumption to draw. I think it is possible to be opposed to same-sex marriage and still support the urgency of some ongoing efforts, both within my community and more broadly, to work together as a community to support same-sex couples, particularly in regional areas, where younger gay people are over-represented in the incidence of self-harm, mental illness and suicide. SoI will continue to participate in this debate. I believe it is an important debate, and I believe it is critical for members to be very moderate and respectful in their language and not to inflame what can be a very divisive issue in our communities. (Time expired) a woman. friends living in loving, monogamous same-sex relationships, and I respect and love them. They are cherished, and their love should be accepted, honoured and understood. I love my sister-in-law Rhonda and her partner, Marion. I have friends like Andrew, Clinton and others. But, respectfully, I do not agree with same-sex marriage. As a member of the Australian Labor Party and this government, I was very pleased to vote for more than 80 pieces of legislative amendment which removed discrimination on issues such as immigration, superannuation and the like-without dissension from those opposite. There have been many wild and ridiculous claims in relation to these matters, on both sides. For instance, from those more fundamentalist extremists from a religious point of view, there have been some ridiculous claims in relation to polygamy et al. This is simply nonsense. I think they are repugnant and really quite disingenuous in relation to their position. But equally, for those people who have argued that this is solely about marriage equality, I think that that same comment in relation to being disingenuous is also the case. For instance, we do not have a situation in this country where one man can marry one woman and then be married to a second woman. That is bigamy, an offence in Australian law. We have prohibitions on marriage between people in close blood relationships. We also have a situation where we have restrictions on the capacity of children to marry. I think it is a clever marketing ploy. I tip my hat to it, but I think that it is disingenuous to argue that it is solely about marriage equality. I think that marriage between a man and a woman was in the mind of the framers of the Australian Constitution when they enumerated section 51. It gave the power to the new Commonwealth government to legislate in relation to divorce and marriage. I think there is considerable argument in relation to the capacity of the Commonwealth government to legislate in the area of same-sex marriage.",226,Bills

217,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12:22,"Like many people in this House, I have relatives andAs a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs we saw real dispute on this particular matter with constitutional limits of the Commonwealth government to make laws in this area. In written and oral submissions there were disagreements in relation to this. Ultimately, if the House of Representatives and the Senate pass legislation, I am sure that those constitutional limits will be tested in the High Court. But steeped in history, in religion, in culture and in our law is the concept of the old definition that marriage is between a man and a woman. That cannot be denied. It is part of our history and our tradition going back to ancient times. It is part of English law and Australian law. I do not ever think that the framers of the Constitution thought that the Commonwealth government had the power to deal with this issue. It has significant repercussions to our society. I believe that a marriage between a man and a women is a fundamental institution of our society. I cast no criticism on those people who find love-no matter how they find it-in adult relationships. I have acted for plenty of people in same-sex relationships when I was a practising lawyer in the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. I know many colleagues from my days as a lawyer who were in same-sex relationships. But fundamentally, before we mess with the concept of marriage held by so many Australians, we need widespread and strong community consensus. We do not have it; therefore, I do not support the bill. (Time expired) Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (12:27): I too rise to oppose the bill. I understand there have been a number of speakers who have put this view this morning. I think it is very important that opposition to the bill is articulated clearly in this place, because this is a contested issue in our community at this time. I have had very vigorous communication from a large number of members in my community seeking me to stand and defend the current definition of marriage on their behalf. I know that there will be tabling of documents today regarding an inquiry into this bill and data related to that. I can reflect from my own local community that 70 per cent of the people who have communicated with my office on this matter oppose any change to the current definition of marriage. I would like to also make an observation from conversations with people in my local community. This is often an issue where views that hold to the current definition are ascribed to older people who are somewhat out of touch with the current values and milieu of our society. In fact, the reality is that there are many young people who speak to me as well. There are many people who absolutely applaud the Labor federal government's amendments to legislation in our very first term to ensure equality before the law. The reality is that they accept that, they are proud of that and they absolutely want to go on the record as having no opposition to homosexuality but much the contrary: to be very clear in their support for the current definition of marriage. I also want to indicate the large number of submissions that came to the inquiry from the Sikh community, from Uniting Care and also from that great supporter of community social justice, the Salvation Army. I again put on the record my opposition to the bill. Debate adjourned. Military Superannuation Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Oakeshott: That this House: (1) recognises the: (a) involvement of Australian service men and women in war and peacekeeping operations; and (b) role of family, friends and community networks in supporting those Australians who have served in our military; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) consider increasing the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme Pension, Defence Force Retirement Benefit Pension and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Pension twice annually by the greatest of the Consumer Price Index, the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index and the Male Total Average Weekly Earnings; and (b) do this in recognition of the unique circumstances of military service compared to all others within the public service. regard to military superannuation and the many concerns in the community in relation to equity and justice within the military superannuation scheme. There is a large and frustrated community of ex-service men and women who feel that the standard of living entitlements are not keeping pace with existing fundamentals within the military superannuation scheme. This motion was, effectively, put through this very chamber nearly three years ago by me and was passed with the full support of the House. Yet we still see frustration, concern and a very active campaign, particularly online, of the ex-service community, who want to see more access to equity and justice. I accept that there are some realities that government does need to deal with in considering any changes. They relate to cost and, if Parliamentary Library figures are to be believed, there are some substantial costs in relation to any changes in this area. There are issues in relation to impacts on the cash balance and the fiscal balance. There are issues in relation to clawback within the scheme, acknowledging that any increases do potentially have an impact on other arrangements such as those to do with age pension payments. That does need to be sensitively considered through any changes in this regard. Also, there has been ongoing debate since the early 1970s in relation to establishing the appropriate link between indexation with regard to the military superannuation pension and the issue of purchasing power to guard against erosion by inflation. Report after report has been unable to resolve this issue of a link. The use of CPI methodology is based on recommendations of Professor AH Pollard in 1973. It has been challenged in reports such as the Jess review of 1970. There were Senate select committee reports in 2001 and 2002 and in 2008 there was a Senate standing committee report. ABS is still grappling with it, the Podger review grappled with it, all the way through to the Matthews report in 2008, and remained unable to resolve this issue of how to adequately link military superannuation schemes with those issues around purchasing power and the CPI. I accept the difficulty in dealing with this issue. However, there are many in the community who are aggrieved and their concerns deserve to be heard in this House. There are many who are frustrated that government, report after report, seems to get the concerns about a lack of purchasing power within the current military superannuation scheme, yet, when it comes to actually doing something about it, the arguments of cost and difficulty in making those changes seem to be directed towards those who have done military service. So there is, I",228,Bills

I ask the government to consider this again and I hope this motion has the full support of the House. pensions to be moved in the last four years. The first was moved by the member for Lyne, the second was moved by me and now the member for Lyne has moved a third motion. I suggest this one will also be agreed to by all members.

I introduced a private member's bill, through Senator Ronaldson, in the Senate to achieve the very issue we are talking about now. Even though the government agreed twice previously-in the member for Lyne's motion and my motion, which were exactly the same thing, to index DFRDB by the same mechanism as the age pension-on the voices in the last two motions, when a private member's bill went up to achieve the outcome, the government voted against it. The government has form on this. In 2007 they went to the election promising to fix military superannuation, and they did not. They failed. They failed the veterans of Australia. In 2010, Tony Abbott went to the election with a policy to index DFRDB. On the back of that announcement at the 2010 election, we took a private member's bill into the Senate-because when we announce something at an election as something we are going to do, we follow through with it. But again the government voted against it, as did the Greens. Ms Burke: What did you do in 11 years in government? Eleven years of inaction! Yet even in the Greens policy it says quite clearly: Australian Greens leader Bob Brown wrote to Minister Tanner earlier this year to urge him to reconsider the government's response to the Matthews' review and revise the indexation for Defence Force superannuation pensions. We strongly believe that the Government should now act to provide wage-based indexation on the same terms as the Aged Pension… That is straight from the Greens policy, and yet when we put forward a private member's bill in the Senate, the Greens voted it down. They voted against their own policy. That is how disingenuous the coalition partner of the Labor Party, the Greens, are. Bob Brown said, 'We can't afford it.' The government said it will cost $175 million; we need savings. As part of the private member's bill that was taken up in 2011 to index DFRDB pensions, $300 million worth of savings were found over the forward estimates by reducing the increase in the public service from 12.4 per cent to a miserly 8.4 per cent-a fairly strong increase nonetheless-but there was a four per cent decrease in the growth of the public service within the Department of Defence. That was yielding about $300 million worth of savings-twice the amount of savings needed to pay for the coalition's DFRDB policy. And still the Greens-and, indeed, Senator Xenophon-voted against it. The government said the savings were not real and then three or four months later the Minister for Defence stood up and said, 'I'm here to announce $300 million worth of savings by tapering off the increase in the public service, taking out a",230,Private Members Business

The level of disingenuousness of this government is completely and utterly staggering. We believe in the unique nature of service. IfI look at the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations in the inquiry of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on the coalition's bill, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations stated: In no other calling, occupation or profession has the State the power to accept or demand the surrender of these rights. The Unique Nature of Military Service deserves unique solutions and also places a great burden on the Government as the ""employer” to ensure that ADF members are looked after both during and after Service. The RSL further said as a submission to the Senate inquiry: An examination of legislation for the Australian Defence Force shows that in almost all respects, the Parliament has been consistent since Federation in regarding the nation's armed forces as a separate and quite distinctly different part of Australian society. We agree with them that the military is required to do a range of actions on behalf of the nation and that that service is unique. We believe in the unique nature of military service. We accept the concept of the unique nature of military service. We have seen it in action. We have experienced it. We have committed to it, which is why we once again commit upon government that we will fairly index the DFRDB. respect to Defence and veterans' policy over a number of years so I think that it is important in that context that we explain a little bit of that history. It is an issue which governments have grappled with not just over the last four or five years but quite a while before then, and I draw this particular point in those circumstances. Those who come here today, as the member for Fadden has done, and state that without doubt, unequivocally, the coalition will act upon the commitment they have now made, needs to remember that for 11 years they did not do it. It was not an issue that was raised only in the last four to five years; it was an issue raised regularly over the previous decade. Throughout the previous decade the coalition government, of which for most of that period the now opposition leader was a member of cabinet, said no. I have even seen recent comments which have suggested that the former foreign minister, Alexander Downer, has suddenly had a conversion on the road to Damascus and now thinks that this is an issue that needs to be acted upon. I have got to give marks though to the former finance minister, former Senator Nick Minchin, who at least has had the courage of his convictions to be consistent with respect to this issue when recently he wrote in a letter that was printed which said: It is easy to feel sympathy for the demands made by retired defence personnel for improved superannuation ... However, all claims made upon the public purse, even those by retired defence personnel, should be considered rigorously and on their merits. This particular claim was properly rejected by the Howard government, of which I was a member, as well as by the Labor government. There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the aged pension.",231,Private Members Business
221,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12:40,"This has been a vexed issue for this parliament withDefence personnel have their superannuation payments indexed the same way that all other commonwealth public servants on defined-benefit schemes have their payments indexed. The payments are maintained in real terms, which is what they signed up for. Changing the indexation for defence personnel would create immediate demands for the same change to be made for all other former commonwealth employees, at a potentially enormous cost to taxpayers. The government should continue to reject this demand. That is the position of Nick Minchin, former senator, former finance minister, long-time member of the cabinet of the previous government, long-time cabinet colleague of the now opposition leader who has done an amazing backflip compared to his past. Others-and there may be some here-would remember not only that, but that when he was minister for employment and workplace relations, his department actually put forward a submission in respect of considering related issues around the question of compensation in which he argued that defence personnel and people in that area should be treated no differently from other Commonwealth employees. So we have seen a change, and I think that is something that really needs to be remembered by the defence community. Is military service unique-yes, it is. What do you then do to recognise that uniqueness? A range of things can be done, and a range of things have been done. For example, there is the capacity to access superannuation at an earlier stage under the scheme we are talking about than is the case overwhelmingly for people in the public sector. The fact is that there are various compensatory payments made through the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the impacts of military service. It is recognised. I would like to address one point that was made in passing, which was the claim that I as a shadow minister prior to the 2007 election went around the country spruiking the fact that we would make changes with respect to this policy. That is incorrect. I must admit that I did when asked on rare occasions make the point that we were committed to a review of superannuation indexation arrangements. That review occurred and was acted on. A set of decisions were made that are well known to the Defence community, decisions that they were not happy with. But the fact that there was a commitment to a review does not commit us to change. I certainly made that point on a number of occasions prior to the 2007 election. I understand the concerns that have been raised by the veteran community. I support their right to pursue those concerns. I wish them well. But we need to try to remove some of the hypocrisy from the arguments that have been put by those opposite about this serious issue. veterans and their families deserve a fair go. This motion addresses many serious issues for the Ryan electorate and I thank the member for Lyne for putting this motion today. My office has received literally hundreds of emails and telephone calls regarding fair indexation and the government's failure to appropriately deal with this issue. Fair indexation is one of the most important issues affecting the veteran and ex-service community. I spoke in my maiden speech about Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, which is in the Ryan electorate, and I acknowledged the very valued contribution made by their service men and women. In that speech, I recommitted again to fair indexation of the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme, the DFRBS, and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme,",232,Private Members Business
222,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (12:45,"I rise today to speak on this motion because Australia'sThe coalition believes in the unique nature of military service and believes that current indexation, which utilises the CPI alone, does not adequately reflect changes in the cost of living of ex-service men and women, Australians who have given much to their nation. Fortunately, I am pleased to reconfirm that the coalition has a positive plan to address this problem. This is not a new issue. The Leader of the Opposition announced prior to the 2010 federal election that military superannuation pensions would be fairly indexed. The coalition acted on 18 November 2010 when we introduced into the Senate the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010. But it was a shameful day for the Australian Senate and for Australia when Labor and the Greens combined to vote down this bill. That was a clear demonstration that the Prime Minister, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens are not committed to improving the lives of military superannuants and their families. On 14 March this year, I recommitted to the reform of military superannuation pensions when I signed the coalition's pledge to continue our commitment to Australia's veterans. This pledge has also been signed by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and many other members of the coalition. That pledge says: 'The coalition will ensure DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as age and service pensions. All DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will benefit.' If we had a government that was capable and responsible, a government that knew how to manage the economy for all Australians, then finding this funding for military superannuants would not be difficult. In fact, it would be paramount. This government is splashing $56 billion plus on the NBN without even referring it to the Productivity Commission but says that it cannot afford to fund this change, which is critical for equity and justice. The government demonstrated their lack of commitment in this year's budget by announcing that they wish to seek to maintain a yet-to-be-delivered surplus by deferring spending of $33.7 million on compensation arrangements for veterans and giving higher priority to cost blow-outs in immigration detention centres and carbon tax advertisements. This is a slap in the face to veterans. Veterans with whom I have spoken have said how offended they are about these delays. It is simply not appropriate to delay changes recommended in the Campbell review for two years until July 2014 while at the same time wasting taxpayers' money on carbon tax advertisements. This government clearly has its priorities wrong when it comes to doing the right thing for veterans. It is absolutely crucial that the government commit to fully support fair and just military superannuation pensions. It is clear, however, that the only way to deliver this very important reform is to change the government. Should the coalition be elected into government by the Australian people, we will look after all military superannuants and their families because that is the right and just thing to do. Ms BURKE (Chisholm-Deputy Speaker) (12:50): I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Lyne. Thank you very much for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House. Having had the benefit of being in the parliament for 14 years, unlike the two previous speakers, I know that this is not a new issue; it is not something that has just sprung from a well that someone has decided to do something about. Indeed, one of the big problems with this is that for 11 years under the Howard government nothing was done. Promise after promise was made and review after review was held. The Podger review came out. It was not even released. No-one talked about it. This festering sore of an issue has been allowed to gather steam. The difficulty is that nobody has said no. One thing in life that you do not want to hear is 'No'. Nobody has mounted the case as to why this should not happen. They have promised reviews. Indeed, Labor was at fault in this as well-we promised and had a review, the Matthews review. The Matthews review said that there should be no change. We have built up a level of expectation among our service men and women, and that is unfair. Our service men and women deserve better than that. They deserve an answer one way or another and not this continual playing of politics with their lives. It has been an ongoing debate, with several reviews. For the last speaker to make statements about what the next coalition government will do is cant hypocrisy, because they never did it in the past. Indeed, changing indexation methodology may be inappropriate, inequitable for other Commonwealth superannuants and indeed very costly. Where will the money be found? The men and women of our Defence Forces do an amazing job. We should not be playing around with their service. We should recognise it and not use it as a political football. They need to understand that the benefits that they receive are above and beyond those of other people-as they should be, because what they do for their country is above and beyond that of other people. They receive currently higher employer contribution rates of 18 per cent to 20 per cent depending on service time, compared with the nationally legislated rate of nine per cent, which is going to become 12 per cent. There are sovereign guarantees within the fund so that their rates do not go up and down with fluctuations in the market. They can receive lump sum payments. They can access, as they should, their superannuation immediately upon service retirement. They do not have to wait until reaching preservation age as others do. Understandably, this is a matter that many people feel passionately about. I have had many discussions with my service veteran communities. We need to see the best outcome for those in retirement. It needs to be clarified that superannuation retirement pay is not the same as the age pension. Superannuation is an employment based benefit whereas the age pension is a means tested income support payment that is part of our social security system. I say to many in my electorate: 'You never want to be on a pension. Work hard and never end up on a pension.' We should not be comparing these two benefits. They are not the same. These payments serve different purposes and are provided for different reasons. It is not relevant to compare indexation, as indeed Nick Minchin has stated quite eloquently, with the member for Bruce reading that into the Hansard. It is not relevant to compare them. For many people, the age pension is their only source of income. For many Defence personnel, their Defence Force super is not their only source of income. However, there are individuals who are receiving less than or the equivalent of the age pension on their Defence Force super. Indeed, many in my electorate who have Commonwealth superannuation are receiving less than or the equivalent of the age pension. We need to deal with that issue. But that is a separate issue. Let us deal with that lingering sore but not by taking up a sledgehammer-which many want to do-to change indexation. Let us deal with those people who are caught in a bind and not put a huge impost upon the budget by going a different route-a route the coalition never chose when they were in government. We need to be seeking the right and just income for our service men and women because they have done so much for us. In his 2008 Review of Pension Indexation Arrangements in Australian Government Civilian and Military Superannuation Schemes-a review the ALP said it would do upon coming to governmentMr Matthews said: … it would need to be generally accepted that an employer retains a responsibility to compensate former employees for improvements in productivity, as reflected in salary rises, which occur after an employee leaves them. This is not a generally accepted responsibility in Australia. The view from Matthews was that you cannot keep compensating people. The difficulty with the compensation issue is that it will reward those on the highest income and will actually not fix those who are left behind at the bottom. (Time expired) and proper thing by veterans as far as their superannuation entitlements are concerned. I acknowledge what the member for Chisholm has just said. If that is so, let us work together as a parliament for those people she rightly praised in her speech. For people who have bravely and willingly laid their lives on the line for their country, the present indexation levels are unacceptable and need to be rectified. The government's continued refusal to pay adequate and fair compensation to ex-service personnel raises many questions. Why does the government continue to discriminate against military superannuants by not indexing their superannuation to retain purchasing power, as promised by their employer when they joined their respective service? Why do the minister and his department continue to neglect the nation's obligation to honour enlistment conditions-contract vested property-and engage instead in continuous extraneous rhetoric, spin and political posturing? Serving and retired members of the Australian Defence Force should not be treated as second-class citizens. This is a big issue for the Riverina and for Wagga Wagga, a triservice city, because many defence people retire to the region because of the quality of the regional lifestyle. If fair indexation is affordable for some 3½ million age pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries, and if generous indexation is affordable for certain parliamentary and judicial superannuation pensioners, why is fair indexation not affordable for military superannuation pensioners? Australian Defence Force people deserve substance, not a so-called fact sheet, the contents of which can be disputed all the way through. Our veterans served their country selflessly and at great personal risk, as we all know too well. In retirement, they, their widows and their families deserve to have their employment conditions honoured as faithfully as they provided their gallant service. As a condition of employment, fair indexation must be a nondiscretionary obligation in the budget. Surely in a country such as ours, where a fair go is one of the cornerstones of our culture, just things such as this are always affordable. When will the government take real action to fix this? Why does the government permit a military condition of service to continue to be breached? The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who claims to be well aware of the concerns of the veteran community, would surely understand this. This condition of service provides for retirement pay, a superannuation pension which maintains its purchasing power. Service people themselves compulsorily contribute to it. The nation is duty bound to honour that employment condition; ipso facto, the budget should provide-veterans argue-for fair indexation as a nondiscretionary item before other discretionary items.",233,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For
223,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (12:55,"This Labor government has not done the rightFair indexation of military superannuation pensions is not a new or improved benefit but a condition of employment. It has been and remains a condition of military service that superannuation pensions maintain their purchasing power. That is why the parliament made provision for that to be done when the schemes were established. This was an employment condition, if you like, or contract which established vested property at the time of enlistment. The cost to provide for fair indexation to meet that condition of service is estimated by the coalition at $100 million over four years before clawbacks-a figure supported by renowned economic commentator Peter Thornton. Of course, any cost to the taxpayer is moot given that proper indexation was a condition of employment and is thus, or should be-according to those who stand to lose out if this issue is not addressed-a nondiscretionary obligation on the public purse. The government's continuing refusal to address this issue cannot be reconciled with Labor's current platform which says it will 'continue to explore equitable and affordable mechanisms for the improvement' of military pensions. Failure to justly index military superannuation pensions comes at a significant cost to veterans' purchasing power. That cost for an average superannuant on $23,000 per annum who has been retired for 15 years is the loss of some $280 per fortnight in real purchasing power which they would have had if their super had been justly indexed at the same rate as age pensioners. With the cost of living increasing all the time and the carbon tax-certain to place even greater pressures on those relying on a pension to make ends meet-real purchasing power becomes an even more burdensome, everyday issue. Fair indexation of military superannuation pensions to maintain their purchasing power is a founding principle of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, and Military Superannuation and Benefits acts. This purchasing power is a condition of service and veterans plan their lives in retirement on that basis. Australia has a magnificent record of service in war and peacekeeping operations since Federation, with nearly 1½ million serving. The sacrifice made by their families has also been enormous. It is now time to honour that service with fair indexation. I support this motion and I call on the government to do the right thing by our retired military personnel. This is about equity and justice for those frustrated veterans who are out of pocket and because they have been let down, unfairly, by this Labor government. Debate adjourned. Autism Spectrum Disorder Debate resumed on motion by Mr Hunt: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnoses are on the rise, with the latest estimates of approximately 1 in 100 children diagnosed; and (b) families caring for a family member with an Autism Spectrum Disorder need greater support and community understanding; (2) acknowledges the need for a National Autism Plan, including a Forum, to discuss how best to deliver support to families caring for a family member with an Autism Spectrum Disorder; (3) notes that: (a) an Autism Spectrum Disorder is one of numerous disability categories which should be addressed as part of a National Disability Insurance Scheme; and (b) 2 April 2012 is World Autism Awareness Day and that the Coalition and Autism Victoria are working to ensure Parliament House will be lit up in blue to acknowledge World Autism Awareness Day. reads in the past tense. Leave granted. That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnoses are on the rise, with the latest estimates of approximately 1 in 100 children diagnosed; and (b) families caring for a family member with an Autism Spectrum Disorder need greater support and community understanding; (2) acknowledges the need for a National Autism Plan, including a Forum, to discuss how best to deliver support to families caring for a family member with an Autism Spectrum Disorder; (3) notes that: (a) an Autism Spectrum Disorder is one of numerous disability categories which should be addressed as part of a National Disability Insurance Scheme; and (b) 2 April 2012 was World Autism Awareness Day and that the Coalition and Autism Victoria were working to ensure Parliament House will be lit up in blue to acknowledge World Autism Awareness Day. This motion is all about ensuring that there is even greater focus on the condition of autism spectrum disorder, that we acknowledge the circumstances of families with autism spectrum disorder within their midst, that we acknowledge the need for a national autism plan, building on those elements that are already in place, and we include as part of that a specific national autism forum. In addition, we note that autism spectrum disorder is one of numerous disability categories, which should be considered as part of a national disability insurance scheme, and that 2 April was World Autism Awareness Day. Let me begin by acknowledging the work of the coalition shadow in this space, Senator Mitch Fifield, and the cooperation that Senator McLucas has given on behalf of the government. I respect and appreciate their commitment. This motion is about a bipartisan approach; it is certainly not about anything which could be seen to undermine that approach. The starting point here is that autism spectrum disorder affects about 30,000 Victorians, on the basis of the advice we have from Murray Dawson-Smith at Autism Victoria. It is a lifelong condition; it is not, however, a lifelong sentence. It is something to be managed and to be negotiated, and the spectrum is just that it is broad. There are numerous different circumstances that individuals and families face in relation to autism. During a recent visit to Abacus Learning Centre, I was lucky enough to meet three-year-old Charlie and his mother, Nicole. I joined Charlie for his therapy sessions. I saw for myself the painstaking work carried out by early intervention therapists and the benefits that therapy can bring to a family affected by autism. That all lead to the proposal that we had for an autism walk around my electorate. We walked 500 kilometres, visited 56 schools and, most importantly, spoke with thousands of",236,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For

225,Mr Hunt,"I move:young students about autism-respecting those who have it and helping them aspire to their best. The critical thing that we learned and which was given to them was this sense of possibility and of potential for each young life affected by autism. On the walk, I had me Marilyn Myszka, Natalie Durkovic, Nicole Devine and Sue DeBono, all of whom walked numerous kilometres-in the case of Marilyn, Natalie and Sue, well over 200 kilometres each, and 300 in the case of my good friend Sue DeBono. It was a real pleasure. Marilyn, Natalie and Nicole are all mothers of boys with autism. Each contributed to the walk in a profound way and contributed to local understanding. At the end of the day, we were able to raise over $35,000 to be shared between Autism Victoria and the magnificent Abacus Learning Centre, which has literally transformed the lives of so many young people with autism in my electorate. In particular, we were fortunate to receive $10,000 from Medibank Private and $5,000 from the Victorian government. I thank both of those organisations and in particular Mary Wooldridge, the state minister who oversaw that contribution. What we agreed on, though, was that it had to be more than just fine words. It was about next steps. That is where this motion comes in. What we want to do is make sure that there is the push for an advanced national autism plan. I acknowledge the work that governments of all levels, including the current government, have done in this space. I made a commitment to the relevant parliamentary secretary that I would acknowledge the good work of the government. It is now the moment where we can seek more, where we can be higher and where we can be better in what we do. My view is that to seek out a national autism plan, including a forum, as to how best to deliver long-term, permanent support to families caring for a member that has autism spectrum disorder is the great step forward. I look at the work of the Abacus centre and see what parents such as Michael and Lauren Moore have done and the way in which early intervention is fundamental. What we need now is a long-term approach about early intervention because, of all the investments we can make as a society, investing in these young people is about unparalleled lifelong transformation which makes us the best that we can be as a society. (Time expired) amendment seconded? that autism spectrum disorder diagnoses are on the rise, and nowhere greater than the Hunter Valley. Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that not only affects the individual but the parents, the family and our community as a whole and therefore needs greater support and community understanding. Whilst it was fitting that 2 April 2012 was World Autism Awareness Day, it was more fitting that in April 2012 the new Aspect Hunter School was handed over for occupation. There is a story about the Aspect Hunter School that is worth telling to this House. In August 2010 I met with a constituent, Tim Austin. He was desperate and despaired that there was no suitable school for his autistic son, Joe. The Autism Spectrum Australia Aspect Hunter School was without a permanent home. They were being evicted from its base at Shortland Public School and a satellite classroom at Tighes Hill Public School the next year. Because of the stimulus package building works, those schools had pushed them out.",238,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For

227,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (13:06,"I second the amendment. There is absolutely no doubtDuring the meeting I called a friend, Hilton Grugeon, and asked if he knew of a block of land that we could acquire to build a school on, and whether he could help build the school. He said yes. I asked, 'How much?' He said, 'How much do you have?' I said, 'Very little.' There was a moment's silence and then he said, 'Okay, let's build a school.' When I advised Tim during this initial meeting that we were going to build a school for the kids and for the parents who have to deal with the lifelong challenges of autism, he thought I was kidding. SoI put the phone on loudspeaker. Hilton told him, 'We're going to build a school for the kids.' He broke down and he cried. The die was set. By the next morning, through the generosity of Richard Owens, 14 acres of land was donated for the school. Planning had begun. The school was designed. The school has six classrooms, each with a bathroom. There is a sensory room, a school hall and an administration block for 60 teaching and support staff. The school caters for 40 students onsite and 100 in outreach programs run from the school. The project, land and building value was in excess of $5 million, yet Aspect had only attracted $1.8 million in Commonwealth government funding. There was a serious shortfall. It was decided that we would put the call out to businesses and the broader community for support for our kids. That support came. Through Hilton Grugeon's 'Hunter nearly-everything' group of companies-for example, Hunter Readymixed Concrete, Hunter Buildings, Steeline Hunter, Hunter Quarries, and Hunter Irrigation and Water Solutions-and the very generous in kind support from dozens of other suppliers, we were able to start. As we told the story, financial support in cash came from Hilton and Bev Grugeon, Jeff and Tracy McCloy, Michael and Felicity Thompson-it just came forth. It is hard to say no to this very worthwhile project. They came from all over. The tradies, the plumbers, the carpenters, the electricians, the plasterers, the painters and even East Maitland Men's Shed all lined up to help. Even my son David Baldwin, who had finished his carpentry apprenticeship in October, worked as a full-time volunteer as a carpenter until he started his new job in late February. At 21 years of age he wanted to put something back into a community that had supported him. The earthworks began in late October, and construction began in December. The fact that it was one of our wettest summers did not deter the builders and the hundreds of volunteers. The school was handed over in April. To build a school in just over four months is an achievement in itself. Given that it was one of our wettest summers, this was a truly amazing achievement. It is clear that whenever there is a genuine community need in the Hunter the heroes in the Hunter step up to the fore and that these heroes were not going to let Hunter kids down. There is planning for an early intervention centre for a two-year-olds and up. It will cost another $750,000 to build. As the state government is yet to provide any funding towards the school, I am hopeful that it will provide the finance for this much needed project so that the school can be complete and that thereby our community can also be complete. Sadly, in December last year Tim Austin succumbed to the pressure, leaving behind his wife, Loretto, and children, Emilie and Joe. This school stands as a tribute to the tireless work of Tim Austin. It is abundantly clear that there is a need for a national autism plan, including a forum to discuss how to best deliver support to families caring for a family member with an autism spectrum disorder. That support should be addressed as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I commend the member for Flinders for bringing this motion before the House, and I support it in its entirety. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (13:11): I thank the member for Flinders for moving this motion. I have in my electorate, as there are in every electorate, a number of families who have children with autism. They are one of the most wonderful groups of parents that you can possibly imagine, and both previous speakers have referred to how extraordinary they can be. One of the things that I am very proud of in being part of this government for the last four years is the work we have done which helps empower some of those parents even further through early intervention and the development of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Sometimes we think we are pretty clever in this parliament because we allocate money and set up programs, but we all know that at the end of the day it is the work the parent does in the home and how well you can enable that parent to work with their child which makes the most difference at the end of the day. Back in 2007 in the election we announced that we would launch the Helping Children with Autism program. It was originally meant to be about $190 million; it is now sitting at about $220 million. It unashamedly focuses its efforts on early intervention. We all know that intervention in the early years makes an extraordinary difference to the life of a child with autism and to their family. There are a number of elements to the Helping Children with Autism program which we have been rolling out for quite a few years. There is the Autism Advisory and Support Service, which has some 36 centres with advisers around the country. It is a one-stop shop where a parent can go for advice on how to get assistance. We also have early intervention funding. This is quite a change from the way funding was delivered in past years. It is $12,000 per family with a child under the age of seven. It allows the child's family considerable flexibility in deciding which services-such as pathology, psychology and occupational therapy-they want for their child with autism spectrum disorder. Again, this is quite a change from past years, when the funding was attached to the service itself. It is part of the change we are undertaking which moves us to the National Disability Insurance Scheme where families will have a far greater role across the board and where the relationship between a family and the providers of the services will change in quite a significant way. We have launched Early Days workshops for parents and carers of preschool and school age children with autism spectrum disorder. We have also launched PlayConnect groups. There are about 150 playgroups around the country specifically for families and children with autism spectrum disorder. Again, both those forums-the Early Days workshops and the PlayConnect groups-provide opportunities for parents, families and carers to come together to share what they know and to feel the support of being with people who face similar kinds of challenges and joys in the raising of their children, something that again makes parents stronger as individuals and stronger as groups. One of the things that we all should acknowledge is that the more we empower parents, the more we help them actually work in the way they need to with their children, the stronger they become, not just as parents but as lobbyists as well. The stronger we make them the more they will rightfully ask of us, and that is one of the things that we will probably do that will have an incredibly profound impact in the long run. They are already one of the most extraordinary groups of parents, and they already know each other, but as they get to know exactly what is happening elsewhere, and build those networks further, they will become even stronger in their quite rightful demands for the future of their children. They are a wonderful group of people. We have also established six autism-specific early learning and care centres around the country. There is one in south-western Sydney-not one in Parramatta, unfortunately. If there is going to be a seventh one I would like to put my hand up, as I am sure we all would. These centres provide places where children with autism spectrum disorder get the specific help that they need. Their families can see their progress on a daily basis and we have had wonderful reports of how well those things are going. AgainI commend the member for Flinders for moving this motion. It is an incredibly important area. The more support we can provide early on in a child's life, the greater the possibilities of that life. I commend the motion. (Time expired) motion on autism spectrum disorder, although I have some disagreement with aspects of the detail that the member for Flinders is seeking to achieve as a result of this motion and I will come to those points. The general point about the need to ensure that there is greater awareness and support for action within the community for those who suffer from ASD and those who support them and who deal with those issues is something that I think the parliament can agree on, no question. I know a lot of work has been done, as the member for Flinders said, by governments of both persuasions over the years to try and ensure that this area gets more support. I know that the current government, of which I am very proud to be a member, has had a range of initiatives over the last few years, since 2008, under the Helping Children with Autism package. The government has provided over $220 million for services for children with ASD. That has covered a range of different issues: early intervention funding available to eligible children to increase and support access to early intervention therapies; Early Days workshops; information for parents and carers of pre-school and school aged children with ASD; an autism advisory service providing advice, information and support following diagnosis across Australia; PlayConnect playgroups-some 150 playgroups specifically for families and children with ASD or ASD-like symptoms; a website; and other positive initiatives via recognition under Medicare. More recently, as I understand it, the government has also established six autism-specific early learning and care centres which provide specific early learning programs and support to children with ASD or ASD-like symptoms in a long day care centre. But we can always look to the future and ensure that more is done. One general point I would make is about something this government has been very strong on-and I certainly congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the Hon. Jan McLucas, for the work she has done on this-and that is the development of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, to which $1 billion was allocated in the last budget. It is a step along a track, it is a track which will take some time and there are clearly a range of issues which need to be worked through. But there is no doubt that there is broad recognition within the community that a more holistic approach is needed in dealing with the needs of those with a disability, and a recognition that it is a responsibility of all levels of governments and that its time has come. It is something that we can all support. I will pick up on a couple of points that the member for Flinders had in his motion which I think need to be debated to a degree. Regarding the issue of diagnosis of ASD being on the",239,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For
228,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (13:16,"I rise in support of the concept and the issue behind therise, my understanding from the current evidence base, which the government has from its Helping Children with Autism package, would appear to suggest a prevalence rate in the order of one to 110 for children under seven. This rate has levelled off over the past three years, as it has done internationally. That does not in any way take away from the importance of the issue, but it does possibly suggest that we are getting a fairly sound understanding of the size of the problem and therefore the need for action. On the question of a national ASD plan and the holding of a forum, again we could debate the question of what we currently have and what the alternatives may be. The point I would make with respect to this is that we need to look at disabilities on an individual basis. The needs of people with disabilities should be focused on their functionality, not on the label. I think we need to look also at the question of what is coming, what is occurring from a national perspective through the NDIS, as a way forward to ensure that there is scope for all children and all people with disabilities to get the assistance that they need as part of a much bigger set of actions by government across the board. I also note that there are a number of peak bodies that represent people with ASD. They include the Australian Advisory Board on Autism Spectrum Disorders, which provides advice to government; Autism Awareness, which promotes nationally inclusion for people with ASD; and Children with Disability Australia, which represents children with ASD. The question mark I have is whether another forum will in itself produce results which are worthy of that effort. But certainly this is a motion where the concerns around autism should be made known nationally and action should be supported by all sides of the parliament. the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt, with respect to autism spectrum disorders. Depending on which research you listen to and who you talk to, autism spectrum disorders are on the rise with, as the member for Bruce just said, one in 110-some say it is one in 160-Australian children diagnosed with a disorder. These figures are increasing and the disorder is becoming more and more prevalent, particularly in First World nations such as Australia. However, research has shown that with proven early intervention measures the effects of the disorder can be significantly reduced and children are even able to rejoin mainstream schooling to continue their education. As we know, the aim of all parents involved is that their child gets to a point where they can live independently at some stage in their future. Associations such as the Autism Association of Western Australia, led by Joan McKenna Kerr, have structured their early intervention programs based on research into the most effective models of best practice. These include individual support services, highly structured and supportive environments, autism-specific content and a functional approach to behaviour management and family involvement. At this stage I would like to mention also the LEARN Foundation, which is run by Mandy Mason and her great number of supporters, which offers a choice in treatments. As I said, no one should in any way discriminate against or criticise any of the programs, other than to say that a choice and an alternative approach are always welcomed in trying to achieve the best outcome. But, as I said, this disorder is on the rise and it is essential that ongoing financial support is given to these organisations in order for them to cope with an increase in demand and the need to apply early intervention measures as early as possible.",242,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For
229,Mr Randall (Canning) (13:21,"I take the opportunity today to support the motion ofThrough the 'adopt a politician' program, five years ago I met young Dermott Barnard his family. Dermott lives with severe autism. I have witness first hand the huge impact that this has had on his family, his mum Lynn and his Elise. Dermott's mum and sister have always had his best interests at heart, but they have found it difficult to access all of the respite and support services they need to manage Dermott's disorder. Families of children living with autism often go unrecognised and miss out on the support and the respite that they often desperately need. I have heard stories from various people within my electorate who have resorted to desperate and unhelpful measures to give themselves some immediate respite. For example, a mother told me at the door that she had sat her child in front of the front load washing machine just to have him entertained for an hour or so because she could not cope any longer. In my recent Canning Walk for Autism, I was able to raise over $22,500 for the Autism Association of Western Australia and respite services such as INKA Respite in Lake Clifton. Without these small not-for-profit respite services, many families would be feeling even more desperate and might resort to even worse actions. It is also important to note that, whilst respite is needed for families and children living with autism, it is also essential that a large proportion of this respite be flexible. Flexibility is the key to this respite. This enables families to access respite when they need it and when they are most desperate, rather than having to book months ahead, when they do not necessarily need it. Having a national autism plan, including a forum, would provide the opportunity to discuss the issues further. The families of children such as Dermott would have a clearer idea of where to get further help, and it would provide a framework of the best intervention measures available. With the rate of autism spectrum disorders increasing, this action is needed now more than ever. There is no doubt that these disorders should be included as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As we are being positive today, I will say that the scheme is supported by this side of the House, although we do have some issues about the level of funding. I will not say anything further about that. But, if the scheme were implemented in full, it would provide a positive opportunity for families to get some relief. I would also like to support national recognition of World Autism Day on 2 April by lighting up the exterior of Parliament House in blue. This would significantly help raise broader awareness of the disorder, as well as reaffirm the commitment of this House to providing ongoing support and services. This year, World Autism Day fell during my Walk for Autism, and I was lucky enough to be welcomed by the students of Dale Christian School for a fundraising barbecue. I was also joined by Joan McKenna Kerr and Paul Beard from the Autism Association of WA, as well as by my colleague Christopher Pyne. He came and walked with me on that day. This significant day helped bring wider awareness, and I support this motion. (Time expired) development disorders that are apparent usually before the age of three and are overwhelmingly predominant amongst males. Whatever the country, it seems that the proportion of females with the disorder is always under about 20 per cent.

230,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (13:27,"Autism spectrum disorders are a group ofOn 26 May, I was fortunate enough to attend, with my colleague the member for Hughes, the annual gala event of the Autism Advisory and Support Service. The member for Hughes is a member of that organisation. During that evening, while discussing things with his wife, I learnt more fully-I already had some appreciation of them-of the kinds of challenges that families face in this sector. Coincidentally, last week the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers announced a $300,000 allocation towards establishing a Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism Spectrum Disorders. That is a very worthwhile gesture. The centre would have the support of 11 organisations, seven universities and one medical research institute, as well as 30 other organisations. This is in conjunction with the $1 billion over four years for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There was some speculation earlier about the reasons for increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders. Who knows whether it is because of more knowledge in the sector, a willingness of people to come forward, improved testing or some phenomena related to our environment and our lifestyle? There is a prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in south-west Sydney. People have put that down to a possible genetic connection with ethnicity, and particularly to the prevalence of public housing. One of the realities is that autism and many other of these kinds of issues lead to the separation of parents and the need for one party to go into public housing. Recently the Sydney French Film Festival featured the film Declaration of War by Valerie Donzelli. It was not about autism but it certainly drove home this issue. It was an account of the director's life as a young mother and the break-up of her relationship in connection with a child who had issues. The Autism Advisory and Support Service is based in Liverpool. It has had a strong connection with me, the member for Hughes and the member for Fowler. The parliamentary secretary was there and she is certainly aware of the organisation's services and issues. At the moment, they are seeking a meeting with the parliamentary secretary to drive home their concerns. I particularly appreciate that a group of families in south-west Sydney can accomplish what they have, using volunteers to get off the ground, establish premises and run a 24-hour telephone service which is utilised nationally. They are heavily involved in a variety of other activities. There is a young adults-over 16 years old-peer group that meets every second Sunday and a family support group that meets twice a month. They have obtained significant support from a number of organisations, such as the Mounties clubotherwise known as Mount Pritchard-Canterbury League Club and Bunnings. The event that we attended in May was again this year a very successful fundraiser. It enjoys very significant broad public support. The facility at Liverpool is first rate, with playground and teaching facilities to give parents some respite. The organisation also works very well with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, who provide concerts for children. The founder of the Autism Advisory and Support Service, Grace Fava, has said on the question of music in the lives of these children: Children with autism and additional needs have a great affinity for music in general and classical music in particular. It relaxes them and gives them a safe outlet for their emotions. I want to reiterate that all members, regardless of their political allegiance, are very supportive of Grace's efforts. We hope that the federal government can make sure that her knowledge, her activity, her enthusiasm and that of the other volunteers are recognised and that they get some say in the process around funding in this country and with regard to upcoming developments. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:32 to 16:20 Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 Consideration in Detail Debate resumed. Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $296,757,000 Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:20): I would like to make some remarks in opening about the departmental budget for 2012-13 for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. The department will receive an appropriation totalling $218.5 million. Of this, the department will receive administered funding of $114.1 million, down quite significantly on last year as a result of the termination of various programs. It will receive departmental funding of $97 million and capital funding of $7.4 million. In addition, the Clean Energy Regulator associated with the department has been established and it will receive an appropriation totalling $763.1 million, comprising administered funding of $670.8 million and departmental funding of $92.3 million. The major components of the department's administered funding include the Low Carbon Communities program, energy efficiency measures, land measures and climate change science applications. Measures for the portfolio announced in the 2012-13 budget included $37.1 million for the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards program, $2.8 million for the building energy efficiency program and $3 million for climate change adaptation. Additionally, in the budget the government decided not to proceed with the tax breaks for the green buildings program. That will provide a saving of $405.2 million over the forward estimates. The budget for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is fiscally responsible. It reflects the fact that much of the government's climate change policy is now contained in the clean energy legislation, the policy for which was announced in July last year. The clean energy legislation and its implementation from 1 July in the form of the carbon price mechanism in particular will decouple economic growth from growth in pollution. Our economy will grow but greenhouse gas emissions will fall, reducing the emissions intensity of the economy over time. It will improve Australia's economic competitiveness in the coming decades when clean energy and low-pollution technologies will be a key to competitive advantage. That is particularly going to be the case in the AsiaPacific region, where our major trading partners are located. The economies that are able to reduce their emissions intensity-the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output-will have a competitive advantage. That is why it is perfectly valid to assert that the introduction of the carbon price mechanism will drive not only emissions intensity reductions in our economy but productivity improvements as well. Those opposite contend quite",244,Dfrdbs It Is Something That I Will Continue To Fight For
231,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climatedifferently. No doubt that will be part of the debate that we will have in the upcoming period of time. The Clean Energy Act become law nearly eight months ago. Since that time, the fact of the matter is that there has been record investment in our economy and exceptional economic growth. We are currently growing faster than every single major advanced economy, as illustrated by the figures released two weeks ago. GDP growth is currently running at 4.3 per cent. Unemployment is at five per cent. We have very high levels of business investment, with more than $173 billion in capital expenditure expected in the year 2012-13 and half a trillion dollars in the resource investment pipeline. This is an essential economic reform at a time when the economy is in a strong position. It is in the long-term interests of the country. As1 July comes closer-it is now less than two weeks away-I think people will have the opportunity to experience the real world rather than baseless fear campaigning in relation to this issue. The economy is strong. This is a reform that needs to be made and the policy measures associated with the clean energy future package are included in the 2012 budget position for the department. chamber I note that the proposed expenditure now before the Federation Chamber is for the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency portfolio and is for $296,757,000. The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. his reference to the real world, lived experience of the carbon tax. I note in particular the decision of the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal to authorise electricity price rises of 18 per cent from 1 July. I note that, as part of that, in the average case across the state at least 50 per cent of that increase will be as a consequence of the carbon tax and that, in the case of Integral Energy, up to 85 per cent of the price rise will result directly and solely from the carbon tax. The rise in prices is going to occupy almost the entire amount of the 10 per cent allocated by the government in its modelling. I refer specifically to Strong growth, low pollution: modelling a carbon price: update, from late 2011, and, in particular, to page 12, where it says, 'Over the first five years of the carbon tax'-not just the first day-'the price rise as a consequence of the carbon tax on electricity will be 10 per cent.' Is the minister really saying that there will be no further price rises as a consequence of the carbon tax in the electricity space? I refer to the fact that the government's own modelling shows a more than 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax on electricity between now and 2017. In particular, the most recent budget showed that the rise would be from $23 to $29 on the carbon price by 2015-16. Will the minister deny that that 25 per cent plus increase in the carbon price will have any impact on future electricity prices? Will the minister deny that the auctioning of forward permits in April 2014 and beyond for the electricity sector will have any impact on electricity prices? This is particularly so given that the Electricity Supply Association of Australia warned last year that this additional forward auctioning of permits would add another 10 per cent to the price of electricity immediately. SoI refer to the fact that five years worth of electricity price rises will have occurred on day one. Does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the additional 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax and does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the auctioning of forward permits, which the",246,Bills

Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:28): The government has a great degree of confidence in the modelling that has been undertaken. It was independent modelling of a very comprehensive nature by the federal Treasury, supported in the case of the energy market by two private organisations that did extensive modelling of the electricity price impact. We stand by what that modelling says, which is a 10 per cent increase in household electricity prices averaged across the country. Different scenarios were contained in that modelling and the government has a lot of confidence in them. It is interesting and-from a standpoint where the Leader of the Opposition has been saying there would be an unimaginable price impact and at various times has asserted that electricity prices will rise by 25 per cent and then 30 per cent and even more-it is important to note now that in various jurisdictions regulators are examining this issue and what the realworld price impact will be, and they are confirming that the Treasury modelling is accurate. Just last week, the South Australian regulator issued the estimated price impact in South Australia, and it is $1.50 averaged across households in South Australia. In Western Australia, it is averaging $2.50. In New South Wales, IPART has confirmed that it is $3.30. It is important that we keep these things in some perspective. We certainly have a lot of confidence in the modelling. The regulators are now resolving that the electricity price impacts are consistent with what the Treasury said; in fact, in some jurisdictions it is less than what the Treasury had estimated. The other important point to make is that the attribution of carbon pricing to everything that is happening with electricity prices has been misrepresented in this debate. In various jurisdictions, electricity prices have risen by over 50 per cent over the last several years. I was in Western Australia last week. Electricity prices have risen by 50 per cent, I think, in two years in Western Australia. None of these things have anything to do with carbon pricing, which commences just from 1 July. My colleague the member for Chifley and I, as New South Wales politicians, are acutely aware that there was, I think, an 18 per cent increase in electricity prices in New South Wales last year This had nothing to do with carbon pricing, and it came off the back of previous significant increases. This has all been driven by the investment in poles and wires in our transmission and distribution system in a host of jurisdictions throughout the country. An urgent investment has been recognised as necessary in those areas. If there is excessive investment-and I note that some commentators are indicating that gold-plating is going on-then that is an issue that needs to be tackled by the relevant jurisdictions and the relevant electricity market regulators. It is very important to make that point about what is really driving electricity prices in this country. There has been an underinvestment in the network for quite a significant period. It is important that it be addressed. It is important that it not be gold-plated. We have to do all that we can to help people at a household level deal with the impact of these price rises. Only $9 in every $100 that a household consumer pays in their electricity bill is going to be attributable to the carbon price, averaged across the country. To assist, the government have announced-and it is the only government acting in this way-a significant number of measures to assist households with these cost pressures. Specifically, with the introduction of",247,Bills

This is what is important to bear in mind. Clearly the coalition, having failed in its fear campaigning up to this in time and confronted now with some facts about actual increases, are now moving to try to scare people about impacts over the next five years. They cannot have it every way. The facts will out with the fear. the opportunity to ask him some questions, particularly given the Gippsland-Latrobe Valley region is recognised, I think even by the government, as one of the regions that will be most adversely affected by the carbon price-or the 'carbon tax', as we like to call it in the Latrobe Valley, even though apparently no-one on the other side of the House likes to call it a 'tax' anymore. I will refer specifically to the regional structural adjustment package, which is supposedly being developed as part of the government's carbon tax package. It has been confirmed by the minister for regional development that there are no guidelines in place for the distribution of this $200 million package. Even when you consider that this $200 million package is grossly inadequate to assist the affected regions, it strikes me as staggering that we are only days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and this $200 million structural adjustment package is without guidelines. Given that there are no guidelines now and that the tax will come into effect in just a couple of weeks time, can the minister explain how regions which are going to be adversely affected by the carbon tax will be compensated for those adverse impacts? The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was in my electorate quite recently-I think it was last Wednesday or Thursday-and he gave the impression that the vast bulk of the money that was allocated under the package would be contingent upon regions demonstrating that they had been adversely affected by the policy through such things as contracts for closure. Given that the government so far has refused to fund even a socioeconomic analysis of the Latrobe Valley to assess what the impacts of the carbon tax or a contract for closure would be, I am interested to know how the government proposes to demonstrate which regions have been adversely affected and how these funds will be allocated. On that specific issue of the contract for closure, given that we are just days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and given that the government was going to make some announcements on 1 July in relation to the contract-for-closure tender process, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for contract for closure?

They have gone around the country-and in particular the Leader of the Opposition-to regions like the Latrobe Valley and terrified the living daylights out of people and created enormous apprehension.

He has created this apprehension in the Latrobe Valley and in many other regions with statements to the effect that Whyalla will be wiped off the map. Just imagine what that means to families in Whyalla-what a disgrace. You have to stand before people and deal with them with some integrity, and that has been lacking in the coalition's approach. As the carbon price comes into effect, this will become clearer and clearer to members of the community, including the Latrobe Valley. I do not suggest the question was put in any inappropriate way. I know that the member is genuine in his concerns, but I think that we have to keep things in perspective here. We are acutely conscious of the circumstances that the Latrobe Valley and, in particular, the brown coal generation sector find themselves in. A very significant amount of funding of course was allocated in the form of energy security payments in the package to ensure that there was confidence on the part of the investors, the equity holders and the debt providers, for the brown coal generators in the Latrobe Valley, and I think there is evidence that those payments have been successful by their continuing confidence in the assets that are there. That is very important for people's jobs as well. The government committed significant funds to ensure that there was ongoing confidence in those assets and in the region. I have visited the Latrobe Valley a couple of times over the last 12 or 18 months to talk to people about this issue, and I can assure the member that I am as concerned as anyone else to ensure the well-being of that community. A number of the electricity generators in the Latrobe Valley region did indicate that they would like to discuss, in the appropriate process, the contract-for-closure issue, and those discussions have been continuing in an appropriate way through the department of my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy. They are commercial-in-confidence discussions. Our public policy announced in July last year, to which we continue to adhere, is that that process would be brought to a conclusion by 30 June, which of course is imminent. That remains our policy position. It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the outcome at this point in time, but the process that we initiated should appropriately be continued and a conclusion reached. I can say to people in the Latrobe Valley that we are very mindful of the circumstances there. We have put a lot of resources into supporting them. We are working very closely with the business community and, I might add, with the Victorian government in relation to these issues. aluminium sector. In doing so, I remind the chamber that of course answers given in this chamber have the same weight and bearing as answers given in the primary chamber of the House, with all the consequences for statements made that may or may not be true.

239,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (16:39,"I want to refer to the impact of the carbon tax on theChange and Energy Efficiency) (16:40): I appreciate the question because it gives me the opportunity to put on the record once again a number of the difficulties that are confronting the aluminium-smelting sector in particular. Essentially, there has been a very significant fall in aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange-in fact, a 40 per cent depreciation in prices over the last few years-and that is impacting on the profitability of much of the aluminium industry within our domestic economy. Added to that, given the strength of the economy and the investment in the resources sector in particular, we have been experiencing a high dollar, above parity with the US dollar, for some months, and for an extended period of time the value of the dollar has been well above its historical average. It could be that that situation will be sustained for a significant period of time, given the strength of the economy and the drivers of the high valuation of the Australian dollar in the marketplace. Those two factors alone-low prices, associated with oversupply in the international market, and the high value of the Australia dollar-are impacting significantly. Added to that, of course, are pressures arising from the fact that long-term electricity contracts that had been negotiated between various state governments or state instrumentalities with the aluminium smelters, as is the case particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, in recent times and in the coming years are expiring. They are contracts that have had perhaps a 25to 30-year term. Many of those contracts have involved a discounted electricity price for supply for the aluminium smelters involved, and the repricing of those electricity contracts by the relevant generators or state instrumentalities is a very material factor in the viability of these businesses. There has been extensive discussion between the aluminium industry, and the smelters in particular, and the various state governments and state instrumentalities in relation to that issue, including in Victoria. It was one of the key issues behind the decision by Norsk Hydro a month or so ago to close the aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri in my own region, the Hunter. To put that into a fair historical perspective, it was a decision of the New South Wales government, followed by a decision of the O'Farrell government, that they would not renew the electricity contract on terms sufficiently favourable to Norsk Hydro to allow the continued operation of that smelter. All of that-low prices, the high dollar and electricity contracts-is yet again being completely misrepresented by the coalition in a misleading way. They are trying to attribute these problems to carbon pricing, which is completely fallacious. To put that in context, aluminium smelting is an industry that in 2012-13 will attract for free an average of 94.5 per cent of the permits it will require under the carbon price, reducing the effective average carbon price in aluminium smelting to $1.30 a tonne. It is a trade-exposed industry, and that is why the government has taken a significant step. That is the assistance that has been provided. Aluminium companies are in constant discussion with the government about these issues and, particularly with my other portfolio hat on, it is not surprising that I would be having discussions pretty regularly with the aluminium sector and others who are feeling some of these pressures-for example, the steel industry-and continuing to monitor the situation. things.

241,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (16:44): I want to pick up on a number ofthan half of that is not due to the carbon tax or carbon price but, rather, has a lot to do with the decisions that have been made as a result of approval given by IPART to the pricing movements requested by state owned corporations, which are the responsibility of state governments. I do not recall that there has been any move to provide any sort of household assistance to cover for the increases to power prices that the state owned corporations have had approved through state based regulators. I understand that there is a household assistance package that will cover households as a result of any move to introduce a carbon price from 1 July, as opposed to what is happening due to the state owned corporations. On top of that, there has been a very active scare campaign about the impact on councils in New South Wales as a result of the introduction of the carbon price which I would like to get some clarity on. So the first thing is to get clarity on the impact, particularly in Western Sydney, of the carbon price on power prices for households. The second thing is the impact on rates and council operations in Western Sydney. The third thing I want to get clarity on follows from an opportunity I had to visit De Bortoli Wines, which has a distribution centre based in Western Sydney. They have been the beneficiary of assistance to help them shift their operations to a more sustainable footing. I was very impressed when I went out to Glendenning on Friday and met the New South Wales manager of De Bortoli Wines who outlined the types of measures that have been taken to move to a more sustainable footing and use their energy more efficiently. While there has been a lot of focus on the carbon price itself, there has not been enough focus on what measures are being taken by businesses and industry to make themselves much more sustainable, to use energy more efficiently in the way they conduct their affairs. I would like to know, particularly from a Western Sydney focus, what other businesses are able to do and what assistance they are able to tap into to find more energy efficient ways to operate and thereby reduce their own costs. Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:47): I thank the member for Chifley for the question because there are some important issues traversed there. I will take them sequentially. It is very important to note that 8.9 per cent, as I recall, of the electricity price rise approved by to an average household cost of $3.30 a week-exactly what the government said it would be. And of course, with respect to that, the federal government is providing an average of $10.10 per week to households in New South Wales in assistance in the form of tax cuts, family tax benefit improvements and pension increases. In Western Sydney, where I had the privilege to grow up-in fact, in the electorate of the member for Chifley, an excellent representative for that area-this is very important for people. There are many people in New South Wales, in Western Sydney, doing it tough. The tax cuts, the pension increases, the family tax benefits, the help for self-funded retirees, for many veterans and many others are very, very important to them. The federal government is the only government that is helping in these circumstances. As to the rest of the electricity price rise approved by IPART, there are very significant factors that are within the New South Wales government jurisdiction to deal with. They are providing no assistance. The federal coalition have banged on for the last 12 or 18 months",251,Bills
242,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climateabout all the doom and gloom, the fear and the terror that is created by carbon pricing. Do you know, the investment in poles and wires in New South Wales equates to the price impact of carbon pricing coming in, as it does in other jurisdictions-and, not only that, it has been more in previous years. Yet they have been claiming doom and gloom for everything with respect to that, when in fact the federal government is providing $10.10 a week, on average, in assistance. The New South Wales government is not helping people. It is not even actively looking at how it can ensure that there is no gold-plating of these investments, which are going on within its jurisdiction, so that New South Wales Electricity consumers are not placed under even greater pressure. That is a very material factor. It is total hypocrisy for the O'Farrell government to try to attribute the totality of the price rise to the carbon price as the member for Flinders was trying to do in his first question. It is completely fallacious and factually untrue. The New South Wales government is not providing assistance to help people in the way the federal government is. The other thing that IPART did in recent weeks was to examine in a thorough way the potential price impact of carbon pricing on councils and their costs. There is a very thorough breakdown published on IPART's website which demonstrates very clearly that we are talking about an increase in the range of 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent in local government costs in New South Wales-I do not have the material before me, but it certainly was not more than 0.6 per cent. Fortunately, in that jurisdiction IPART keeps a pretty close eye on what the councils can do, along with the state government. Those are the facts of the matter. I was in Brisbane last week. The Brisbane City Council, which is, of course, under Liberal National Party control, has come up with a completely fallacious claim. Given the same circumstances, they will be putting rates up by 1.9 per cent and ripping people off and having no transparency and accountability about it. These are all material factors. The member for Chifley is right to point to the importance of programs generally that will assist organisations such as manufacturing businesses and local governments to reduce their energy consumption. Of course, some of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism is dedicated to programs which will assist in this. Last week the government announced a number of recipients among local governments and not-for-profit organisations of energy efficiency grants which will see energy consumption and electricity bills reduced. Last week I visited a food manufacturing facility at Emu Plains called Crafty Chef. A co-contribution by the government is expected to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of Crafty Chef by 54 per cent, deliver CO2 savings, boost its turnover from $20 million to $50 million and increase jobs. on the solar hot water rebate program. This program was axed in February, with $45 million lost. Although at the time the government claimed there was no reduction against budget expenditure, on budget night it was shown that the net loss as a consequence for the sector was $45 million, and the budget papers were reduced accordingly. The government has now reinstated that funding, although in a different format. My first question to the minister is very simple: where does that $45 million come from? Within which programs was it contained in the current budget? If it was not contained in any of the programs, will the minister confirm that the government's so-called surplus will be reduced by $45 million?",252,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
243,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (16:52,"I have two sets of questions for the minister. The first is inThe second set of questions relates to landfill and the number of liable entities on the government's register of liable entities. Is the minister aware of plans by some landfill operators, and indeed potentially by some councils, to divert waste from consolidated highquality landfills to smaller regional landfills so as to legitimately avoid the 25,000 tonne limit but in so doing potentially to lead to an increase in overall emissions and a decrease in environmental standards? Is the minister aware of any case where this is occurring, and can he rule out that landfill is being diverted from larger landfills to smaller landfills so as to avoid the liability but in so doing also losing the potential for methane strip and diverting waste to landfills which may not have the same lining and environmental standards? Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:54): In relation to the solar hot-water rebate, which was introduced in 2007, it is material to point out that the government has now provided over $320 million to help more than 258,000 Australian households replace older, higher emissions related hot-water systems with renewable, lower emissions alternatives. As at 31 May this year, an additional $68 million had been spent on rebates above the budget for the program announced in 2007, and an additional 33,000 systems have been installed above the target announced in 2007. It has been a program with a significant degree of funding expended on it over five years and with a significant number of systems installed-over a quarter of a million. The program has not been closed early; it was always designed to be closed in 2012, and that is what the government has done. We have obviously consulted widely in the industry and with associated stakeholder groups about this issue, but I emphasise that it was always scheduled to end on 30 June this year. Mr Hunt interjectingthrough Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus that the $44.7 million that I think the member for Flinders is referring to, which remained from the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme, will be used to support two national programs assisting local communities and low-income families to become more energy efficient. This will involve a new $24 million Local Government Energy Efficiency Program, established to help councils install solar or heat-pump hot-water systems in community facilities, and an extra $20.7 million under the Home Energy Saver Scheme, to support low-income households to invest in a bigger range of energy-efficient whitegoods and heating and cooling systems. This does not add to the budget in the way that was implied by the member for Flinders; this is an underspend from the program. Mr Hunt: That is untrue. The budget was corrected and the money was taken out. the budget surplus in a contingency reserve, and perhaps that is why the member for Flinders had not picked that up. In relation to landfill, only 34 councils-as of Friday, according to the list based on current data published by the Clean Energy Regulator-have been identified as liable entities on the Liable Entities Public Information Database. That is 34 councils of 559 nationally. The coalition, in yet another example of fearmongering and campaigning and misrepresentation and misleading statements, has been running around trying to terrify local governments about this issue. The fact of the matter is that the government has worked very closely with the Australian Local Government Association for several years-since the previous parliament-",253,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates

246,Mr Combet,"I am afraid that that is the position. I am reminded that it was factored intoabout how to structure landfill emissions to minimise methane liability under the carbonpricing mechanism. Many local governments that operate landfill sites have already invested in methane capture technology, which is what triggers landfill liability. Many local governments, including in my own region, have already invested in methane capture technology in order to either flare the methane, which under a carbon-pricing arrangement will potentially reduce their liability below the emissions threshold that triggers liability, or use it to generate electricity. We have consulted very closely with the landfill sector and local governments about the issue that the member for Flinders pointed to-the potential diversion of waste. It might be recalled that, under the CPRS, mechanisms had been mooted to deal with the potential of that issue. We satisfied ourselves in consultations that that is an issue that it was not necessary to address under the clean energy future package at this point in time. Chifley's question before. It seemed like the 'don't mention the war' episode out of Fawlty Towers, only he slipped up and mentioned the carbon tax. 'I did it once but I think I got away with it'. I am sorry to say, Member for Chifley, that the people of my electorate and right throughout Australia do not feel that you are getting away with it. They know what this tax is going to do to their lives. This is a tax, and all the bribes and the slick advertising will not hide the fact that this tax is going to cascade through the economy and have a big impact on regional communities. It is also a tax that your Prime Minister specifically ruled out ever introducing. But I do thank the minister for his answer previously, and I also acknowledge, Minister, that 1 July is the government's policy in relation to contract foreclosure. But the practical reality of the situation is that contract foreclosure negotiations are going nowhere fast, and I think the minister knows that. My community in the Latrobe Valley is suffering right now because of the uncertainty being created by your government's policy. Your government has no plans in place in relation to structural adjustment. Your Minister for Regional Development, Regional Australia and Local Government has acknowledged that as well. There are no guidelines in place for that particular policy, and there is a crisis of confidence going on right now in the Gippsland and Latrobe Valley region which is directly related to the carbon tax policy which the Prime Minister explicitly ruled out in the lead-up to the last election.

250,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climateterrible. I think the Leader of the Opposition today was forecasting the price to go up, and so on, but on the other hand, when it is politically suitable for them, they try to point to the price falling and therefore holes in budgets and all the rest. We have confidence in the Treasury modelling, and that is reflected in the budget. I was reminded today in question time in relation to this issue, when the member for Flinders was googling the European Union allowance prices, that in fact in July 2008 the European unit price was, I think, A$56 a tonne just prior to the global financial crisis. It is an emissions trading scheme, it is a market price that is set. Of course, the carbon price mechanism that we have implemented will migrate to a floating price, a market price, from 1 July 2015, and the market will set the price. The Treasury has modelled that, in one of the most comprehensive modelling exercises undertaken for a public policy change, at $29 a tonne in 2015-16. We have confidence in the modelling. If the member for Flinders is a derivatives expert on carbon markets, that is great. However, to be suggesting at this point in time that, in three years, we will still have low prices in Europe is a pretty big call, for a number of reasons. One of them is that we would all share the hope that the current debt crisis that is being experienced throughout the European zone is resolved as expeditiously as possible. That debt crisis has affected many markets, including the carbon market in the EU. I know, through consultations that I have with the EU in relation to this issue, that there is a great degree of concern about that and the need to resolve the debt crisis and restore confidence and stability to markets in Europe, including in relation to the trading of European Union allowances. The government has already announced that we are in consultation with the European Union about the potential for ultimately linking the two schemes, which would be an important policy initiative-it is the largest carbon market in the world. The European Union scheme goes into a third phase in the not-too-distant future. There is a lot of discussion in Europe about the application of that phase and whether there would be contemplation of measures to support the price in the EU ETS as part of those changes. That is a matter for the European Union to deal with. The point that I am endeavouring to make is that 1 July 2015 is some period away, and we certainly anticipate that carbon prices and international markets will recover. By the time that we migrate to a floating price, from 1 July 2015, I think the Treasury modelling is going to prove to be as sound as the confidence we have in it. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Treasury Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $4,441,842,000. (17:07): It gives me great pride to be able to speak in support of the measures contained within the appropriation bills. The 2012-13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus. The surplus is growing over the forward estimates. As well as returning to surplus, the budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families and lowand middle-income earners with increases in the cost of living. The return to surplus is the right decision for the Australian economy because it will sustain confidence in the strength of Australia's public finances, it will strengthen the government's balance sheet, to support Australia's capacity to respond to future adverse economic shocks, and it is appropriate for an economy expected to grow around trend and allows monetary policy to respond to economic conditions.",255,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
251,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)Australia's budget will return to surplus ahead of any other advanced major economy. Many other advanced economies are still grappling with the task of rebuilding their economies as well as setting their public finances on a sustainable footing. The current European sovereign debt crisis makes maintaining strong fiscal discipline and credibility more important than ever. Australia's strong public finances, very low public debt, solid economic growth, low unemployment and contained inflation make it one of the strongest economies in the world. The government will return to surplus despite tax receipts being revised down by $28 billion over four years from 2011-12, relative to the 2011-12 MYEFO, due to parameter and other variations. Relative to the forecast made in the 2008-09 budget, total tax receipts have been written down by around $150 billion over the five years to 2012-13. The government has taken a disciplined approach to both return the budget to surplus and create room for new investments. This has required the government to identify $33.6 billion over five years in savings, with those savings split roughly equally between expenditure and receipt measures. These savings have been designed to be targeted and responsible, ensuring that the most vulnerable Australians and front-line services are protected. In addition to delivering the surplus and spreading the benefits of the boom, the 2012-13 budget contains a number of important initiatives, including establishing the first stage of a national disability insurance scheme; reforming Australia's aged-care system to make the system fairer, more transparent and responsive; delivering additional dental health services; and investing in a number of high-quality infrastructure projects, including funding for duplicating the Pacific Highway, additional funding for Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs, committing to develop the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal and the Torrens and Goodwood rail project. Average real growth in payments over the forward estimates is 1.8 per cent. This is within the commitment to maintain a two per cent annual cap on real spending growth on average, until surpluses are at least one per cent of GDP and while the economy is at or above trend. The budget also sees a fall in nominal payments in 2012-13 compared to 2011-12-the first fall in 42 years for which data is available. This highlights the key role disciplined spending is playing in the fiscal consolidation. The discipline imposed on real spending growth has reduced payments as a proportion of GDP to 23.5 per cent in 2012-13-that is a fall of 1.6 percentage points from 2011-12. In 2012-13 and each subsequent year in the forward estimates, payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to be at their lowest level since the onset of the global financial crisis. Across the forward estimates from 2012-13, payments are expected to be below 24 per cent of GDP. This is the longest sustained period below 24 per cent since the 1980s. The budget includes measures to support the integrity, fairness and sustainability of the tax system, such as the removal of tax concessions for golden handshakes and living-away-fromhome allowances. Nonetheless, over the forward estimates the tax to GDP ratio is projected to remain below what it was in 2007-08. In 2012-13, the tax to GDP ratio is expected to be 1.6 percentage points lower than the 2007-08 level, which equates to around $24.1 billion worth of tax in 2012-13. Tax receipts are projected to reach 22.9 per cent of GDP in 2015-16, around one percentage point below the levels reached in the mid-2000s. Tax receipts as a proportion of GDP in 2011-12 and the previous two years were the lowest since 1993-94. (Time expired) remarks. I want to touch on a few things before moving to his specific responsibilities. I would like to focus on the general issues around the budget. There is some confusion surrounding the budget papers and why in a number of cases they were delivered late to coalition people in the opposition budget lock-up. Assistant Treasurer, was it Treasury's responsibility to deliver the budget books to the opposition in the budget lock-up? Were any copies of the budget or related papers, including the portfolio budget statements, shredded at any stage during the printing process in the lead-up to the 2012-13 budget? Copies of portfolio budget statements were not available at 1:30 pm when the opposition budget lock-up started. I wonder whether the Assistant Treasurer could shed any light on that; whether there was any delay in the loading dock. I am curious as to why those papers were not available when they would ordinarily have been available. I also want to talk about the clarity within the budget papers and their transparency in accurately reflecting the Commonwealth's budget position. You would be aware of criticisms from Ross Gittins, who was quite vivid in his criticisms of the actual budget position and how that was communicated-the transparency in a range of transactions that have been shifted off budget and the accounting rationale there; a table that aggregates all those transactions under a range of different headings; and their headline and underlying impacts. You would be aware that he was pointing to a budget surplus when, in his words, 'it actually hides an $8.7 billion budget deficit.' He goes on to say: The hiding of the headline deficit is just one example of the way the budget papers are becoming less informative rather than more, and the way the spin doctors are turning them into an exercise in media management rather than transparency and accountability. He provides a number of specific examples. I invite the Assistant Treasurer to address himself to those criticisms that Mr Gittins outlined in relation to payments to NBN Co. as an example, and also on the Clean Energy Development Bank and why that is presented in the way it is in the budget papers. AAP also had a complaint, which Mr Gittins has alluded to: This year AAP has accused the government of leaking budget information to selected media for broadcast during the budget lock-up. How's that for duplicity. Has the Assistant Treasurer had those complaints by the AAP investigated, either by the Treasury or the government? What are the outcomes of those arrangements? Does he agree that this in part undermines the whole point of the lock-up, where there is selective release of information? The Assistant Treasurer and I share a spot on a particular television program, where he is fond of saying, 'I won't be drawn on budget speculation,' and then proceeds to talk about the selective speculation he would love to be drawn on and was actively involved in propagating. I would invite the Assistant Treasurer to comment on those two very concerning issues about the integrity and transparency of the process and the papers themselves, and on the bewildering reason why key documents were not available to the opposition as they would ordinarily be in the regular course of events. (17:16): The first point that the member for Dunkley raised-which goes to the question of documents and materials that were provided or were intended or meant to be provided to the",256,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
252,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (17:12,I thank the Assistant Treasurer for his opening,258,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
253,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)opposition and the timeliness of their provision-is not a matter that has been raised with me previously. Certainly, that is something that I will endeavour to look into and provide the member for Dunkley with further information on. It is my understanding that it is up to the respective individual departments themselves to make available information to the opposition. I am not aware of any instance in which the way in which departments conducted themselves in the most recent budget departed in any way from the way in which matters would ordinarily occur. I have no knowledge of anything untoward in that regard, but I will certainly have a look at the matters that the member for Dunkley has raised. I welcome the member for Dunkley's interest in transparency, because with a $70 billion black hole the Australian people are going to be very interested in the transparent in way in which the opposition presents its proposals to the Australian people ahead of the next election. The budget papers, in all regards, comply with the usual accounting practice in terms of how budgets are recorded and matters are disclosed. There is no suggestion that that is not the case. It is good to see the member for Dunkley imbibing his daily or weekly element of Mr Gittins's commentary, because I think the opposition could learn a lot from much of what Mr Gittins has said. He has been a very strong critic of the lack commitment to fiscal discipline on the part of the coalition. On the question of transparency, the government is very pleased to stand behind a budget that is being returned to surplus. We have stated the reasons why it is so important that we return the budget to surplus. We have done so using all of the accounting mechanisms that would ordinarily apply to the way in which these matters are reported. That will show that we are delivering in 2012-13 a $1.5 billion surplus. The surpluses that will be achieved into the out years grow over time. Of course, this is a remarkable result when we consider what is occurring all around the world at the moment. Indeed, these projections are based upon strong growth, growth that is strong by international standards. There is good reason to believe that those projections will be realised. In recent national accounts data released we see that the Australian economy continued to grow more strongly than any other major advanced economy. The Australian economy today is somewhere in the order of nine per cent larger than the economy that existed before the GFC. We are experiencing growth at rates that no other major advanced economy can even come close to, and we are returning our budget to surplus faster than any other major advanced economy. Indeed, as we return the budget to surplus others are still grappling with very large deficits, and we all operate in the current global economic settings with the inherent challenges they bring. The government are very pleased that in this budget we have been able to spread the benefits of the mining boom, and that is so important. The national accounts data really did show that the growth in this country is occurring much more strongly in some parts than in others and in some sectors more than in others. As we extract mineral resources in this country today to meet the demands of the global economy and the global marketplace, it is absolutely important that we extract a sufficient and appropriate return for the Australian people from those resources. Through the mining tax and the minerals resource rent tax we are doing that, and we are determined to make sure that the benefits of the boom are being spread. I think that is the responsible thing for the government to do, particularly in a climate where the resources boom, which has meant so much bounty for so many, has also provided structural challenges and changes that have impacted on so many others throughout the economy. This is a very good budget, one that has returned to surplus and one that helps spread the benefits of the mining boom. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (17:21): I want to ask the Assistant Treasurer about the government's decision to return the budget to surplus, but I also want to make a couple of observations in that context about the state of the Australian economy, which is today nine per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. Like the Assistant Treasurer, I am a subscriber to the Treasurer's Economic Note, which reminds me that, compared with pre-GFC levels, the Italian economy is now five per cent smaller, the British economy is three per cent smaller and the Japanese economy is one per cent smaller. Other economies have grown, but not by much. The United States economy is up by one per cent and it is the same with Germany; the Canadian economy is up by four per cent. So the Australian economy, having grown by nine per cent from pre-GFC levels, really is in a class of its own. I also want to raise the recent national accounts figures. As the Assistant Treasurer has noted, the release of those figures really did give the lie to those who argue that Australia's best days are behind us. As the Treasurer put it, the release of those figures was a week when the optimists won over the pessimists. It is important to put in place productivity-boosting reforms and they are reforms that Labor is currently undertaking. The National Broadband Network, the historic investment in schools and boosting the quality of Australian schools are reforms that will pay dividends, but they will not necessarily pay off in the year in which they are implemented. We know this from looking back at past reforms. We can see, for example, that the deregulation of the financial sector and the cutting of tariffs in the 1980s paid off in productivity in the 1990s. In terms of Australia's debt level, which naturally goes to the question of the return to surplus, it is worth drawing on a number of observations made in the press recently. The Executive Director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, has noted that Australia's level of public debt is among the lowest in the world. In fact, he noted: At less than 10 per cent of GDP, the Commonwealth’s Net Debt is so low that the financial sector has urged the Gillard Government to issue more government bonds than is actually necessary to ensure the ‘liquidity’ of the government bond market. Stephen Koukoulas, in the Australian Financial Review on the morning after the budget, noted, 'Not once did the Howard or Fraser governments in about 20 years in office achieve a single year where government spending was cut in real terms, while Labor governments have been able to cut real spending in five years since the mid-1980s.' Mr Koukoulas further notes that in the 2012-13 budget the ratio of government spending to gross domestic product will fall to 23.5 per cent, which is 0.7 per cent of GDP lower than the average of the 12 Howard government budgets. 'In today's dollars, that is around $10 billion less spending.' George Megalogenis, writing last year in the Australian, had this headline: 'ALP best manager of money, history shows'. Mr Megalogenis goes through the average annual real spending increase when the economy was growing at better than two per cent a year. Those figures show that under John Howard as Treasurer growth was 2.3 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 1, it was 1.9 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 2, in the salad days, it was 3.3 per cent. Under Wayne Swan, it was 1.0 per cent. There is a fear campaign being run by those opposite against the debt that we took on in order to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses, which I am sure that the member for Dunkley is deeply concerned about. Yet we still see those opposite running scare campaigns on things like the debt cap, which we have been advised to increase in order to take account of the fact that there are fluctuations in government revenues through the course of the year. We are raising the debt cap prudently. But those opposite seem keener on taking a leaf out of the playbook of the US Republicans. My question to the Assistant Treasurer is: why is the government returning the budget to surplus and why is this important for maintaining Australia's economic prosperity? (17:26): I thank the member for his very informed and insightful contribution. I welcome the opportunity to respond to his question. He asked why it is important to return the budget to surplus. There are many reasons why it is important to return the budget to surplus. We as a government should be attempting to live within our means. When the economic circumstances are as strong as they are-and the economic circumstances in this country stand in stark contrast to the challenges that so many other economies are facing around the globe-these are precisely the times in which governments should be attempting to return their budgets to surplus. What are the indicators to which I refer? When it comes to solid growth, the recent national accounts figures are a testament to the strength of growth in the Australian economy. I often hear those on the other side allege that the government has a preference for redistribution over wealth creation. The strongest endorsement of this government's commitment to wealth creation is the fact that this economy has grown faster in the period since the global financial crisis than any other major advanced economy. As a Labor government, we are committed to ensuring that there is fairness in the way in which taxation and transfer systems operate. But we also believe first and foremost that an economy must grow. Through growth and enlarging the pie, we are able to give more and more Australians the opportunity, with government support and assistance, to realise their potential so that they can make the contribution that our country requires and deserves from them. Our growth is very strong. We also operate in a context in which unemployment is relatively low. An unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is relatively low compared to those economies with which we would normally compare ourselves. If we have a look at those economies in Europe and economies such as the US and the UK, what we see is that our unemployment levels are considerably lower. All of those countries to which I have referred would give their right arms-they would give a limb-to have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. And that is what we have in Australia. In fact, much of the discourse in this country at the moment is positioned around the challenges of confronting labour and skills shortages. And this is a government that has a plan to address those matters as well. We have strong growth and low unemployment, and we have contained inflation. Containing inflation is the best way that any government can attempt to fight the rising cost of living. Containing inflation is, by definition, a government's efforts to contain rising costs of living. With contained inflation, we see strong growth and low unemployment. At the same time, as the member for Fraser rightly pointed out, our net government debt is amongst the lowest of major advanced economies, peaking at 9.6 per cent this year. In fact, if you look at comparable nations and put them all in a basket and work out their average, our net debt peaks at about one-tenth of the average for those countries. We have low net debt, despite the carry-on and the protestations of the opposition.",258,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
254,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)Whenever they have this discussion they firstly do not wish to acknowledge the international realities and the comparisons with other countries. The other point that those opposite seem to forget is that we have been through the global financial crisis. They want to forget that because they are ashamed of their record of having voted against so many of those important measures that we as a government implemented to support jobs. I have mentioned all of these indicators, but the 800,000-plus jobs that we have created in our time in office are perhaps the strongest indication of this government's agenda. It is about growth. It is about jobs. We have delivered those jobs. Often we have had to do it without the support of those opposite, because they come into the parliament and vote against these measures. Then they want to pretend that there was not a significant international economic incident and a period of challenge that we have been through. We tackled it. As a result of having tackled it, hundreds of thousands of Australians had a job who would not have otherwise had a job. measures-I think that is what he is alluding to-which in broad figures saw the budget position expand expenditure by $40 billion in that year. Is it not true that the so-called targeted and temporary measures involving the GFC response were neither temporary nor targeted but that they elevated the floor for Commonwealth expenditure by some $40 billion? It has never turned back. On your analysis, Sir, that would mean that every day that Labor has been in office, we have been in a GFC mode, because there has been no reduction in expenditure or no removal of that GFC stimulus for any of the years that followed. It just represented an elevated floor against which further increases were added. You now claim that those increases were not as substantial as they might have otherwise been, conveniently ignoring the $40 billion uplift in one year under the name of the GFC. Is it not true that those stimulus uplift factors created a new floor for the Commonwealth outlays, that we are now spending $370 billion a year compared to $270 billion a year four years ago, that there has been no restoration of the budget base nor the trajectory that was in place before the GFC, and that all of your comments about modesty in expenditure are completely fallacious because there has been no restoration of the expenditure trajectory prior to the GFC? On the issue of those outlays and the budget position, may I remind you that you have not delivered a surplus; you have forecasted one. None of your economic forecasts have come within a bull's roar of the end-of-year position. How confident are you that this budget will have some sort of accuracy that belies the track record up to date? What analysis have you done on the sensitivities that you have factored into the budget parameters? I refer to what was a remarkable inclusion under the contingency reserve for budget year 2012-13, which is a sizeable negative number. After some flapping around in Finance estimates, the explanation that was provided for this unusual occurrence was there was a lower than expected March quarter CPI outcome that needed to be factored into the papers and that this was 'received too late in the process to be allocated to individual agencies or functions'. Is this answer accurate and reliable? How is it that this reduced CPI outcome is not reflected anywhere else in the budget or, if it is, can you please point to where it is? Could you give some indication of the size of the downward forecast revision and what this downward forecast revision has meant for revenue? And, to pursue this matter further, in terms of that late revision and the economic parameters that it is supposedly influencing, what are the revenue and growth projections that",261,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
255,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (17:31,"The Assistant Treasurer talks about the stimulusare now in the budget if you have got that downcast in there covered by a negative contingency reserve amount but it does not appear anywhere else in the budget papers? I will move on to the budget issue. You touched on debt. If you are claiming it is a surplus, how is it that there is a growth in the debt profile and why are you seeking an increase in the debt ceiling? How is it that the explanation you provided relating to the fluctuations in revenue throughout the year cannot be accommodated by an existing mechanism available to you through the Loan (Temporary Revenue Deficits) Act 1953? How can you credibly say there will be a surplus when you are forecasting a need to increase the debt position? On the issue of the sensitivities regarding the downward revision in GDP, what is the sensitivity to net debt for each year across the forward estimates of a one per cent increase or a one per cent decrease in GDP and where does that leave the final budget position? On the issue of taxation, you talk about the taxation measures that are included. When was the decision made to abandon Labor's company tax promise? Less than 24 hours before the Treasurer delivered the budget speech, the Minister for Small Business claimed that that was still part of the budget and, when asked why 92 per cent of small businesses feel that no government policy is helping them, reached for that measure. Being on the Expenditure Review Committee, he must have known that that was not the case, so why was he not being straight with people? That is probably why the member for Deakin has circulated that information. What is the status of the company tax cuts? Finally, doesn't your budget confirm the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset, which will put up the level of taxation on the income of about 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses? How is that assisting small business, in the manner you claim, in distributing the proceeds of the mining boom? (17:36): I welcome the member for Dunkley's intervention on this occasion. In particular, I welcome his willingness to bring small business front and centre into the debate about what this government is doing. Once again, I am surprised that he would come into this place and seek to draw attention to his own abysmal failure. The member for Dunkley is the shadow small business minister, and he would have to be the only shadow small business minister, certainly from the coalition side, in the history of this parliament who has voted against tax relief for small business. He came into this parliament and voted against tax relief for small business, and then he has the audacity, the hide, to come in here. But it gets much better than that. He glossed over the fact that he voted against tax relief for small business-the instant asset write-off measure, which will ensure that small businesses all around this country will be able to share in the benefits of the mining boom by getting an upfront deduction, an instant asset write-off for every asset they purchase under $6,500. This will be a massive boost to small business and will give them the capacity to invest in their own capabilities and in their own capital and equipment, making sure that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in the markets they serve. Not only did he gloss over that point, he had the audacity to come in here and challenge the government when it comes to the question of company tax cuts. Day after day we came into this parliament and those opposite jumped up and down and said, 'We will vote against company tax cuts.' The rationale for that was, they said: 'We don't support the incomegenerating source. We don't support the minerals resource rent tax. So, because we don't",262,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
256,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)support the minerals resource rent tax, we won't be supporting any of the expenditure measures that are attached to it.' They made that point. They would have an ounce of credibility if they would at least maintain some consistency on that point. But what have they now done? We have handed down a budget where we have made it clear that, despite their determination to block our company tax cuts, we will make sure we spread the benefits of the boom. But we are going to do it by providing some other forms of assistance-in the form of increases to family payments and increases to allowances-to ensure that those individuals and families who are doing it tough share in the benefits of the mining boom. And what did they say? All of a sudden they discovered that they were in a position where they could support expenditure measures that were linked to the MRRT. I think the real issue here is that the shadow small business minister does not have the clout in shadow cabinet. When it comes to small business issues, he was not able to get them over the line when it came to supporting a tax cut for business. What a shameful position to be in! He has been the only shadow Liberal small business minister to vote against tax relief for business, but then he got rolled. He got rolled in shadow cabinet on trying to give a company tax cut. For the member for Dunkley to come in here and try to challenge the government when it comes to tax reform, particularly in relation to company tax cuts, not only is really gilding the lily but is beyond the pale. The member for Dunkley also made a few points in relation to the global financial crisis. He wants to block it from his memory. We all remember the shameful position that they took when they voted against the stimulus measures that supported this economy-or at least those that managed to turn up to parliament to vote against them. The member for Dunkley voted against them. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been protected and supported as a result of that. One challenge I hand down for those opposite is that they should come forward and tell us which economy, which country, out of all those economies out there in the world handled the global financial crisis better than Australia.

Mr Billson interjecting13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus from surpluses growing over the forward estimates. But, as well as returning to surplus, this budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living.

259,Mr Shorten,"He does not need protection; he could take all three of you on. The 2012trend, and it allows monetary policy to return to surplus ahead of any major advanced economy. Many other advanced economies are dealing with the very difficult issue of an ageing population and how to make sure that there is enough money for all people who reach 65 to retire. That is why we had some measures in our budget which improve the superannuation prospects of Australians. Unlike the coalition, who consistently vote against increases to superannuation, we on the Labor side believe in boosting Australian's superannuation. We also believe super should be concessionally taxed, and we are making the system fairer for millions of low-income earners by removing the compulsory tax on compulsory superannuation contributions from 1 July 2012. It was also clear to us that a small number of people on very high incomes are getting a better tax deal out of superannuation than millions of Australians on average incomes, because most compulsory superannuation contributions are taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent, regardless of the person's income. This is why we are making the system fairer by reducing the higher tax concession that the very high-income earners receive on their concessional contributions. Indeed, in this budget we announced that we would take steps to more closely align the tax concession for very high-income earners with the concession received by average-income earners. The government took this step because it is not fair, nor is it good economic policy, to give 128,000 Australians a 30 per cent tax break, excluding the Medicare levy, on their superannuation contributions. We are better targeting the tax concessions for superannuation by reducing the significant concession which very high-income earners receive on their contributions. This reform will affect only people whose income is more than $300,000, which is approximately 1.2 per cent of people contributing to superannuation in 2012-13. We are reducing the tax concession which wealthy taxpayers receive on their contributions from 30 to 15 per cent, so it is more in line with the concession received by people with average earnings. This reform builds on our low-income superannuation contribution, which will make concessions on contributions fairer for about 3.6 million low-paid workers in 2012-13. The low income superannuation tax abolition-that is, getting rid of the 15 per cent tax paid on superannuation by people who earn less than $37,000 a year-will also support, in particular, women. Of the 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, approximately 2.1 million are women, thus ensuring that they have more money for their retirement, when it is well known that women find it more difficult to save money for their retirement when they have to step in and out of the workforce. In addition, in 2012-13 and 2013-14, all individuals will be subject to the general concessional cap and will be able to make concessional superannuation contributions of up to $25,000 per year. We are deferring the start date of the higher cap by two years, from 1 July 2012 to 1 July 2014, in light of comments made by industry about the difficulty in administering the higher cap before the new start date. During consultation, the superannuation industry raised concerns in relation to the cost and complexity involved in administering the balance limit and the difficulty some individuals may face in determining whether they are eligible for the higher cap. Deferring the start date will significantly help resolve these issues. It will allow implementation to occur at the same time super funds are making more changes to their systems to report more information to the ATO as part of the SuperStream reforms. In addition, individuals will be able to more easily determine whether they are eligible for the higher cap when the ATO provides access to comprehensive account balance information from early 2014. The Labor government is the only party in federal politics that is interested in improving superannuation for all Australians. (Time expired) contributions paid by employers that are legislated to increase from nine to 12 per cent are indeed paid for by employers and have been legislated? There has been some suggestion from Labor members that this is subject to some kind of negotiation and wiggle room. That came as news to most people. Could he confirm that that is the case. Could he also turn his mind to a question that has been put to the coalition which relates to the number of small businesses that are suffering at the moment through a 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies. A number of them point to their business being their retirement nest egg and thank the coalition for the capital gains tax rollover relief and other measures that they had planned to rely upon for their retirement. They point to the lack of appetite for purchasing new businesses or instances where a business has hit the wall and there may be a limited window within which to accumulate a retirement nest egg. Has the minister any plans to examine the contribution cap for mature age people, particularly in light of the reduction that the government has introduced where there might be a limited period of time-say, for the people over the age of 50-to accumulate a retirement nest egg and whether that is on his radar screen? I move to a related area about the accountants exemption that the minister would be aware of and FOFA changes first announced by then minister Bowen. It was proposed by the government that this exemption would be changed. This has created some uncertainty and concerns for accountants across Australia. Can he update us on progress of the proposed changes to the accountants exemption allowing them to provide advice on setting up or closing SMSF funds? I believe that was to come within weeks back in February. I think the minister was reported as saying that that was forthcoming within the next two weeks. So there is a bit of date slippage, but we are just wondering where that has got to and whether any changes to this measure are being contemplated that deviate from what Mr Bowen had to say. What action is being taken and when will this next two weeks arise as the minister promised? I will just more onto another related area, mindful that I suspect the clock will be run down by Labor colleagues. In the investment manager space, can he explain the delay in finalising the investment manager regime legislation? Is one of the issues resourcing of Treasury? I note there was a report of about some four dozenMr Shorten: Do you like Treasury? You normally hate them. We look out for the pre-election budget outcome, because we know your mysterious hand has not gone over those figures and so they have a degree of tidiness about them. Is this an issue of the resourcing of Treasury? Has Treasury received any stakeholder feedback on the delay and is there some reason that that seems not to be 'moving forward', to coin a phrase? On payday lending, could the minister update us on progress with the proposed payday lending changes contained in the Consumer Credit and Corporation Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011? I acknowledge that the minister has appreciated that payday lending is different to microfinance, and there has been some change there.

Fair enough. The most substantial question which the member for Dunkley led off with was about superannuation and who pays it. Let me be very clear on this matter. It is not appropriate for the opposition to spend their time scaring business and misleading people about who pays for superannuation. Superannuation increases are paid for out of the creation of value and wealth in enterprises going forward. For this, I submit the real-world evidence of what happened between 1992 and 2002. Over that time period, where compulsory superannuation was increased from three per cent to nine per cent, we saw at the same time a decrease in the unit labour costs of business, an increase in business profit as a share of GDP, an fall in unemployment from 11 per cent to something around six per cent and a rise in real wages in a continual pattern. It is not good enough that those opposite, who are the shipwreck survivors of the Howard-Costello era, without necessarily the capacity of some of those former members, have forgotten their own party's record on superannuation. What they always do is initially oppose and then they try to own the changes. Ms O'Dwyer: Why don't you talk about your record? preselections, is now interjecting. WhatI recall is that her former boss, the former member for Higgins and the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, acknowledged the benefits of superannuation. I touched a raw nerve there with the member for Higgins. As for who pays, it is paid for out of the creation of productive value in enterprises. The only way you could argue that it is some sort of a cost on business would be to suggest that there will never be real wage increases in the whole period going forward and that the wages in 2013 would, without",266,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates

266,Mr Shorten,"The member for Higgins, who has had a very bad weekend insuperannuation, be the same remuneration received by employees in 2019, which is patently false. The question of who pays is clearly and succinctly dealt with. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Keating, 'When conservatives tell you that this is some sort of tax on employers, they are either misinformed or they are lying, and they are wrong.' Some of the other questions raised by the member for Dunkley include the proposition that superannuation is another impost on small business. Having first established that it is not actually what it has been described as by the shadow minister for small business, I would also remind him of the measures which this government has put in the actual appropriation bill to help small businesses. Of course, that includes not least the loss carry-back provisions. I also remind him of the deduction for motor vehicles which are purchased. I remind him of the tax deduction for purchase of capital equipment. These are real measures which help small business. Of course, in politics it does not do anyone any credit to practise political amnesia. The reason why small business did not get a tax cut is that those opposite were against it. To quote the Assistant Treasurer in the chamber, the first spokesperson for small business ever in the historyMs O'Dwyer interjectingDoes anyone remember a coalition small business spokesperson ever voting against a tax cut for small business? You look through the history. You look through Hansard from 1901. There is only one person who wins that prize, and that is the current member for Dunkley. He also asked questions about contribution caps. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! There is only one party in this parliament that believes in increasing the contribution caps. That is the Labor Party; that is the government. We believe in increasing the contribution caps for people over 50. The opposition, as on many things in terms of policy for the nation, have their policy on contribution caps in a witness protection program. We know they cannot afford to be positive and match Labor's policy of lifting it to $50,000 in 2014 for people over 50 with account balances up to half a million dollars. We know that those opposite cannot afford to be positive because they cannot afford to pay the bills. They have done no work in opposition and they do not know how they are going to fund it. In terms of the other questions asked by the member for Dunkley, the IMR regime legislation will come forward soon, as will legislation on payday lending. We are most interested to see if those opposite will actually support reform of payday lending. In terms of the accountants' exemption, that will be resolved fairly soon after continued discussions with all the relevant bodies. In terms of the APRA-regulated funds within Trio, people who had money which has been lost through malfeasance in APRA-regulated funds have in fact been compensated.

267,Mr Shorten,"The louder you shout, Member for Higgins, your logic does not improve.before the House at this stage, we see another articulation of what it means to be Labor and to believe in ordinary Australians. In my seat, there are a number of groups of people who I have particular concerns about, Minister. I would really be very keen to hear how the government's reforms that are being revealed through Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, which is before us today, will assist these particular groups of people. First of all, I am thinking of people who are roughly at the age of 30. Thankfully, having grown up in a period after Labor brought in superannuation, these young 30-year-olds know the term 'superannuation', and in their lives they will have some experience of the benefits that that has given to people who are older. But, for our 30year-olds, what does what we are about to implement with the appropriation bill coming to pass actually mean? Another question I would really like a response on, Minister, is about the commitment that we have to people who manage on a very low income. What is it that Labor is doing in this appropriation bill to make sure that low-income earners in the seat of Robertson are going to get the advantage of having voted in a Labor government, knowing that we are going to honour our word and honour our ideological commitment to making sure all Australians move forward together? What is there for the low-income earners of Robertson? One of the features of the seat in which I live is that we have a large number of peopleover 18 per cent of the population in my seat-over 60. I note that many of them have given great service to this country and have an incredible level of experience that they still want to contribute to the community. Being over 70 does not mean that you are unemployable; it means that you are much more employable in many, many ways than others. What are we doing to help people who are over 70 in my electorate to get their fair share of what is going on in this country? It would be unsuitable for me not to ask a question about women. Being a working mother myself and having faced all of the wonderful opportunities and challenges that come with being a working mother, I know that Labor has a legislative commitment to advance women's rights and issues, to advance the economic potential for women to provide for their own futures and to have a secure retirement. We know that, currently, women are terribly underfunded in terms of their retirement savings. What is there in this budget that helps and supports women in getting better equity in life outcomes? I know there has been considerable argy-bargy here this afternoon with regard to small business, but the reality is this is a government that absolutely understands that small business is a major employer. In seats like my seat of Robertson, where there is a large service and retail sector, small business employers really need the advantages of what we can offer them as a federal government at this point in time. I am very interested, Minister, to hear what is in the appropriations bill that we can give to the small businesses in the seat of Robertson. call on the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation to respond. It is by agreement that we go through to 6.30 pm. I am conscious that we will chew in to people's time if there are further questions for the Minister for Financial Services. I will therefore let the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation respond, but then I am keen, as chair, to get over to the new minister.",268,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates
268,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Oakeshott,"I thank the member for Robertson and I willMinister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (18:01): I will try to be brief in answering that question. In terms of the propositions made about superannuation, there have been a range of measures made in this appropriations bill and there has been work done by the Treasury officials funded in this appropriations bill previously and going forward. So, adopting the standard of the member for Dunkley, I will range widely in terms of giving a comprehensive but brief answer to the member for Robertson. First of all, Labor is the party of superannuation. Without the successive Labor governments, the superannuation system as we know it now-universal and providing retirement nest eggs as part of people's retirement strategies-simply would not exist. It is also fair to advise the electors of Robertson that, whenever the coalition has had an opportunity to increase superannuation, they have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Again, the latest budget just represents more of the same of their DNA-to make superannuation the preserve of just some, not all. In particular, the member for Robertson asked me about what is being done to in support for women and their superannuation. I would obviously refer not only to this budget but also to earlier legislation which has seen the abolition of the 15 per cent contributions tax paid by people who earn less than $37,000. As the member for Robertson well knows, a high proportion of the very large number of Australians who earn less than $37,000 are women. What we have done is, basically, provided in the course of this year an almost billion-dollar tax concession to the low paid. That is good news for the people of Robertson, in particular to the women electors who earn less than $37,000. But that is part of the broader superannuation strategy in which we have been assisted by Treasury. We have increased the rate from nine to 12 per cent-that is good. We have abolished the tax for the low paid-that is equitable. We have put on a slightly higher charge for people who earn over $300,000-that is equitable and it is making sure that tax concessions are falling to those who most need them. We have also been improving the back office. I do acknowledge that the coalition today has voted to support some of our efforts in the back office operation of the SuperStream levy. We have also managed-although we were opposed by the opposition-to abolish the discrimination against people over 70 who are employees. Courtesy of this government, if the member for Robertson has people over 70 who are still employees, they will, from next year, be able to get superannuation on what they earn. In addition we have propositions in the parliament about better governance of superannuation. We had to take the difficult decision to defer the concession caps-that is the amount of money you put into superannuation above which you do not get the tax concession advantage. We had hoped to make it $50,000 per annum for people over 50. This year, clearly, the need to get back into surplus and the wise economic stewardship of the nation required a deferral of a quite attractive proposition to July 2014. I note also, for the member for Robertson to advise her electors, that we are the only political party interested in having an increase in the concessional caps. Unfortunately, we have heard nothing from the opposition-they are very good on the negative but not so good on the positive-in terms of superannuation.",269,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates

He has 16 officials sitting behind him. I think it has been an enormous waste of an opportunity. It is, again, a demonstration that the government is trying to avoid scrutiny. happened previously. The Federation Chamber is dealing with proposed appropriation for the Treasury portfolio of $4,441,842,000. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio be agreed to. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Resources, Energy and Tourism Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $648,549,000. management of the tourism portfolio. This is an industry, when you combine tourism and hospitality, that employs about one million people or 8.8 per cent of the Australian workforce. The issue I want to start with is the funding for Tourism Australia. When this government came to power the budget for Tourism Australia was $136,269,000. This year the proposed budget is $130,178,000 and in the forward estimates it is $134,556,000. This is the lowest funding level ever for Tourism Australia-the lowest funding ever for an industry that employs a million people. In fact, in real terms, the dollar loss between 2007 and 2012 is $18,949,000 or 16 per cent, and projected through to the forward estimates it is $22,943,000 or 19 per cent less. So, Minister, given that last year Australians spent 132 million bed nights on holidays overseas and that in 2008 Australia dropped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum's travel and tourism competitiveness index rankings, how do you justify reducing the budget for Tourism Australia when the numbers have dropped off so massively? The second thing I want to raise with you, Minister, is about your announcement on 2 May, the week before the budget, when you launched the Australian Tourism Investment Guide with great fanfare, yet in the budget-and you must have been aware of this-the MIT withholding rate was increased from 7½ to 15 per cent. Minister, surely you would have understood that that was going to have a massive effect. You got people wound up, geed up and excited about investing in Australia and then, after barely a week had gone by, that confidence for overseas investment particularly in our hotel industry was absolutely destroyed. It is no secret that there is a bed shortage in Australia, particularly of quality hotel accommodation. We both agree on that. So how do you address the fact that you launched the policy knowing what was going to be in the budget? You are a cabinet minister and I can only assume that things affecting your portfolio would have been discussed with you. The third thing I wish to raise with you, Minister, in the limited time we have here is the passenger movement charge. When you came to government in 2007 the passenger movement charge was $38. It was increased to $47. It is now proposed to increase it to $55. Minister, how do you justify a 45 per cent increase in a tax when this, projected through on",270,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates

On top of that, how do you justify putting a CPI on the PMC tax going forward from next year? Minister, given that you turned up at the National Tourism Alliance on 2 March, the final line under item 2 of their communique says: The Minister stated there would be no increase in the passenger movement charge. And then later on, in discussion on 'passenger facilitation', it said: The Minister informed the meeting he had heard of no proposal to raise the PMC in the upcoming budget. Minister, how can an industry have confidence if you are telling them one thing before a budget and doing something different afterwards, or does this equate to the promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' and then you introduce one? You have gone to the tourism industry and told them that there will be no increases in the PMC, and then after the budget they find that they are getting whacked. I know you are going to say that you are offsetting with the Asia Marketing Fund of $61 million. Minister, your CPI increase alone will collect $156 million just on the CPI increase, and you are giving $61 million back to the industry.

It is all right when out of the blue the New South Wales government introduces a new cruise ship tax of $20 per person, whereas previously it was an amount levied on each vessel by the appropriate port authorities. Mr Baldwin: Minister, this is about your tax! do this, then why can't the Australian government similarly adjust taxes as required? Perhaps the member for Paterson should also give the House an explanation as to why it was all right for the coalition when in government to increase the passenger movement charge on a regular basis, but it is not all right for the current Australian Labor government to do so.

Is the honourable member seeking to ask a question?Mr Baldwin: No, I am seeking to answer a question, as the minister has actually asked me a question. an increase in the budgetMr Baldwin: A rip-off. charge in 1999 by the Howard government, from $27 to $30. Then they sought to create the impression that this would just be to cover short-term costs related to the Olympic Games, but all of a sudden we found that increase was to continue-it was set in concrete. Then we go to 2001. It increased in 1999 and then in 2001we had a further increase from $30 to $38, an increase of 27 per cent. So it is good for the coalition, it is okay to increase the passenger movement charge, but when it comes to a government of an alternative political persuasion it is not appropriate. Let us also go to what we did as against the opposition. The increase in the passenger movement charge will have a minimal impact on the Australian tourism industry, because it is actually going better than the member for Paterson would like it to go both internationally and domestically. The average international visitor during the 2010-11 financial year spent $4,096 when visiting Australia. The proposed increase in the passenger movement charge of $8, or 17 per cent-a lower increase than the 27 per cent increase in 2001-represents only a small cost in the context of total visitor spend: 0.2 per cent. I also inform the House that work undertaken in 2011 by the Centre of Economic Policy at the University of New South Wales on behalf of the state and territory governmentsoverseen by Tourism Research Australia-modelled a 20 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, higher than what the government proposes. It found that it would have minimal impact on international visitation and potentially a positive impact in terms of Australians not going overseas, which is one of the desires of the Australian tourism industry. At the moment, we have 5.5 million visitors per year from overseas with 7.5 million Australians going overseas per year because of the strength of the Australian dollar-and the strength of the Australian economy. On the question relating to how the Australian tourism industry is going, the truth is that in relative terms, given the challenges in North America and Europe-and I suppose the opposition spokesman has not noticed that there are major economic challenges in North America and Europe at the moment-international tourism is doing well from an Australian perspective. In 2011, there were 5.9 million international arrivals, a similar result to 2010, which is not bad given the challenges in Europe and North America. Growth in Chinese arrivals was particularly strong, with an increase of 19.4 per cent in one year. Indonesian arrivals were up 13.2 per cent-and people forget the importance of Indonesia. And there was an increase in Indian arrivals of 6.8 per cent. (Time expired) hats for me-switching from his beach hat to his mining and resources hard hat.

282,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (18:17,"I ask the minister if he would not mind switchingcarbon tax. I know that in your heart of hearts, Minister, you do not actually believe in what you are being forced to implement. I want the minister to try to explain to me the seemingly contradictory position that he has. He has openly spoken about his support for efforts to clean up brown coal, possibly for export purposes. I think that it was the minister who coined the phrase, 'The Latrobe Valley could be the Pilbara of Victoria.' I believe that that position contradicts and is in stark contrast with your government's contract-for-closure policy, under which you are seeking to force the closure of 2,000 megawatts of brown coal power production and force the owners of those power stations out of business. Perhaps the minister can explain to me the miracle that occurs on the ships as they cross the seas in which this brown coal is somehow cleaned of its carbon content. Minister, I do not believe that you have any love for the contract-for-closure policy. Previously, you have left yourself a fair bit of wriggle room in your comments. You are saying that it is not contract for closure at any price. You are probably the only minister who has left himself a bit of wriggle room in that regard. On the contract-for-closure policy, given that we are just days away from the 1 July deadline the government has set, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for this process? Isn't it a fact, Minister, that the whole process is completely off the rails and there is no prospect of an agreement within the next couple of weeks and that you need an extension of time to try and salvage something from this policy wreckage? Rather than announce an extension of time, Minister, why won't you do what you really want to do, which is abandon this dud of a policy, a policy that will cost jobs and do nothing to change the temperature of the planet? Minister, we both know that closing coalfired power stations in the Latrobe Valley will not deliver a single direct environmental benefit anywhere in the world. We both know that contract for closure is a dud policy. Minister, will you deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time on its contract-for-closure policy? Tourism. But before I do call him, I would remind the member for Gippsland about parliamentary language. There was one particular word used in that speech with the blank look. I will remind him the word 'bulldust' is certainly in context. It is a word where better words can be found to describe the same concerns. The minister. for Tourism) (18:19): Let us, firstly, deal with the nature of the Latrobe Valley. The Latrobe Valley is rich in brown coal reserves. Let us also be frank, historically it is not able to be exported because it of its high moisture content and its combustible nature. The government is therefore absolutely involved with the Victorian government in exploring potential technology opportunities. The opportunities are basically driven by the private sector to which both parties are prepared to make a financial contribution and to assess potential technology, which would reduce the moisture content, and hence make it exportable. Also from an export potential it would represent a further energy opportunity for countries not as rich in resources as Australia in reducing emissions. For example, one of the projects involves Australian proponents in association with a company out of India. The lignite in the Latrobe Valley is akin to the lignite in India-high in moisture content-and if we break through on the technology front we create a new export opportunity.",273,Ipart In New South Wales Is Attributable To The Introduction Of A Carbon Price That Equates

284,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Minister for Resources and Energy and MinisterI am pleased to say that there are a whole variety of potential technology solutions in the Latrobe Valley including carbon caption storage which we also committed money to in trying to guarantee the future of the Latrobe Valley. In terms of the contract-for-closure process, obviously there are a range of issues of a commercial-in-confidence nature. I can also say that a number of the applicants-as has the government-have negotiated in good faith. They are interested in assessing whether or not it is possible within the envelope provided by government to enter into an agreement over time to reduce the emissions in the Latrobe Valley in terms of the high-emitting nature of the Latrobe Valley. No-one can deny that in relative terms the emissions out of a coal fired power station in Victoria are significantly higher than most other coal fired power stations in Australia. Hence, we also have the approach to technology of how to reduce the moisture content and, in doing so, reduce the emissions. With respect to the contract-for-closure process, if we make the breakthrough in technology, who will know what we will get out of the contract-forclosure process? There is an envelope and I will not go beyond the envelope because our assessment of what is value for money in terms of those existing power stations. Should one power station, for example, close, a change on technology can guarantee the future life and even potentially extend the life of other coal fired power stations because of the potential capacity to reduce emissions. These processes and negotiations are continuing, including with HRL and Energy Brix. I had further discussions today including, I might say, with the Victorian government to assess all available options. The real issue is: how do we assist the Latrobe Valley in creating a new future. I remind the honourable member that, under a direct action of his own coalition party room's policy at the last election, their intent to close power stations in the Latrobe Valley was absolutely reflected in direct action. I am reminding him of the policy at the last election-he was a candidate at the last electionMr Chester interjectingwould close the Latrobe Valley because the coalition at the time also appreciatedMr Chester interjectingreduce the emissions and to guarantee the Latrobe Valley a future.

If it is okay for the Latrobe Valley coal to be used in those contexts, why is it not okay for Latrobe Valley power station workers to keep their jobs? for Tourism) (18:24): Consider my answer. I refer to the technology which reduces the moisture content therefore, potentially, makes it exportable because it is no longer combustible. It also means the end use has low emissions, be it in Australia or overseas. My answer also referred to the fact that, if you get the necessary break from technology for whatever power stations that may continue operation in the valley, it makes them lower emitting; therefore, more viable under a carbon tax regime. Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Does he agree with the new CEO of that institute, Brad Page, who said in the press on the weekend in regard to the seed capital of $100 million a year being given to the institute that it 'was more than it knew how to spend' and said further: It's actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly. Does the minister agree with that statement? If he does not agree with that statement, can he explain to the House exactly what control he and his department have over the expenditure of the institute, which according to an article written by Lenore Taylor-who I am sure the minister has respect for because Lenore gets things right-describes a lavish lifestyle of that committee as it travelled first-class around the world having meetings at exorbitantly expensive venues. The questions are: does he agree with Brad Page that it is actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly, and can he explain what control he has over the institute to stop it wasting money? for Tourism) (18:26): I have not seen the comments of the CEO, in whom I have confidence.

I was part of that process. The initial figure raised is no longer the figure, as the honourable member appreciates. The current funding allocation enables us to pull our weight internationally as the major coal-exporting nation in the world, to participate in other countries in terms of the research and learning processes potentially related to how we reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage. The technology is not proven; the issue is how to reduce the cost to commercialisation. In the same way we have to work out how we reduce the cost of every other form of clean energy, be it nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal or whatever.

We are beating the rest of the world, whether you look at the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe generally. We have a very good news story to tell on jobs. We have a very good news story to tell on inflation, which is low. We have a very good news story to tell on wages growth, which is faster than CPI. We know that the best way to deal with the cost of living is to have growing wages and, if you have not got a job, to get a job and, if you got a job, to get a better job. That is always the best way of dealing with the cost of living. We have got low interest rates, which of course are a major contributor to family and household budgets. We have got low debt-not high debt but low debt-and we have got an investment pipeline, which, according to the Treasurer tonight, increased by 12.3 per cent in the March quarter, to reach a record of $1.086 billion, the first time more than $1 billion has been spent on mineral exploration in a single quarter. That exploration has risen by 35 per cent since the price of carbon was announced, and 80 per cent since the minerals resource rent tax. So we have a stunning investment pipeline, which will basically underwrite future economic growth. We have doubled investment in schools. We have an extra 116,000 university places, which we know are a major contributor to future economic growth. We have a record number of people in training and apprenticeships. We have some 460,000 Australians currently in trade apprenticeships or vocational training nationwide. So we have got a very good news story, particularly when you look at the rest of the world. The US recovery is slow due to the housing overhang and the results of the household debt and banking debts that were incurred during their crisis. Europe is having a political crisis which has economic implications, which is all basically around the security of debt and who is going to be responsible about it. We see them pursuing damaging and counterproductive short-term austerity programs, very similar to what the coalition would advocate for Australia. We know that in Europe the only solution is a guarantee of all European debt, followed by short-term growth policies and finally a program of long-term austerity, not short-term austerity.

We know that the member for Mayo has speculated about mining investment in my state, South Australia. He will do so again-talking the state down, talking mining down in the state.

The first is 22 per cent unemployment in Greece; 20 per cent in Spain; and 4.9 per cent here in Australia. Imagine the way the political discourse would be carried on in this country if we were loaded up with the number of jobless that exist in those countries. Certainly no-one wishes that on anyone but having that level of unemployment, not only as an economic issue but as a social one as well and its massive distortion on politics, would be phenomenal if it were to occur in this country. If anything, in terms of this debate, it is not so much that we talk about facts themselves; it is more getting a recognition of facts from those opposite. When you look at where our economy is relative to others, our economy has done phenomenally well. We are right to be proud. Mr Briggs interjectinggracious about the contribution of those opposite.

There was not an investment in hospitals; there was an underinvestment in health. In terms of education itself, instead of putting money into TAFE, those opposite sought to duplicate the TAFE system by setting up their own rival TAFE system and underfunding TAFE. Yes, you did get a surplus-everyone acknowledges that. It is the way that you got there and the underinvestment and what was left as a result of that and the type of issues that we have to deal with now. The Reserve Bank was saying from the early part of the last decade that capacity constraints were the biggest threat to the economy, that those capacity constraints were in the form of skills shortages and infrastructure constraints that needed to be addressed and were not. I have already talked about what happened in education. Where were you on infrastructure? You pretty much abandoned, for instance, anything to do with urban planning or involvement in urban infrastructure-not only making cities liveable but ensuring the fluid movement of people and goods within cities. I will give credit to those opposite. The one bit of infrastructure that you did get to was the M7, and you only got to it because you put a toll on it. I am first to admit that the M7 was certainlyMr Briggs interjectingto invest without putting the imposition of tolls. Most of the infrastructure in this country has not been developed simply as a result of putting a toll bucket on the end of it. Again, if you look at unemployment, at inflation and at growth, we have a great advantage relative to others. My biggest concern is not just about our recognising the strength of this economy but about making sure that we continue to ensure that this is an open economy, one that connects within the region, that maintains, for example, a commitment to recognising the value of Australian investment, along with foreign investment; that we are able to take advantage, for example, of what we have as a result of the NBN and take advantage of our IT sector and what that can do in connecting us, not only internally but within our region. As much as this is a discussion for here and now-and what I will pick up on in terms of what the member for Mayo is saying-the reforms that we make now generate prosperity down the track. I am certainly proud of being part of a government that has put us in a position where we are able to leap off the advantage that has been given to us. opposite who speak on it is so typical of this government's approach: they automatically think that the good aspects of the Australian economy have something to do with them. I would not be so churlish as to say that the past reforms of past Labor governments have not contributed to Australia's economic performance today, just as the past reforms of the coalition government.

322,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (18:45,"What we are seeing in this motion and in all of thoseThere is no shame; repeatedly, week after week, day after day, there are motions of selfcongratulation when, really, if you look at what this government has done and the way it goes about it, it is very, very obvious to Australians that not only is this a bad government but it is a government that will claim credit for things it has not done. It is a government that, still, with every breath, with every day and with every act will not be straight with the Australian people. My friend and colleague the member for Mayo articulated very eloquently the government's failings on some major policy areas. If you take this long motion from Dr Leigh, it calls, amongst other things, for debates with facts. Now, this motion is coming out at a time when the government is sending letters to pensioners about cash for the carbon tax, and the Prime Minister's office is tweeting 'cash for you'. The public rightly see through this. There are letters such as the one I have here with the headline 'Extra cash for you' and reads: 'Cheaper than a $2 shop, extra cash for you. P.S. This is just part of the extra help the government is giving millions of Australians.' Extra help for what? 'Extra help to deal with the carbon tax, compensation to help with the injury we are causing you with the carbon tax.' Dr Leigh says there should be debates about facts. What about some facts on a letter headlined 'Extra cash for you'? What about another P.P.S saying: 'All of this is borrowed money.' That would be one fact that, if you were upfront with the Australian people, you would put in a letter that you were sending out. What about explaining to the Australian people that every dollar that the government is giving is borrowed and they will have to pay it back, and their children will have to pay it back? But, no, you do not get that from this government or from those who support this government-those who prop it up. As I mentioned at the outset, we saw on the weekend the hashtag from the Prime Minister's office, 'Cash for you'. Quite rightly, the Twittersphere responded as you would expect. One tweet likened it to an African bank scam, as you would expect: '#cashforyou. Urgent business relationship. First, I am a Nigerian prince and must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.' This government that seriously stands before this parliament is sending out letters with 'cash for you' and twee hashtags, as I have said, and is expecting the public to take them seriously. What the Australian people know is that this money that is being sent out is borrowed money. There is $100 million a day being borrowed. In your personal life, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Oakeshott, because you are a normal family guy, if you spend on your credit card you get the bill. With the government, they have got the card, but it is the families that get the bill. They pay the bill. This government borrows money on their behalf to send out to them and then writes them a letter congratulating itself on sending the money out, headlined, 'Extra cash for you'. We have all the oratory from the Prime Minister. That is what it has come to for the Labor Party. From Curtain to Chifley, I would even say the oratory of Whitlam, down to this Prime Minister: 'Cash for you.' That says it all about this government, and to have a motion from Dr Leigh on serious economic issues(Time expired) very interested to read the recent book by George Megalogenis and to read about Billy Snedden, then opposition leader, in about July 1973 summoning the coalition leaders to Sydney to talk about the fact that the Whitlam Labor government had failed, that the experiment was wrong and all these jeremiads about how bad it was.

324,Mr Neumann (Blair) (18:51,"The member for Casey talked a bit about history. I waswas like reading a speech from the current Leader of the Opposition. It was the fact that those opposite never, ever accept the legitimacy of a Labor government. It is the divine right to rule that is in their heads and in their hearts. What you really should believe is what they say when they go overseas, not what they say when they are campaigning here. We have had the Leader of the Opposition running around like some sort of Old Testament prophet saying, 'We're all doomed,' like Sodom and Gomorrah or something like that. The whole thing is about to collapse. Australia is like Sodom and Gomorrah: it is going to collapse; the economy has completely had it. But when they go overseas it is a different story. When they are speaking to an international audience they endorse the direction and the strong economic fundamentals of the economy. In fact, in his budget-in-reply speech, the opposition Treasury spokesperson said that economic growth under this government had been poor. But he went on Bloomberg TV and conceded that the economic fundamentals of the economy were strong. The Leader of the Opposition declared that the federal Labor government would never return the budget to surplus, as we projected and Treasury projects, but he actually recalibrated his message, with his Treasury spokesperson talking up the Treasurer's steps to deliver a surplus when he was overseas. When he is overseas he says, 'Yes, it's going to happen.' But, when he is in Australia, it is a different story entirely because it does not suit their narrative and their campaign purpose. Last year when he was in London, the Leader of the Opposition claimed that Australia had serious bragging rights, but now there is a sovereign risk with a Labor government. All we can say about those opposite is that they are inconsistent. They have a mercurial if not schizophrenic approach to economic management that is governed by 30-second sound bites. But I prefer to listen to what the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have to say about our economy. When those opposite are in power they say that they are great managers of the economy, but when Labor is in power and the economy is going well it has nothing to do with the government; it is all to do with other events and other people. But when they are in power you hear the exact opposite. If they had bothered to go to the recent forum in Brisbane, they would have heard first hand what the participants at the forum said. But they called it a talkfest. The Premier of my state did not even bother to turn up to it in his hometown. It was a missed opportunity to meet with the captains of industry and leaders of the unions to talk about how to improve the economy and improve the productivity of the country. We know when you have a look at the economy, you see the five per cent unemployment rate. About 835,000 jobs have been created since we have been in office, while 27 million jobs have been lost in the Western world. We have low interest rates-lower than when those opposite were in government. I distinctly remember being a candidate in 2004 when former Prime Minister John Howard talked about interest rates always being lower under a coalition government. It is completely untrue. We have a growing economy. We are one of the few countries to actually avoid a recession and it is because we were not asleep at the wheel when it came to the global financial crisis. We invested in timely, stimulus events and it had to be done. Those opposite failed. They would have taken us to unemployment and recession. We invested in road infrastructure, school infrastructure, health infrastructure and community infrastructure. Why? We wanted to keep jobs going. That is why we have an unemployment rate of about 4.6 per cent in Ipswich. Traditionally, Ipswich has almost double the national average rate of unemployment during times of hardship and decline. We invested in great projects like the Ipswich Motorway, where about 10,000 people had jobs. We invested in those projects; those opposite spent three campaigns campaigning against that. That is an indication of why the economic fundamentals are strong in this country. a thesis it is. I just hope that the one that got him his doctorate had a little more substance than this one. He talks about the key issue being whether we want the economic discussion to be about fact or fiction. My view of this thesis of emotion is that really it is Dr Leigh's motion of no confidence in the Treasurer. It is saying that the Treasurer's record cannot stand on its own; therefore we need all members of the Labor Party to stand up and hail the Treasurer for the wonderful job that he has done, whereas they all know and see it in question time everyday that this Treasurer has no credibility whatsoever. He can take credit for nothing because he has done nothing of substance as Treasurer to in any way improve the productivity of this nation. This no confidence motion in the Treasurer, as set out in this thesis by Dr Leigh, has no substance to it. Let us look at what is fact. Let us look at the fact that the Labor Party will not call the carbon tax for what it is: a tax. It always says 'carbon price'. Yet the Prime Minister, under duress, admitted that it is a carbon tax. So now they must not dare mention carbon tax in anything that goes out; it has to be carbon price. Let us get some facts. Let the Labor government tomorrow in the chamber come out and use the words 'carbon tax'-call it for what it is. Let us see some facts. Let us also see them detail the real impact that it is going to have on the Australian community. I do not think that Dr Leigh or the others we have heard from today will do that. The memo has gone out to the Labor Party: 'You cannot use the term ""carbon tax"", even though the Prime Minister admitted that that is what it is. You have to use carbon price.' Not only do they have to use carbon price; they then use bribes to try to overcome the detrimental impact that it is going to have on the Australian people. They will use those bribes and market them under this '#cashforyou'. I must commend the member for Mayo for the wonderful press release that he put out last week on this '#cashforyou', where he demonstrated magnificently what it is all about: cash being taken from future generations of Australians to bribe the current generation of Australians to try to forget about the impact that this carbon tax will have on them. He referred to it as being very similar to an African Ponzi scheme, with the emails we all get trying to rip off the Australian public. It was extremely apt and hit the nail on the head when it comes to fact versus fiction with this government. We also have other examples. Let us look at the budget surplus-the budget surplus which the Treasurer has said that he will deliver. Why then, on the nation's credit card, did he sneak through a rise from $250 billion to $300 billion? And why, when we sought to make this clear in the budget papers, would he have nothing of it? We wanted to get the fact in that, even though he was budgeting for a surplus, he wanted a $50 billion extension on the nation's credit card. Would he allow that fact to be revealed in the budget papers clearly? No, he would not. Let us look at cost of living. I do not see any mention of cost of living in Dr Leigh's motion before us. Since this government came to power, electricity costs have increased by 65.7 per",282,Private Members Business

The list goes on and on, and I have not even got to child care. The government has done nothing to address these cost-of-living issues and it is about to make it worse when it introduces the carbon tax on 1 July. We on this side are happy to talk about facts until we get to the next election and we can get rid of this incompetent Labor government. Debate adjourned. Trade Unions Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Buchholz: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) serious allegations have been made surrounding the misappropriation of union members' funds by union leaders; (b) Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary, Dave Oliver, has said that every union member has the right to know that their money is going to be subject to good governance and good regulation; and (c) Australian Workers Union National Secretary, Paul Howes, has said he supports bringing unions' accountability and transparency in line with the Corporations Act 2001; and (2) calls on the Government to implement a plan that will expect the same standards of accountability and transparency of union leaders as are expected of Company Directors under the Corporations Act 2001. past few months a classic example of alleged horrendous misuse of some union members' funds by some union officials. It is a disgrace to this nation, not to say embarrassing for the union movement as a whole. Moreover, given the widely criticised role of Fair Work Australia in recent weeks, a better system or policy needs to be set up to investigate any possible regulatory breaches by the unions, while enforcing regulations and any new powers to bring criminal prosecutions directly to the courts. In his address to the 2012 ACTU Congress on union governance the ACTU Secretary, Dave Oliver, said: We have a significant responsibility to our members to ensure and make double sure that members’ money is only used for purposes to advance our members’ interests. I believe Dave Oliver's comments to be sincere and that the union movement want to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the sordid affairs of the misappropriation of members' funds. This motion allows that to happen by expecting the same level of accountability for union officials as expected of company directors under the Corporations Act, which is enforced by the relevant regulatory bodies. Here we have it: even a secretary of the one of the biggest union movements in Australia recognises change is needed to ensure better accountability and transparency for our union leaders. Furthermore, in his opening address the 2012 congress, Mr Oliver said that unions 'have a significant responsibility to our members to ensure and make double sure that members’ money is only used for purposes to advance our members’ interests'.",284,Private Members Business
326,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (19:01,"Let me start by saying that we have seen over theWe have seen shameful actions by union officials time and time again and it is well due that we as federal members do something about it. I can no longer sit back and watch the tireless efforts and hard-earned dollars of mums and dads and men and women-some of whom are in my electorate-who pay their money to these unions allegedly be misappropriated. I am talking about the money that is earned by some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, by people who face an incredible struggle every day just to put food on the table and pay their bills, people who, for the sake of their job security, pay union fees because they believe or are led to believe that union officials represent the interests of their members. Failure to implement this motion would be a grave action of injustice towards the Australian people-towards their integrity and their dignity-because it speaks directly to ensuring that the rights of the Australian people are put first. The union movement in Australia, as I understand it, was constructed to work as a collective group with the aim of bettering workplace conditions. Yet we have seen time and time again, particularly in recent times in relation to the HSU, the misuse of members' funds to the denigration, reputation and personal gain of union leaders. Something has to change and it is time to make that happen. The regulatory approach of company directors outlined in the Australian Securities and Investment Commission states that company directors are expected to comply with the law. It is backed by the requirement laid out in the Corporations Act 2001. SoI ask: if it is good enough for company directors, why is it not good enough for the union officials as well? Well, it is. In fact, it is the intention of union officials such as Oliver and Howes who are calling for this motion. They are calling for this motion because they know that it offers them a level of protection. They want to be measured by the same levels of integrity that are imposed by the Corporations Act. They want to distance their respective organisations from the allegations of poor governance resulting in 156 alleged contraventions which were identified in the recent Fair Work Australia report. It is these findings that afflict a stench over the whole union movement. The act also states that they are to comply with statutory due care and diligence, that a reasonable person would exercise their power and discharge duties in good faith in the best interests of the company for proper purpose and not improperly using their position to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to the company and not improperly use information, and to disclose to other directors any material personal interest. ASIC Chairman Jeff Lucy AM highlighted the importance of these aforementioned points in an address to the 2006 Australian Institute of Company Directors. The address of Mr Lucy also looked at the experiences of companies whose directors were charged with criminal neglect of their duty and their companies obviously went broke. I am slightly surprised that the task of implementing this motion has not been tackled earlier by my colleagues in this place. I truly believe that the aim of protecting the interests of the Australian people-for me the people of right-through implementing this motion is imperative to safeguarding their rights and future. It is with great honour that I put forward the motion. I say this for two reasons because it concerns the lives of innocent working people that I represent as the federal member for Wright. Their welfare is paramount to my role as the federal member, and tougher supervision of unions in this matter is, I believe, an effective way to stay on top of our game. In a common sense approach in saying this I asked the question: who are the union officials? They are, as I mentioned earlier, representatives of some of the lowest paid workers in this nation. In a recent opinion column published in the Sunday Telegraph on 20 May 2012, Australian Workers Union National Secretary Paul Howes said: Being a union official should make you less likely to steal money from workers, but that's not always the case. It is a sad situation for the entire nation when even union officials admit that other union officials would possibly steal funds from their members. There is no excuse for accepting this type of criminal behaviour. I wholeheartedly endorse this statement when it goes on to say that: The new compliance structures will work to restore our members' trust in their unions. What a powerful statement to come from a union official. It is absolutely imperative that this motion work to restore confidence of the Australian people. We have, as members of parliament, a duty to work constructively to increase the levels of transparency and accountability of unions to their members. Furthermore, Health Services Union secretary Kathy Jackson has also come out in support of making unions subject to the Corporations Act. In her speech to the HR Nicholls Society on 12 June she said, 'Union leaders have urged for tougher regulations of companies to protect investors, but union members need to do more to protect.' Finally, in an opinion column in the Australian Financial Review last week, Ms Jackson said: Reform brought in by a Coalition government and resisted by many unionists actually served for the better governance of unions. There is some fine work done in this nation by unions and there are some fine people who contribute to unions, but there is a stench at the moment around the governance of specific union membership and where the contributions of mums and dads to unions end up. Here we have two senior union officials-Oliver and Howes-both calling for more accountability and transparency. They support accountability and transparency being brought into line with the Corporations Act. If it is good enough for company directors, why is it not good enough for these organisations? In support of my motion, I ask for the government's support in establishing, for the sake of union members right across the nation, the same level of protection that is offered to those who contribute to banks-or anyone whose peak body falls under the regulatory auspices of the Corporations Act. member for Wright that unions play an important role in this country. I support the proposition advanced by the member for Wright that, when working men and women in Australia pay their contributions voluntarily, as they do, to an association known as a trade union, those funds be used for the purposes for which they are contributed-that is, to advance their interests. These are interests like advancing wages and conditions, and legislation and other regulations that are often the subject of debate in this place. It is to ensure that they get the best deal from legislation and from government and the best deal when it comes to their wages and conditions. I support that proposition. In fact, it would be pretty hard to argue against it although, from time to time, I have heard members stand up in this place, particularly members of the coalition, and argue against those propositions. But it",285,Private Members Business
327,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (19:11,"I support the proposition advanced by thewould be very difficult for right minded-no pun intended; a reasonably minded person-to advance that proposition. Further, I support the proposition that a union official should be accountable to the members they are elected to serve. I say this with some authority on the matter, having spent some six years of my life as an elected representative of the trade union movement and it is something I am very proud to have done. I can honestly say that for six years of my life I went to work every day attempting to do something to advance the living conditions of the working men and women I represented. I am also very pleased to say that, in an overwhelming number of instances, I left that union-and those men and women-in a better state that when I found it. I do not say this because I think I am some exception; I say this because I think that the overwhelming number of men and women whose calling it is to represent union members in this country go to work with that aspiration. They attempt to do that. I know I represent the views of the men and women on this side of the House when I say, and it was not said by the member for Wright, that the allegations that have been made in relation to the misuse of members' moneys by branches or parts of the Health Services Union of Australia, if found to be true, are nothing short of deplorable. They stand to be condemned by every union member in this country and those who hold and share the values of the union movement. If those allegations are proved to be true, then they stand to be condemned. In so much as the motion goes to the heart of those issues it is very difficult, and I would say that every right-thinking person in this country and in this place should support them. But that is not really what this is about. This is about the coalition party having another go at the union movement in an attempt to use this place, this chamber, as an opportunity to rake the muck and make allegations against unions and unionists in this country. We know this because, in his address on the motion before the House, the member for Wright advanced that on the basis that it was in the interests of low-paid workers. The member for Wright is an honest man; I know him to be a man who approaches his job with integrity. But if he really had a concern for the plight of low-paid workers in this country, he would leave this chamber immediately and go to his leader's office and to the office of the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations and say: 'This year should we the last year that we have opposed a wage increase through the awards system for the lowest-paid workers in this country. I know that we have done it every year since Federation, but this year should be the last year that we do it.' I know the member for Wright to be an honest man with integrity and he believes in the things that he is advancing. If he wants to do something for the low-paid workers in this country he should make that march into his leader's office and say: 'This should be the last year that we do this. We cannot on the one hand advance a motion in support of low-paid workers in this country and on the other hand oppose wage increases going to the lowest-paid workers in this country.' The second thing the member for Wright should do is move from this chamber to the nearest phone at his disposal and call the Premier of New South Wales. He should say, 'Dear Premier, I am concerned about the plight of working people in New South Wales and, for that reason, I ask you to withdraw the laws that you are ramming through the New South Wales parliament which are an attack on workers compensation in New South Wales.' That is the second thing that he can do. I do not believe that that is going to happen and, even if the member for Wright does make that journey and that phone call, I do not think we are going to see that about-face. From that, and upon that evidence, we are entitled to form the conclusion that this is nothing short of a ruse. They are crocodile tears. Let me contrast that to the very real actions that have been taken by the minister for industrial relations to address the issues. We have taken steps and the minister has announced that we intend to introduce legislation into parliament before the end of the year which is specifically designed to increase the transparency and accountability of registered organisations, both employer and trade union registered organisations. For instance, it will require the full disclosure of remuneration and board fees to be made to all members. I interrupt my line of thought here for a moment. When I was running my union-and I am sure that the member for Chifley had a similar approach-we had a very simple rule: if you are a representative of the union and you are sitting on a board, you take one salary and not two. If you are receiving remuneration as a result of your being a nominee on a board, whether that be a superannuation board or any other board, you donate those fees back to the union because that is the right thing to do-you take one salary, not two. I think it would be a good thing in this country if many of the employers and corporations took the same approach instead of featherbedding their own remuneration. I think that is the right principle. But the proposition that will be advanced by the government is that all board fees and remuneration should be disclosed to members, and I think that is the right thing to do. It will require transactions with related parties, including family members or companies related to family members, to be disclosed to members as well so that we cannot have registered organisations taking advantage of union funds to send contracts to family members or other related entities where that would not otherwise pass a due diligence test. It will require officers to undertake training in financial accountability that is related to their duties. It will require organisations to develop policies in relation to financial accountability and management. It will recognise the important role played by trade unions and employer organisations in our federal workplace relations system. I support bona fide reform in this area. Members should have full control over the affairs of their union, including the remuneration paid by their union. It was interesting to note that, when the executive remuneration legislation was before this House earlier this year, those opposite took an entirely different approach. They said that the shareholders should not have tools at their disposal to control the remuneration of board members of publicly listed companies. They want to impose an obligation on union officials that in many instances they are not willing to impose on employers. The whole thing is a ruse. We need reform, and members on this side will support genuine reform. the member for Wright. It is one that encapsulates the feelings of many Australians who are very angry at the form of the Australian union movement and in particular at the political arm of the union movement, the Australian Labor Party. The reality is that tens of thousands of ordinary working Australians who are making award wages have seen their money frittered away by hacks in the union movement who have squandered the hard earned money of those lowly paid Australians while members of the Labor Party averted their eyes.",287,Private Members Business
328,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (19:21,"I am pleased to support the excellent motion moved byThis motion seeks to encapsulate the strong community sentiment that enough is enough. Australians are tired of the Australian Labor Party looking the other way while tens of thousands of dollars-and in some instances there are allegations of hundreds of thousands of dollars-of the money of low-paid Australian workers is spent at the behest of union leaders to support the things that union leaders want. This motion is a good starting point, but in reality what we need is a royal commission into the Australian union movement. The Australian union movement should be subjected to a royal commission so that we can get to the bottom of what is going on. A labour force of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are seeing the money that they pay to the union movement-a million dollars in one union alone-misappropriated. I noticed that Labor members opposite laughed. Labor's fundamental problem is that they think it is funny when potentially millions of dollars are misappropriated. When a member of parliament stands up and says, 'We will stand up for low-paid Australian workers', says that it is not good enough that their money is being misappropriated, it is not good enough that the Australian Labor Party turns the other way and it is not good enough that they fly blind in the face of the allegations, it concerns me that Labor Party members think that is funny. And why do they think it is funny? Here is the great con: the reason they think it is funny is that basically every single member of the Australian Labor Party is a former union hack who has bought their way into the Australian parliament. Workers pay their fees to the unions and that money helps pay for the campaign activities of Labor members. That is why people on our side turn their noses up at the sheer rank hypocrisy of Australian Labor Party members when it comes to the fees that are paid to low-paid Australian workers. There should be a royal commission into exactly what is going on the trade union movement. But the extraordinary thing is that the allegations have been around for a long time. I have had allegations put to me by an unsuccessful tenderer for a public authority who lost out on a tender despite the fact that they were the cheapest tenderer. They investigated why they lost the contract. What went wrong? It was reported back that they had not made big enough contributions to the so-called training funds of a particular union. This is what concerns us. Allegations like that have been aroundseat. I ask the honourable member to come back to the motion before the chair. arrangements of oversight of union movements. Very serious allegations against union movements have been around for years. That is the reason there needs to be better transparency, that is the reason union officials should be held to exactly the same standards that apply to company directors and that is the reason we need a royal commission into the trade union movement. It is not right, it is not fair and it is not equitable for those workers who pay their money, day in and day out, expecting that their rights and their best interests will be upheld by people who are more interested in finding their way into this federal parliament or into a state Labor parliament. That is the reason we need to have better oversight.

331,Mr Ciobo,"The motion before the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, deals withinterests of the company and for proper purpose, and not improperly use their position to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or cause detriment to the company. That is what applies to company directors and it should apply to union officials as well. unbelievable behaviour! If anything, that last contribution really demonstrates what is beneath the veneer of this motion. Those opposite wring their hands at any sign of criticism of corporate Australia. They are out there upset and uptight at any point at which you criticise corporate Australia. They drag their own feet on reform that might not reach the approval of corporate Australia. You only need to look at how long it took to get trade practices reform through the gritted teeth of corporate Australia because those opposite would not do anything about it. But, whenever they get a chance to bag out unions or their members, they are there with a straight spine. They are there, first off, taking any chance they can to bag out unions and to ignore working Australians, unless of course they are able to be used as a media opportunity. The Liberal Party never meaningfully engage with the union movement. They never, ever engages with them. It is simply tick-a-box, stakeholder consultation where they are telling you what they are going to do and not really trying to involve the union movement on issues that affect their members. They will never seek the unions' ideas out and they will never work to sort out differences. Let me contrast it this way. If we on this side of the House were to ever treat corporate Australia in the way that those opposite treat the union movement, they would be the first to feign outrage and to have a national wailing movement with confected outrage about the mistreatment of corporate Australia. How is it that those opposite can continually malign, bag out and criticise the union movement and never meaningfully engage with it or see them as people who have an inherent stake in the future of the economy, in the communities they operate in and in this country? Why do they never ever see them as a group that should be consulted and worked with? The Liberal Party are only ever there to bag them out or to see if they can score a political point out of them. The people who had the Work Choices cape are now telling us they are the greatest offenders of the low paid whereas, as the member for Throsby pointed out, they are never there supporting any submission to increase the salaries, the incomes or the wages of the lowest paid in our society. To the matter at hand, I have spoken on the record encouraging unions to embrace accountability and to champion transparency, not just because it builds a greater affinity and a greater commitment to unions as a whole, but because it is simply the right thing to do. But, with respect, we do not need this resolution to do that, because as a government we are already acting. The government has already been clear, through the introduction of legislation in parliament which is specifically designed to increase transparency and accountability of registered organisations-not just unions, but also industry associations-that would require, for example, remuneration and board fees to be disclosed to members; require transactions with related parties, including family members, and transactions where an officer has a material personal interest, to be disclosed; require officers to undertake training in financial accountability; require organisations to develop policies in relation to accountability and management; and recognise the important role played by unions and employer organisations in our federal workplace relations system. These things are being introduced by us as a result, I emphasise, of widespread consultation not just with one group or one section of the",290,Private Members Business
332,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (19:26): What stunning hypocrisy; whatcommunity-industry associations-but also with unions. It has been open; it has been transparent. It has not been conducted behind closed doors; it has not been foisted on the parliament as an ambush. The legislation that was specifically designed to hurt one group in society, Work Choices, contrasts with what we are doing, which is talking with people and trying to introduce reform. The other thing I have to say to those opposite is: just bear in mind the unintended consequences of what you are saying. There are a number of people who are affected by this-not just unions, but industry associations as well. I would be interested in getting from them a sense of where they are going to get people to go onto their boards of management if the opposition enforce the types of provisions they are trying to suggest should be enforced through what is being proposed here today. friend and colleague the member for Wright in the motion that he puts, as well as the member for Moncrieff, who seconded the motion. Today a leader of the Australian union movement could well be found admitting in private 'Now is the winter of our discontent.' Tarnished by the rolling scandals of the Health Services Union, plagued by factional warfare among its leadership and struggling to maintain a declining membership, which is now at only 12 per cent of the private sector workforce: these are the realities of the current union landscape. Yet, despite these seismic developments, many on the other side of the House continue to maintain, as if nothing has happened, that it is business as usual. They continue to roll up to the ACTU conferences chanting Soviet era songs and pledging their allegiance. But they are in denial, for the HSU scandal is something more than a passing event. It goes to the core of good governance and the standards of transparency and accountability that we expect from our organisations and our community leaders. It goes to the heart of what we consider to be criminal behaviour and subject to significant punishment. This is what the motion put forward by my friend and colleague the member for Wright is about. It is about saying that we expect the government to hold unions and their leaders to the same standards that we would expect of our companies and their directors. It is not enough for AWU secretary Paul Howes to simply say: ... the alleged actions of a small minority in a relatively small sector have stained the reputations of the majority ... and to use that as an excuse for not supporting wide-scale reform. Nor is it sufficient for Jeff Lawrence to say 'union members have a right to be confident that their money is being well spent' but then not put in place real changes that will prevent a repeat of what happened at the HSU. The opposition has a plan that the government should support, a plan to pass legislation that will see registered organisations subject to the same rules and the same penalties set out in the Corporations Act 2001. Currently trade unions, like employer groups, work as registered organisations with obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. Such obligations include not using their position for personal gain, ensuring the appropriate use of members' money and acting at all times in the best interests of the members. However, the penalties are not nearly as significant as those found in the Corporations Act. For example, under section 287 and 288 of the Fair Work Act, civil penalties for using information to the detriment of the organisation or for personal advantage could involve fines of up to only $2,200 for an individual, and no criminal provisions apply.",291,Private Members Business
333,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (19:31,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to support myIn contrast, under section 184 of the Corporations Act, criminal offences could lead to a fine of up to $200,000 for an individual and/or imprisonment for up to five years. This is what now is required. What is more, the coalition is not prepared to leave Julia Gillard's creation Fair Work Australia and its general manager to police to enforce or to investigate these new obligations on registered organisations. We need to separate the watchdog role of Fair Work Australia from its day-to-day role solving disputes and making agreements. This is why it took nearly three years or more for Fair Work to produce a report into the HSU, highlighting its institutional 'go slow' tactics as well as disconcerting levels of incompetence. Tony Abbott has said that in government we will establish a new body, the Registered Organisations Commission, which will enforce these new compliance organisations, educate members of registered organisations about their rights, and also act as a repository for complaints from its members. This motion is not an attack on unions. In fact, there are many good people who are members of unions. They make a significant contribution to the betterment of our country. But what this is about is an attack on corruption and building levels of responsibility, accountability and transparency. With more than 150 findings by Fair Work against HSU, and 70,000 low-paid workers being short-changed by thousands of dollars wasted and misused something needs to be done. This motion goes some way towards that end. contribution from the previous speakers, I am sure it would have been considered. Nevertheless, I rise to oppose the member for Wright's motion. WhilstI have a lot of time for the member for Wright-I am sure I will see him down at the Senate rugby field tomorrow morning, where we might be on the same side or on opposing sides-nevertheless I do oppose his motion. I respect his intentions and respect that commitment of everybody in the House to accountability. However, I do reassure the member for Wright that in the last few months the Gillard Labor government has taken an unprecedented number of actions to improve the regulation of trade unions and employer organisations as well-something that I look forward to reading the transcript of his speech to see that he has mentioned. Given the findings by Fair Work Australia in its reports regarding the HSU national office and the HSU No. 1 branch, the federal government has repeatedly stated on the public record that the conduct outlined in Fair Work Australia's reports is not acceptable at all. We believe, and I believe in my discussions with the union movement, that the problems with the HSU are not representative of the broader trade union movement at all. We recognise and understand that unions and employer associations play a critical role in facilitating the operation of the workplace relations system. I say that from my experience in the union movement both when I was a teacher-when I worked unpaid as a teacher as part of enterprise bargaining negotiations-and then as a member of the Queensland Independent Education Union as a union organiser, when I sat down and worked on behalf of my members. I should say that I do not know the HSU very well. We do not have an HSU in Queensland. United Voice, the AWU and a few others would basically cover that calling that the HSU covers. But I can say that I do know the three unions that I am a member of: the Independent Education Union, which looks after private schools' union members; United Voice; and the ASU's clerical and administrative branch. I have had a lot to do with them, particularly the",292,Private Members Business
334,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (19:36,"While I did not have a chance to hear all of theIndependent Education Union, whose annual reports I see every year. A respectable auditor goes through their accounts with a fine toothcomb. Having had a union credit card, I can say that I seemed to spend every month laboriously going through to justify anything and everything that I put on that union credit card-which is the right thing and the appropriate thing to do. Obviously things did go a little bit astray in the HSU No. 1 branch, where they were able to put such things on the union credit card. I take my role as a Labor representative very seriously, as I am sure the member for Wright will acknowledge, but I also took my role as a union representative very seriously and would not ever spend a union member's dollar unless it was in pursuit of the best interests of that union member. I took that role very, very seriously indeed, and most of the trade union members. I have ever met are similarly inclined. They are passionate people trying to do the right thing by working members of Australia. Obviously, we have had a long and free independent union movement. If we trace our days back to Barcaldine, the shearers' strike and the formation of the Labor Party out of the union movement, we can see that the union movement and the Labor Party have always had that strong connection. In fact, I have always seen the Labor Party as the political arm of the trade union movement. Members of trade unions, like members of employee organisations or other organisations must be respected and their interests must be respected. Obviously, they have every right to expect that their money is used only for the benefit of members. Financial transparency is a good thing. I have nothing to hide, nothing at all, and no problems with disclosure by registered organisations to their members. The bills introduced by the Gillard government will improve the way that investigations into breaches of registered organisations provisions are conducted by the general manager of Fair Work Australia. We have overseen the tripling of civil penalties where people have contravened the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, and I look forward to that further supervision continuing. important motion, which goes to a central question: what is it that the leaders of unions in Australia are doing with their members' money? Is there a reason to be concerned or should we be satisfied that everything is fine and that there is no need for further action on this front? I am sorry to say that the evidence suggests that we need to be very concerned about the governance occurring in unions around Australia. There has been, quite properly, very detailed focus on what has been happening in the Health Services Union, but the problem appears to be significantly more widespread. What is it that union leaders are doing with their members' money? The first thing they are evidently doing is paying themselves very generous salaries. Michael Williamson of the Health Services Union is reported to earn a salary of $330,000 a year. Mr Bernie Riordan was until recently the head of the Electrical Trades Union in New South Wales and, according to the Sunday Telegraph, last year he earned nearly $400,000 from a combination of his union job and directorships of three superannuation funds and businesses. Kathy Jackson has admitted to earning $270,000 in her role at the Health Services Union. This exchange occurred on 7.30 on 21 May:",293,Private Members Business
335,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (19:42,"I am very pleased to rise to speak on this extremelyrammed through the council, by Michael Williamson and his people. We objected to it. The role of union members and union officials in relation to their members in enriching themselves is seen not only in the basic salaries that union officials are earning but also in the way they have used the industrial arrangements to direct a stream of payments into superannuation funds which are associated with those unions. It appears that union officials regard those superannuation funds with which the union is associated as offering them nice little earners for positions on the boards of those superannuation funds. As I have already mentioned, both Michael Williamson and Bernie Riordan top up their union salaries with additional director's fees from the boards of the superannuation funds on which they sit and to which they were appointed by the unions of which they are officials. Let us remind ourselves what the current member for Dobell has had to say about the appointment of Kathy Jackson as a director of HESTA, one of the big industry superannuation funds. In the parliament recently he said: She sat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board. I do not know whether that precise allegation is correct, but it is an interesting insight into the mindset of one particular former union official, the current member for Dobell, who is himself a former union-appointed director of an industry superannuation fund. Alternatively, we could look at the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund, in which Mr Wally Curran, who was recently described in the Australian as 'a legendary unionist, former long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving trustee director of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund', was a major figure. The Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund invested some $30 million in a property company called Austcorp before the company collapsed losing almost all of the $30 million. These extravagant salaries and some of the other arrangements operate to put these union leaders in a very different class to the often poorly paid workers they represent. I note that Mr Kevin Morgan in a recent article in the Australian argues that this stems from the Hawke government's amalgamations of the union movement and that a new breed of careerist union officials has emerged. This is an important motion before the House. Union governance needs clear scrutiny and action. have a lot of time for the member for Wright-unlike some of his other colleagues here tonight who have ranted and raved and made allegations they would never have the guts to make outside this place. They stand in here and make all these allegations about people, but clearly the simple facts show that those opposite have absolutely no idea how unions work and how they go. The previous speaker is a prime example. He wants to make an across-the board claim about union officials living on larger-than-life salaries, but that is just painfully untrue. It is incorrect, and it is a slight on the hard working people who are out there protecting workers whose wages and conditions this lot want to savage. I note that because the first point of the member for Wright's motion reads: … serious allegations have been made surrounding the misappropriation of union members funds by union leaders …",294,Chris Uhlmann Doesn T That Seem A Little Excessive Kathy Jackson Yes It Does Chris Uhlmann For Someone Who Represents Some Poorest Workers In Australia
336,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen) (19:47,"I rise to speak against this motion even though IThey have broad-brushed this to blame every single union official and every single union leader. You want to claim in this motion that every single one of them is rorting their union funds. That is wrong-dead wrong. Mr Buchholz interjectinghave made the claim that every union is in there. The fact of the matter is that there are many unions. I am a member of the Transport Workers Union and very proud of it, and I know that those blokes do not earn anywhere near the money that is being claimed. They get out there and work hard and deliver results that are in the interests of their members on, say, freights, which this lot opposed. They do not believe that the people who drive trucks deserve a fair rate of pay for themselves and their families. Union officials right across this country are out there every day, in some cases slaving away in factories. I am thinking of officials of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, which operates in an industry where people are in low-paid work. These TCFU officials are not earning good money for being union officials, but they get out there and do the job because they care about people. They get out there and care about what happens to people and how they live, and they give them the opportunity to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. If you go through what has been said previously in this debate, you have to laugh at the member for Moncrieff, who either had had too many Red Bulls or, seriously, there are a couple of cogs missing in his gearbox. The claims that he made were just outrageous. He said everyone in the Labor Party is the result of the union movement. That is a lie, plain and simple. I have never been an official of a union. I have been in many unions and continue to support unions. This motion says that all union officials have been misappropriating funds. Let us have a look on the other side of the fence. We have the Fair Work Australia thing going on at the moment that is looking into one union-an issue with one union. At the same time that this is happening, Lend Lease, an Australian company, has been fined $54 million for overbilling its clients for a decade in America. If we used the member for Wright's terminology, then all business owners are crooks. That is the stupidity of the way this has been put. We know that all businesspeople are not. I do not think you were a crook when you were running your business, were you? It is the same thing. Mr Buchholz: It is about transparency. the Corporations Act. But, if you actually know the difference between the Corporations Act and organisations like unions and the regulation of organisations, you would know they are not the same. You cannot treat everyone exactly the same. Mr Christensen: Tell Paul Howes that. is a bloke who thinks that this government is run by the left-wing feminazis-that is the credibility of his argument. The Corporations Act and what is involved in the regulation of organisations are two different things.

But the differences in the entities are quite clear. Corporations are designed to generate wealth and protect financial interests for shareholders. Organisations like unions have rights under the Fair Work Act. And let us remember this is the Fair Work Act that your leader, Tony Abbott, put in place when he was industrial relations minister. So in its very first test it screwed up, and you want to blame us. The reality is you do not know how to make legislation, and that is the fault in it. (Time expired) sensible motion on union accountability and transparency. The motion obviously in point (a) refers to Fair Work Australia's report into the serious allegations that were levelled at the Health Services Union and in particular, it has to be said, with regard to the member for Dobell and his involvement in that union prior to what will no doubt be his short-lived parliamentary career. Fair Work actually found 181 contraventions of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009-181 times that that single union breached the act. To understand the extent of corruption in the HSU, you have to look at some of the findings about what was going on there. We have a breach where an official, whom I have already named, used a MasterCard to make cash withdrawals in circumstances where the national executive had not authorised policies or procedures in relation to credit card usage or cash withdrawals. We have the national secretary using his position to gain an advantage for himself-namely, the use of a credit card to pay for hotel accommodation the night after he had resigned from the position. Finding 39 talks about the purchase of incidental goods, chocolate and cigarettes, on the credit card-nothing to do with the running of the union. Finding 56 talks about expenditure relating to flights, accommodation and meals on an overseas holiday-a personal trip-and cash withdrawals, again on the MasterCard, while on that holiday. We go on to finding 64, where the national secretary is found to have failed in exercising their powers and discharging their duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise in relation to a whole heap of different spending on entertainment purposes. Finding 117 is of a breach of rules with the expenditure of $4,826 with regard to the establishment of the Long Jetty campaign office. We go on to finding 118, finding 124, finding 125, finding 154, finding 155 and finding 156, all relating to the misappropriation of funds on a federal election campaign-union members' money. I will talk about the three conclusions that Fair Work came to regarding the misappropriation of money on escort agencies. This went on in a union here in Australia. Afterwards when the report hit the deck, all the minister had to say in response was: The dysfunction in some parts of the Health Services Union has shown that the actions of a few individuals, if left unchecked, can jeopardise the effective functioning of a union in the best interests of its members. I have got to say that, with a statement like that, I am guessing that the real estate at 21B Baker Street will not be on the market anytime soon. But what, in terms of action, did the minister say? He said that they were going to introduce legislation to improve the accountability and transparency of unions via financial disclosure obligations, higher penalties and proactive compliance education. But what he did not say is more to the point. He was asked by journalists at the press conference if he accepted the proposition that unions should be treated similarly to executives of major companies and he did not say yes to that. Instead he said unions should not be scapegoated for the actions of the few.",296,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
340,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (19:52,"I rise to support the member for Wright's veryThis week the government is bringing in legislation that they say is going to ensure transparency and accountability. But I am told that, in fact, it imposes on union officials penalties that are one-tenth of what is imposed on company directors for exactly the same thing. One tenth. So the pain and suffering of victims of a white-collar crime when it comes to unions, that is workers, is worth only one tenth of the pain and suffering of the victims of white-collar crimes in the business sector or shareholders. This is from the so-called party of the workers. The member for Wright is spot-on with this motion. I do not often agree with Paul Howes, but he has called for union accountability and transparency to be brought into line with the Corporations Act, despite what the previous member said, and we are calling on the government right now to implement a plan that will expect the same standards of union leaders as is expected of company directors. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (19:57): I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate. Needless to say, and it has been said by many people, the circumstances surrounding the HSU are very difficult circumstances. They are very unfortunate circumstances, and they certainly are not ones that any of us in this place want to see repeated. It needs to be said that they are, however, circumstances that are isolated and that do not affect the vast majority of unionswhich go about their business of representing their members in a very steadfast and diligent way. I commend them for it. At the outset I should say that it has been noted during the course of the debate this evening that, to quote one of the opposition members, 'All those contributing to this debate are union hacks'. I am very proud to support unions, but I have to say that I was formerly a corporate lawyer and acted for corporations. I find it extraordinary that this motion seeks to blur the distinction between organisations representing workers-traditionally not-for-profit organisations acting for workers, coming from a very different background and tradition-and corporations, which have, at their heart, the sole interests of shareholders in making a profit for shareholders. So, to begin with, there is a very different set of philosophical underpinnings to the regulation of registered organisations and the regulation of corporations, and I know that very well. That said, it is important to note that there are some elements of the arrangements relating to registered organisations which have commonality with arrangements relating to corporations, and appropriately so. For instance, the general duties of officers of registered organisations and directors of corporations are similar. They must each exercise care and due diligence, act with good faith and not use their position improperly for personal advantage. I think it is the case in respect of most corporations, as it is the case in respect of most unions, that this is widely observed and rarely experienced in the breach. In relation to financial regulation, for example, there is commonality in relation to the regular reporting of financial accounts and auditors signing off on the books of those organisations, as is the case in relation to companies, in accordance with accounting standards. Similarly, the investigatory powers of regulatory bodies relating to corporations and relating to registered organisations are similar. So there are areas in which there is commonality, but it is important to bear in mind in this debate that there are very clear distinctions between the philosophical underpinnings of unions, registered organisations and corporations. With all of that said, in the short time remaining to me I should note that this government has been very clear in the response it has made to ensure that trade unions continue to be democratic, professional, accountable and member focused organisations. I know that the minister has introduced into parliament legislation specifically designed to increase the transparency and accountability of registered organisations-both trade unions and employer organisations-to their members. It includes, for instance, requiring remuneration and board fees to be appropriately disclosed to members and requiring transactions with related parties and transactions where an officer has a material personal interest to be disclosed to members. So there are a range of steps being taken by this government to scrutinise appropriately the activities and the reporting arrangements for registered bodies. These changes, and a range of other changes, would apply to all federally registered trade unions and all federally registered employer organisations. They represent very significant reforms to the regulation of employer and employee organisations. Unlike the Liberals' approach to policy-and we are yet to find out what their arrangements will be in relation to regulation applying to workers and regulation applying to employment arrangements overall-these reforms developed by the minister have been made in consultation with peak employer bodies and with the ACTU through the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council. So in the context of those reforms, and having regard to the very distinct differences between unions and corporations, as mentioned earlier, I think it is appropriate that we reflect on the arrangements which are being put in place by the minister and see this motion for what it is: an attack on workers. Debate adjourned. Renewable Energy Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to the promotion of clean energy industries in Australia in order to develop a sustainable, healthy and safe energy future for our country; (2) recognises: (a) that the expansion of Australia's wind energy industry is of critical importance in promoting Australia's energy security while decreasing pollution; (b) the importance of the wind energy industry in ensuring, in the most cost effective manner, that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will come from renewable sources by 2020; and (c) the considerable opportunities for increased employment, industry and regional development which are, and will continue to be, generated by the Australian wind and general clean energy sector; and (3) expresses its profound concern that, through the imposition of unreasonable planning restrictions on wind farm developments, State governments risk creating investment uncertainty for the wind energy sector and forfeiting the local jobs and industries that will be created as we move to a clean energy future. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (20:02): I am very pleased to speak on this motion this evening. It is a matter of some considerable interest to me as a Victorian and as someone who is very interested in the development of clean energy industries. I know certainly that for this government the promotion of clean energy industries is something that we regard as critical in order to develop a sustainable, healthy and safe energy future for our country. It is for this reason that I was very pleased to speak in favour of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill last sitting week. As part of the clean energy mix, wind farms have a very important role to play in achieving the government's target of 20 per cent renewable energy by 2020. Increased renewable energy, along with energy efficiency and putting a price on carbon are each fundamental to our clean energy future. The renewable energy target is of course designed to ensure that the equivalent of at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020. It is an important means to change our energy generation mix and to reduce greenhouse gases and emissions. Last Friday, 15 June, was Global Wind Day. It is an international event coordinated by the Global Wind Energy Council and is designed to raise awareness of the value of wind energy worldwide. On the same day here in Australia, it is important to note, the Clean Energy Council released the findings of a very significant new report undertaken by Sinclair Knight Merz, on its behalf, into the economic benefits of wind farms. The study found a great many things, and I commend it to members to read. It found, for example, that $4.25 billion has so far been invested in Australia in wind power projects and that there is a potential for a further $17.8 billion to be invested locally in wind power through a variety of proposed wind farms. Australian investment includes manufacturing of towers that support the wind turbine generators and blades; and the civil, electrical and other site works, amongst a range of other things. Importantly, the study found that the construction of a 50-megawatt wind farm would provide a gross value-add of around $50 million to a state and could contribute between 0.012 per cent and 0.21 per cent to gross state product, depending on the size of the state economy. In terms of employment the study found that the same size wind farm could generate around 238 jobs nationally through direct employment in its construction and total employment of around 795 full-time equivalent jobs directly and indirectly during the course of construction. In addition to that, the report estimates that a wind farm of the same capacity could generate 16 full-time equivalent jobs directly and 44 jobs in total as a result of its ongoing operation-that is, a single wind farm. The report estimates that the current direct employment in the industry could be as much as 2,300 full-time equivalents and total employment-that is, both direct and indirect employment-could reach around 6,900 full-time equivalents. It is an extraordinary number of people who are currently employed in the industry. As I mentioned earlier, Australia has committed to having 20 per cent of its energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. It has also committed to a carbon reduction of between five per cent and 15 per cent-or 25 per cent below 2000 levels-by 2020. The five per cent target, as we all know, is unconditional. If we are to achieve this we need wind energy in our renewable energy mix. The report I mentioned by Sinclair Knight Merz mentions the current status of wind farm investment, employment and carbon abatement. It found that the average abatement achieved by 100-megawatt wind farm developments across Australia is around 246,200 tonnes per annum. That is the equivalent of taking around 57,000 cars off our roads. No doubt, members will join with me in supporting wind farms and wind energy as a means to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and achieve the targets that we seemingly all have signed up for, even those sitting across the chamber from us. The expansion of Australia's wind energy industry is of critical importance in promoting Australia's energy security while decreasing pollution. It is in that context that I am extremely disappointed with the planning arrangements that have been put in place arbitrarily, without consultation and without regard to the future generation of wind energy in Australia by the Victorian government. The damage that can be done to the future growth of wind farms in Australia through unreasonable planning restrictions has been demonstrated by the actions of the Victorian government. Since coming to office in 2011 this government has sent a clear message to the wind farm sector, and that is that it is not welcome. They have done this by introducing excessive planning restrictions on wind farm development through the Victorian government's new planning amendment VC82. The major change of this amendment is that wind farms cannot be built within two kilometres of an existing dwelling without the written consent of the owner. That means that a single objector has been given a veto on all wind farm developments within two kilometres of their dwelling. This is referred to as the twokilometre setback. There are also five-kilometre dead zones-areas where wind farms are prohibited, even if everyone in that community supports a wind farm. It is quite extraordinary. They have also listed an extensive maze of wind farm buffers and bans which specifically exclude whole sections of the state of Victoria. When you add these restrictions together you can see that the state government is trying to strangle the wind farm renewable sector in Victoria. These are extreme and have gone much too far. They have been rightly reported to be Australia's most restrictive planning laws for wind farms. The devastating effect of this policy has been estimated by industry consultants Carbon Market Economics, who have concluded that this policy could mean that between 50 per cent to 70 per cent of proposed wind farms would not be developed in the state of Victoria. And much of that investment is in regional Victoria, so it is extraordinary to me that members of the National Party, of all parties in this place, should be supporting these sorts of measures. Global wind farm developer, Windlab, has closed down its Melbourne office, moving its operations to Canberra, blaming the restrictive new Victorian planning laws. Windlab's general manager, Mr Nathan Steggel, said that the Victorian government's planning laws had gone too far and made it 'difficult to develop projects in Victoria'. Pacific Hydro's general manager, Mr Lane Crockett, is on the record as stating, 'Unfortunately, these new wind farm laws will hold Victoria back while other states power ahead.' The ridiculous nature of these restrictions is further emphasised by the comments of the head of the world's largest wind energy company, Vestas, Mr Ditlev Engel, who is reported as saying that he has no idea where the government's new restrictions come from or what they are based on. The impact on clean energy generation from this action will be to freeze output. The Victorian government's own Department of Primary Industries forecasts that, over the term of the current Victorian government, there will not be any additional wind-generated power put into the grid. So not only is this likely to threaten jobs and future investment but also it obviously puts under pressure the renewable energy targets that Australia has set and the emissions abatement targets that it continues to set. The Victorian government has also imposed additional administrative and specialist costs on local government as part of its new approval regime for wind farms in Victoria. These are new costs for noise and engineering experts, lawyers and accountants, and no doubt they will flow on to ratepayers through their rates. I know that many regional councils have already voiced their opposition to this considerable cost-shifting and the imposition of red tape on industry and job development. We hear regularly from those opposite about the damaging effects of introducing red tape in industry development, yet extraordinarily we have people here this evening who no doubt will be supporting the Baillieu government's attempts to restrict the wind farm industry. It is really a drastic restriction on industry, and it needs to be said that it was done with minimal public scrutiny. It was done originally without legislation-just a decision by the Liberal Minister for Planning, Matthew Guy, supported by his government. I have mentioned this evening the very significant effects on industry development and jobs creation of the wind farm industry. It is extraordinary to me that, in a state which is struggling at the moment, we are not making better use of our opportunities to generate new industry, to generate clean energy industry and to support the regions, as those opposite would have us believe they do. It is extraordinary to me that we are putting in jeopardy jobs and revenue streams for farmers. There is much more that I could say on this, but for this evening I am afraid that that will suffice. I support the motion and I encourage other members to do likewise. La Trobe, for this motion gives the House an opportunity to take a reality check and to examine the effects and the costs of diverting our nation's scarce and precious resources into subsidising industrial wind farms. Firstly, far from state planning regulations being unreasonably restrictive on wind farm developments, as this motion claims, the states have so far abjectly failed to protect our rural communities, by having planning regulations and noise guidelines so lax as to be perfectly biased in favour of inappropriately sited wind farms. This motion displays a complete contempt for the rural people of Australia, many of whom are unlucky enough to be situated in areas where wind turbines could potentially be located. Back in 2005, the United Nations Environment Program, with one of those 'the science is settled' predictions, asserted that global warming would create millions of climate change refugees. By 2010, it was said, these people would be forced to flee their homes because of rising sea levels from melting ice caps. Well, 2010 has come and gone and there has not been a single person made a climate refugee because of rising sea levels. However, here in Australia we now have some of the world's first climate refugees, forced to flee their homes not by rising sea levels but by government policies subsidising industrial wind turbines. Dr Sarah Laurie has documented over 20 Australian families who have been forced to flee their homes in Victoria alone because of wind turbine noise and infrasound. Dr Laurie states: … current noise guidelines are completely inadequate to protect people's health because they do not involve measurement of infrasound and low frequency noise. TodayI received a letter from Mrs Pamela Connelly, an Australian climate change refugee forced to flee her home because of inadequate planning regulations which have allowed wind farms to be built too close to her home. I would like to read her letter: I am writing to share with you our personal experience of living for three years alongside (1.2 km away) a Pacific Hydro wind turbine and more importantly the contrast after having lived away from them for 18 months.",297,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
341,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (20:13,"I welcome this motion moved by the member forThe first time the turbines started to turn … imagine our shock of hearing a constant sort of jet engine/sonic boom whooshing sound and more annoyingly feeling a vibration sometimes in our chest bone every second or so. When the turbines were at their worse, this noise continued day and night even through closed double glazed windows. I recall sitting on the couch on one of those earlier nights and amazed that not only could I clearly hear the turbines, but also feel the wave of vibrations every second or so through my whole body. Another thing that increased very gradually was headaches, and in the last year or so I was taking Nurofen migraine tablets regularly … The headaches were sometimes so bad that unarmed with Nurofen, the migraines were completely debilitating … These headaches stopped straight away after moving away and in the past 18 months I have only taken two Nurofen tablets. Mrs Connelly continues: We asked at a meeting Pacific Hydro for written proof that it was safe for the health of us and more importantly our children but this could not be supplied. On further questioning to Pacific Hydro at a meeting at our house we were told no further testing was neededand nothing could be done. She continues: It is not until you move away from the turbines that you realise the profound effect that they had on you. You don't particularly connect the symptoms to the wind turbines because they very gradually build up over time and you put it down to co-incidence or anything as you really don't want to believe that staying where you love is making you unwell, it really only becomes clear in a short time after you leave the vicinity of the turbines how much of an effect they were having on you when the symptoms disappear. So to the member who bought this motion I say, 'Shame,' for your motion seeks to inflict the type of pain and suffering experienced by Mrs Connelly on hundreds if not thousands of rural Australians and strip away their property rights and force them out of their homes. This motion also farcically talks about considerable opportunities for increased employment in connection with the construction of wind turbines. This is a complete fallacy. Wind turbines are ludicrously inefficient. Let us not lie about the costs. The electricity they produce is 500 per cent more expensive than electricity produced by coal-fired plants. Simply because of their inefficiency, no one would invest in wind turbines unless they were guaranteed some type of government handout or special government privilege. Ms O'Neill: Seventeen billion. someone. That is something the Labor party does not understand. They are paid by families through higher electricity prices. They are paid by families, by factories, by hospitals, by schools, by offices, by churches and by retail shops. They are the people that pay the price of these policies. So what this motion actually seeks to do is to promote the interest of wind farm developers-either the union-controlled Pacific Hydro or foreign multinationals-at the expense of Australian families and businesses. The evidence from overseas is clear. While the member for La Trobe may talk about the wonderful jobs that they create, we also have to look at the jobs they destroy. The evidence, as I said, from overseas is clear: policies to subsidise wind and solar power have proven an absolute disaster in Germany, Denmark and Spain,",302,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
342,Mr Craig Kelly,"That is right. But these government handouts have to be paid bywhere it has been calculated that, for every 'green' job that is created, in the real economy it has destroyed 2.2 jobs. A recent Verso study in the UK has found these types of subsidies destroy 3.7 jobs for every green job created. It is clear-for every wind turbine constructed in our country, jobs are lost, our nation's prosperity is reduced, we become less competitive and costs of living become higher. As Henry Ergas pointed out today: NEXT year, each man, woman and child in this country will pay $450 in electricity charges for ""green schemes""… That totals, across the economy, $10 billion. For a mother raising three young kids, that is $1,800 it will cost them in the next year alone in electricity prices. We need to consider the opportunity costs of subsidising hopelessly inefficient wind turbines. We live in a world where billions go to bed hungry at night. We live in a world where millions will die this year from particulate and water pollution. We in this parliament have to try and find $8 billion a year to fund our National Disability Insurance Scheme. Noone will ever know what new products, what new processes or what medical breakthroughs will have failed to come into existence, killed before they were born, because of the diversion of our nation's precious, valuable resources into wind turbines. No-one will ever be able to compute the price that we all will pay for this public policy failure, keeping our standard of living lower than it would otherwise have been. And for what? What is this for; what is the entire point? Well, members on the other side often regurgitate that delusional phrase: 'We are taking action on climate change.' Firstly, we need to be clear how little power wind turbines actually produce. You would need 3,500 giant steel windmills to produce the equivalent output of one single, medium-sized conventional coal or gas fired power station. Secondly, even if we built these 3,500 steel windmills, we would still need a gas fired power station as a backup-for when the wind doesn't blow, the power doesn't flow. It is that simple. And of course any gas fired backup power station needs to be ramped up and down to compensate for the intermittency of the wind. A gas fired plant runs inefficiently, burning more gas and having a shorter life span than a plant which is just working normally. It is like a car battling through heavy traffic-less fuel efficiency and more wear and tear. Overseas studies have suggested that we could actually lower our emissions of carbon dioxide if we did away with wind turbines altogether and just ran gas power stations inefficiently. We have beautiful country landscapes around our nation, from Beaudesert to Boorowa, magnificent horse-riding trails and picturesque vistas. We can desecrate these landscapes by covering them with giant steel industrial wind turbines for as far as the eye can see, but it is not going to do anything to change the temperature of the globe and it not going to have any measurable effect on levels of carbon dioxide. To do so would be a recipe for retarding economic growth, increasing poverty and harming human health. That is what this motion seeks to do. By any analysis, this motion is to support a public policy disaster. (Time expired) moved by the member for La Trobe reaffirming the parliament's commitment to the promotion of clean energy industries and the importance of wind energy as a renewable energy source. I refer the member for Hughes to the Wind turbine health impact study by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, whose epidemiological studies suggest no association between wind turbine noise and psychological or other distress. As for this",303,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
343,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (20:23,"I rise to express my support for the motionquestion of needing backup sources of power, I do not know whether the member for Hughes is aware of it or not, but there is such a thing as a national electricity grid which serves to ensure that renewable energy sources are used to maximum effect. Wind power is a significant component of any effective response to climate change. Building more wind farms will help facilitate the structural change we need to become a low-carbon economy. It is with great concern, then, that I note that the Victorian Baillieu government is imposing unreasonable restrictions on wind farm development. Its changes extend considerably the areas to be excluded from wind farm development in Victoria. In effect, they create wind farm no-go zones. Wind energy facilities are to be excluded from such areas due to various concerns that they raise. Quite remarkably, proposed wind farm developments now need to obtain the written consent of any owner of a dwelling within two kilometres of any turbine. While the Baillieu government says that such amendments provide certainty, the amendments effectively create a presumption against wind farm development over a large part of Victoria. There will be negative consequences for investments in wind farm facilities. By creating many no-go zones for wind farm development in Victoria, the amendments will re-entrench existing patterns for energy transmission and generation and impact on Victoria's commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The amendments are also tarnished by the revelation that a Victorian Liberal MP, Simon Ramsay, lobbied against the wind farm if its developer, Acciona, did not meet a series of requests, including buying his family's Western District farm. He sought a string of concessions, including that the company pay him $66,000 to grow trees as a noise and visual screen, scrap all turbines within two kilometres of his home and pay for works, including the sealing of the local gravel road. Mr Ramsay represents western Victoria in the state upper house and made the demands in a letter to Acciona over its plan to erect to 63 turbines at Birregurra, near Colac. In the past, he had been a champion of wind farms and had in fact obtained permits for turbines on a parcel of land that he has since sold. His lobbying triggered allegations that he sought to use his political access for personal gain and that he may have failed to adequately notify parliament of his interest during key debates on new wind farm rules last year. A new report by the accountancy group PricewaterhouseCoopers for Acciona finds that the Waubra wind farm has boosted the economy of its region, near Ballarat, by $346 million and has created nearly 1,700 jobs for the area. The modelling by PricewaterhouseCoopers finds that investment in the Waubra farm of $226 million has increased Victorian industry output by $685 million and created over 1,800 new full-time jobs. In New South Wales, investment of over $50 million in the construction and operation of the Gunning wind farm created over 350 full-time jobs in its region, reduced regional unemployment and added over $69 million to gross domestic product for the area. Renewable energy infrastructure, construction and maintenance create more jobs per dollar invested than conventional power generation. The Baillieu government needs to rethink its new laws for wind farms, which will cost jobs and investment in regional Victoria, stunt the growth of the wind farm industry and damage the environment. It is a remarkable double standard that the Victorian government is giving landowners within two kilometres of wind farms an effective right of veto when in every other circumstances you can think of it is eroding local residents' rights to object to planning proposals. Not only do my constituents in Brunswick not have a power of veto over the planned expansion of the Brunswick electricity terminal station; the state government expressly moved in to override the decision of the Moreland City Council to reject the expansion. I challenge the Victorian government to nominate any other piece of infrastructure-power stations, coal mines, freeways, airports-where every resident within two kilometres is required to agree before the project can proceed. There is none and it is a dead giveaway of the Victorian government's unreasoning and inexplicable hostility to wind power that it should be singled out for such treatment. sustainable, healthy and safe energy future, but we must ensure we do it without putting environmental measures before people and livelihoods. Support for wind power generation has been driven by a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a diversification of energy sources. A study by University of Edinburgh economics professor Gordon Hughes for the Global Warming Policy Foundation warns that using wind turbines to cut emissions costs 10 times the price of a gas fired power station. Professor Hughes concluded that wind power is an extraordinarily expensive and inefficient way of reducing carbon emissions compared with the option of investing in efficient and flexible combined cycle gas plants. Reg Brownell, of Australian Landscape Guardians in Victoria, a body committed to achieving better outcomes for natural and cultural landscape through the planning process, has stated that electricity from wind is four times as expensive as coal. He says that the cost of carbon saved is $500 a tonne compared with $15 a tonne by switching from coal to gas. Why then are those who portray themselves as being for the environment so eager to push the wind energy agenda? Is it because these massive structures look like something is being done? Is it because they will not be erected in their own electorates? The green voters of Melbourne will not be seeing a wind turbine erected in the central city anytime soon, but they are more than happy to tell those in the country that wind turbines should be placed on their properties. I say, 'Shame on them.' The placement of wind turbines on properties has an impact not only on a specific property, but also on surrounding properties and those people who live on them. It drives those properties' values down and if those living on them wish to move it is almost impossible to sell because no-one wishes to live on a property next to a wind farm. I am sure the member for La Trobe would not want that. There are also serious concerns from people about the adverse health effects of wind turbine operation and these cases are starting to attract attention from medical professionals. A peer-reviewed study from Danish University researchers into wind turbine noise has found that newer, larger turbines are emitting lower frequency noise than older turbines. It is this low-frequency noise which has been the basis of many claims of adverse health effects for rural residents. Executive Director of the Australian Environment Foundation, Max Rheece, said this study has confirmed his anecdotal accounts of the effects of hundreds of 150-metretall wind turbines on rural communities and the health of residents. A number of Australian medical professionals including Ballarat's sleep physician, Dr Wayne Spring, and Dr Andja Mitric-Andjic, a rural general practitioner practising in Daylesford, have publicly highlighted their concerns about the health problems experienced by patients who live in the vicinity of",304,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
344,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (20:28,"It is important for Australia to establish awind turbine developments. They join Dr David Iser, the first Australian clinician to voice his concerns about wind turbines in 2004 based on a small study he conducted on patients living near the Toora wind development in South Gippsland, Victoria. There have also been concerns raised about the increased fire risk wind turbines present through an inability to extinguish wind turbine fires. This is an unwelcome burden to many rural communities whose firefighters are nearly always solely volunteers. It is important that strict planning restrictions are put in place regarding wind farms to ensure that they have a very minimal impact on people who will have to live near them, especially as studies prove that wind power is not the miracle answer to greenhouse gas emissions which it has been touted to be. I just wonder whether this government, because it is so beholden to the Greens, is pushing this agenda because it has been cobbled together by the Greens and that is what keeps them in power. The member for Hughes has highlighted how hopelessly inefficient and expensive wind turbines are and, as he said, when the wind does not blow the power does not flow. There is a better way. The National Party room heard only tonight from the Buckwaroon Catchment Landcare Group which has got a wonderful Cobar regeneration model involving property vegetation plans. They get the litter from the ground and put it into a heat furnace and convert it into energy, and that is providing better grassland and energy prospects for the mining operations that they have near Cobar. There is a better way and it is certainly not wind turbines. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (20:33): Marriage is a cultural institution of long standing, and the prospect of change is unsettling to many people. But we should remember that society is always changing, that it has undergone great change even in a nation as relatively young as ours, and that the changes we have made over the last 100 years or so in addressing discrimination on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation, though in almost every instance slow, difficult and hard-won, have been profoundly beneficial. In 1902 Australia became the first country in which women could both vote in federal elections and contest those elections as candidates. But it was not until 1962, only 50 years ago, that the Commonwealth Electoral Act extended the franchise to all Indigenous people. In the early part of the 20th century there were Commonwealth ordinances that restricted the marriage of Indigenous Australians, and in places like WA the permission of the Chief Protector was required before an Aboriginal person could marry a non-Aboriginal person. It was not until 1966 that we scrapped the rule that had forbidden the permanent employment of a married woman in the Commonwealth Public Service. It was not until the 1970s that the efforts of organisations like the Women's Electoral Lobby and the work of people like Jocelynne Scutt began to bring about legislative reform to address the common-law immunity for a man charged with the rape of his wife. Less than 50 years ago, a woman, by virtue of marriage, could not be a permanent employee of the Public Service and could be legally raped by her husband. I cannot imagine anyone looking back at those circumstances and wanting to return to them today. But nor should we imagine that reform occurred easily. Some of these changes were fiercely resisted, and all of them took a long time to achieve, even after the terrible discrimination that they represented had been identified, and even though removing that discrimination now seems a matter of plainest common sense. The restrictions on who could marry whom and the abrogation of certain rights or protections within marriage did not stand alone as discrete instances of discrimination but rather stood as manifestations of a widespread discriminatory malaise that applied to Australian women and Indigenous Australians. Within a marriage-as within society as a whole and its laws, institutions and cultureAustralian women had fewer rights and lesser standing than men, and Indigenous people had fewer rights and lesser standing than non-Indigenous Australians. Despite the progress over the past 50 or 60 years, that broad inequality has not yet been fully erased. The same is true of gay men and women today. Same-sex couples being excluded from the opportunity to choose the category of relationship that we generally regard as representing the greatest degree of love and commitment is a form of pure discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. For that reason, it is illogical, unfair, intolerant and intolerable. Just as the discriminatory aspects of marriage as it applied to women and Indigenous Australians bespoke a larger and connected set of inequities, so does marriage discrimination against same-sex couples. The journey we have made over the last 100 years, on the road to being a more tolerant, more cohesive and more egalitarian nation with each passing decade, has delivered benefits in which we have all shared. As part of that, the reforms introduced by this government in 2009 represented a huge leap in the legal and administrative recognition of same-sex couples, with all the rights, security and peace of mind that attend those changes. Those reforms built on the wider cultural shift that has occurred. While gay men and women have made their contributions to Australian life from the outset, for much of our history gay Australians, ordinary and extraordinary alike, have been personally, socially and economically constrained through intolerance and discrimination. Once upon a time it would have been unusual if not practically impossible for a new senator, like Dean Smith, or for the leader of a political party, like Bob Brown, to be openly gay. It would have been unusual for a High Court justice, like Michael Kirby, to be openly gay or for a CEO, like Alan Joyce, or for a sportsperson, like Matthew Mitcham or Ian Roberts or Natalie Cook. It would have been just as unlikely and in many ways even more difficult for a bricklayer in Donnybrook, a school teacher in Hamilton Hill or a GP in Port Hedland, let alone a year 9 student or the captain of a school footy team. Those difficulties continue to be very real, because discrimination against gay Australians is very real and often very cruel. The consequences of that discrimination, especially for young people, include bullying, severe alienation, violence and mental illness. Families and households come in all shapes and sizes and yet the most important things remain the same: the sense of belonging, love, happiness and well-being. Happiness shared is not happiness diluted. I support this bill and the change it represents because there is no reason or evidence to believe that sharing the benefits of marital commitment more widely heralds anything other than greater tolerance and stability and love in our community. 2012 and an issue I am very passionate about, marriage equality. I realise that this issue is highly contentious and affects all communities. The electorate of Wright, which I serve, is no different. I am a firm believer that, if a fellow politician wants to be brave, they should stand up before an election and use this issue as a platform in order to try and win government. I do not agree with the wider view that marriage in Australia has changed since the 2010 federal election. I wholeheartedly support the coalition in believing that the definition of marriage contained in the existing provisions of the Marriage Act of 1974 appropriately affects the common understanding of marriage in the Australian community: 'The union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' I am not persuaded that this definition should be changed. It is not a piece of legislation that can or should be considered lightly. The effect of making any changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will have many psychological and social implications, which at this point in time are not well researched and understood. I am not just talking about the welfare of children. Firstly, I must highlight to this parliament that I was brought up in a family with strong Christian values. While I am no saint, I stand by these values because they have been and continue to be a fundamental moral compass for my life. In a speech on 13 February 2012, the member for Melbourne spoke about love, stating that it has no boundaries and no limits. However, I say that love is a feeling, just the same as anger, frustration, confusion and hate. I certainly do not feel it necessary to try and convince the parliament that I should be allowed to act upon it with anyone I meet. The same Christian values that I was brought up on have helped me to understand that. Can you imagine the consequences for society if we were to legislate acts of violence, for example, due to the feelings of hate? It would be a disaster. Secondly, I made a commitment to the preselectors of Wright before the last election that I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman and that I intend to honour that commitment-a concept sometimes foreign to the people on the other side of this House. Thirdly, I question the long-term effects the amendments to the Marriage Act will have on children who will become the innocent victims should we fail to ensure that we accurately know and understand the psychological and social effects of growing up with same-sex parents. This is not an area where we should be allowing experimentation. In a speech for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010 on Friday, 4 May 2012, Professor Tom Frame highlighted that samesex marriage cements an alienation of one children from one or both biological parents. My last point is in relation to the perception that some of the arguments against the bill are discriminatory. My decision to not support this bill is not aimed to discriminate or separate those who choose to have a same-sex relationship, because I am convinced that the changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will do far greater harm to our society. The Prime Minister pointed out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. In 2008, 85 laws were changed in favour of those same-sex relationships and was supported unanimously by Labor and the coalition removing all discrimination in Commonwealth law. State law was genuinely ahead of the Commonwealth on this but relationship registers or their equivalents in Queensland,",306,Kathy Jackson I Agree With You But Let S Look At The History Of This As I Said Previously This Was
345,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (20:38,"I rise to speak about the Marriage Amendment BillNew South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT ensure that there is no discrimination at state or territory level. I also bring to the attention of parliament the speech of 13 February. The member for Melbourne made an inaccurate statement when he said that a change in the Marriage Act will make it clear to those same-sex relationships that the parliament believes that their love is equal. The parliament has never, to my knowledge, stopped everyone from falling in love. However, marriage is not an automatic action just because I or someone else had fallen in love. If that was the case, I am sure that the majority of society would be married several times over to many people, and think what would happen to those people who love their pets. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said that in Australia functional equality has already been achieved. He said: I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in terms of rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown. In conclusion I say that, on issues as significant as this, we want to take it to a federal election. Let the people have their turn. I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Health) (20:43): I speak in support of the member for Throsby's motion because the time for marriage equality in Australia has come. This is a recognition of the basic equality of all Australians, regardless of sexuality or sexual identity. All Australians should have the right to legal recognition of their relationships and the advantages and responsibilities that such legal recognition brings with it. All Australians deserve the full social acceptance that removing discrimination symbolises. I am proud of the reforms that this Labor government has made in removing those 85 pieces of discriminatory legislation, removing every piece of discriminatory Commonwealth legislation bar one. It is time to remove this last piece of discriminatory legislation. Some have said that this change is a threat to marriage, but I believe that the opposite is true. This change reinforces that marriage is a legal and social bond that many Australians aspire to in order to demonstrate their commitment to their partner. Even for those gay men and lesbians who do not want to get married, the message that this change sends is a powerful one. The message is: you are equal before Australian law and you are equal in the Australian community. No young man or young woman should feel that their same-sex attraction marks them out as a second-class citizen. It is also about time that someone said marriage is about more than sex. This debate has focused so much on the agenda of the couple and, by implication, on the sex act itself that I think we have lost the real meaning of marriage. Marriage is about a lot more than the sex act or the gender of the couple. It is about bringing two families together and creating a third family. It is about stability, commitment, mutual love and support. It is about friendship and companionship. For many people, of course, it is a religious sacrament; for others it is a secular, social and legal commitment to their partner; and for others it is the ultimate romantic gesture. The member for Wright spoke about the innocent victims of same-sex marriage being the children of such relationships. I find it disturbing that there are so very many children who are already the children of same-sex relationships. When they hear things like, 'They are the victims of their parents' relationship,' what do they think? Those children should not be brought up thinking that the loving, committed relationships of their parents are worth less than the loving, committed relationships of their friends' parents. If marriage were just about sex and procreation, we would not let people who cannot or will not have children marry. But, of course, we welcome and celebrate marriage for all of the reasons I have described. I understand that many, though not all, church leaders are concerned about this change. This bill makes it clear that churches will not be forced to solemnise samesex relationships. I have been overwhelmed with support from my constituents for this change-not just my gay and lesbian constituents but many, many straight constituents who are opposed to discrimination. Of course I have heard from opponents as well. But, when I ask myself whether I should be on the side of change or on the side of discrimination, there is only one answer that I can reasonably give: I have to be on the side of change and equality. I hope that in years to come, when all Australians are able to formally recognise their love without discrimination, we will look back on this debate with the same wonder we now feel that there was ever a time when couples of mixed race were prevented from marrying or when couples of mixed religion were discouraged by their families from marrying. As I have said before, it is not good enough to say to one group in our community: 'You're almost equal; you should be content with that.' We do not say to women: 'You're almost equal; you should give up the fight for equal pay.' We do not say to people living with a disability: 'You're almost equal; you should stop campaigning for greater access and support.' And we should never say to gay and lesbian Australians: 'You're almost equal; that is good enough.' Almost equal is not good enough. and to inform the House that the coalition will not be voting for the bill. The coalition will honour the policy it took to the 2010 election to maintain the Marriage Act as relating to marriage between a male and a female. We took that to the election and people voted for us on the basis of that platform. We will honour that commitment and we will vote on policy, en bloc, as one, as a coalition against this and a similar bill that I spoke on this morning introduced by the Greens deputy leader, the member for Melbourne. CanI just get rid of some shibboleths that exist out there, the first being that this is an issue of discrimination-that we need to remove the discrimination that exists within the Marriage Act. Having been here in 2008 and having voted for the legislation that removed 85 pieces of discrimination from 85 bits of legislation, I can say with some authority that there is zero discrimination right now in the law with respect to same-sex couples. The Prime Minister pointed this out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, when she made this same point. Family law expert, Professor Patrick Parkinson, in his submission to the Senate inquiry, said: 'In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved. I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions.' The so-called marriage equality campaign that some people have entered into and engaged",309,Bills
346,Mr Robert (Fadden) (20:48,"I rise to speak against the current bill before the Housewith with the best of intentions, to their credit, unfortunately has been deceptively hijacked by an aggressive Left-Greens agenda. The other way that this is unfortunately being hijacked is that it is now being aggressively pushed as an anti-freedom of speech issue. The campaign has depended on first driving alternative voices out of the debate by public demonisation and then filling it with a range of disinformation. The terms 'extremist', 'hater', 'bigot' and 'propagators of hate' are some of the labels used in the media recently against the Australian Christian Lobby and against other supporters of marriage. How is it that the debate has degenerated to such standards of speech? Victoria's deputy chief psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he participated in a submission to the Senate's inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by numerous gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne tennis centre because of her disagreement over same-sex marriage. The ACL submission to the Senate inquiry documents numerous other cases around the world of freedom of speech on this debate being infringed. In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in law as the same as marriage has been given this situation has only worsened. Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure that the church will not be forced to provide marriage equality to samesex couples. Yet, Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. The rights of parents to determine what their children are taught in the area of sexuality has been dramatically curtailed in places like Massachusetts in the United States, where gay marriage has been legislated because it must be presented as equal once given the same status as marriage. Parents have been fined by the state for objecting to socialising even their preschoolers. This is almost certain to follow such legislation here in this country when the Australian Education Union already has in its 2006 policy on gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people on page 3 that it is determined to teach that heterosexism is discriminatory. With those sorts of radical forces at play in our community, this is not a debate about whether loving couples can marry. This has nothing to do with that. There are many genuine people who are seeking that debate but this debate has been radicalised. This is about reshaping the national conscience and the law in the image of some people who want to see a radical agenda in place. The coalition will have no bar of it. We went to an election promising that marriage will be between a male and a female. We actually honour and hold our election policies. We do not change them on a whim and we will not change this one. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (20:53): This is the fourth occasion on which I find myself speaking on same-sex marriage. I spoke in favour of same-sex marriage in this place on 13 February of this year, the day before Valentine's Day; on 24 August last year I reported back to parliament on the views of my constituents; and on 30 July last year I spoke to the ALP ACT national conference on the issue. SoI wanted to use the opportunity today to read into Hansard some of the stories of my constituents which I have received over recent months. Daniel Edmonds wrote to me: When I was young, I asked my grandmother what her view would be on having a gay grandchild. Her response was steadfast: ""I could not support it,"" she said. ""It would be against God, and against everything I believe in."" Years later, I came out to my family before leaving home to move to university (an economics degree!). My grandmother was unsteady in the knowledge that she now had a gay grandchild, something that was seen as uncommon in North Queensland at the time. It was years before she was able to bring it up in conversation with me. However, when she finally did, it really moved me. ""I want you to know that I will always support you, and love you, no matter who you love."" Ever since, she has met my partners, opened her arms to them as part of the family, and consoled me when those relationships didn't last. I am very lucky to still have my grandmother, but I only regret that in all likelihood my grandmother will not be able to attend my wedding day. I appreciate you fighting for the right of future grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters to be able to attend the wedding days of their beloved family members. Ian Brown wrote to me: My partner, Roger, and I have been together for (gulp) 40 years and were 'civilly united' in 2006 under UK law, as he holds a UK passport. We had our ceremony in the British consulate in Sydney-they said we could have a maximum of six guests so naturally we invited 30! It was one of the most exciting days of my life and I will always remember my late mother's tears of joy on our finally being 'married' after a 34 year 'engagement'! Another constituent, Bill, from Ainslie, wrote to tell me of his experience watching an interview with Bishop Pat Power on 7.30 last Friday. In that interview Bishop Power said: ... where two people have that definite commitment to each other and if they make the decision before God well I would say that their blessed in that life that they're living and they do that with honour and respect for one another ... I would want those people to feel at home within the life of the church. Bill had written to me previously to say that he did not support same-sex marriage. He wrote to me after seeing that interview and said: Good Morning Andrew, For what it's worth and just to let you know, after hearing Bishop Power speak and having met and spoken to several Gay people myself I have now changed my mind and support Gay marriage. I felt that you treated my position then with respect and I appreciated that. I'm sure there are many others in the community who are wrestling with this issue and who will, with time and reflection, come to see the justice of the homosexual case. There are many people of faith who have taken the view that we should support same-sex marriage. Writing in the National Times, the Reverend Harry Herbert, the Executive Director of UnitingCare NSW/ACT, refers to the fact that in the latter part of the 19th century there was a campaign to remove from marriage acts the restriction that a man could not marry a sister of his deceased wife. When it was proposed by colonial governments in Australia to remove the restriction, churches led the charge against it. Reverend Herbert quotes the Reverend Adam Cairns, who at the time described the proposed change as a 'deliberate treachery to the cause of truth' and said, 'By the unchangeable word of God such marriage is incestuous.' Reverend Herbert points out that this seems to be a selective reading of the Bible because the Book of Deuteronomy in fact enjoins a man to marry his deceased wife's sister. But the broader point that the Reverend Herbert makes is that churches should not impose on nonbelievers a vision based on faith. In his I have a dream speech, Reverend Martin Luther King spoke of the promissory note that African-Americans were bringing to be cashed. In that speech he said that America had defaulted on her promissory note as far as her citizens of colour were concerned but that they did not believe that the 'bank of justice is bankrupt'. The same principles bring gay and lesbian Australians to this House to call for us to support same-sex marriage laws. I do so with a respect for those who disagree but with a passionate belief in the justice of this cause. Debate adjourned. Debate resumed. That grievances be noted. South Australia: Electricity Grid in South Australia with the recent announcement of an 18 per cent increase and the effect that government policies in the renewable energy area are having on our electricity grid. Retail electricity rates are set to rise by 18 per cent. The Energy Users Association of Australia has said that after 1 July-that is, carbon tax day-the retail price of South Australian electricity is set to become the dearest in the world, with an average retail price in excess of 31c a kilowatt hour. South Australia is home to more than 50 per cent of Australia's installed wind generation capacity, more than 1,200 megawatts. The photovoltaic rooftop solar subsidies and state based feed-in tariffs have been spectacularly successful in South Australia, with one in seven houses having PV cells installed and an installed capacity of 120 megawatts in total. That is, six in seven households that do not have rooftop solar are in effect subsidising these systems through feed-in tariffs. The theoretical total generation available to the grid, including the interconnectors, is about 3,400 megawatts. Historically, the Playford power station of 240 megawatts and the Northern power station of 540 megawatts-these are brown coal power stations, I might add-operated by Alinta Energy at Port Augusta have provided around 40 per cent of the state's electricity. In recent years this has been supplemented by two interconnectors to Victoria-Murraylink, 220 megawatts, and Heywood, 460 megawatts. On average, the Alinta power stations still produce more than 30 per cent of the state's demand. On1 July both power stations will be taken off line by Alinta. South Australia's electricity demand fluctuates from less than 1,000 megawatts to about 3,500 megawatts. Prices fluctuate from minus $500 up to $12,000 a megawatt hour. Normally, this electricity retails at around $250 to $300 a megawatt hour. The Essential Services Commission informs us that 194,000 South Australian householders are seeking assistance with their power bills. A further issue-it is a side issue but I must bring it up, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott; I know you will understand about this community-is that the Coober Pedy Council, which operates an off-grid generator, is being forced to raise electricity prices for commercial customers by more than 30 per cent from 1 July. Those are the facts. I believe that the South Australian electricity grid is, at best, in an uncertain state and its problems are almost all caused by a mishmash of government policy overlapping and double-dipping on the back of the push to reduce our CO2 emissions. The RECs, the solar PV subsidies, the solar PV feed-in tariffs and now the off-budget Clean",311,Bills
347,The Deputy Speaker (Ms O'neill,The question is:,314,Grievance Debate
348,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (20:58,"I rise tonight to speak about the escalating electricity pricesEnergy Finance Corporation and the carbon tax are effectively a double triple whammy on the industry. If Labor should win the next election-I certainly hope they do not-and keep the carbon tax in place they should wind back the other expensive renewable schemes and provide a far simpler signal to the marketplace. Let us just for a start have a look at Alinta Energy's coal fired power stations at Port Augusta. Since 1954, 58 years ago, first PlayfordA then PlayfordB and later the Northern power station have provided a substantial part of the state's electricity. As at the end of this month that will cease. Playford will be permanently closed, so 248 megawatts off the system, and the Northern power station will be operated for only six months of the year-the winter months-so 540 megawatts off this system. Many will cheer this in Australia as evidence that we are moving away from fossil fuels. However, the questions are: what kind of future do we move to, is it sustainable and what is the price? The closures are being forced on Alinta by the depressed prices brought about by the very high levels of wind generation in South Australia. I have spoken about the wind generation in this place before, but I want to go back over some of the facts. More than 50 per cent of Australia's installed capacity in wind generation is in South Australia. Even more importantly, about 35 per cent of the state's installed capacity on the electricity grid is wind. For those who do not fully understand 'installed capacity', before we had such things as renewable energy and intermittent power supplies we just talked about the capacity of a power station. Now we talk about installed capacity because it may or may not be available, depending on the weather conditions. With a solar cell, for instance, it is not available at night but it is available during the day, and then it depends on the intensity of the sunlight. So it is with the wind-it may blow, it may not. With more than 1,200 megawatts of installed capacity being provided by wind, that means that it is capable of providing more than 100 per cent of the demand on a windy day in winter. So when we have low demand it can provide over 100 per cent of the demand-and as little as two per cent on a still day in the middle of summer. So the grid has become unpredictable and difficult to market and to operate in for baseload generators, who are by their very nature incapable of load chasing. There are plans in South Australia to build another 1,000 megawatts of wind energy. Renewable energy always sells first on the grid, because of the RECs, which add around $38 or $39 a megawatt hour or 38c or 39c a kilowatt hour in returns to the generator, on top of what they can sell their electricity for. Of course, the industry is being forced by the regulations and the laws of this parliament to move towards a 20 per cent renewable target. SoI am seeking more information at the moment from the Australian electricity market authority as to the sustainability of the grid and what the 760 megawatts coming offline at Port Augusta as of 1 July is likely to mean to the operation and supply of electricity in South Australia. Even more important than the price is the question: when workers get home after a hard day, at whatever the coalface might be for that particular person, and flick the switch will the light come on? Or will that industry be rationed because the grid is not able to supply the power? So the real question is: to what extent is the concentration of renewable energy in South Australia leading to what will be, according to the Energy Users Association of Australia, the world's highest price for retail electricity by 1 July. It is difficult to see that South Australians are not making a larger contribution to reaching the MRET targets than the rest of the nation. Even further, what are the risks of brownouts in the middle of winter if we get a cold, frosty string of days? One of the things not everybody understands is that the other baseload generator in South Australia is gas fired. Gas power stations do not have big containers of storage; they use their pipelines. So, if we get a cold snap of weather, the pipelines actually depressurise over a period of days, because that is the holding tank. The generators crank up the power station at Torrens Island, people come home and turn on their gas fired heating and will run down that supply. Should the weather continue, that is where we are likely to face shortages. And AEMO, the Australian Electricity Market Operator, have the ability to command Alinta to turn the generators back on. That sounds all right, except it takes two weeks to fire them up. I have read the legislation closely, and I have talked to the industry, and there is absolutely no understanding in the industry as to who would pay Alinta to restart these generators. Mr Perrett: That is why we have peakers. Mr Perrett: No, peakersinterjecting. The member for Grey has the call. did raise the issue before and I will seek some more time in the House to speak on Coober Pedy-with a 30 per cent increase in electricity, it is appalling. South Australia is the only state in the nation that does not provide subsidies to remote communities to have electricity at grid prices. The South Australian government have withdrawn support and yet the support they do give to the Coober Pedy council is contingent on them supplying household power within 10 per cent of the grid. So it is being passed on. National Security terror organisations since 2003. Hamas has been listed and re-listed by parliament as such an organisation on several occasions. Founded in 1987, the purpose of Hamas and its Ezzedine brigades as enshrined in Hamas's charter is to create an Islamic state in all of geographic Palestine. At the recommendations of the relevant Australian government committees, it has been considered a threat to Australian interests and a potential risk to Australian businesspeople, tourists and government officials. Let us be clear: the threat that Hamas poses to Australia is clear and present. That is why I was surprised by a report on the ABC on 12 December 2011 which concerned the guilty plea in an Israeli court by an Australian citizen, Eyad Rashid Abuarga, on the charge of espionage on behalf of that organisation, Hamas. Mr Abuarga was sentenced to 30 months jail along with an 18-month suspended sentence for providing services to an illegal organisation. He was detained on 24 March 2011 at Ben Gurion Airport, attempting to enter the country on his Australian passport. According to the indictment, Abuarga provided what the intelligence services call 'scoping' for the Hamas organisation of various industries and places there. The indictment said that this Australian citizen had worked for Hamas for four years and stressed, 'The seriousness of his being recruited to help the terrorist activities of Hamas,' for which he was ultimately convicted and jailed.

352,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (21:09,"Australia's parliament has listed 17 groups asEast correspondent, Michael Vincent, Abuarga was introduced with the following words, 'Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organisation'. Naturally, I wrote to the ABC on 19 December objecting to this sin of omission. My objection was, and is, straightforward and self-evident: ABC TV viewers' prospective concerns were minimised by saying that it was only Israel that considered Hamas to be a terrorist organisation. Absent was context: any reference pointing back to Australia's position, which in fact accords with that of Israel, and specifically designates the Ezzedine Brigades of Hamas as a terrorist group. The clear inference of the story's introduction was that only another country regarded Hamas as a terrorist organisation, materially different to the Australian government, the US government and the Canadian government which also regard Hamas as a terrorist organisation. The ABC's distorted frame of reference was the prism the viewer was conditioned with when the report was broadcast. Following the ABC's procedure for complaining about relevant programs, I wrote to the Victorian news editor, Shane Castleman. His response, which was dismissive and full of obfuscations, failed to address the matters I raised. Castleman seemed to imply that the Abuarga case is being heard in Israel and therefore it is Israel's view of Hamas that is fundamental to the man's predicament. The conclusion from Mr Castleman's response is that it is the designation of Hamas as a terrorist organisation by Australia that is irrelevant. This is completely untrue of course, and is sadly the conclusion that reasonable viewers would take from this material omission. Without this context, and absent the common knowledge of the average viewer, there is no context with which to characterise the activities of Hamas in our society. The ABC creates a clear insinuation that an Australian citizen is subject to a domestic Israeli law that may not constitute a crime in our country, or perhaps has domestic political significance in Israel is prejudicial to the rights of Australians under the norms of Australian law. This could not be further from the truth. My objection to this tepid ABC response elicited a further answer from another ABC executive, Mark Maley, which failed to advance the matter. He merely reiterated, 'As the Australian government was not involved and made no representations to the court or to the Israeli government it was not necessary to report its views on Hamas or on any other matter.' This is plainly ludicrous. The story was reported in Australia for an Australian audience. It was not a generic international news story. It was made by an Australian news organisation and reported by that organisation's resident correspondent. The fact that the Australian government was not involved or did not make representations is not in dispute, but it does not excuse the negligence or insouciance of the ABC towards the most serious issue of safety of Australians. It is disappointing that after sending a copy of my letter to the managing director of the ABC, Mr Mark Scott, I have had to resend it as his office has still not responded six months later. Surely with the arrest and jailing of an Australian man for assisting a terrorist organisation it is fair to report that under Australian law Hamas is a terrorist organisation? Once his sentence has been served in Israel, Mr Abuarga may well return to Australia. Do Mr Scott, Mr Castleman, Mr Vincent and Mr Mark Maley really believe that Australians do not know that a crime committed there is also a crime committed here, and that a person who has committed such a crime might in some way be of interest to Australian citizens? Of course that person is, and the fact of his affiliations must be of interest to Australian citizens too. The ABC's response to date has been without substance and reflexively defensive. It is reflective of a self-serving and impenetrable complaints apparatus that protects the ABC from reasoned feedback. The process is arbitrary and subjective and raises significant concerns as to the means of any member of the public. If I, as a member of parliament, cannot navigate this bureaucratic stronghold, what hope does a member of the public have to handle this euphemistically and laughably labelled 'complaints procedure'? Unfortunately, we have seen this trend in the ABC also in a recent interview on Four Corners. For some reason, Mr Kerry O'Brien of the ABC's flagship current affairs program, Four Corners, chose journalist Robert Fisk-who is a correspondence for the UK newspaper the Independent-as his guest after a serious BBC program on Syria. Fisk is not an academic expert on Syria. The subject matter of the O'Brien interview was indeed Syria, but it was O'Brien's generous-indeed, obsequious-introduction of Mr Fisk as a journalist who covered the Middle East with distinction that drew my attention. As members will no doubt know, and as Mr O'Brien presumably knows, Mr Fisk's journalistic excesses have become a byword in misreporting, to the extent that a verb has been associated with the line-by-line analysis of misreporting that has entered into the lexicon of journalism-namely, the verb 'fisking'. This was explained in 2005 by the UK Observer as: The practice of savaging an argument and scattering the tattered remnants to the four corners of the internet (named after Robert Fisk of the Independent). Mr O'Brien is entitled to interview anyone he chooses and to be as ignorant as he likes about the Middle East. However, given that Mr Fisk was interviewed alone to provide an overview of a terrible conflict where over 10,000 people have been killed without contrary views being offered, it would have been better journalistic practice to choose a less polarising commentator. Fisk's failure of objectivity was borne out in the body of the interview, but it was Mr O'Brien's failure to ask him any serious questions about this that drew my attention again. Fisk took issue with O'Brien's calculation of the human cost of the conflict in Syria. This did not elicit from Mr O'Brien any request for clarification of attribution, nor any challenge of Fisk's blatant attempt to diminish the nature of the crisis in that benighted country. O'Brien allowed Fisk once again, as he would so predictably do with anyone who knows his record, to attack without foundation his bete noire, the state of Israel. Deplorably, O'Brien did not raise a murmur when Fisk insisted that Israel along with its existential enemy, Iran, seeks to support the Assad regime and benefits from the massacre of Syrian citizens. The outcry against Assad has been vociferous at all levels of the Israeli government, including in unequivocal statements from its Prime Minister, its foreign minister and its President, Shimon Peres-right across the political spectrum, at all levels of think tank. Peres said on radio last week: The killings are growing more and more every day and it's scandalous. Joining President Peres was Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, Shaul Mofaz, who called for international military intervention against Assad on 14 June. They have been very clear to make their attitudes towards the Syrian government known. With regard to Fisk's ridiculous assertion of a shared agenda between Israel and Iran, Dan Meridor, the very famous lawyer there, stated that the fall of Syria's President, Bashar alAssad, would end the axis with Iran and its President Ahmadinejad. The same point was made by Efraim Halevy, the former head of Israel's secret service and, again, a man who has been very critical of the Israeli government. We see the spectrum of criticism of Syria right across the political spectrum. The ABC's attitude to complaints about having one-sided commentators on the Middle East shames the organisation and really needs to be addressed by the editor-in-chief, Mr Mark Scott. World Elder Abuse Awareness Day the city heart of Townville to watch the Respect for Seniors March for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The1 RAR band led the way and was followed by a march of an army of the city's seniors, proudly marching behind the banners. They started at Flinders Street outside the Cowboys Leagues Club and marched down to Stanley Street, up to Walker Street and into the council forecourt. They were met there by Townsville mayor Jenny Hill, state MPs John Hathaway and Sam Cox and a healthy band of well wishers. They wore red shirts emblazoned with 'Seniors Creating Change'. For your benefit, Deputy Speaker Scott, I will show you a photograph of some of them. Mayor Jenny Hill spoke to the group and proclaimed 15 June as Townsville Elder Abuse Awareness Day and asked for everyone's commitment to build safer communities for our seniors. Jenny spoke on behalf of the city when she said, and I quote: We are concerned about older residents who suffer from or are at risk of neglect, or who are the victims of financial, psychological, social, physical or sexual abuse. Jenny summed up the mood pretty well when she stated: Townsville's seniors are valued members of our society and are often the quiet achievers of our community. They take time out to volunteer in many organisations as well as caring for a new generation. It is our collective responsibility as a community to ensure that they live safely and with dignity. Anna Cody, the senior legal and support services officer at the Townsville community legal service, TCLS, spoke and what she said was spine chilling. She said that they know that 27,000 seniors in Queensland will experience elder abuse each year and that a majority of this abuse will include financial abuse. Based on the statistics they have collected, they know that seniors in Townsville who have sought help from them in the last five years have lost an estimated $15 million as a result of financial abuse. The sad part was that Anna noted that they knew that this financial abuse did not occur in a vacuum and almost always they will also experience psychological or physical abuse-and even homelessness. The 'Red Shirt Brigade', my friends, then struck up a song-and for the benefit of Hansard and most people here, I will not sing it. The tune was When the Saints Go Marching In and the key lines were as follows: that the seniors could create change themselves; that seniors deserve respect; that we as a community and political leaders have to listen to our seniors and actually care about them; that all they want is to live with dignity and not just be part of the economy; that they want to be safe in their own homes; that they want to walk safely in the evening; and that those who have fallen on hard times are treated right and fair; that they want to live sustainably and not be belted by big business and cruel taxes. They also sang Glenn Campbell's Try a Little Kindness, and if there is any time left I will burst into that. I spoke with a couple of the guys from the TCLS. They are feeling the pinch with reduced funding. They are a great service for our city and they understand the needs of their client base. Being a legal service, they are acutely aware of time. My solicitor charges me by the",316,Grievance Debate
353,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (21:19,"On Friday, 15 June, I was lucky enough to be inhour in six-minute lots and parts thereof. The issue when dealing with seniors is that there has to be a duty of care in meeting their needs. It cannot be done hard and fast. There are background issues which need to be sorted out first before they can discuss their main concern. There has to be a more pastoral role played by the people at TCLS to find out the real needs and deal with them. That costs time and they are time poor. But they do it because it matters. I want to take this opportunity to give my full support to the TCLS and all its ancillary services. They will lose a staff member on 1 July when the funding for their financial adviser is withdrawn. This person dealt with the serious debt issues and harsh consequences facing many people in Townsville now. I know that I have the support of the Shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, on this matter. Senator Brandis has made representations previously without success for the support of the TCLS. Where to from here? Anna Cody referenced the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children from 2010-2022, the Respect for Seniors Campaign launched in 2009 in New South Wales and Queensland's own 'Act as one against elder abuse' campaign for most of her points. Point1 was advocacy. Everyone everywhere can advocate on behalf of seniors by recognising their human rights, which include their right to respect, dignity, equality, support and in particular make their own decisions. Point2 was social isolation. This issue increases the risk of elder abuse. Factors such as the lack of access to public transport, being culturally and linguistically different, ageism, discrimination and racism all contribute to social isolation. Programs such as Men's Sheds, older women's networks and the Seniors Creating Change group are all important, for they provide social participation, communication, information and stronger community support. Point3 was screening. This assists with the detection of elder abuse. Screening relies on community members recognising the signs, symptoms, behaviours and attitudes of those who may be at risk so that that action can be taken. Point 4: active service and wellness approach. As I explained, in Australia there was a slow shift away from the traditional dependency type model of care for seniors, towards the provision of the active service model of care, which is centred on the individual. That means that the aged-care providers can assist seniors to remain in their homes and community, resulting in better quality of life, rather than moving into aged care where the majority of the decisions are made for them. What seniors are most concerned about is a loss of independence, social isolation and their transition to aged care and as a society we must address these issues. The member for Mackellar, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, speaks of ageism as being as vile as racism and sexism. It is something that, until you are faced with it, you do not know it exists. But as soon as you are shown what actually happens, what it actually looks like, smells like and feels like, you become acutely aware of its consequences. That someone would abuse an elder, and most probably a family member, for money is abhorrent to all of sound mind. That it is so prevalent is mind-boggling. That it can happen in any family is a huge concern to me. My mum and dad still live in Brisbane in the family home. They are both in great shape. I am one of three boys in our family and we are still very scared of incurring my mother's wrath. I would never imagine being the person who abused her to get money. I could never imagine being the person who would physically and psychologically abuse my mum and dad in any way. That this is a modern phenomenon should not surprise. The known demographer Bernard Salt spoke at a conference I attended. He said that the pension used to kick in, as it always kicked in, at 65 but the life expectancy of the Australian male was 62. So you were actually dead for three years before you even got the pension. He asked us to look at photos of our grandparents when they were 50. They were already old people. We now see more and more people turning 100 and celebrating diamond wedding anniversaries. We see our parents trying to cope with being in the new territory of self-funded retirees and the problems that brings with interest rates and inflation and new taxes. We see them trying to make their money last and have a quality of life for which they worked and richly deserve. It is not enough for any of us in this place or in our community to accept that there is elder abuse happening under our noses. In Queensland alone it is estimated that seniors lose over $100 million each and every year. The problem for our seniors is that legal remedies are often too expensive, stressful and time consuming and, when you couple that with not seeing the grandchildren ever again if they do speak, then you have that perfect storm. Seniors sometimes say something like, 'You feel like people are pushing you. They think because you are old that they have to make the decisions for you as they know what is right for you.' Or 'People just don't listen to you; young people simply do not respect older people.' Or 'Young people think they can bully older people and discriminate against them.' Sometimes I hear someone say, 'I'm too scared to go out after dark. I'm scared inside my own home. I'm too scared to even go for a walk.' For them to say these things is just wrong. I call on all of us in this place to do our bit and stop elder abuse. I call on every Australian to do the right thing by their elders and simply treat them with the respect they deserve. We as a community need to have this conversation. It is not just about seniors; it is about engaging everyone-families, mums, dads, kids, school students, principals, everyone in the community-to raise awareness of this serious issue and having the discussion about how we as a community can ensure that elder abuse does not continue. We must stamp it out now. We are a great country and my city of Townsville is a great city. We are an aspirational society. AllI ask it that we as Australians, as Townsvillians and Queenslanders, act like it. Holt Electorate: Youth represent the youth in my electorate of Holt and how much I value their contribution to our community, particularly in the city of Casey. The city of Casey has a large number of young people. The 2006 census had the total number of young people, aged between 10 and 25, at 59,953. I am sure that, given it is six years since the census was taken, that it is now many more than that. This is a significant cohort of young people. They are the future of our community and the future of our country. Their opinions actually matter. What has concerned me for some time in my electorate and the surrounding region is the way in which our young people have been categorised and the pressures they are under. For example, when a young man in my electorate threw a party some years ago, that was front and centre in the national media, but when it comes to the many constructive things that young people do, and the contribution they make, we very rarely read about it. What sort of message does that send to our young people? Basically, it says that if you do not do anything bad you do not get reported, but if you do, you will.",319,Grievance Debate
354,Mr Byrne (Holt) (21:29,"I rise tonight to state as a starting point how proud I am toI have been fortunate over the past couple of months to engage with young people in our community, to talk about the challenges they face in their lives and how they are confronting them. It is easy, as I have said in the past, to overlook our youth, but they are the future of the community and the challenges they face need to be paid attention to. During the regular meetings with our young community leaders we discussed a number of challenging issues confronting young people at present, ranging from school bullying to the immense pressure that is being placed upon young people who are required to define who they are at as young as 16 or 17. However, one issue that came out loud and clear, and which deeply disturbs me, is the increased rate of young people taking their lives in our local community. I am hearing, unfortunately, story after story of young people who know about young people who have taken their lives. Too many people have been touched by colleagues and friends committing suicide at a young age. What is this saying? In fact, I was contacted by a young student leader a couple of days ago about another suicide that happened. So what is happening in our community? We know that youth suicide is an incredibly important issue, and that governments pay attention to it, but young people are dying-they are dying in my area-and that is just not good enough. We have to do something about this. We have to do something to reduce the terrible toll this is taking on our young people in our community. We have known for a long time that mental health issues have gone under the radar, but these issues need to be discussed. Experts advise that six or seven Australians die by suicide every day. For each person lost by suicide approximately 30 others have made a suicide attempt. In Australia, the rates of suicide and self-harm remain unacceptably high in the community, with the number of deaths at least 40 per cent greater than the number attributed to national road fatalities. According to Professor Patrick McGorry, the issue of youth suicide needs to be taken as seriously as the road toll as it is the biggest killer of young people under 35 years of age. After speaking recently with Drew Gormley from Spirit WorksI was incredibly disturbed to hear that one particular school in the area that I represent had about 11 suicides of past students in the past 18 months. According to Drew Gormley there is something serious that has happened; this goes outside of the norm; it is something that we need to pay attention to. Interestingly, according to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing's July 2011 report Before it is too late, the groups of young people who may be at risk of suicide include in no particular order: victims of bullying, including cyberbullying, harassment and discrimination; gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals; those who are socially isolated or homeless; individuals with mental illness, especially depression and anxiety; those in the juvenile justice system, those using drugs and alcohol; individuals who engage in self-harm who have previously attempted suicide; and individuals who have experienced trauma, particularly where there is unresolved, grief, loss and family breakdown. One of the leading documents looking into the issue of youth suicide is the Suicide Prevention Australia submission to the Senate inquiry into suicide in Australia in November 2009. According to the Suicide Prevention Australia submission, suicide remains a complex phenomenon for which there is no single cause and no one solution: Deaths of this kind bear profound individual, familial, social and economic costs – not all of which can be effectively measured. The submission goes on to note: Beyond the toll to a person’s mental and physical health and well-being, experiences with suicide can result in financial stress as a result of loss of employment, an inability to return to work, or the financial imperative to do so before an individual is ready. Estrangement from social networks, relationship breakdown, impediments to educational progress and study, family conflict … and changes to religious or spiritual beliefs … also feature strongly. The submission also found that: For every suicide, it is conservatively estimated that, on average, another six people will be severely affected by intense grief. The submission goes on to note that significant and far-reaching loss by those left behind, particularly family, friends and colleagues, is therefore immeasurable. The vicarious trauma and impact of suicide ... on first responders ... clinicians, general practitioners and other health professionals (including coronial staff), and also volunteers, work colleagues and whole communities, should not be underestimated. Whilst the pain associated with each suicide and suicide attempt may be private, both remain major public concerns. Finding ways in which to reduce suicide rates and the incidence of suicidal behaviours is therefore everybody's business. According to the submission, one of the key preventative measures that is needed is to create a national suicide awareness campaign that takes its lead from previously successful community health campaigns, such as tobacco, HIV-AIDS and road trauma to strongly promote messages of hope, help seeking, resilience, social inclusiveness and well-being amongst individuals and communities whilst at the same time tackling the stigma associated with suicide and self-harm. Such a campaign would need to engage with and from connections to other relevant social agenda issues, including homelessness, bullying and substance abuse-that includes drugs and alcohol-and the impacts of ongoing challenges such as the global financial crisis and climate change. The submission also noted that within the school environment a student's attempted or suspected suicide is a similarly traumatic event. However, it can also contribute to an increased suicide risk in other vulnerable students and members of the student's family. The submission importantly notes that in these instances the roles of school and education providers to manage the potentially long-term impact of suicide on young people, including the tensions that inevitably arise from a duty of care to others, and the ways in which information is shared between students, parents and staff following the student's suicide becomes vitally important, requiring great compassion and mindfulness in respect of the needs and wishes of the bereaved or the affected family. More action is needed in assisting schools and the broader community in dealing with the issue of youth suicide. There are a number of programs and organisations that exist to help young people deal with life pressures, but more resources, especially in rural and urban areas, are needed. The main programs run are basically by beyondblue; Suicide Helpline; Lifeline; and an initiative called 'Living is for everyone', which is an Australian based self-harm prevention resource website. Headspace centres are also run by the National Youth Mental Health Foundation, which helps young people who are going through a tough time. I will not go into all the services that headspace provides. It is a place that you can go to talk to someone about any issue, particularly young people. I highly recommend young people visit a headspace centre if they are finding life's challenges difficult. One organisation that I know everyone would welcome here and it is worthy of mention is Professor Patrick McGorry's Orygen Youth Health centre, which is a world-leading youth mental health organisation based in Melbourne. This organisation has three components: a specialised youth mental health clinic service, an internationally renowned research centre, and an integrated training and communications program. I also wish to praise the efforts of the youth in my community who have even started up a Facebook page called 'Coming together to prevent youth suicide'. In light of their initiative and the ongoing feedback that I have received from our young leaders in Casey, I wish to convene a summit in the electorate of Holt that brings together leading experts in Australia like Professor McGorry to address the issues that young people like Danny Rothwell, who is a constituent of mine and a great youth leader, continue to talk about, so we can discuss the plight of so many young people in my area who are affected by suicide. In the coming weeks I will talk more about this particular initiative. It is time that young people's voices were heard. This ongoing situation of youth suicide in my area is unacceptable. One suicide is enough. One suicide is one suicide too many. We need to do something about that. Listening to the voices in our community through this Facebook group, through this Facebook page and other young community leaders we are going to make sure their voices are heard by convening the summit and making sure we have a regional, areawide plan to stop another young person dying in my electorate. Electricity Prices particularly in New South Wales and particularly on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. There has been a lot of discussion at a community level around concerns over the last five years of record increases in electricity prices-up around a 70 per cent increase in prices over the past five years. It is a genuine issue of concern within the community. In relation to last week's New South Wales budget, on page 5.18 of the 2012-13 budget statement there is something that is of no comfort for those who have continued to see increases in electricity prices. Under dividends received by government under distribution and transmission there is a 2011-12 dividend of $639 million which is increased to $901 million in the 2012-13 year in the New South Wales budget. That is over a $250-million increase in the one year. On our rough estimates that is a 41 per cent increase over that one-year period. This is from a government in its second year who went to the ballot box in March 2011 promising to cut the dividends to the government from the distribution and transmission network and promising to do something about electricity prices. Sadly, that has not and does not look like occurring any time soon. Instead, we see the issue of the emissions trading scheme being loaded up to blame for all the evils of the extraordinary electricity price rises over the past five years. Last week in New South Wales the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, IPART, released figures showing that electricity prices, again, will rise by 18 per cent from 1 July. This is, as I have said before, an increase of 70 per cent over the past five to six years. IPART have confirmed that carbon pricing will account for only eight per cent of that 70 per cent increase and that the real culprit is poles and wires charges, which have gone up by more than",321,Grievance Debate
355,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (21:34,"I rise to not to talk about electricity prices,70 per cent over the last five years. IPART have made it crystal clear that network charges are up 70 per cent and that carbon adds just eight per cent. It is hard for all mid-North Coast residents and New South Wales residents as consumers to understand the intricacies of electricity prices. The various retail, network and green components make up the total price we pay, which makes it easy for some to blame a carbon price for electricity price rises, even when the regulator has shown that to be wrong. There is one proven way to cut through all of this confusion and obfuscation. All we have to do is follow the money. If anyone doubts or denies that network charges are the real reason power prices are so high, then the New South Wales budget of last week has come to their rescue. We only have to look at that one line item at page 5.18 of the New South Wales budget statement for 2012-13 under dividends on distribution and transmission which shows that in its first year the O'Farrell government expected $579 million in dividends from its four state owned power network monopolies when it, in fact, received $639 million; $60 million more than it budgeted. This is in a climate when the election promises of the 2011 campaign to cap power network dividends was made and made strongly. That promise is in the document entitled, NSW Liberals& Nationals plan for an affordable & sustainable energy industry. On page 2 at point 4 it says, 'We will cap dividends at forecast levels.' That was the promise. That was the contract. that they broke that promise by $60 million last year. That is nothing compared to what comes next year. The same budget papers at 5.18 reveal that state owned power network monopoly dividends will increase from $639 million last year to $901 million next year. That is an incredible 41 per cent increase in one single year. In fact, if the O'Farrell Liberal-National government had kept its promise to cap dividends last year-a promise that plenty of people, I acknowledge, voted for and welcomed-the increase in forecast dividends would have been an astounding 55 per cent. The O'Farrell government will skim from its power network monopolies $242 million more in cash next year than it did last year. That is roughly an extra $80 from each and every power consumer in New South Wales-higher for small businesses-and, unlike with the carbon price, there is little or no assistance or compensation or whatever you want to call it for most households and absolutely nothing for small business. Mr Ewen Jones: So they should do what they said they were going to do before an election? interjection-and stick by their election promise to cap the dividends. Mr Ewen Jones: You should tell the Prime Minister. 2008 election, was to back an emissions trading scheme. Point4 is a clear promise from the New South Wales Liberals and Nationals plan for affordable and sustainable electricity to introduce a dividend policy. They themselves last week broke this promise by nearly $300 million. The New South Wales Liberals and Nationals promised to 'introduce a dividend policy that stops government treating electricity companies as cash cows', but the reality is",324,Grievance Debate

359,Mr Oakeshott,"My election promise, not only at the 2010 election but also at thethat households and small businesses are paying dearly for ballooning power profits. You could say that they are paying for a bad dividend policy based on a lie. It is no wonder that landholders affected by a new high-voltage transmission line promised in the electorate of Lyne question whether the project is designed to meet power demand or to make money. TransGrid is one of the four state-owned power monopolies that will pay much higher dividends next year than it has in the past, and its transmission line proposal has been met with extreme distrust by landholders of all political variations. the past five years. Let us be very clear about that: wholesale prices in New South Wales over the last decade have hardly moved. Added to that, demand in New South Wales over the last two years has fallen. Those who can think logically can add all that together-wholesale prices are holding, demand is falling and retail is going through the roof with 70 per cent increases over the last five years. This is the greatest market failure in Australia today, and it needs to be corrected by state governments, which are currently skimming the super profits, setting their own rates of return and not dealing with appeals to rates of returns such as those that occurred in New South Wales, where they gave themselves a 10 per cent return over the last five years. Mr Perrett: Caesar judging Caesar. the actions of a previous Labor government as well as those of the current Liberal-National Party government: I am talking about actions that have been made across party lines. This is a market failure of grand proportions which the Commonwealth, if the states are not going to deal with it themselves, needs to start to address. Before us on page 518 is the story, which I have heard of a lot lately, of the cat being belled. There is nearly $300 million in dividend increases from the new New South Wales government, which largely ran on a platform of fixing the problem. They have not, and there is now a moment in time where the Commonwealth seriously needs to consider what it is going to do about the National Electricity Market and what it is going to do about the greatest market failure in Australia today, which is sending cost-of-living pressures through the roof and causing a whole range of debates around carbon pricing that deny the reality of what is really going on in the electricity market today. Mining Industry Employment 'job snobs' being applied as a pejorative to workers who are apparently able to take on a job but are unwilling to move to a region to take up that job or to take up an employment opportunity that may exist within the place where they live. It implies that somebody is unwilling to do a job that they are more than capable of doing. TodayI rise to point to a significant risk for the mining sector: if mining companies are to escape the tag of being job snobs themselves then they must do everything within their power to ensure that Australians workers who are ready, who are willing, who are able to take up employment in the resources sector, in the booming mining developments in Western Australia and Queensland, are given first choice in taking up those jobs.",325,Grievance Debate

361,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (21:49,"Over the last decade we have heard the termFor the last four years the mining industry has well and truly dominated the political and economic landscape. It is the sector which is driving new investment, over $500 billion worth, in the development or expansion of mines. Employment in the sector is growing; while it still makes up only a relatively small proportion of the overall workforce, it is expanding rapidly. For example, in my own region, employment in the coal mining sector has increased at around 12.6 per cent over the same period when, I note, we were being told by the Leader of the Opposition that mines were all going to close down. Coal production has actually increased by 14 per cent in the last 12 months in my own region alone. The debate over the return to taxpayers from the exploitation of those mineral resources has also gripped this place. I am very pleased to see that our proposal for the minerals resource rent tax has now passed into law and Australians will have the opportunity to ensure that for generations to come they will reap the benefits of the mining boom, long after the last bucket of dirt has been exported from our shores. The mining and resources boom is the single cause of our high Australian dollar, the force which has made our non-mine exports less competitive but, at the same time, our imports significantly cheaper. We are seeing a massive structural shift in our economy, in opportunities which exist in the north and the west, a long way away from where the population and the infrastructure exists, in the south and the east. More recently, the mining industry has been in the foreground over the issue of the use of foreign employees to work in the massive mining developments that are occurring in Western Australia and Queensland. I have given qualified support to the notion of enterprise migration agreements, but this support, like the support of the Australian community for these agreements, could well founder on the willingness of the mining sector to do the right thing by Australia and the Australian people. The mining industry quite simply has an obligation to the Australian community to ensure that it is employing locals and, what is more, to ensure that it is training locals, whether they be locals that are employed or locals that may be able to be employed in those mining developments. I am quite tired of being told on the one hand that there is work for anyone who is able, because I am sick of hearing people coming up to me in my electorate saying that this is simply not true because they have made numerous applications for jobs in the mining sector, only to have been either rejected or heard no response whatsoever. One of them is Antony Sprajk, a 21-year-old who has just completed a four-year apprenticeship at BlueScope and, because of the troubles in that business, is now looking for a job. He has made over 200 applications to mining companies. He is very well qualified, well thought of and has excellent referees, but he has either not heard back or, if he has heard back, has been looked over and told that he is not suitably qualified. A further example is John Wooley, a constituent of mine from Albion Park who has over 20 years experience in the building and construction industry at a supervisor level and a tradie level-he is a carpenter by trade. He has lost count of the number of jobs he has applied for and the number of times that he has been looked over and told that he is not suitable for the jobs that are on offer. Time after time we are meeting constituents in our electorates who have said that they have applied and that they are ready, willing and able to make the personal sacrifice and the great journey to either transfer to the west or the north or to engage in fly-in fly-out work-at a great cost to them and their families, quite often-but they are not being picked up by the mining companies. In response to that, I have written to the head of the Roy Hill company, to BHP, to Rio Tinto, to Fortescue, to Thiess and to all the other major mining companies and said: 'Before you come to government and ask for our agreement to another enterprise migration agreement, I suggest you come to my electorate in the Illawarra and I will help you set up and hire a hall. We can tour the supermarkets in the suburbs of my electorate because I know that there will be literally hundreds of men and women who have the skills, the willingness and the ability to take up jobs in these far-flung places.' It is not that I want to see these people leave the electorate. That is far from the case. I would rather they stayed and made their livelihoods and their lives in my electorate. But what I do say is this: if I have people who are out of work or who are looking for work in my electorate and they are keen to have a go, to try their luck in one of these far-flung places and to do the work that is necessary, and if they have the skills-that is, they are ready, willing and able-then I should be doing everything in my power to give these people a go, and the mining companies, the proponents of these enormous developments, should also be giving them a go. If the only thing standing between these workers and a job on these sites is a sitespecific licence or ticket, then the mining companies themselves should be assisting the workers to obtain that training and licence so they can take up that employment. A couple of thousand dollars is a small cost to a mining company, but it can make the world of difference to people who are currently out of work and looking for work. There are things that the government is doing, and I congratulate the efforts of the minister and the Prime Minister, who have been responsible for setting up Job Board Australia. It has been in place for only 14 days, but well in excess of 60,000 people have visited the site and over 2,000 people have registered with the site, seeking employment. At the moment only 250 jobs are directly registered with the Job Board, and another 1,700 are available by indirect links. But it is a good start; it is a good sign. It is a little bit unfortunate. If we had been facing this situation a decade ago it would not have been an online site that people would be going to. It would have been something called the Commonwealth Employment Service, a body that once had both the expertise and the reach and capacity to deal with exactly this sort of situation-how you connect people who are out of work in one part of the country with job opportunities that exist in another. In the face of a commitment not to do so, the Howard government closed down the Commonwealth Employment Service-to its shame and to the great detriment of the many thousands of Australian employers and employees who rely on these sorts of services either to get jobs or to fill vacancies. In view of that, the Job Board is filling a gap, and I encourage Australians, including people in my electorate, who are after a job in the mining sector to apply. There are things that we can be doing in our local electorates for fly-in fly-out workers. I am encouraging the local council, which owns a regional airport in my electorate, to do everything within its power to ensure that the airport and its infrastructure are available so that we can attract airlines to ferry workers to Queensland and Western Australia, making available those job opportunities. The key point here is this: we have workers who are ready, willing and able and a government that is willing to facilitate. It is incumbent upon the companies themselves not to be job snobs and to provide opportunities for employment for Australians. There are great opportunities available. 192(b) the debate is adjourned.

362,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"Order! In accordance with standing orderAttorney-General's (Question No. 830) Mr Oakeshott asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 8 February 2012: Has she responded to recent claims that (a) the Government (i) spent more than $9.7 million using a grant from her department's Counter Violent Extremism Fund to promote the Islam religion in Australia, (ii) has developed and implemented activities that assist the Islamic Society of Victoria to dispel myths and misconceptions about Islam and Muslims, and (iii) is funding overseas religious workers, paying them a salary of $66,000 per year to spread Islam in Australia, and (b) no such government program has ever been run for any other religious group, and no other religion has ever received a penny from the government; if so, what was her response. Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i). In the 2010-11 Budget the Australian Government committed $9.7 million over four years to countering violent extremism in Australia. The Building Community Resilience (BCR) grants program is one component of the overall strategy across all levels of government to address extremist influences before they pose a threat to our security. The grants program supports community-based projects that assist individuals and groups to resist or disengage from intolerant and radical ideologies, and encourage positive and constructive community participation. Projects include work across the areas of education, skill building and developing counter narratives to challenge violent extremism and extremist ideologies. Through the BCR grants program, 29 projects have been funded (to the total value of $2.8 million). (ii) The Islamic Society of Victoria is not a recipient of funding from the BCR grants program and has not been funded to undertake any other activities through the $9.7 million allocated from the 201011 Budget to counter violent extremism. (iii) The Government's CVE program, including the BCR grants program, is not funding anyone, including overseas religious workers, to spread Islam in Australia. In July 2011, Darebin City Council was awarded a BCR grant of $100,000 including $66,000 for the employment of an outreach officer based in Australia. The role of the outreach officer is to build stronger relationships between Muslim and non-Muslim communities within Australia by supporting and delivering opportunities for interfaith dialogue and education. (b) The CVE Program is directed at all types of violent extremism, regardless of the motivation or ideology. The aim of the Building Community Resilience grants program is to support local initiatives that actively address and discourage violent extremism in all its forms. Neither the broader CVE strategy nor the grants program promotes an ideology of any kind, be it religious, political or otherwise. The BCR grants program is open to all communities in Australia. Immigration and Citizenship (Question No. 889) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 27 February 2012: What proportion (as a percentage) of his department's (a) 2010-11, and (b) 2011-12 budget was (i) allocated, and (ii) spent (to date), on shared business services (ie, human resources, payroll, security, financial services, IT support, communications, recruitment, etc), and will he provide a list of those specific shared services, and the sum allocated and spent (to date) against each. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) For the 2010-11 financial year the Department: (i) did not provide internal allocations specifically to shared business service functions as these services are components of broader functional or operational budgets across the department; and (ii) has expensed approximately $231.2 million on shared business services, which equates to approximately 19.0 percent of the Department's total expenses, excluding depreciation and amortisation expenses. (b) For the 2011-12 financial year to 31 March 2012, the Department: (i) did not provide internal allocations specifically to shared business service functions as these services are components of broader functional or operational budgets across the department; and (ii) has expensed approximately $184.9 million on shared business services, which equates to approximately 18.8 percent of the Department's financial year to date expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation expenses. The specific shared services total expense figure includes corporate services such as payroll and human resources (including learning and development), accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, procurement services and Information Technology and Communication costs. The services reported in the attached tables are generally transaction oriented and have common characteristics across a range of business units. The expenses reported do not include property related expenditure.

Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There have been no instances where the use of the credit card has breach department guidelines for the three financial years.

Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In respect of current Tourism Ambassadors under the Tourism Ambassador Program: (a) How many Ambassadors are currently engaged Tourism Australia (TA) currently has over 160 international and Australian based advocates in its ambassador program, known as the Friends of Australia program (FOA). Ambassadors engaged as part of FOA have committed to help promote Australia without financial payment. See Attachment A. TA also engages with Australian and international personalities in broader marketing projects. Any activity that a FOA is engaged in where their services go beyond that of their FOA commitment is dealt with as part the broader marketing project they are engaged in. (b) Does each primarily conduct their work domestically or internationally FOAs are engaged in opportunities both domestically and internationally free of charge. Examples of domestic work include but are not limited to:  participating in media interviews and content projects as part of TA's domestic marketing strategy;  providing testimonial content (both written and video) that is distributed via Australia.com, Tourism Australia's You Tube channel and other digital platforms;  blogging and using social networks to share positive stories about Australia. Examples of international work include but are not limited to:  hosting international media and participating in interviews as part of TA's International Media Hosting Program;  providing testimonial content to be used in advertorials, editorials, digital and broadcast content initiatives;  attending TA related events in key markets, such as G'day LA, press conferences, launch announcements and media briefings. (c) Is their work voluntary or paid; if the latter, how is payment determined (ie, fixed term, fee per event) and what sum was paid per Ambassador in 2010-11; if under contract, on what date will each contract expire FOA are not paid for their involvement in the program and advocate about Australia on a voluntary basis. On occasion, TA does offer paid opportunities for FOAs, where the scope of work is considered to require significant time and effort on behalf of the ambassador. Examples of this include:  A FOA hosting a TA owned television series or major broadcast initiative, other than general editorial coverage  A FOA emceeing an event, such as a press conference or stakeholder event  A FOA appointed as a formal ambassador for a specific campaign, that requires a significant working commitment In instances where a FOA is paid for their activities, payment is determined as a one off fee per event/ campaign/ opportunity. When a Friend of Australia is involved in activity as part of a marketing campaign (such as a television series or as an ambassador for a specific campaign), this activity is considered beyond their involvement in the FOA program, and is managed and paid as part of the relevant marketing project. Ambassadors currently under contract include:  Matt Moran is currently under contract for the T-Qual Tick Tour campaign. His contract ends 31/07/2012.  Erica Angyal is an Australian expatriate living in Japan and is under contract for her services as an ambassador until 31/12/2014.
