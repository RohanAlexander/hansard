If duties of Customs and Excise are paid in one State on dutiable articles consumed in another, the State in which the articles are consumed is credited with the revenue. It will be apparent, from the figures before honourable members, that the two great cities of Sydney and Melbourne are, as was naturally to be expected, becoming every year to a greater extent distributing centres for the rest of the States. Owing to their large populations, and the consequent volume of importations, freights from all parts of the world to these centres are necessarily lower than to smaller centres. The result of this has been that during the past financial year, New South Wales 'was debited with £ 1 3 3 , 3 9 6 , and Victoria with £ 3 6 6 , 4 1 1 , making a total of £499,807 on imported dutiable goods transI n most parts ferred to other States for consumption, as against £ 7 5 , 6 0 7 and £ 1 9 6 , 1 52 respectively, or a total of £ 2 7 1 , 7 5 9 in 1902-3.

The estimated loss of £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0 for the nine months will be distributed among the States as follows :New South Wales, £ 5 8 , 0 0 0 ; Victoria. £14,000-Victoria, has for some time past adopted the penny postage; Queensland, £29,000; Western Australia, £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 ; and Tasmania, £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 . know that penny post has been successful' in all British countries in which it has been tried. I have not recent statistics relatinsr to New Zealand, but I believe that the system has proved very successful there. Canada in iqoo. and the Minister of Finance, Mr Fielding, speaking on the 22nd May last, said :It is but a few years since Canada had i£d. domestic letter rate and a to Great Britain, and even with these heavy postal rates the Post Office Department absorbed Sir John Forrest. all the revenue it could collect, and at the close of the year some ^120,000 or ^140,000 was usually required from the Public Treasury to make good the deficiency and keep the postto some extent, influence the preoffice running-w e have no longer a i£d. rateCanada has penny post within her own borders and penny post with the mother country. TheI t affords me Post Office Department no longer absorbs a l l its own revenue, no longer calls for ^120,000 or ^140,000 from the Treasury. After affording the people a very liberal postal service, after giving reduced rates, after establishing the blessing-for it is not too much to speak of it soof penny post, the Postmaster-General comes, at the close of the year, asking nothing from the Public Treasury, but tenders the splendid sum of J£I8O,OOO to assist the other public services of the country. It was not possible that the different rates of postage existing in the various States could for long continue. It is absolutely inconsisAs Treasurer, I have satisfied mytent with the principles underlying Federation that the people of one State should enjoy privileges at the hands of the Government which those of other States are denied, or that the people of the cities and towns should be charged one-half the rate charged to the people in the country. Almost since the establishment of the Commonwealth the people of Victoria have had the benefit of penny postage within their borders, and I believeMy estimate of the loss the people of Victoria would not thinkvery highly of the present Government if we declared that we intended to .level up instead of levelling down in regard to their rate of postage. What would they say if we recommended to equalize the postage rate all over Australia, but, instead of making it a penny, we proposed to make it twopence? I ' am inclined to think ( that there would be a howl of oppositionfrom one end of this State to the otherHonorable members will be afforded an opportunity to discuss the details of our proposal within a dav or two. The Postmaster-General has looked into South Australia, £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 ; the matter most carefully, and when he introduces! the Bill-whic h he probably It is encouraging to will do at once-to authorize the adoption of the penny postage system, he will beprepared to .give honourable members f u l l information in regard to the matters to which I have referred. I need scarcely point out that we alreadv eniov uniform The penny post was established in duties of Customs and Excise. Weenjoy uniform telelgraph rates except in the case of Tasmania and* we now propose a uniform system of penny postasje, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but throughout the Empire, and"" rate on letters throughout foreign countries which are willing to deliver Australian letters. Upor» this occasion I do not propose to say more than to express my satisfaction that this .great advantage is to be conferred upon everybody in Australia and throughout the Empire. that it will become an accomplished fact, because I believe that honorable members will be only too glad to vote for I most heartily congratulate my honourable friend and colleague, the Postmaster-General, upon the fact that it is to be accomplished during his term of office, and upon his recommendation. The fact that he has -made such a proposal shows that, after travelling in other parts of the world and rubbing shoulders with men charged with responsibility, he has returned to us more -convinced than ever of the need for this 1 advance in postal facilities for tlie people. I can assure the representatives of Tasmania that I have always advocated' that we should do all within our power to give -consideration to that State. that, as one of the smaller States, its Treasury has laboured under difficulties as the result of Federation; and that the revenue it has. received since the -establishment of the Commonwealth is £ 9 9 8 , 1 1 2 below that which it would have received-o n the basis of its returns for 1900-unde r its own Tariff. In these cir-cumstances, I have pleasure in intimating that the Government have decided to re-duce the rate in respect of telegrams to Tasmania from is. 8d. to is. per mes-sage of sixteen words. In order that this -may be done, provision is made on the Estimates for a payment, at the rate of £ 5 , 6 0 0 a year, fo the cable company. We -guarantee the cable company ,£5,600 a year, but no payment has been made under that guarantee since the extra charge of jkl. per word has hitherto been imposed. ""This additional | d . per word-as compared with the rate prevailing in other parts of the Commonwealth-ha s returned more than the guaranteed amount of £ 5 , 6 0 0 . Under -our present proposal, the people of Tasmania will secure that to which they are -entitled. They should have the same concessions, rights and privileges as are given the people in other parts of the Commonwealth with regard, not only to postal and telegraphic communication, but to every other Federal service. think it was ever intended J o differentiate between the States ir. regard to telegraphic -communication. -one should be able to send a telegraphic -message of sixteen words from Thursday Island, vid Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, to Wyndham, Western Australia, a distance of 7,000 or 8,000 miles for is., when a message of the same numI have no doubt whatever ber of words cannot be sent from 'here to Tasmaniaf o r less than is. 8d., owing to the fact that a stretch of 150 miles of sea separates that State from the mainthe adoption of our proposal. land. I am very glad indeed that this 1 anomaly is to be removed, and that the people of Tasmania will thus be benefited. There will, I believe, be but little loss of revenue consequent upon this change, because the increased traffic as the result of the reduced rate will be sufficient in a year or two to recoup it. I am also glad to say that on these Estimates the Government propose to deal with the increased subsidy of £ 7 , 0 0 0 for the mail service between Melbourne and Launceston, in the same way that we have dealt with other ocean mail services, and that is, to charge bhe amount -per cafita amongst I recognise the States. Prior to Federation New South Wales had a mail service' from Sydney to some of the Pacific islands, and under that contract it paid a few thousand pounds a year-. After Federation the contract was renewed with other conditions, and the extra amount paid was considered as "" o t h e r "" expenditure, and charned f e r cafita amongst the States. That is exactly analogous to the case of Tasmania. Prior to Federation, that State had a service for which it paid £ 6 , 0 0 0 a year. Since Federation a. contract has been made for £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 a year, and, as in the case of New South Wales, we intend to charge the difference of £ 7 , 0 0 0 as "" o t h e r "" expenditure f e r cafita. For the future Tasmania will only pay her share f e r cafita of the additional cost of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , and this will also obviate the necessity of making any mileage payment to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, as was done last year. The estimated revenue, as before stated, from the Post and Telegraph Department for 1906-7 is £ 2 , 8 i 3 , o o o . If it had not been for the introduction of penny postage, if would have been £ 2 , 9 7 0 , 0 0 0. The revenue is estimated to be obtained in the following manner :From telegraphs, ,£587,000 : telephones, £382,000; postage, £1,687,000 : and miscellaneous items, £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0 . If the I do not provision had not been made for a penny post the estimated revenue for the Department would have shown an increase of It is an anomaly that £ 1 4 5 , 8 1 8 instead of a decrease of £11,182. After making an allowance of £157,000 for the loss of revenue in connection with penny post, it is estimated that the postal revenue for 1906-7 will be contributed by the States as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £1,075,000; £751,000; Queensland, £347,000; South Australia, £284,000; Western Australia, £245,000; Tasmania, £111,000; total, £2,8x3,000.

Last year the total expenditure was £4,494,841, being £ JIII , 4 3 2 Jess than the Estimate. . The amount which the Commonwealth had a legal right to spend, under the Constitution, was ,£5,324,766, whilst the amount actually expended was .£4,494,841. Consequently, we returned to the States ,£829,925 more than was constitutionally obligatory. In other words, if we had spent that sum of £829,925, which we had a right to do under the Constitution, the States would have received that much less from the Commonwealth. I only mention this to show that the facts do not bear out those charges of recklessness and carelessness which are often levelled against this Parliament by ill-informed people who criticise us. If this House wanted to get kudos for itself by spending as much as it could on necessary works throughout the different States, thereby gaining to some extent the approbation of the people, we could have spent very much more than we did. But, instead of so doing, we havehanded over to the States an immense sum during the pas* f>\ ivears, allowing the States Governments to spend the money, 1 and therebv to gain anv kudos that might be attached to the-expenditure . Mr JosF.ru COOK -We could not. help ourselves. orable member's pardon; we could easily do not propose to deal with the expenditure have spent the money ourselves. But last in detail. I may mention that the year we were able, by economy and careestimated expenditure on the Departfulness in our management, to return to ment of Trade and Customs-the cost of the States £829,925 more than it was obcollection, in fact-is £264,258, an inligatory upon us to return.

The facts show that this House has crease over last year, which was £777.714-. always been most economical, and that it of £76,991, and on the Post Office, has at all times given full consideration to £2,704,105; an increase over last year, the interests of the States.

There is no doubt a great deal to be done in this direction, but it will not be accomquote a few statistics for the informaplished by our remaining idle and failing to attack the question. We know what we need. We require an increased population, and we need a population, of a certain kind. We do not want the. dregs of other lands. We need the young and the enterprising, and if we set about the work of encouraging immigration in a proper way, I am sure we shall find our wishes capable of realizawith Papua, as yet, it is the ,day of small tion. We can do very little without the co-operation of the States. They have the land, the mines, and the means of transit, and if they can be brought into line and will work with the Government, we are willing to -co-operate with them in the most generous manner with a view to encouraging population to settle Australia. The Government have endeavoured to do something in this direction, but the results are for the future. ,£5,000 has been placed on the Estimates to enable us to advertise for and secure suitable immigrants. We think that if we established a central office in London, in which all the States would be represented by their agents, it would work well. If the scheme for solving the financial problem which I have placed on the table to-day be adopted, immigration will be one excellent object to which to apply the proceeds of a specific Customs and Excise tax, and if the States would co-operate with us, I believe that good results would follow £ 5 J 3 ; sandalwood, £'71873; Under this plan the immigrants could be selected by the Commonwealth in concert with the States and landed in Australia, where required by the States, who would provide for their reception, employment, or settlement. The Commonwealth could arrange with, the immigrant, but no direct excountry must be fairly good to be able to pense would be imposed on the State until the immigrant arrived in Australia. Until he lands in Australia it should be a Commonwealth! matter, so far as is consistent with State assistance in choosing immigrants. States would alone deal with him, and find him his home. posals I have submitted, it is not intended that the bookkeeping system should be continued after the 31st December, IQTO ; but during the existence of the bookkeeping system each State would have to Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. pay the whole or part of the passage-money of immigrants landing on its shores; but I know very well that the, inwhen the bookkeeping'system comes to an end, or if an arrangement were made before that time with the States, the Commonwealth would be alone responsible. I have already referred to the position of Papua, and I should like at this stage to tion of honourable members. The estimated revenue of Papua for 1906-7 is £ 3 8 , 3 6 3 . The Commonwealth makes an annual grant of ,£20,000, and the Customs revenue amounts to £ 1 5 , 2 0 0, so that this leaves only £ 3 , 1 6 3 to be obtained from all other sources.' In looking through these figures, it has occurred to me that things. It would be not only satisfactory, but little short of marvellous,if we could control the Territory and do our duty in respect of 375,000 natives for less than £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year. The estimated expenditure for Papua for 1906-7 is £39,113) and of this £'6,000 represents expenditure on the Merrie England. The white population, according to the latest statistics I have been able to obtain, consists of 500 A sum of males and 142 females, making a total of 642. Of this number 48 are male officials. The black population is roughly estimated at 375,000. The imports for 1904-5 were of the value of £ 6 7 , 1 8 8 , the principal imports being:-Foodstuffs , ; £ 3 > ° 9 5 ; building material, £ . 3 , 0 9 2 ; to2 bacco, £ 6 , 1 0 2 ; wines and.spirits, .£3*555i drapery and clothing, £ 7 , 8 9 3 ; machinery, £2,012; hardware and ironmongery, £ ' 6 , 5 2 6 ; boats and launches, . £ 4 3 0 ; and miscellaneous, £ 1 4 , 4 8 3 . The principal exports consisted of gold valued at 6 6 2 and copra, £ 5 , 6 7 1 . Miscellaneous exports were valued at £ 6 , 5 2 9 , making a total of £.76,435. It would seem that such a large population should be able to provide labour for industries, and to make Papua flourishing and prosperous. The sustain such an immense population, and I think that, with a wise and liberal expenditure, very good results would be obtained. But we have spent very little money yet on public works. We need to cut tracks After the immigrant lands, the and roads through the country. It is of no use for any one to think that we can Under the procolonize and properly settle this immense Territorv without expending a considerable sum. It is impossible to bring an estate into cultivation and establish farmers thereon unless a considerable expenditure is made for that purpose. In PapuaI believe a great deal of the country is jungle, and the means of getting from one place to another, except by narrow paths, is very difficult. What we ought to do-that is, if we take a real interest in the matter-is to spend a hundred thousand pounds in opening up, and making the Territory self-supporting and prosperous. The pastoral industry in Australia is flourishing. The value of wool produced last year was £20,125,900, being the largest amount that has ever been received. The sheep increased in number from 65,822,000 in 1904 to 74,706,000 ir. 1905,-' being an increase of 8,882,755 in twentv-one months. cord that in a period of three vears and nine months, sheep have increased ir. number by 22,000,000. Australia had her largest number of sheep in 1891, namely, 1.06,000,000. crease of 32,000,000 sheep to equal that number. But I am glad to say that'the return from sales of wool was greater from 74,000,000 sheep in 1905 than from 106,000,000 sheep in 1891. very .satisfactory indeed. When in London a short time ago, I made some inquiries concerning the question of silver coinage and currencv. Judging from the interviews I had with the Imperial Treasury officials, there is no desire to' prevent Australia from having a coinage of her own if that is desired. and I think that we should have probably had a communication to that effect if there had no.t been a change of Government in England. ready made a communication. present Government, but the previous one. Government made a communication. was not settled. Some communication from this Government was not answered at the time the change of Government occurred, but the question was almost decided. I had ten Chamberlain, late Chancellor of the Exchequer. When a scheme to allow Australia to do just what she liked in the matter was placed before Mr Austen Chamberlain for approval, he said that he wished to have a little"" more time in which to consider it, because he desired to ascertain whether there was not some other means by which Australia could be satisfied, without establishing a system of coinage different from that existing in the mother country. I was assured by those with whom I conversed that the question of securing .the profit or. the silver coinage for Australia does not influence the decision, and that the Imperial Government is quite willing that any profit which accrues from such coinage should go to Australia. There are, however, other questions in connection-with the maintenance of gold to be considered. The result of rriy interviews was communicated on my return from London to the Prime Minister in the following terms: In regard to silver coinage the difficulties in the way are :(a) The Treasury officials fear that the withdrawal of a larger value per annum It is a splendid rethan j£ioo,ooo would result in considerable loss, and even at that rate it would take twenty years to withdraw the ^2,000,000 of silver in circulation in Australia. The continuance of two silver coinages in circulation We.require an induring that period would be unsatisfactory. (*) The maintenance of the gold coinage of Australia at its f u l l standard weight, which is now borne by the Imperial Mint, would, if the existing silver That is currency were withdrawn, become a burden on Australia, and it would have to be ascertained and decided as to how much of that coinage the obligation would rest upon. But in addition to the foregoing considerations is the question as to whether the establishment of a different silver currency might not be in the direction of widening rather than tightening the bonds of Empire. Such a currency would Their wish is to meet our desire, require very careful watching to avoid its being either depreciated by reason of an excess issue of silver, or the public being inconvenienced through an inadequate quantity being in circulation, the difficulty being increased by reason of the smallness of the population. It was, therefore, thought worthy of consideration whether some other means could not be devised other than establishing a distinct and separate silver I mean not the currency. There would appear to be no likelihood of the United Kingdom establishing decimal currency in the near future, and the general opinion expressed was to the effect that any interference with the value of the people's penny would lead to widespread dissatisfaction and resentment. . Having regard to the foregoing considerations, it was agreed that the question of silver coinage and decimal currency should be one of the subjects to be submitted to the Imperial Conference to meet in London next year, and in the meantime fuller consideration could be given to the question. the Minister is mixing the question of coining, our own silver.and the question of establishing a different currency. Sir JOHN FORREST I do not think so. I now come to a very important matter, and that is the position of the sugar industry.

51,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I think that"" White Australia "" policy appears to have been thus far very successful. The amount payable in bounties is increasing. This year provision is made for the payment of £ 2 7 8 , 5 0 0 , which represents a production of 139,000 tons of sugar, as against a production of 69,000 tons last year. A t first I hesitated to accept the departmental estimate. It is estimated! to make an immense increase from 69,000 tons to 139,000 tons produced one year. that the estimate is based upon probabilities, and I have accepted it. mated that the acreage of sugar-cane cultivated by white labour this year will be 116,750 acres, and that the area cultivated by black labour will be 37,150 acresmaking ,a total under cultivation. year is estimated to be-suga r produced by white labour, 144,236 tons, and sugar produced by black labour, 54,614 tons; making the total production 198,850 tons. I think that if that estimate, which has been obtained after a good dteal of trouble and care, is borne out at the end of the year, and if we produce 144,236 tons of sugar by white labour, the result cannot but be regarded as very satisfactory ioxdleed. The number of sugar-cane growers in Queensland employing white labour in 1902 was 1,521. It is estimated that at the end of 1906 the number of growers employing white labour will be 3,393, making an increase in four years of 1,872 growers employing white labour. the growers in Queensland employing black labour numbered 975, and in 1906 they numbered 837, showing a. decrease labour of 138, In New South Wales in 1902 there were 1,005 growers of sugar by white labour, and ira 1906 there were 1,450, showing an increase in the four years of 445 farmers employing white labour. Wales 115 growers employing black labour, and in 1906 there were 110. the four years there has been a decrease of five farmers in New South Wales who employ black labour. at the end! of 1906 there will be 4,843 growers of sugar-cane by. white labour in the Commonwealth, as compared with 947 growers employing black labour. have been taken during the year to find > out how many persons are employed in the sugar industrv. The Customs authorities have obtained information that on the 31st of December, 1905, there were 20,162 white persons so employed. That is a very satisfactory statement to be able to> make, and a fine result to have attained. There were only 8,452 coloured persons employed in the industry. industry as a whole; not merely in growing. Sir JOHN FORREST In the sugar industry, taking into consideration everything connected with it . The total number of persons employed in the industry by white labour in at the date mentioned was 28,614. But I have been assured There were 17,937 white persons earning bounty; and there were 2,225 white perI t is estisons and 8,452 coloured persons who were not earning the bounty. In regard to cultivation, since 1904, and up to the end of 1906a period of two years-it is estimated that the area cultivated by white of 153,900 acres men will have increased in Queensland The production this from 45,424 acres to 96,000 acres-a n increase of 50,576 acres. The figures with regard to cultivation in New South Wales are hot so satisfactory. In the same two years it is estimated that the increase will be from 19,114 acres to 20,750, an increase of only 1,636 acres. The total increase in the area cultivated by white men in the Commonwealth in the last two years amounts to 5^,212acres. During the same two yearsthe area cultivated by black labour decreased in Queensland from 74,375 acres to 35,000, a decrease of 39,375 acres; and in New South Wales the area cultivated by black labour decreased from 2,411 acres to2,150a decrease of 261 acres. The total On the other hand, in 1902 decrease in acreage where black labour was. employed in the two years was 39,636 acres. That result is most satisfactory. I never expected to have such satisfactory of growers employing black figures to convey to honourable members in regard to the policy which we have been trying to carry out. Since 1902a period of four years-the estimated production of sugar by white labour increased in Queensland from 12,254 tons to 125,000 tons-ar t In 1902 there were in New South increase of 112,746 tons. So that in mated "" ? Sir JOHN FORREST I cannot speak of these figures as actually realized, beI t is estimated that cause the period is not yet complete. They cover the period from 1902 to the 31st of"" December, 1907. The figures have beendefinitely ascertained up to the 31st DecemSteps ber, 1905, but I wish to give the definite and the estimated figures together. Irr Queensland, as I have said, the increaseamounts to 112,746 tons. In New South Wales, however, it is estimated that the production by white labour will have decreased from 19,434 tons to 19,236 tons.",38,Total Pob Six Years 1901 2 To 1906

The total increased production by white labour in the four years is estimated at 112,548 tons. During the same period the estimated production by black labourin Queensland has decreased from 65,581 tons to 53,000 tons-that is to say, by 12,581 tons ; while in New South Wales, it has, I regret to say, increased from 1,526 to 1,614 tons, or, in other words, by 88 tons. There has been a total decrease of 12,493 tons of production by black labourin four years. Honourable members are aware that, under -section 87, known as the Braddon section, of the Constitution, the Commonwealth receives one-fourth of the excise revenue. At present, the excise is £ 3 per ton, and therefore, the Commonwealth receives 15s. per ton, and has to pay £ 2 per ton as ""bounty, losing thereby £ 1 5s. on every ton produced by white labour. ton' ? will begin to operate at the beginning of next year.

The Commonwealth's one-fourth -of the £ 4 excise will be £ i , and the bounty to be repaid will be £ 3 , so that the Commonwealth, out of its one-fourth, will have to pay £ 2 more than is received.

The bounty payments are attaining large proportions. In 1902, the bounty paid to Queensland was £ 2 4 , 4 9 3 , a r , d to New South Wales it was £ 3 6 , 3 3 3 , or a total of £ 6 0 , 8 2 6 .

66,Mr Dugald Thomson,"But the fact Ithe position of the whole question of sugar growing by white labour, I think there is good cause fojr satisfaction. When the policy, was introduced many qi us, and I , amongst the number, had great doubts as to whether white men would be able to work in this industry in the tropics. I had had some experience in the north-west .tropical parts of Western Australia, but, so far as can be gathered from the figures, it seems that the policy established has beer. ,thus far absolutely successful. It may be that finality has not been arrived at in dealing with this question, but I think we may all look' to time and experience to finally place the question in a satisfactory position. The next question associated with the sugar industry is the repatriation of the Kanakas, which has to take place almost immediately. I know I am only expressing the wish of 'the Government and of every member of this Parliament when I say that we all hope the greatest care will be taken in returning these men to their own country that every kindness and consideration will be shown, and that every hardship that it is possible to avoid will be avoided. The Government have provided £25,000 for the purpose of the repatriation. The Queensland Commission, which recently sat, estimated the cost of the deportation at £53,454. The members of the Commission state that there are 5,280 islanders liable to be returned, and they anticipate that not more than 4,500 will be deported. The Pacific Islanders' Fund, of which we have heard so much from time to time, and which is in the Queensland Treasury, has, I am informed, only £10,619 t 0 credit. 'estimated that, of the 4,500 who are likely -to be deported, 900 will be sent away by the end of the year, and the remainder as soon as possible thereafter. The deportation of these Kanakas is a part of the White Australia policy, and must be persevered with. I am glad to be able to inform honourable members that satisfactory communications are going on with the Queensland Government for joint action in carrying out the law in this respect. a very important matter, the external trade of the Commonwealth. I refer, not to the Inter-State trade, but to the trade in imports and exports with countries beyond the seas. The value of our imports has not greatly varied during the last three years. In 1903 it amounted to £38.8^5,682. The value of our imports in 1905"" is much about the same, the value of imports free of duty amounting to ,£14,072,061, and of dutiable goods to £24,274,670, or a total of £38,346,731.

Tasmania sends away £3,239,441, and receives back only £1,913,629. The -other four States do the opposite. I come now to a very important matter, and that is to my recommendations with regard to the financial problems of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. I am .glad to say that I have been able to submit these recommendations with the full concurrence of my colleagues in the -Government. The desire of the Government is to act as far as possible in accord with the wishes of the 'States. When I became Treasurer, I felt that it was my duty not to follow, but to endeavour to lead, in this -crucial matter. I felt that it was the duty of the Commonwealth Government, and, If with all diffidence I mav sa>v so, the -duty c*f Parliament as well to lead the way rather than to leave it to others to discover a suitable road. ciple, the Government have taken the responsibility of propounding a scheme with that object in view. I do not for a moment say that we have arrived at finality, or that the scheme I have propounded, and which has been approved by other States goods to the value of £8,480,764, and receives from them goods I have prepared a to the value of .£3,535,695. Tasmania sends to the other States goods to the value °f £3> 39>44 > d receives from them 2 I a n goods to the value of £1,913,629. The figures for the other four States tell in the opposite way.

But I do say that I am convinced that the plan I have proposed is a good one, that it will meet the circumstances, and give satisfaction, not only to the Commonwealth, but also to the States. It is a difficult matter with which to deal, as we have to continually keep in mind the terms of the Constitution, the interests of the Commonwealth, and the interests of the States. These three considerations must be constantly borne in mind, and I felt that it would be of no use to propound a scheme unless I were fairly certain that it would be acceptable to the people. It would be most undesirable, as well as difficult, to attempt to force upon the country the viewsof the Government or even of Parliament. The desire of the Government is to arrive at a fair and reasonable arrangement with the States, and the best way to begin is to propound and recommend, as has been done, a scheme, to Acting upon this prinbe criticised by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States and by the people of Australia. It is not expedient that the Government should hesitate to take the lead in this matter. Nearly six vears have passed since Federation was 1 inaugurated, and that time has been fully. occupied in arranging the various Departments of Government and passing the laws necessary to give effect to the constitutional changes involved. three Conferences of Premiers have been held in which this question has beer, raised, and, although some advance has been made towards a settlement, there is yet no finality. In four years' time-o n the 31st December, 1910-sectio n 87, the Braddon clause, becomes alterable. liament will then have the responsibility of deciding what amount of surplus Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the several States, and on what basis the return shall be made. I do not fear that the States will suffer injustice under this arrangement. sents the people of the States, and will, I feel sure, always recognise the obligations and responsibilities of the States Governments. great works in settling people on the land, in building railways, providing water supplies, and giving all the other facilities which are required for the settlement and inprovement of the condition of the people, the provision of which does not come within of the Commonwealth. My confidence is somewhat shaken, however, when I notice that resolutions have been passed in Conference and in Parliament asking for a per capita distribution, under which the State of which. I am a representative would suffer a loss Of about' £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. But, .although I have never seen any disposition on the part of the members of itHis Parliament to act -otiher than fairlv and generously to the several States, I recognise that it is not right that the financial position of the States should be uncertain or unsafe, and dependent upon the annual votes of this Parliament. We should, therefore, begin to prepare at once fori the time when the. Braddor.' provision will become alterable. taking office as Treasurer, that the question was one of the chief obligations resting upon me, and have kept it in view ever since, and I went to London specially to obtain information i i i regard to the matter. meet the views expressed by the Premiers of the States in Conference at Hobart, and to complv as nearly as possible with the terms of the Constitution. The proposals submitted have, as I have alreadv Sir John Forrest. said, received the approval of the Government, as a scheme most likely to meet with the support of those best acquainted with Still, our constitutional and financial circumstances, and honourable members will find in the Budget papers the f u l l proposals, with complete returns and tables which will be found useful in thoroughly investigating the position. The proposals of the Government embrace the taking over of the Par'debts of the States, the amount of the debts to be so taken over, the continuance of section 87, the Braddon section, the amount and basis of the annual paymenrs to the States-, the bookkeeping system, the future borrowing by the States, some concluding remarks and a summary. This Parliament repreI do not intend to deal with the scheme in detail now, as the f u l l report is submitted for the information of honourable members. I have not consulted any one They have to carry out outside Australia in regard to matters between the Commonwealth and the States, because I am of opinion that those who possess f u l l information and local knowledge are better able to deal with ihetn than any one else. But, with regard to the taking over of the States debts and the province the substitution .of Australian stock for the States' stock now existing, I /felt that great financial authorities in England could give valuable information, and I was not disappointed. Amongst those whom I had the privilege of consulting were the governor, deputy-governor, and officers of the Bank of England, the directors and officers ofi the London and Westminster Bank, the brokers for those banks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the permanent Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Sir Edward Hamilton. I also had the honour of an interview with Lord Goschen, who, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, carried out the great scheme under which nearly ,£600,000,000 worth of British stock wasi converted. In I felt, on adjdition to having a long interview with Lord Goschen, I had a number of interesting conversations with Sir Edward Hamilton, who was his right-hand man throughout the negotiations referred to,, and who was then, as he is now, the In considering it . I have tried to principal financial Secretary to the Treasury. I ' also had the pleasure of meeting Lord Revelstok'e, one of the governors of the Bank of England, and the head of the firm of Messrs. Baring Brothers. The conclusions I have arrived at after carefully considering the opinions expressed by those whom I have had the privilege of consulting are contained in a memorandum I addressed to the Prime Minister as follows :Commonwealth Treasury, Melbourne, 9th July, 1906. The Honourable the Prime Minister. On the 25th September last I submitted to you a memorandum (copy herewith) after carefully considering the opinions exsetting forth, more fully than I had done pressed by those whom I have had the in the Budget Speech of the 22nd. of Auprivilege of consulting aregust, my views in regard to the annual returnof Surplus Revenue to the States, and the extension of Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) of the Constitution. 2. Since that time, having given attention to the subject, I now venture to submit the result, in the hope that it may not only be useful in arriving at the best means of dealing with the important matter of the taking over by the Commonwealth of the State Debts, but also in dealing with, the otherfinancialproblems of the Constitution. 3. I propose to deal with the whole subject under the following heads:A -Taking over the States Debts. B -Amount of State Debts to be taker. over. C -Continuanc e of Section 87 (the Braddon Clause). D -Amount and basis of the annual payment to the States. E -Bookkeepin g system. F -Futur e borrowing by the States. G -Concludin g remarks. H A -TAKIN G OVER THE STATES DEBTS. 4. During my recent visit to LondonI had the opportunity of consulting leading financiers and directors of financial institutions, as well as the Permanent Financial Secretary and other officials of His Majesty's Treasury, and the result of such consultations fully satisfies me that it would be financially advantageous to Australia if the transfer of the State Debts to the Commonwealth, as authorized and' intended by Section 105 of the Constitution, were undertaken as soon as possible; ar.d further, I : was assured that such proposals to transfer would be well received in financial circles in London. 5. It is not reasonable to suppose that any single State of the Commonwealth can for long be able to either raise, redeem, or convert loans on such favorable terms as the [7T] Commonwealth, with its exclusive powers of taxation through Customs and Excise, and with the security behind it of the whole of Australia. Those who argue that State securities are likely to continue to be as valuable as Commonwealth securities, take a very sanguine, and, I think, not well founded, view of the situation. 6. The conclusions I have arrived at (1) That by having one denomination of stock firmly established on the London market, secured on the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, a considerable advantage and saving to Australia must eventually result. (2) That a favorable opportunity for the establishment of Commonwealth Stock would be at a time when a considerable amount of State Stocks was within a reasonable period of maturity. (3) That as the existing State Stocks from time to time are approaching maturity, provision should be made for their conversion or redemption (or in some cases, of such portion as is not provided for by a sinking fund) by the issue of Stock secured upon the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, to be called ""Australian Consols."" (4) That such Stock should be issued -Summary. at 3 per cent, interest per annum for a fixed! term of, say, thirty years, but interminable after the expiration of that term except at the option of the Government, on giving six months' notice to the holder. (5) That until "" Australian Consols"" are firmly . established on the London market and become popular (which it is anticipated would soon be the case) it is inadvisable to proceed with conversion of State Stocks until they are approaching towards maturity. (6) That"" Australian Consols"" would in time (if not immediately) command a higher price than State Stocks of the same denomination and currency, and it that so soon as that takes place conversion on terms favorable to the Commonwealth would no doubt be found to be advantageous, and consequently would be desired by' existing Stockholders. (7) That upon all ""Australian Consols"" issued for the conversion or redemption of State Stocks or Otherwise, a sinking fund of not less than \ per cent, per annum should be provided; and such sinking fund, together with all net interest arising from its investment, should be vested in trustees for the purposes of the final redemption of such Stock. Any existing sinking funds in connection with any of the State debts taken over by the Commonwealth, should, subject to the existing trusts in each case, become the property of the Commonwealth, but solely for the purposes of such trusts and the redemption of such debts. (8) That all net profits arising from any conversion or redemption of existing loans should be credited by the Commonwealth to the State concerned, and the annua! payment by that State reduced accordingly from time to time (3) That on conversion or at maturity 7. Nothing in the foregoing proposals would in any manner affect the indemnity given to the Commonwealth by the States under Section 105 of the Constitution, but it would be advisable for each State to pass a special permanent appropriation providing for the payment to the Commonwealth from time to time of any deficiency that might arise. I would, however, particularly point out that for many years to come, under the plan proposed, the Commonwealth would have ample funds in hand belonging to each State to fulfil its obligations in this respect to each State (vide TablesC and D, herewith, showing approximately what would be the position at the end of 192.0. B -AMOUN T OF STATE DEBTS TO BE 8. I recommend that legislative provision Stocks before conversion, as such action 1 be made for taking over by the Commonwould prevent the possibility of any prowealth of the whole of the existing State fitable conversion,, and would be making to Debts, which amounted ir_< the aggregate the existing holders a present of any inon 30th June, 1905, to £236,680,1.39 ; but, crease in price caused by the additional as by Section 105 of the Constitution only Commonwealth security. Sir John Forrest. the State Debts"" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" which on the same date amounted to ,£201,983,386 (vide TablesD and F herewith), can be legally dealt with, and, as it must take some time to obtain an amendment of the Constitution, I advise that the legislation should provide for dealing with the £201,983,386 at once, and that the balance °f £34>697»353 be dealt with so soon as the required amendment of the Constitution is obtained. By adopting this course the conversion or redemption of loans approaching maturity could be dealt with at once by the Commonwealth. The procedure and conditions of taking over the State Debts to Le as follows:(1) That a law be passed enabling the whole of the State Debts to be converted before maturity, or redeemed at maturity by the Com-, monwealth (subject in regard to . debts incurred since ist January, 1901, to the necessary amendment qf the Constitution), by such successive operations as may be thought fit. ' (2) That until conversion or maturity of the State Debts, as the case may be, each State continue to pay its own annual interest and sinking fund (if any). of the State Debts, as the case may be, the Commonwealth become solely liable for the annual payment of interest and sinking fund as well as for the redemption of the Stock. (4) That the Commonwealth deduct each year from the amount to be paid to each State the expenditure made on behalf of that State for interest and sinking fund, and, if such amount is insufficient in any case, the deficiency be paid to the Commonwealth by that State. The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on StateC -CONTINUANC E OF SECTION 87 Braddon Clause). 9. Under Section 87 of the Constitution, known as the "" Braddon Clause,"" it is provided that "" during a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until' the Parliament oherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure."" It is not generally realized that this section, which was intended for the financial protection of the States, has never yet come into practical operation, as the Commonwealth has not expended in any year by a considerable sum the one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue it was entitled to expend. ,10. I do not recommend the continuance of this clause beyond the 31st December, 191 o, the date on which it becomes alterable, as provided' by Section 87 ; indeed, if the States would agree, I should advise, in the interests of both Commonwealth and States, its repeal at once and the substitution of a plan by which a specified annual payment should be made to the States. During its continuance it has never been of any advantage to the' States, while it has hampered the Commonwealth and prevented it dealing with important questions of policy. The one fact that if additional revenue were required from Customs and Excise, whether for general or specific purposes, it would be necessary to raise four times as much as was required, shows the unpractical character of such a provision, and renders its permanent continuance impossible. For instance,, if , say, an additional million were required from Customs and Excisef o r general purposes, it would necessitate raising four millions; or, if an additional million were required for a specific purpose, such, for instance, as for Immigration, Defence, or Old-age Pensions, and a special Customs tax were imposed on certain articles with the object that the proceeds should be ""ear-marked"" for such specific purpose, it would be necessary to raise four millions instead of the one million required. Such a procedure is impracticable. A periodical adjustment on the basis of a proportionate return of the whole of the net revenue from Custom's and Excise suffers from the same difficulty, as it would practically prevent additional revenue being obtained from Customs and Excisef or any [71]2 °i5 (The general or specific purpose without compelling the Commonwealth to raise four times as much as was necessary. D AMOUNT AND BASI S OF ANNUA L 1 1 . Realizing fully, therefore, that a return by the Commonwealth to the States of a fixed proportion of the whole Customs and Excise revenue annually received would leave the States in a position of uncertainty as to the amount they would annually receive, and would also be embarrassing to the Commonwealth, I am convinced that the most satisfactory solution of this question would be that the Commonwealth should undertake to make to the States annually a specified fixed payment, with an additional annual payment should the total net revenue from Customs and Excise increase, and that the whole of any additional revenue derived from any new or existing items of duties from Customs and Excise which may be levied after 31st December, 1910, and appropriated for a specific purpose may be ""ear-marked "" and retained by the Commonwealth solely for such purpose. 12. The effect of this plan would be that the Commonwealth, having arranged its taxation so as to provide sufficient funds to pay annually the required contribution to the States, and also sufficient to provide for all its own general and special expenditure, would then be free from any further financial obligation to the States. The States, on the other hand, would be free from uncertainty as to the amount they were to annually receive from the Commonwealth, while both Commonwealth and States would know their exact financial positions and obligations, and would have the burden separately placed upon them of making both ends meet. This is not the case at present, since any extra expenditure by the Commonwealth means a diminution of trieamount returnable to the States. This proposal of a. return of a specified amount annually has already received the support of the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Carruthers), vide para. 9 of my letter dated 25th Sentembe'r, 1905 (copy herewith, AppendixA ) . 13. I would suggest that the period during which the Commonwealth should undertake to guarantee an annual payment to the States (on the basis hereinafter mentioned) be ten years, viz., after 3.1st December, 19TO, up to 31st December, 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. By that time we should have had twenty years' experience of Federation, and would necessarily have acquired during that period a greater and wider knowledge of the question, which would assist the Parliament in making arrangements "" on such basis as it deems f a i r "" for the future. The guaranteed annual payment to each State to be on the following basis:(1) To pay annually to each State for ten years after 31st December, 1910 (the date on which. Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) becomes alterable), a fixed sum equal to the average annual' amount of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State has contributed during (say) the five years preceding such 31st December, 1910 (not including the special revenue in the case of Western Australia). (2) If three-fourths of the total net revenue received by the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise in any year after 31st December, 1910, exceeds amount of the annual fixed sum guaranteed to all the States, any such sum in excess to be distributed among the States per capita. (3) Provided that after 31st December, 1910, the Commonwealth mav impose additional Customs and Excise duties for specific purposes, and may specially appropriate and retain and ""earmark"" the 1 whole of the revenue(a) Derived from any new items of duties imposed solely for specific purposes ; (b) Derived from any additional duties on existing items of duties imposed solely for specific purposes. If any surplus remains in anv year after providing for such specific purposes from the revenue derived from such special appropriations, three-fourths of such surplus to be annuallv returned to the States i>er capita. These aranffemer.ts to continue for ten B, with annotations), it will be found that years, viz.,'after the.3 ist December, 1910, there is nothing in them inconsistent with up to 31st December. iq2o. and thereafter 'any of the proposals recommended by the until the Parliament otherwise provides. Sir John Forrest. E THE BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM. 14. Under the foregoing proposals the bookkeeping system would terminate at the same time as the ""annual fixed payment"" system would come into force, viz., 31st December, 1910. The effect of this termination would be that the Commonwealth expenditure would be dealt with as a whole, irrespective of State divisions; though it -need not prevent the Commonwealth expenditure in each State being approximately commensurate .with the revenue derived from that State. It would also simplify the keeping of the. Public accounts, and give financial responsibility as well as financial independence to both the Commonwealth and the States. We must not. however, forget that both are supplying the wants of the same people, and that in each case the expenditure is intended to be equally beneficial to the same 'people. F FUTURE BORROWING BY THE STATES. 15. The Commonwealth, should be empowered to raise loans for the States on terms and conditions to be agreed upon. the aggregate 16. It is, I think, inadvisable at the present time to ask the States to undertake for all time not to borrow on the London market except through the Commonwealth. In order, however, to firmly establish or. the London market ""Australian Consols"" with the object of obtaining better terms and making greater savings through the conversion or redemption by the Commonwealth of their existing stocks, the States should undertake not to borrow in the Londori-market, except through the Commonwealth, up to 31st December, 1920, the date on which it is proposed that the amount and basis of the annual payment by the Commonwealth to the States may be reconsidered by the Parliament. The States should limit their borrowing during that period to the Australian market, and each State would of course be solel'y responsible for any new debts it incurred, together with all interest and sinking fund on such debts. G -CONCLUDIN G REMARKS. 1.7. I submit the foregoing recommendations for adoption. If a comparison be made between my proposals and those made by the Premiers on 15th Februarv, 190.S. at the Hobart Conference {vide Appendix Premiers. 18. Only two sections of the Constitution are affected, viz., Sections 94 and 105, and if these recommendations are favorablyviewed by the States, there should be little difficulty in obtaining the consent of the electors to the required amendments at the ensuing General Election, especially as the proposed amendments would not in any way prejudice State rights; or it might be considered sufficient to obtain "" the concurrence of the Parliaments of all the States"" to an agreement with the Commonwealth based on these proposals, under the powers contained in Section 51, sub-sec. xxxviii. of the Constitution, and if this can be legally done there need not be any amendment whatever of the Constitution. 19. I have purposely not referred in this memorandum to the question of "" Transferred Properties,"" because my recommendations on that subject have beer, already presented to Parliament (vide page 1800, Parliamentary Papers, vol. 2, Session 1904, AppendixA i ) . H -SUMMARY . 20. The following is a summary of the recommendations contained herein: (1) That the State Debts, ""as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" amounting to about 202 millions (as provided by Section 105 of the Constitution), be taken over as soon as possible (vide par. 8). (2) That the balance of the total existing State Debts, amounting to about 35 millions, 'be "" taken over,"" so soon as an amendment of Section 105 of the Constitution, enabling it to be done, is obtained (vide par. 8). (3) That Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) be not continued beyond the 31st December, 1910 (vide pars. 9 and 10). (4) That after 31st December, 1910, up to 31st December. 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, the net Customs nnd Excise revenue ibe divided between the States and the Commonwealth as follows: The States to have(a) A guaranteed fixed annual payment for ten years to each State on the basis of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State contributed (excluding the special revenue in the case of Western Australia) during (say) the five years preceding such 31st December, 1910 (vide par. 13, sub-par. (b) If three-fourths of the total net revenue from Customs and Excise in any year (not ""ear-marked"") exceeds the aggregate of the guaranteed fixed payments to all the Statesa per capita return of such excess (vide 'par. 13, sub-par. (2). (c) A per capita return of three-fourths of any surplus of "" ear-marked "" net Customs and Excise revenue (new or additional) after providing for the specific purposes for which it was specially appropriated (vide par. 13, sub-par. (3). The Commonwealth to have(d) Subject to the annual paymen of the guaranteed' fixed sum to the States one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue (not "" ear-marked"") (vide par. 13, sub-par. (1). (e) Any new or additional net Customs and' Excise revenue, '' ear-marked "" for specific purposes (vide par. 13, sub-par. (3). ( / ) One-fourth of any surplus of "" ear-marked "" net Customs and Excise revenue, after providing for the specific purposes for which it was specially appropriated (vide par. 13, subpar. (3). (5) That the bookkeeping system should cease on 31st December, 1910 (vide par. 14). (6) That the States undertake not to * borrow on the London market, except through the Commonwealth, up to 31st December, 1920 (vide pars. 15 and 16). (7) That Sections 94 and 105 of the proposed by the Premier of New South Constitution be amended or an Wales( Mr Carruthers), is the only one agreement entered into between that will be permanently satisfactory to the the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth and to the States.

(Hansard, p. 1217.) 2. The more I have considered this question the more I am convinced that the plan outlined in my Budget speech, and now Sir John Forrest. 3. It is scarcely likelv that the Federal Parliament will continue the Braddbn Clause beyond the 31st December, 1910, and, therefore, after that date, the whole Customs and Excise revenue will be at the disposal of the Commonwealth, subject only to the provision in Section 94 of the the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Common4.

(Hansard, p. 1216.) 5. But the taking over of the States"" The States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest 'payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portion of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States."" It will be noticed that the Constitution even, seems to infer the possibility of there being no surplus returnable to the States by the word's used, viz., "" o r if such surthatplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States."" 6. Unless, therefore, some mutually -satisfactory arrangement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States before the end of 1910, the States will have to rely solely upon the Commonwealth Parliament, and not upon any legal obligation, in respect of the return of surplus revenue. 7. That being so, it is manifestly a very urgent and important matter for the States that no time should be lost in endeavouring to make a binding arrangement with the Commonwealth in regard to the amount to be annually returned' to them after the end of 1910. 8. The duty of the Commonwealth and the States is, of course, to do that which is best for Australia as a whole, and viewing the question solely from that stand-point, States must always be of vital importance the proposal foreshadowed in my Budget to the Commonwealth Parliament, and, -speech, and now submitted by the Governtherefore, although it may be thought by ment of New South Wales, seems to me some that in giving favorable consideration the only possible satisfactory Dasis for the to the proposals of the Premier of New future in the interests of both-the ComSouth Wales( Mr Carruthers) the Commonwealth and the States. 9.

My reason 6,379,726 218,113 for not making any proposal of a perma4.526,010 136,012 nent character is that I do not believe' it 7.356,573 255,697 possible at the present time to formulate 31,323,199 1,144,524 235,555 7,174 a plan that would be acceptable for all 1,914,350 63,181 time to both the Commonwealth and the 75,728 States.

If we were to attempt to make a permanent arrangement now, it would no doubt be necessary to amend the Constitution, and there might be obstacles to our success in that direction. plenty of room for criticism and for differences of opinion in this matter, and all I desire is that those who do not agree with me will suggest some better scheme. The honourable member for Mernda has had several conversations with me upon this matter, but I am sorry to say we are not in accord. He has in preparation a scheme which I hope he will allow me to place upon the table of the House in a few days, in order that honourable members may give it their full consideration. I have not seen the final draft of it, but honourable members know the .reputation of the honourable member. He has had a long commercial experience, and I believe that his scheme-whic h I will not venture to criticise at the present moment-aim s at securing finality immediately. I am sorry to. say that I do not think his desire can be attained. His proposals are much more ambitious one than the proposals I have submitted, and I am quite sure that it will receive from honourable members every consideration. I thank the honourable member for what he has done, and regret I do not aeree with his views. I wish that some other honourable members, possessed of similar knowledge and experience, would do the same. I submit my proposals with confidence, and in the hope that they will prove acceptable to the Governments of the States and the people of Australia. I suppose it is characteristic of me that, while I do not make up my mind in a moment, when once I have made it up I am not easily turned from mv resolve. Probably that is the reason why I am sometimes credited with being an autocrat. will be opposed to the right honourable gentleman upon his proposal to terminate the Braddon section of the Constitution. pose to terminate that section immediately. Under my proposal, it will be practically perpetuated till 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. will see it in that light. to say that the proposals now submitted are practically in accord with the views expressed by the Premiers of the States at the Hobart Conference. As a matter of fact, they are more generous to the States There is than were the proposals of the Premiers. For instance, I do not suggest that the States should for ever forego the right to borrow on the London market except through the Commonwealth-as was agreed to at the Hobart Conference but I propose to make that question an open one after 1920. In no way are the present recommendations of the Government less liberal to the States than were those submitted by the Premiers themselves at Hobart. If honourable members will look at AppendixB they will see that I have annotated the recommendations of the Premiers, so as to show clearly where they differ, and in what respect our proposals are more liberal or less liberal, than those submitted by the Premiers. Our proposals will give-subjec t to certain limitations financial freedom alike to the States and the Commonwealth. The last subject with which I am called upon to deal is the Tariff. I am not in a position to submit proposals for an amendment of the Tariff with my Budget statement. HadI beeni able to do so, it would have been most desirable, because I should then have been in a position to indicate the financial effects of the proposals. Up to the present time, only the operation of the excise duties has been reported upon by the Tariff Commission, and considered by the Government. It is impossible for me to announce the * probable effect of any proposed duties until more reports have been received from the Commission embodying their recommendations in regard to Customs, and until their general effect upon the revenue has been ascertained. I should like to point out no doubt it has occurred to honourable members-that any proposals for an amendment of the Tariff must take effect immediately they are submitted. That being so, their consideration will require to be proceeded with, without delay, until the final decision has been arrived at. That is a very important point, which honourable members should thoroughly weigh. In dealing with Tariff reform, we ought not to commence the consideration of any proposals we cannot finish.

I are continued after the period during which mentioned that in Enel-ind the demand for they were intended to apply, and in most cotton is increasing. The figures for last they are increased. the same, whether it be a bounty or a progation of Mr Chamberlain and some of tective duty. In 1789, when Madison in his followers, the cotton industry there is troduced his first Tariff, and placed a duty of 7^ per cent, on cotton in order to stimulate the industry, he said that it was to be imposed for only a few years, and that the industry, being once established,-could continue without adventitious aid. But the duty was increased to 35 per cent, in 1812. Cotton is one of the lines which, under this Bill, is to be stimulated into productivity in Australia by means of a bounty. I may also point to the experience of Canada. AlthoughI do not wish fo specify the articles' in respect of which the bounties were given, we know that the original policy, both with regard to period and amount, was never adhered to. Some of the commodities that are to be the subjects of bounty under this Bill have already had the bounty system applied to them in Australia. I think that fifteen or twenty years ago Queensland granted a bounty to stimulate the cotton industry. In 1892 some 700 or 800 acres there were under cotton, and produced over 200,000 lbs. of ginned cotton. According to recent information, the industry has not progressed.

What we want to do is to get a reputation for coffee, and that will depend upon its quality. The offer of this bounty -which , if it does anything, may perhaps draw into the industry a few small men, who generally fail-is not likely to lead to a very great stimulus in production. On many lines we ha.ve had bounties in operation in the States. for instance, there was a bounty on the production of olive oil. unequal bounties are when I mention that practicallv that bountv was drawn by one or two men. I think that one man derived the principal advantage from it.

A bounty on cotton production' would amount to absolutely no stimulus in the Northern Territory, where the plant grows wild and in abundancestatement was that some of the States would not participate, and my replv was that in South Australia almost all of these articles could be produced. statement of the Minister. But I repeat that the bounty would be availed of largely, if not exclusively, by New South Wales and Queensland. Certainly, the articles mentioned by the honourable member are produced at the present time. be produced in the Northern Territory. don, the conditions under which they are to receive the bounty are not existent in the Northern Territory. It is of no use to offer a bounty of cotton in places where it could not be produced by white labour. The honourable gentleman offers a bounty with one hand, and practically takes it away with the other. Within the settled district's of Australia, so far as bounties are likely to be effective, they would operate chiefly in Queensland and parts of New South ""Wales. The reports say that cotton can be produced here; but, leaving out the Northern Territory, I have not seen in a report a reference to any other part of Australia where the cotten industry is likelv to be successful. We have had from the Treasurer to-day figures showing that in bounties on sugar production alone Queensland and New South Wales have received, in the last five years, over .£700,000, and that there has been an average shrinkage of ,£100,000 a year from imrjort duties on sugar. So that, in connection with the sugar industry, those States have received a subvention of over £1,200,000; and the operation of this Bill will be, although in a comparatively small way, in further aid of industries in those territories. I am not seeking to draw any distinction between the States. WhatI submit is that bounties ought to be given in respect of such commodities as are likely to be produced over a fairly wide area of the States, or, at all events, be applied to commodities the production of which would not be confined to one or two States. Because, so far as production was likely to be confined to one or two States,, those States could produce the article unaided. This is an Australian policy, or it is nothing. Buti f a bounty on the production of commoditieswhich are almost peculiar to a State be desired, then that State, with the consent of the Commonwealth, has the power to make the necessary provision. The duty rests upon the Stales to stimulate certain classes of production. Talking of the probability of the success of bounties, I said in the beginning that in manv cases they have failed. I remember reading in the report of the Tobacco Commission that the bounties given in the State of Victoria for the production of tobacco had failed. The amount was, I think, 3d. per lb.; and 1 for reasons which one may or may not accept, given in the Commission's report, and for causes which are also explained in Coghlan and other authorities, the bounties were not a success. That, at all events, suggests that we should be cautious before for the production launching out on a system of bounties, the extension of which is almost certain to be demanded. bacco industry in Victoria. events, bounties could not keep it alive, and we cannot afford to forfeit excise for the sake of bounties on tobacco. I do not quite understand the scope of this Bill. The Minister of Trade and Customs mentioned, and' clause 3 describes, what bounties shall be given in respect, of the goodswhich the Minister is to find to be "" of a merchantable quality."" This is one of those' Bills which prescribes a number of duties that necessitate the Minister being an expert. Under clauses 5 and 7, for instance-and in the latter clause, although the Governor General is mentioned, the Minister is meant-the Minister is to docertain things. He is to find what is the standard rate of wages in a particular industry. Paragraph b of clause 7 prescribesthat he is to determine the market value of certain commodities, All that I can say is, that if the Minister efficaciously discharges the duties imposed on him by the Bill, he must become an expert. Then thebounty is to be given to' a number of persons. It is to be given to the grower or producer of the goods in question ; but we also find in clause 4 that the owner, occupier, or lessee of any land or factory in which the goods were pr^uced.",70,Bounties Bill Second Reading

99,Mr Glynn,"Perhaps so. But, at allor in which they may 'have gone for any process of manufacture, shall be deemed to be a producer. If the bounty is .to be given to the grower or the producer, and also to all the persons mentioned in clause 4, who are also to be regarded as producers, it seems to me that the amount which each of them will get must be very small. Some portion of it will go to persons who have absolutely nothing to do with the production of the commodities. There seems to be something wrong, either in the draftsmanship or in the policy of this Bill. Surely the,lessee of land as well as the owner ought not to share in the bounty. The lessee may be the producer or he may not. The owner may be the producer or he may not. But you cannot have both the owner and the lessee as producers of a particular commodity-excep t under the definition of this Bill. We ought to be careful before we consent to the system proposed. with any benefit to the genuine producer on whose behalf the Minister professes to be so solicitous, and its benefits will be less than the producer had a right to expect, after reading the platform generalizations of the Prime Minister as to what he was going to do for the agricultural industry. The Bill and the policy which it represents are not likely to lead to that extended production throughout Australia which we have been led to expect, and if the farmers have any such hopes, they are likely to be falsified. [5.44] -On Friday last the Minister of Trade and Customs promised that before this Bill was proceeded with he would make available for honourable members certain documents from which he quoted. There was a clear and definite statement on that point. The Minister made that the excuse for shortening his remarks, and certainly for shortening his quotations. Why has not that information been made available? propose to have the information printed and distributed amongst honourable members,"" but he did not say that that would be done 1 before the debate was proceeded with. distinct understanding that this Bill would not be proceeded with until the documents were printed. there was a definite promise, but there was an understanding that before we got into Committee the information should be available. ister went on to-promise that there should be every speed in the printing of the documents. the Budget papers had to be printed first. This is really a Committee Bill, and we will not ask honourable members to go into Committee upon it before the documents have been distributed. afraid that I shall have to proceed. My recollection does not accord with that of the Prime Minister. However, we are accustomed to__that; and we are also accustomed to the constant absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs when he has business before this Chamber. It is about time that some protest was made against It is not likely to be attended the. absence of the Minister so constantly when he has important Bills before the House. important business in Sydney. has a great deal of important businessprincipally in connection with his electorate. The Prime Minister need not apologize for the absence of his colleague, because we know quite well where he is. He is doing what we should all like' to be doing, and for the same reason. He is electioneering, and he is doing that persistently; but I submit that whan a Minister brings down important proposals to this House, such as the Minister of Trade and Customs has done in connection with the Anti-Trust Bill and this Bounty Bill, he ought to be here to see those measures through. He ought to be here until our business upon them is completed. But we find this honourable gentleman throwing Bills down on the table of the House, reading some statements in support of them., which very often he does not understand-and when asked for information he cannot give it. For instance, when discussing the growth of cotton the other day the Minister quoted some figures, and when interrogated by the honourable member for North Svdney as to whether he was referring to raw cotton, or otherwise, he had not the slightest idea. He could not tell us whether he was speaking of raw cotton or any other kind of cotton. Honourable members, who would have",71,Bounties Bill Second Reading

Sydney) [6.0] I am very much astonished at the attitude taken up by Ministers. The Minister of Trade and Customs decidedly left the impression on honourable members' minds that he would provide the information on which he had based the Bill, so that we might discuss it, not at one stage, but at every stage. the want of a quorum. \Quotum formed.} interrupted by the call for a quorum, I was saying that it was distinctly understood by honourable members on this side that the figures which the Minister of Trade and * Customs did not put forward in full, but merely alluded to as his ground for introducing a measure of this character, would be placed in the -hands of honourable members before they were called upon to continue the debate. Had it not been for that understanding. I am sure honourable members in all parts of the House would have insisted on the Minister giving the figures in full. The Minister said that the figures contained important information which it had taken twelve months to gather, and which had induced him to introduce the Bill. Not only so, but it was suggested by honourable members on this side that, in order that the information might be available in time, it should not be handed to Hansard, but should be printed as a separate document. We now find ourselves called upon to discuss the B ill ; and to that I should not have objected in the least had the promise been fulfilled. We are asked to resume the debate without the information which is the basis of the measure, and which the Minister promised to supply. I cannot believe that if the Minister were here, he, knowing what took place on Fridav, would not recognise the position at once. It cannot be said to be the fault of honourable members that delay has taken place in the printing of the documents. So much was I satisfied with the Minister's nromise. that, like the denuty-leader of the. Oopositiori, I have waited for the information before coming to any conclusion on the Bill. At the present moment, not only have we not the necessary information, but we have not our ownfiguresprepared, because we have been waiting for what the Minister had to place before us, naturally anticipating that he would have figures from the best source to enable us to consider a measure of the kind. I hope that the Prime Minister, in the absence ot the Minister of Trade and Customs, will see the desirability of carrying out the understanding arrived at, and not insist on a second reading debate in which, while considering the necessity for the Bill, we have to deal, not with its details, but with its methods. measure. merely with the principle of bonuses; because, whether an honourable member is, or is not, in favour of bounties or bonuses as a principle, he must consider whether the Bill proposed deals with items that require a bounty-whic h will most benefit by a bounty-o r whether there are included items which are not deserving, or which should come second when such a question is being considered. That is the information we anticipated obtaining from the figures referred to by the Minister. It looks to me like taking advantage of honourable members to promise such figures and then fail to supply them. Had the Minister not made that Dromise we should doubtless have required the figures to be quoted, in order to satisfv us as to the desirability or otherwise of the Bill. I am prepared to resume the debate in a sort of way without the figures, but I am sure every honourable member will admit that, with the information available, he would be in a much better position to consider the question. a moment, without interfering in any way with the right of the honourable member for North Sydney to speak further, I should like to say that, although personally I heard my honourable colleague during the greater part of his speech, I did not hear the undertaking mentioned. But since honourable members press themeaning they attached to the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I suggest that, as the next measure to be proceeded with is not immediately available, vou, sir, under the extraordinary circumstances of to-day, might see your way, with the consent of the House, to leave the chair,",72,Bounties Bill Second Reading

In this measure Parliament is asked to further exercise the powers which it possesses under section 51 of the Constitution to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect todesigns and trade marks. This Bill is really one of a number of measures dealing with tlie subiects referred to in that sub-section of the Constitution. We have already passed laws dealing with copyright, patents of invention, and trade marks. maining under the sub-section which we have not vet exercised is that relating to designs. The Bill is rather urgent, because certain practical difficulties have arisen in connection with the operation of the other measures to which I have referred which necessitate the passing as soon as possible of a law dealing with this branch of the subject. A Convention between several leading European countries was signed at Paris on the 20th March. 188-?, and in the following year Great Britain gave her assent to it. Article2 of this International Convention providesThe subjects or citizens of each of the Contracting States shall in all the other States of the Union as regards patents, industrial designs' or models, trade marks, and trade names, enjoy the advantages that their respective laws now grant or shall hereafter grant to their own subjects or citizens. Consequently they shall have the same protection as the latter, and the same legal remedy against any infringement of their rights, provided they observe the formalities and conditions imposed on subjects or citizens by the internal legislation of each State. Of course, it is our desire that in the matters of patents and industrial designs our people shall enjoy the benefit of this international agreement, but in order that they may do so, it is necessary that we should legislate upon all of these subjects. The House is accordingly asked now to give its assent to this Bill, which has alreadv been passed by the Senate. passed Designs Acts already ? by the Convention? as a Commonwealth Parliament we have dealtso far only with patents, trade marks, and copyright, and in order to get the benefit of the Convention, it is necessary that we should exercise our power to deal with this other branch of the subject as well. propose to differentiate between a trade mark and a design? only for the ornamentation of goods, and may have reference to the particular configuration of an article.

On the issue by the Governor General of a proclamation in pursuance of this Bill, the administration of the existing States Acts will be transferred to the Commonwealth. As a result, whatever executive powers are now possessed by the Governors of the respective States under the States Acts will then be exercisable by the Governor General or the Governor General in Council of the Commonwealth. All the records, registers, and so on kept in the various States under the States Act will pass over to and become the property of the Commonwealth. Under clause 6, it is provided that, after the proclamation, there shall be no further registration under the States laws, and subject to a saving of the rights under existing States Act, the administration will proceed on the principles laid down in this measure. Imperial Act? based on the English Act. The English law on the subject is to be found in the Trade Marks Act of 1883 and amending Acts of 1888. This Bill embodies the principles of the English law, and applies the machinery we have already adopted in connection with the which I have referred to meet the circumstances of the Commonwealth. The administration of the law will be in the hands of fhe Minister of Trade and Customs. It isi provided that there shall be a Registrar, but it is not intended to create any new office. The administration of this Bill will be in' the hands of the present Commissioner of Patents, and there will therefore be no increased cost in that respect as the result of passing this measure. There is power given in the Bill to appoint deputy registrars, the intention being that if it should be found necessary in any of the States, there may be such an officer appointed for the purposes of this Bill. trars will keep up the records. In the States offices they do not keep up the records in connection with patents. That is a very important matter. ministration. It is intended under this measure to establish a Designs Office at the Seat of Government. Following the lines of other legislation upon kindred matters,, there is to be a sub-office in each State, and a seal of the Designs Office. The Bill deals with, copyright in designs, and its machinery is intended to protect such copyright. In clause 4 it is provided that ""design""means an industrial design applicable, in any way or by any, means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, ofan article, or to any two or more of those purposes, while "" article"" means "" any article or substance."" What is protected is the copyright in a design as distinct from the article to which a design is applied. Under the English law, the protection of designs covered originally only designs applied to certain classes of fabrics, such as cotton; but it was afterwards extended to designs applied to other articles, and now relates to all designs applied to articles of manufacture. The design is distinct from the article to which it is applied. For instance, the pattern printed uppn cotton goods is something apart from the goods themselves, being the result of an effort to produce something to take the fancy and capture the taste of the public. In some instances, the design is the configuration or shape of the article to which it is applied. For instance, a design of the shape of a lamp shade has been held in a leading case on the subject to be protected. between copyright in such a design and a trade mark? a mark or a word used to indicate that the article to which it is applied is the manufacture or production of a particular person or firm, and carries with it a certain reputation.

Clause5 provides thatA design shall be deemed to be applied to aa article when(a) the article is made from or in accordance with the design; 01 (b) the design is applied, in any way or by any means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of the article, or to any two or more of those purposes.

Then the Bill setsout the procedure to be followed in the registration of designs"". Clause 19 provides that, after an application for registration has been lodged, the design may be published and used without prejudice.

I have told honourable members exactly what the amendment is intended to do, and I hope they will support me. Let them prove their bona fides in this direction--le t them say that, in the event of the Commonwealth failing eventually to construct the line, Western Australia or Western Australia and South Australia combined should refund the expenses of the survey, and I shall have no further objection to the passing of the measure. I give honourable members this opportunity, and I can see that the honourable member for Gray is coming over to my view. While I am dealing with this subject, I should like to point to yet another peculiarity, which makes my amendment still more valuable. Those who have read the reports on this proposal know that there will probably be some difficulty in inducing South Australia to agree to the route advocated by some Commonwealth engineers, and which would possibly be advocated by this House. It is obvious that if a deadlock ensued owing to South Australia's tyrannical objection, the Commonwealth would have absolutely sacrificed the expenditure of £20,000, which we are now asked to authorize. In these circumstances, the Committee, as a business body, must see that, before this clause is passed, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are safeguarded to the extent I have proposed.

It has often been said that the proposal for the construction of the railway is put forward in the national cause, hope that the Government will give attenand is not submitted from any selfish, narrow, or provincial feeling on the part of South Australia or Western Australia. Therefore I confess I anticipate no objection whatever from the Western Australian representatives to this amendment.

Havjumped up by half-a-million pounds a ing accepted it in principle, they cannot' reasonably object to that principle being inserted in this measure.

That is a characteristic which is as inherent in the Victorian as in the Western Australian miner. It is human nature the world over. But that is no justification for Parliament committing itself without due consideration. I hope that the Government will safeguard the position by requiring thei two States concerned to give us some assurance of their bona fides. That they can do by transferring the land abutting on the proposed line to the control of, the Commonwealth. It may be that the land is not of great value now, but if, the line is constructed, it will have a value; and we should have some guarantee, because the estimates which we now have show that there will be a considerable The first thing required is the assent of the two States which are cliieflv interested in this proposal to the construction of the line. The assent of Western Australia is not in question, but we know from the correspondence which has taken place between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia that the latter State will not assent to the construction of the line, even at the expense of the Commonwealth, unless a particular route be followed. Assuming, therefore, that a survey, -be made of another route, which does not meet with the approval of South Australia, what will be the result? The money expended upon the survey will have been practically wasted. That is a further reason why the Government should have some assurance from these States that the Commonwealth, will be safeguarded if the railwav be constructed. If they declined! to vest in the Commonwealth an area of 25 miles, upon each side of the line, perhaps they might be willing to grant to the Commonwealth alternate blocks. At anv rate, it would be an evidence of the belief of South Australia and Western Australia that the undertaking would eventually prove to be a profitable one. In short, it would be a guarantee of their good faith. I feel, however, that, rightly or wrongly, the Government intend to undertake this survey. I realize that it is almost useless to appeal to them not to do so. I do hope, however, that, The gold-fields people in their saner moments, they will-befor e the Bill is finally disposed of-tak e into consideration the view which I have presented.

Minister has told us of the enormous sacri J (ices which the people of Western Australia are prepared to make in this matter, but he concludled by saying that they are not prepared to put their undertaking into writing in the terms of my amendment. The honourable and learned gentleman has greatly over-estimated the extraordinary nature of the surrender proposed by Western Australia in this regard. This line will pass through 450 miles of Western Australian territory; that, multiplied by fifty miles, will give an area of 14,400,000 acres. up at the maximum rental obtained' in the West for similar country, it would yield a revenue of only £7,200 per annum. The experts intrusted with the matter by the Commonwealth have estimated that the deficit to be expected from this line, arising from the excess of working expenses and interest charges over gross revenue, will amount to £70,000 per annum. Therefore, the great sacrifice which Western Australia is prepared to make, and which the Minister thinks should be sufficient to induce us, as the trustees of the taxsome' proposition of a similar nature. I payers of the Commonwealth, to withdraw all other objections to the proposal, is a sacrifice equal only to one-tenth of the actual annual loss which the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to bear in connection with the running of the line. sacrifice the rental value. They say only that they will not alienate this land until such time as the line is made when the value of it will possibly be enhanced. they would act up to the spirit behind the offer made, but I admit that, as the honourable member for Moira points out. there is no guarantee that they will allow the Commonwealth to secure the advantage of any enhanced value given to this land by the construction of the line. The Treasurer, whose presence I welcome, has on some. occasions expressed profound distrust of the methods proposed by certain sections of Australian political parties. gentleman follow the honourable member? better to do. » settlement proposals. Here we have an opportunity to start afresh. If the amendment is accepted, no graduated land tax will ever be necessary in connection with the area involved, because we shall retain the enhanced value given to this land by the construction of the line. The Commonwealth is being pledged to an expenditure of nearly £5,000,000, and it is only reasonable that we should ask for some guarantee in return. The Minister is not prepared to give any guarantee. He is a representative of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and not merely of Western Australia, who are no doubt anxious, if they can, to get some one else to bear their If all this land were taken burden; and yet he has absolutely refused to agree to insert a simple provision of this character. He informs honourable members that it is entirely foreig.ni to the measure.. If it is, the blot is upon the measure itself, because the more safeguards we have the better in dealing with a measure of this kind. I regret that it has been necessary for me to rise again to urge upon the Minister the advisability of accepting my amendment. I feel sure that if the honourable and learned gentleman will not accept this amendment he will accept hope that honourable members will help me to divide the Committee on the amendment, and to see that every possible safeguard shall be provided for.

280,Sir Tohn Forrest,"Sometimes an offihope that the Treasurer will bear with me while 1 endeavour to carry out a promise I made to the honourable member for Lang to move an amendment to the proposed new section 36c. The object of the amendment is to bring about a healthy state of financing, by which the House will know definitely for what purpose it is voting money. In his report for the year ending 30th June, 10-05, the Auditor-General saysA number of repayments and recoveries of the same purpose, and may not be aware amounts, included in the expenditure of previous that a portion of the money has been unyears, and amounting in the aggregate to about expended. In that way, the Auditor-Gen.£2,000, were made during the year 1904-5. The Treasury departed from the practice hitherto in eral points out, votes may be obtained pracforce of crediting these receipts to revenue, and tically without the authority of Parliament. placed them to the credit of the then current votes corresponding to those of previous years. This alteration of practice amounted. to an appropriation in aid of votes, or in reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority, and upon exception being taken, the Secretary to the Treasury advised that an amendment of the Audit Act would be sought to authorize such credits. Undoubtedly the object which is sought to be attained by this Bill is to authorize such credits. The Auditor-General, who is an independent arbiter in these matters, has said that the alteration of the practice virtually amounts to an appropriation in aid of votes, or Ln, reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority. I think that the Committee should be extremely careful before it takes a step of that kind. The honourable member for Lang, who unfortunately is unable to be here to-day, has asked me to move an amendment. The Bill has been, reached so unexpected Iv to-night that I have not had an opportunity to look through his voluminous notes, but I commend the amendment, which is in print, to the attention of the Committee, especially the Treasurer, who, I have no doubt, will be able to accept it. Clause 8. In proposed new section 36c, omit all the words after the word ""closed,"" with a view to the insertion of the following in place thereof : "" shall be crediterl to revenue on account of appropriation of former years. Provided, however, that any amounts credited to expenditure during the financial vear mo;-6 may, with the consent of the Treasurer, after favorable report from the Auditor-General, be allowed -to remain in credit. The effect of the adoption of this amendment would be to compel unexpended sums in any one year to be re-credited to revenue, except in cases in which the Auditor-General would permit their expenditure in the ensuing year. Under the scheme to be legalized in this Bill this vear we mav vote £ 1 , 0 0 0 for the carrying out of a particular work. Only ,£200 may be expended this year. It may be that the work is a new post-office, and that it is discovered that £ 1 , 0 0 0 is more than sufficient. But, although £ 8 0 0 remains unexpended, the Government may next year come down with ""an item on the Estimates of £ 1 , 0 0 0. Members of Parliament may then overlook the fact that a previous vote of a similar amount has been made for ways show re-votes. balances in one year can be used in tlie next. I am not at all sure that an unexpended balance could not be used for an entirely different purpose. It is an important point, and one which I hope the Treasurer will be able to meet. The matter in question is not an important one, but there is a little confusion in regard to payments towards the end of the year as to which it is impossible to get in the accounts in time. A case in point would be wbere a State-say , Victoriapays a sum of money for the purpose of mails to New Zealand. Perhaps a good deal of that money should be paid by New South Wales. A credit is given on account of New South Wales, which would lessen the expenditure of Victoriai f it were received iDefore the close of the financial vear. Buti f it is not received before such close, Victoria is charged with the whole expenditure, and afterwards gets a payment from New South Wales as revenue. It is as follows:Therebv the expenditure and revenue account is fictitiously enhanced. The difficulty could only appear at the end of the vear, when it is impossible to get in accounts in time to credit expenditure properly. As the balances are arranged at the end of every month, it is convenient, in order that the revenue and expenditure may not be fictitiously increased to have a provision whereby payments from the other States mav be taken in reduction of similar servicas for the ensuing vear. The difficulty has been found to be troublesome. The provision is not a very important one, but I think that what it attempts to do is reasonable. ,",89,Forrest We Shall Get A Audit Bill
