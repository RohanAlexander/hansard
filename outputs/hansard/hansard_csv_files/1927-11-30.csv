I now inform the honourable member that it is probable that owing to pressure of work at the Government Printing Office, the publication of this report will be delayed until early next year. Yesterday the honorahle member for Capricornia ( Mr Eorde) asked the following questions of the honourable member representing the Minister for Defence1. What was the date of the first representation made to his department by the honourable member for Capricornia for the establishment of an aerodrome at Rockhampton ? 2. What was the estimated cost of establishing the aerodrome? 3. Why was it not established? 4. In view of the large sum of money made available for civil aviation during the current year, and in view of the growing importance of Central Queensland in civil aviation, will he reconsider his decision and make a special, effort to have a suitable aerodrome established at Rockhampton in order to give the desired encouragement to civil aviation in that district? I a m now in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h t h e tion :f o l l o w in g replies:1. 29th November, 1924. 2. The site, which is now considered to be most suitable for the purpose of an aerodrome is estimated to cost £1,000 for purchase. The clearing and levelling of the area would cost an additional £600. 3. It has been the policy to concentrate activities upon certain approved aerial routes none of which embraces Rockhampton. 4. The proposed increased grant to civil aviation is to be spent primarily in the development of certain aerial routes, but the Government w ill give sympathetic consideralocated at Brisbane, tion to any request for reasonable financial assistance towards the cost of establishing an aerodrome at Rockhampton in collaboration with the local authorities.

The assessable income of any person shall includeGeneral) [11.26] -The purpose of this clause is to amend section 16 of the principal act, in order to remove by the judgment given this year by the H i g h Courti n the Weatherly case. Section 17 relates to what are known as walk-in and walk-out sales, and provides that a profit made by the sale of trading stock or live stock in a walk-in, walk-out transaction shall be taken into account for income tax purposes, as is quite proper. Breeding stock, however, were regarded as capital assets, and the proceeds of the sale of them were not to be included for income tax purposes. The section was intended to cover only walkin walk-out sales, but the H i g h Court held that it had a general application. Sub-section 1 of section 17 upon which the H i g h Court delivered its judgment, reads :-The proceeds derived from the sale of the whole or part of the trading stock of any business after the thirtieth day of June One thousand nine hundred and twenty-one (whether on the sale of a business as a going concern or in any other manner for the purpose of discontinuing the business) shall be assessable income. It was intended by Parliament that the words in parenthesis should impose' a limitation, but the H i g h Court held that they were not words of limitation, and that the section meant that the proceeds derived from any sale of live stock or trading stock should be assessable income, and that the exemption in favour of breeding stock should be allowed in connection w i th every sale. In the Weatherly case portion of the land on which a pastoral business was carried oa had been sold, and the proceeds of the sale of breeding stock were held to be exempt from income taxation. That was not the intention of Parliament, and the purpose of this clause is to make the intention clear. Perhapsi t is desirable that I should state what are the proposed amendments. Clause9 proposes to repeal section 16, which defines assessable income, and to substitute provisions which honourable members w ill find on page 4 of the bill. It is now proposed to add the following paragraph:""and (/(.) in the case of any person who sells or otherwise disposes of to another person (otherwise and by way of testamentary disposition) (o) either as a whole or in separate parts, the a flaw that was revealed whole of the assets of a business carried on by him for the purposes of putting an end to the whole of his business; or (&) part of the assets of his busiuess, for the pur* pose of putting an end to a part of his business. . . . The first amendment which I shall ask the committee to make is to leave out the words "" whole of h is "" in paragraph a. The provision w ill then apply in the case of a person who sells either the whole or any part of a business carried on by him for the purpose of putting an end to the business. This legislation is prin cipally of importance to those engaged in the pastoral industry, but it w ill apply also to other avocations. If this amendment is accepted by the committee the provision w ill then apply to a pastoralist who owns stations in , say, Queensland and Victoria, and desires to sell his Queensland property.

There is also involved the task of computing the value of the wool on the back of the breeding sheep. At the present time, without the innovation of the new system of separating the wool from the sheep, the purchaser is able to protect himself as to price, and so forth, because the wool on the sheep that he purchases passes with the sheep into his year of accounting, and he thus makes his assessment of the value of the sheep, knowing that he will have to account for the wool, which may be quarter, half, or say threequarter wool. The vendor is asked to account, in some instances, for the wool in the taxable period,-plus portion of the new clip that passes on to a second person, where the vendor has incurred some of the costs of production in the second period.

If he purchases sheep in the wool, the price he I think that the pays for them must necessarily include Later, when he shears the sheep and sells the clip, he pays income tax upon the proceeds. Surely, in that case, he is entitled to some deduction for what he paid for the wool. That is the whole point. If a person buys stock from a wholesale merchant, and sells it, he must take it into account at the price paid for it.

A capital, because it is not heeding stock. In the case of a clearing sale, only breeding stock is regarded as capital. I could understand this exception being made in respect of stud stock, but not in the case of ordinary ewes which are kept largely for their wool. Ewes are kept both for breeding purposes and for their wool. asset as is the ewe, but because of the fine distinction made, revenue is lost. I do not strongly object to that. The honourable member for Wannon, however, goes further, and says, that if a flock of ewes is sold at the winding up of a business, no account should be taken of the wool on their backs. if the sale was not effected those ewes would be shorn, probably the next month, and on the clip obtained from them the owner would have to pay income tax. The hoiaorable member cannot have it both ways. We cannot allow a purchaser of stock to deduct the price he pays for the wool on the backs of the sheep, and also, when he sells those sheep later get an exemption from taxation for the wool on the backs of breeding stock. that. a pastoralist was selling out. If , at the facie, it is not an income-producing beginning of an accounting period, he took his sheep into account at a certain value, the wool which they had grown while in his possession, would add to their that in a walk-in and walk-out sale no value no matter to what extent it had grown. If the sheep are in the wool in each case, there will be no income tax payable on the increased value of the sheep. Buti f a man buys sheep soon after they have been shorn> and keeps them, he should pay tax on the value of the wool obtained from them. The purchaser is protected; but a man who buys sheep at a fairly low price because there is no wool ori them, and after a period of Income Tax [30 NOVEI JER, 1927.] Assessment BiU. 2285 six months sells them in the wool, and receives an entire exemption from taxation because they are breeding stock, is obtaining a benefit. If he retains them a little longer, and shears them, he will have to pay income tax on the price wether cannot be treated as received for the wool. The principle underlying the department's suggestion that the purchaser shall be allowed to deduct from the price obtained for the sheep, the value of the wool on their backs insists that in the case of a clearing sale the two things must be separated. reasoning of the honourable member for The wether is as much an Yarra( Mr Scullin) is sound; but I should like the Attorney-General to say why his proposal applies only to walk-inwalk-out sales and compulsory sales. Th.? necessity of assessing the wool, as distinct from the breeding ewes, should apply to every sale. I point out that General) [12.15] -Specia l provision for walk-in walk-out sales is necessary, because it is arguable whether in the absence of similar provision the proceeds of such sales are income at all. In the case of other sales, the ordinary provision as to sales applies; the clip from the whole flock, including the breeding stock, is taken into account. Unless there was a special provision dealing with at a clearing sale, to walk-in-walk-out sales, the court might hold that taxation should not be imposed upon any moneys resulting from the sale of a business as distinct from the carrying on of a business. Inconie is earned in the carrying on of a business. If a man sells his business, then, prima operation; it is a realization of assets. At least, it includes the sale of capital assets. It was held in the High Court income tax was payable in respect of the year in which the sale occurred, although, of course, what was sold included the annual produce. Therefore, it is provided that after a walk-in-walkout sale the proceeds from ordinary trading stock or live-stock shall be taxed; but a distinction is drawn between capital assets and other assets.

It is thought proper that, when trading stock of any description, whether sheep or the stock-in-trade of an ironmonger or any other trader is sold for the purpose of putting an end to a business, the proceeds should be regarded as income; but an endeavour is made in this clause to distinguish between sales of capital assets, such as breeding stock, and other sales, and to provide that any profit on the sale of capital assets shall not be regarded as income. This clause is based upon the view that the proceeds of the sale of wool growing on breeding stook is in the nature of income. seems to me that, in a walk-in and walkout sale, not only the sheep but also the wool on the sheep's back is part of a pastoralist's capital assets. I cannot conare simply the despair of the man on the ceive of separating the wool from the sheep, because, on the average, the wool on the sheep would represent 40 per cent, of the value of the animal, if it were in f u ll wool. Purchasing a sheep is like buying a store and paying, say, £1,000 for the building, and £500 for the stock that is in it. It would be necessary for the seller to clebit his wool account 40 per cent., and credit his sheep account by that amount, in order to keep his accounts in perfect order and see that he was taxed in an equitable manner. If in a walk-in and walk-out sale, a man sells his sheep in full wool, he disposes of part of his capital assets. If he realizes on the wool, provement on the bill as originally he gets a return for it while he is in business; but when he sells his sheep he sells the sheep and wool. Therefore, I say unhesitatingly that he sells part of his capital assets. [12.20] I have with interest heard of the purchaser to be declared upon making the learned discussion on this matter, and his return, for all purposes in connection with I cannot help wondering what the ordithe assessment of the income derived by the nary breeder of sheep would have made purchaser, of it if he had been listening. A number of honourable members know something about We all know that, in walk-in-walk-out sheep, and I do not think that even they out sales, it is customary for different are too sure of the effect of the provisions values to be placed upon. the land with, under consideration. It .seems to me that of course, the buildings, and also the provision at the end of clause 9 is separately upon the stock. I remember proposed to be inserted in the act merely with the object of seeing that, in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller shall not escape paying a certain amount of income tax, which may easily be a negligible sum. That principle is carried into the next clause, which makes a distinction in detail as between wool and sheep. I should like the Attorney-General to make it clear whether this distinction is the result of definite recommendations to the Government by any authorized and reliable body of pastoralists, graziers, or sheep-breeders. If it is not, I am opposed to it. If there is reputable authority for considering that the provisions are workable, and that any authorized body of sheep breeders supports them, I shall be prepared to consider them. But, otherwise, it seems to me, after listening to what has been said, and after reading the clause myself, that they are highly legal provisions, which land. Goodness knows, he has to make enough returns already. He has to declare the-number of fruit trees growing on his property, and I am not sure that he has not to estimate the number of eggs that his fowls will probably lay .in the next year! Men. at sales in the country know little of legal details. Their business is simply to buy or sell stock. It seems most unwise to pass any law the effect of which we are not quite certain, and which may embarrass them. I must say that, on the whole, I think that the amendment suggested by the Attorney-General is an imdrafted. Clause 10 provides for the repeal of section 17 of the principal act and the insertion of a new section.

The point is that the agreement had to be made at the time.

But I put it to the Government that the existing provision is good enough. It is better to leave the law as it stands than bring about some difficult legal position, which is not understood even by honourable members. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [12.25] -This is a most important matter. In the first place %ve must appreciate the distinction between breeding stock and the wool upon their backs. Following up the argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) as to whether breeding stock should be regarded as a capital asset, I point out that it has been the practice for some time to adopt that view, and exempt the proceeds of their sale from income taxation. Breeding stock has been taken as part of the capital assets of the pastoralist, in the same way as machinery is regarded as among the capital assets of the manufacturer. But the position in regard to the wool is a very different one. ' In the event of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the value of the wool is taken into account, and it is treated as part of the ordinary trading profits of the pastoralist, income tax being charged upon the profit froni its sale. of a walk-in-walk-out sale, there is, possibly, ten months' wool on the sheep, and the wool would have been shorn very soon afterwards and brought to account. Obviously it is not part of the capital assets. I have had considerable discussion on this matter with the representatives of the pastoralists, who, I can assure honourable members, have taken all the points that could be raised to show that the capital assets consist of the sheep plus the wool. One of the points they make is that the wool is not physically detached from the animal that produces it, and that, therefore it still remains part of the capital asset. The Government cannot accept that view. We come then to the conwhat percentage of wool sideration of the position in regard to the wool. It may be said that it does not matter so long as somebody I am sure that the clause was pays tax upon it, and that the Government should not worry about it at a l l . ' The sale consists in the disposal of the capital asset plus part of the ordinarytrading asset, namely, the wool on the sheep, and this is sold to somebody else. If the way the pastoralists had to treat the wool was to bring it in as income ac the purchase value on the one side of their account, and bring into account the asset in the sheep on the other side, using the principle of the purchase price to determine the value on both sides, the revenue would receive that to which it was entitled with regard to that particular wool. Pastoralists are now allowed the option of bringing the sheep in when they are purchased in the wool on the one side, or of bringing the wool in at the sale price on the other side. They can separate the two. But if the suggestion now made were adopted in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller or somebody else would not have to account for the wool, witb the result that the revenue would lose the whole of the income tax due on the profits from tbe sale of the wool wbicb is clearly a trading asset tbe moment it is separated from the sheep. It is obvious that nobody would suggest that it is drawing.on the capital asset to separte the sheep from tbe wool. We bave had to accept tbe idea of separating tbe sheep and the wool in tbe case of a walk-in-walk-out sale. In A t the time that case it only applies to tbe vendor. The position of an ordinary purchaser in",26,Tabiff Board S Reports
94,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Minisa walk-in-walk-out sale presents no difficulty, for he can keep the sheep and the wool intact if he pleases until the end of the term or he can separate the two. The Government has had a full discussion of this matter witb. the pastoralists' representatives. honourable member for Boothby has asked whether representations have been made for the wool to be taken into account separately from tbe sheep in the case of the vendors. Tbe reverse is the position. The pastoralists' representatives bave naturally said: "" No ; certainly this should not be done,"" and they have tried to maintain that the sheep, plus the wool on it, is part of the capital asset. The vendor, or anybody else wbo is likely at any time to be interested in a walk-inwalk-out sale, would naturally maintain that the sheep plus tbe wool is part of the capital asset, and try to draw it in as such capital asset. I venture to say that it is only possible to substantiate the case that the sheep itseK and not the sheep plus the wool, is part of the capital asset. The Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition has asked how far we can allow breeding stock to be taken into account as the part of the capital asset, or, in other words, as part of the machinery of manufacture of tbe pastoralists. We have accepted the principle that breeding stock shall be so regarded; but we cannot .accept tbe suggestion that the sheep plus the wool in the case of sales on a walk-in-walk-out basis sball be taken as part of the capital asset. that all stock must already be accounted for in taxation returns at a specified value. Could not the amount for taxation in respect of the sale of such stock on a walk-in-walk-out basis be taken as the difference between the price realized at the sale and the valuation at which the stock appears in the departmental returns ? Government is firm upon is that it canlose heavily under enforced sale while in not allow the trading asset which bas the second eventuality the purchaser been added to the capital asset to be inwould benefit materially by a sudcluded in the capital asset, for that would den rise without having been debited bave the effect of adding the value of tbe with a material proportion of cost.. wool to tbe capital asset. There must be Immediately we depart from the fixed a statement separately as ' to the value of period of income and expenditure we the wool on tbe sheep. 1 feel that the two great principles involved in this issue have not been clearly followed by the committee. Tbe first point is that income tax is levied on the total amount of the income in a given Tbe period, less only part of the cost incurred in the same period in making it. The case I cited was clearly put. I instanced the case of a clip and a half, or a clip covering a period of one year and ten months, passing into tbe accounting period in respect of whicb tbe costs of only one year bad been taken into consideration. In sucb a case the vendor would be treated inequitably if he were allowed to deduct only the costs in respect of the twelve months period. The basic principle on which income tax bas always been imposed in this country is tbe calling into account of all income for a fixed period of twelve months and the deduction of the cost of raising the income over the full accounting period, without any overlapping. If this proposal is agreed to, a departure will have been made from that established principle. of sale would be allowed. If in tbe preceding year tbe clip was not sold, a greater amount would be allowable for expenses; so that the thing would balance itself. would not do so. If tbe income from the sale of wool or station property were as fixed as tbe salary of bonorable members it might be possible to apply this machinery to it with some equity; but under existing conditions that cannot be done. The great pastoral industry of Australia, as every one knows, is subject to many vicissitudes of climate and circumstance.

We bave deliberately said that tbe principle upon which the collection of our income taxation sball be based in respect of tbem is that there sball be a fixed term in wbich both income and expense shall be placed side by side. If we depart from this principle, as it is now proposed that we shall do in tbe case of walk-in walkout sales, we shall place ourselves in a most dimcult situation.

I cannot see any reason wby tbe taxing master sbould fear that the country will lose revenue by tbe continuation of its present practice. Tbe Attorney-General, and to a lesser extent tbe Prime Minister, in discussing this subject, expressed fears that losses of revenue would be sustained if this alteration were not made; but I cannot see wby that sbould be so.

He desires tbe concession to be given to the purchaser and at the same time not to. be taken away from the vendor. He cannot have it both ways. To me, tbe merits of the question are very clear.

If that is inconvenient, then the purchaser will not exercise that option, and will be in exactly the same position as be is in today. It is quite probable that the opportunity given under this clause will not be largely availed of. In days gone by, however, before the averaging of rates and other methods were adopted, the law inflicted a hardship, as I can show in the case of a client of mine. bought sheep heavy in lamb and in f u l l wool at 38s. 3d each. It was just before tbe nothing to do witb it. Tbe option allows end of the year, and be brought his return to me. I naturally put the stock in at tbe cost price, which allowed him, on account of baving other stock sales that year, to show a profit, and be was liable to income tax amounting to about £25. During the next year, after the return had gone in, the commissioner wrote to my client to the effect that he was liable to this tax; but, in order to give him an option to come under the lower provision, tbe commissioner pointed out that if my client liked to bring in the stock at the rate then fixed9s. or 12s -instea d of baving to pay £25 he would bave to pay nothing. I was away at tbe time, and my client, thinking that I had made a mistake, put his stock in at the lower price and paid no tax. During that year the sbeep bad lambed, and the natural increase was shown at 9s. in bis next return. TI e sbeep had also been shorn, and tbe wool showed a return of 12s. This made a return of 21s., but on account of tbe dry spell he sold the grown sbeep for 15s., bringing his gross return or credit to 36s. That meant that be bad made a loss of 2s. 3d. on each sbeep. In furnishing bis return for the second year be bad to start witb the sbeep at 9s -for wbich be bad paid 38s. 3d and his return was 36s. as shown, this meant he made a paper profit of 27s. His tax on that amounted to £111. He came to me and complained, and on inquiry I discovered what had happened. That clearly shows the value of the provision in the bill. If that man had been able to separate bis sheep and the wool, he would bave put his wool in"" at 12s. and sheep at 26s. wben be bought, and the subsequent difficulty would not have arisen. I might say that on representations being made to tbe commissioner tbe tax was reduced. There will be little need for this clause, because of the provisions in the acts of 1924 and 1926. If a purchaser were forced to separate his wool and sbeep there would be tremendous difficulty in accounting in some cases, especially if the sheep were bought a few months off shears; but there would be no difficulty when buying sheep in f u l l wool. HowThis man ever, there is no compulsion, the buyer can do as he likes. The seller has tbe purchaser time to consider what to do. Under this provision if a man buys sheep in the wool be will be able to get a proper debit for both wool and stock, and a proper credit for tbe stock at tbe end of tbe taxation period. When a man buys up to tbe middle of the year, say six months after shearing, he will not gain much advantage, because he will enter the sheep at the average value, whicb will include tbe price of the wool. There is then not much difference between the first price at which be buys and tbe price at wbich the sheep will be valued on his return. I suppose there is no use in attempting to do anything more than register my protest against this provision, seeing that the Opposition and tbe Government are in agreement. I do so because it is a dangerous practice to bring into account a partiallygrown crop of any description. I can foresee a great deal of trouble and disappointment ahead of primary producers.",30,Tabiff Board S Reports

Since this country, like every other, is invaded periodically by hordes of pests that attack the growing crops, it is not possible to pre-assess the value of a crop before it is actually harvested. To attempt to do so is to make trouble both for the contracting party and for the taxation department. Naturally, I expected opposition from tbe Deputy Leader of the Opposition to any measure wbicb would be for the good of the pastoralists of Ausance to the stupid charge wbich be made tralia. Never bas anything affecting tbe pastoral industry been before this House when the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition bas not taken tbe opportunity to assail tbe industry. Yet tbe pastoral industry might be said to-day to be tbe bright spot in the nation's finances. I think he has had some past experience of the ills endured by workmen under the old pastoral conditions; but he ought not to bring those forward at the present time. The pastoral industry is now providing some of the best conditions in Australia for the working man. To the extent which the principle is the same in this section of the bill as in the last, I am not going to blow hot and cold, and support tbe principle when it suits me, and to reject it when it does not. I do not think we sbould bave stepped over tbe border of a new year and anticipated the return to be derived from a growing clip especially when we cannot bring into account the corresponding costs which the taxpayer would have to bear.

I throw the lie back in his teeth. I regard the pastoral industry, and all the other industries of this country, as interwoven one witb another. I look upon wool-raising as one of tbe staple industries that will keep this country solvent. If the honourable gentleman was not obsessed with some strange illusion, he would not have given utterthis afternoon. This is a concession to tbe pastoralists to save them from being doubly taxed on their wool clips. I have given it my warm support because it is just, but I would not support any attempt, whether by pastoralists, agriculturists, joint stock companies, or private individuals, to avoid paying their just share of taxation. Wben taxation is evaded it always means that somebody else has to pay more. does not knoAv any instance-in whicb the existing system has worked an injustice. would be possible for it to do so. T pointed out to the bonorable member that this clause is a concession that bad to be balanced by the conditions in the previous clause. Whatever he might say about my attitude in regard to these clauses, it is absurd to say that this one will inflict any jflijury on tbe pastoralists, wben, as a matter of fact, it is specially designed to save tbem from being doubly taxed. It gives him the right to choose under whicb system he is to be assessed. It is evident from his remarks that the honourable member does not understand the clause. Amendment agreed to.

Haviug come to the conclusion that exemptions should be allowed in those two cases, we are now faced with the case of a company registered and controlled in Australia, which has shareholders who are resident outside Australia. ""We believe that if the other classes of absentee shareholders are to be exempt from taxation, the absentee shareholder in the Australian company should not be placed in Having decided to exempt shareholders of this type, Ave had to consider the position of persons Avho lent money to a company on debentures or on deposit.

Only a small percentage Avill be During this discussion many honourable members have indicated that their object is to take the maximum toll of people Avho are investing capital in this country. The Government, on the other hand, regards such investment as esseutial to the opening up of the country and the promotion of neAv industries. Avise. may appear that the exemption of certain capital from income taxation means a loss of revenue and a resultant heavier burden on the Australian taxpayer, that is not the ultimate effect, if a greater inflow of responsibility to find means of defeating capital is stimulated. Such money will be utilized for the establishment of indusnot, however, affect tbe fundamental fact tries and the creation of employment, and will cause a general increase in prosperity. benefit , to tbe country.

In the long run the actual effect Avould be to relieve the local ral increase-and tbe excess of births over taxpayer. also to locally provided capital? tralia is to develop at tbe rate Avhich its national circumstances demand, its capital requirements cannot be provided from tbe annual excess of income over expenditure. We must get money from abroad to accelerate development and tbe influx of neAv population. I agree that all monies employed in industry and creating neAV avenues of employment will be of great advantage in reducing tbe burden of taxation upon the people as a Avhole. But there is another angle from whicb to view this problem. Very often the question is asked, ""Why sbould foreign investors a worse position than they. take toll of Australia in the form of interest and dividends on the capital they have invested ?"" It is suggested that all the benefits that arise from such investments are reaped by the people outside Australia, and that we are entitled to recover from them as much as possible. Sight is lost of the fact that the great bulk of the money is employed in the creation of .new industries or tbe extension of existing ones; these Avill increase the Avages bill, and the money will circulate throughout tbe country to the benefit of all secutilized for tbe payment of interest or dividends to the foreign shareholder. Money sent into Australia from abroad is of benefit to the country, and not detrimental, as some short-sighted people seem to believe. ' We all feel considerable resentment against foreigners who trade in Australia, and by tbe manipulation of subsidiary companies appear not to earn any profits and so escape taxation. Tbese unscrupulous methods are applied nearly always in distributing businesses; it would be difficult to apply tbem in manufacturing and productive enterprises. If people do resort to these methods, it is clearly our their machinations. Cases of this kind do that tbe investment of new capital is of pared an estimate of tbe capital requirements of Australia. The figures disclosed that, if we could afford to be content with the present growth of population by natudeaths in Australia compares favourably with the natural increase in any otber country-and the corresponding expansion in trade, commerce, production, and industry, we sbould be able to provide out bf surplus wealth the whole of tbe capital",33,Tabiff Board S Reports

131,Mr Bruce,"Certainly ; but if Aus-we need. But, unfortunately, possessing an enormous continent and being faced witb the necessity for populating it and accelerating its development, we cannot be content with what in an older country would be considered a very satisfactory rate of progress. Consequently, baving regard to the inequalities that arise under the taxation law as between absentee shareholders in different classes of companies, the Government came to tbe conclusion that all should be placed on the same basis. decided to extend the concession to moneys lent by way of debentures or on deposit to companies. However, the discussion last night made clear a consensus of opinion in the committee against the action proposed by the Government in regard to shareholders. The committee apparently is not prepared to go so far as the Government j>roposcs in the direction of bringing absentee shareholders into line irrespective of the type of company in which they are interested. The Government accepts that decision. It would be unwise, therefore, to take the further step contemplated in regard to debenture interest. I do not reflect upon the views expressed by bonorable members, but I repeat that the basis of tbe Government's proposals was the necessity for attracting .capital into the country. This legislation appeared to the Cabinet to be one justifiable method of accelerating the inflow of new capital to develop our industries and increase our capacity to absorb new people. I recognize that our attitude may be misrepresented; the suggestion may be made that the purpose of this legislation is to favour the big companies and the wealthier sections of the community. I hope that that course will not be adopted, and that this issue will not be clouded with prejudice, for, whilst the Government recognizes the will of tbe committee, it is convinced that at some future time this Parliament will adopt action of the nature suggested in the bill. is political animosity, the task of any goveniment--no t necessarily the present Government-that may attempt similar action to that proposed on this occasion will be made more difficult. Tbe Government does not propose to press paragraphs b and c of clause 11, nor will it, when clause 23 is reached, persist with its proposal. Government displayed very much greater wisdom in withdrawing from an untenable position, than it did in inserting this provision in the bill. The withdrawal proves that the criticism of the Opposition last night was justified. I remind the committee that it required continual hammering from the Opposition It then before the Government "" saw tbe light."" I am glad that the Government has displayed greater wisdom at this stage than it did earlier in the debate; but we cannot allow the matter to remain where it is. Tbe Prime Minister endeavours to make it appear that the provision is withdrawn merely because be has a majority against him, but that he is right and we are wrong. The Prime Minister spoke of tbe different angles from which he approaches the subject. I suggest that bis argument was triangular. First of all the right bonorable gentleman spoke of tbe difficulties of collecting the tax, and of ' tbe companies from whom it is impossible to collect it. He concluded by stating that the whole principle underlying the clause is the great need to attract capital to Australia, and he gave us a lecture on the desirability of encouraging imported capital to develop the country, urging that the money that comes from abroad is very beneficial. That is arguable. Some investments from abroad bave certainly assisted to develop Australia, and to that extent are beneficial; but others have merely exploited the country and drained our resources. I suggest that we set aside all considerations as to whether imported capital is beneficial or otherwise. Surely the right bonorable gentleman does not contend that Australian capital invested in this country is not as beneficial as that from overseas! Yet be proposed to tax profits on local investments and exempt If , in the meantime, the matter those on investments from abroad. It is surrounded with prejudice and impossible to advance a sound argument in favour of exempting profits made on investments of foreign capital in Australia and at tbe same time taxing the profits on local capital invested in this country. We have had to thresh this matter out since last",34,Tabiff Board S Reports
132,Mr Sctjllin (Yarra) [3.0],"Th eMonday, and no doubt we shall be told that tbe Opposition bas held up the business of the country. I venture to say that this withdrawal would not have taken place had tbe guillotine been applied last night; absentee shareholders would then have been exempted from the tax. It is fortunate for Australia that tbe Opposition was able to ""secure an exhaustive debate on the matter. We were able to place our views before tbe Government, and honourable members supporting tbe Government were also induced to ventilate tbeir opinions. Minister said that he hopes that an attempt will be made to view tbe subject free from party influence. I ask the right honourable gentleman to analyze tbe records of Hansard, feeling confident that ne will find that the case of the Opposition has been presented on a high plane, aud has dealt merely witb tbe merits of tlie proposal. It is futile to insinuate that ness interest, and they are anxious to tbe proposal was witbdraAvn for fear that pressure would be brought to bear. The Government was forced to abandon its position simply because of the strength of our arguments against an iniquitous proposal. Opposition cannot claim all credit, if credit is due, for the withdrawal of this proposal. Minister has indicated that tbe Government does not intend to press it. I believe that there are otber ways in wbicb capital may be attracted to Australia. At tbe same time, I am of tbe opinion that tbe Government was perfectly bonorable in its intentions, and was actuated by tbe desire to encourage capital to come to Australia. No one, however, should be permitted to make profits in Australia and not contribute to the revenue of the country. I remind bonorable members that, early in the session, I suggested that the Government would encourage tbe investment of capital in Australia, if it placed the rate of property taxation on a basis similar to that which,applies to personal exertion. I was glad to hear tbe honourable member for Bailey( Mr Theodore) advance a similar recommendation yesterday. The investment, of money from abroad in our industries must be retarded if people have. to pay nearly double rates on. profits made out of their investments in Australia. The higher property rate will also increase the interest rate and house rents in Australia, and will be of general disadvantage. If the Government takes from the individual only, it places an impost on the whole community. Tbe country would be better off if tbere was freer investment in Australia, not only of local, but of outside capital. offer my sympathy to the Government. The PrimeI t must be very galling to learn that tbe Opposition possesses infinitely greater wisdom than do tbe combined cabinet, and honourable members sitting behind it. One would gather from the remarks of the Prime Minister that those wbo wished to invest in or lend money to Australia were benevolent societies, merely seeking to benefit us. Theirs is merely a busimake profits. Our present financial position is very serious, and we should endeavour to propound a satisfactory solution. From time to time. I bave advocated that, instead of raising new loans, we should have a conversion loan, and place the money in consols at the existing rate of interest. Had that been done recently, instead of raising a new loan of I am glad that the Prime £36,000,000, the country would have been saved at least £325,000 a year for 33 years over the existing rate of interest. It is regrettable that 75 per cent, of the £10,000,000 loan was left on the hands of the underwriters; it could have been raised in Australia. While we bave gilt edged securities available in Australia under the present conditions people are not likely to invest their money in industry. Two considerations that led me to come to Australia were the low price of land and the low rate of interest, and I have no doubt that other people would come here if the price of land and the rate of interest were as low as formerly. I am not the only person in the community who believes that tbe rate of interest payable on gilt-edged securities is a hindrance to our development. A gentleman who was formerly connected with the Treasury, but who, for some reason wbicb I have never beard explained, lost his position, is also of that opinion. Speaking before the Adelaide",35,Tabiff Board S Reports

134,Mr West (East Sydney [3.10],"IChamber of Commerce some time ago he made it quite clear that the rate of interest on our war and other loans would have to be reduced before this country could make any substantial progress in its primary and secondary industries. We had a useful discussion in Melbourne some years ago on the taxation of absentees, and I would advise the Prime Minister \o instruct his officers to look it up. Many honourable members pointed out, on that occasion, that absentees received numerous benefits from this country, ancl therefore they should contribute something to the cost of government. I am glad that the Government has recognized the justice of the case made out by the Opposition and others for the taxation of absentees. have sufficiently recovered from the lecture which I . received from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to join him in expressing appreciation of the action of the Government in agreeing to withdraw this proposal. It may be inexcusable for me to have the temerity to disagree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and if anything I have said has injured his personal feelings I regret it. I assure him that I am looking forward with great interest to his speech on the Land Tax Assessment Bill, and I shall judge him afresh after I have heard his remarks on that measure. I do not take the view of many honourable members opposite that this proposal of the * Government was made as a concession to capitalists. It was not intended as such. I am of the opinion that we ought to do all we can to encourage capital to come to this country, but I agree with the view of the Prime Minister that we are in some danger of certain foreign companies setting up great distributing organizations here with the object of participating in our prosperity without interesting themselves in the development of our country by paying reasonable taxation. It is for that reason I commend the Government for having withdrawn this proposal. Nevertheless, certain British interests have done a great deal throughout the years to develop pastoral Australia also North and Central Australia. They have used their money during many years without drawing much interest, and often making losses. I hope that the Government will endeavour to find some way to give them greater encouragement than they have had in the past, for if their capital were withdrawn it would be detrimental to Australia. did not speak on the motion for the second reading of this bill, I had intended to address myself at some length to this question, but the Government having withdrawn its proposals, it is not necessary for me to do so. The members of this Cabinet will go down to history as the finest political quick-change artists that Australia has known. The abject way in which they abandon policies which they have put forward is, at times, bewildering to us.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for' 'Dalley, and other honourable gentlemen on this side of the committee may be specially complimented on having caused Government supporters to realize the iniquity of its proposal to discriminate in favour of foreign investors.

It is well known that expensive and protracted litigation follows almost every amendment that we make to our taxation laws, and our taxpayers and the Government thereby involved in legal costs wbicb amount pounds annually. The ambiguity of tbe amendments that are made to our taxation laws from time to time, shows the necessity for the appointment of a standing committee of the Parliament to examine taxation proposals before tbey are submitted to honourable members. Tbe suggestion that such a committee should be appointed bas been made on a number of occasions, and as the Government delegates far less important matters to standing committees for consideration, it should be prepared to appoint a standing committee to deal witb this important subject, which affects the economic well-being of the whole community. If such a committee were appointed, it would be possible-and I say this in reply to the interjection of the honourable us to examine taxation proposals in a non-party atmosphere. posal of the honourable member that a every year, and it is very necessary that standing committee sbould be appointed some action should be taken by the Gofor tbe purpose. ter has stated that there are well nigh bringing pressure to bear upon their insuperable difficulties in taxing foreign leaders to drop the vital provisions of the companies, but I refer him to legislation bill now before the Committee. which was passed some little time ago by the Lang Government in New Soutli ""Wales, with the object of taxing the profits of foreign motion picture interests, wbicb has been the cause of an appeal amended by inserting after sub-section (3) the to the High Court. judice. its judgment on Monday. on certain matters, but new pleas are to be filed. statement. I shall not discuss tbe matter further than to .say that the experiment, which the Lang Government! made in attempting to tax the profits made by these foreign companies, was justified. Doubtless, tbe measure will be tbe subject of litigation before tbe Privy Council. As to the practicability of imposing taxation upon tbese interests, bonorable are members are surely aware that there are more ways of killing a cat than by chokto many thousands of ing it with cream. I suggest that tbe Government sbould introduce a federal company law in spite of declared constitutional difficulties, either with or without consultation witb the States. Foreign companies, which make profits on business which they do in Australia, sbould undoubtedly contribute towards the cost of government here, and legislative control over companies is a means to that end. Tbat seems to me to be the most effective method of taxing the profits of companies. In regard to a company law, Sir Robert Garran, when giving evidence before the Royal Commission ou the Constitution, saidI t is not at a l l certain, in view of later decisions' of the High Court, that a law regulating companies would be held to-day to be invalid.

I agree with the honourable member that everything possible ought to be clone to encourage the investment of capital within Australia. When our people become wealthy, and amass capital, they should, if. they invest that capital outside Australia, be subject to taxation by the Commonwealth; of course, with such limitations as might be necessary on account of taxation imposed elsewhere. Australia should obtain some benefit from incomes earned overseas by Australians resident here. Millions of pounds lave been invested in tin mines in the Malay Peninsula, and in the timber resources of Borneo and elsewhere, and from the profits made out of those investments not oue penny is collected in income tax from shareholders in Australia.

Better returns are always secured from money spent by private corporations. The coming of additional capital to this country would induce more production which, in return, would lead to greater prosperity and more employment. There seems to me to be one objection to this amendment, and that is that it embodies the principle of double taxation. If the honourable member for Swan could see his way clear to allow concessions to be made in'respect of taxation paid abroad, bis amendment would be less open to objection. I do not think we should discourage people from invest-ing their money abroad, even if they do live in Australia. If people who invested their money abroad did not pay any income tax to the country where the money was invested, there would be no double taxation; but if<they do pay sucb taxation abroad, the amount of it sbould be deducted from that collected in Australia. I bave no objection to the amendment if tbe honourable gentleman will agree to sucb an alteration. I am opposed to the system of double taxation. Ever since I can remember there has been an outcry against double taxation, as it operated between Great Britain and Australia. We have now adjusted that matter to some extent, and we do not want to introduce the principle elsewhere. I cannot agree that, because an Australian is drawing his income from another country, be sbould pay f u l l income taxation would then be prevented within the tion in that country, and pay f u l l taxaEmpire; but if a man invested his tion again in Australia. Such a provision as that would hinder tbe free flow of capital. Supposing a man drew income from India, and was taxed there on that income; it would not be fair that he should be assessed here at f u ll income tax rates in respect of the same income. If be is paying no taxation in India, there would be no objection to his being taxed here. That is a fair proposition, and if tbe bonorable member for Swan is prepared to admit it, I will support his amendment. am surprised that the honourable member tralians who invest their money in the for Swan( Mr Gregory) sbould have Tremendous sums proposed an amendment of this kind. We have, I think, always been opposed' to the principle of double taxation, and yet he is deliberately proposing to introduce it bere. I cannot understand why any one in Australia who invests bis money abroad-as he is perfectly entitled to do-shoul d be compelled to pay taxation both in the foreign country and in Australia. The adoption of this pro-, posal would amount to a most iniquitous grab on tbe part of Australia for money to which it was not entitled. We should be most inconsistent if we supported this amendment, and I hope the committee will turn it down. cannot agree with tbe honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen). If a man lives in this country and invests bis money outside, no matter what taxation he may pay to the country in which he has invested it, he has no right to enjoy the benefits of Australian citizenship without meeting his obligations , in the way of taxation. If be enjoys tbe privilege of Australian citizenship, be must accept his responsibility in regard to Australia's war debt, and the maintenance of tbe governmental services. investments in Australia. man may live here and enjoy the privileges of citizenship, and not bave one penny invested in Australia. I think we ought to devise a system such as that operating in Great Britain. Double taxamoney in a foreign country he would be subjected to double taxation, and rightly so. It seems an extraordinary thing to me that Australia should abstain from this system of taxation. We are practically the only advanced country in the world whicb does so. The bonorable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has quoted instances in wbich this form of taxation has been adopted, and in practically all other parts of the Empire, and in most foreign countries, residents are taxed on incomes drawn from abroad.

I hope that the amendment will be seriously considered. agree with the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and the mover of the amendment.

Certain proposals in the measure were designed to attract capital to Australia, and obviwool and wheat. ously it is illogical to allow simultaneously native capital to flow out of the country. The two policies are irreconment apply to them? cilable. We were faced with the increasing exodus of capital from the Commonwealth, and had to consider whether steps should be taken to check it . The effect of this is illustrated by the manner in which government securities have been almost hawked in Australia, the Government being obliged to make the income from them tax-free as an extra inducement to the Australian people to lend their money to the Commonwealth. The Government realized, however, that a fundamental alteration of tbe system could not be proposed without very much greater investigation. The Commonwealth income tax law, when originally framed by a Labour Government, was based on the logical and just principle that taxation should be levied on income actually derived within the country. Abandonment of that principle would be a very radical change, especially at a .time when the principles that govern income taxation are being exhaustively considered by all the nations of the world. The matter was dealt with at Geneva, and whilst finality has not Somebody living alongside us been reached, the trend of opinion is towards recognition of the principle that taxation on investments should be levied only by the country in which the capital is controlled. There is another considerabefore we completely reverse our taxation policy in this regard. Australia is vitallyconcerned in increasing its import trade, of which all us would like the secondary industries to contribute a bigger proportion. To illustrate the probable effects of the proposed amendment, I remind the committee that H . V.

I discussed this matter with the income tax commissioner, and, contrary to the legal opinion we have just beard, he expressed tbe view that tlie amendment would apply to all moneys invested outside Australia, irrespective of tbe nature of the investment. So much is involved in the amendment that tbe Government cannot accept it Without further investigation. I assure the mover that the point be bas raised has already been exhaustively examined by the Government, and that it will be further probed. Australia cannot afford to allow its own capital to drain away to other countries when it is so bardpressed for money that it has to offer special inducements to foreigners to subscribe to its loans. ""We all are agreed as to the desirability of keeping as much of Australia's surplus wealth in the country for the development of its resources as is practicable; but I urge the committee not to make, by this simple amendment, a fundamental and far-reaching change in the taxation system. Moreover, the adoption of the proposal would completely upset tbe finances of tbe Government. Nobody can say what would be its effects. might even get too mucb revenue. that it would enormously increase the revenue. then reduce the tariff duties. for Swan cannot be allowed to achieve bis free trade objective by a side wind. The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that it would be impossible, without careful research, to estimate tbe effect of this alteration upon tbe revenue. I appeal to tbe committee not to accept the amendment. Tbe matter is being who purchase wool on consignment and carefully examined by the Government, sell it at an enhanced price. and, in view of tbe necessity for retaining Australian capital for internal development, it may be necessary, wben all the facts are ascertained, to take some action to achieve that result. Prime Minister was right in saying that the amendment involved a change of a fundamental and far-reaching nature. I am sorry that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) did not circulate it some days ago. The Prime Minister said that the amendment, if carried, would probably lead to an enormous increase in revenue from income taxation. That proves that the Commonwealth is losing a lot of revenue now. Tbe only sound argument that can be urged against a government baving too great a revenue is that it is taking from tbe pockets of the people an undue amount of money, which might be put to better use. Tbat objection does not apply in this case, because, if we tax the profits of those who have invested their money abroad, we leave them less money with which to carry on that undesirable policy, and we do not lessen the amount invested in Australia. % out of Australia altogether. strong case in favour of the amendment. I certainly agree that if we did impose this class of taxation, which could be subjected to reciprocal arrangements similar to those now in force between Great Britain and Australia, it would be beneficial. The Prime Minister exGovernment pounded an argument that was exploded when the subject was discussed before tbe royal commission on taxation, that the provision would penalize men who were making products locally, and sending them abroad .to Argentine, Africa, and other countries, to exploit their market, such as Hugh Victor McKay.

We should certainly tax the man who is resident in Australia and has his capital invested abroad, particularly the man who has his money invested in tin-mining and other ventures in cheap labour countries. principle upon which we impose the rate of taxation is ability to pay. There are two main considerations governing the collection of taxation ; one the service that the country renders the individual as a member of the community. The Prime Minister refers to it as the "" protection of the flag."" The other and greater consideration is the protection that the country gives to the industry from which the individual makes his income. We have the right to impose a tax on the resident of Australia who earns his money in this country, ancl that also gives us a claim on the absentee who earns a portion of his income, in Australia. That justified, too, the stapfl taken by the Opposition in regard to.'.the proposals that were to be applied to."" absentee shareholders. We have an even greater claim on those individuals, who, while resident in Australia, ""are exploiting undeveloped countries, where government may not be solid. Great Britain has frequently taken responsibility for the safeguarding of persons engaged in such ventures. It is right that those people should contribute to the revenue of the country that protects them, and in which they reside. The royal commission on taxation was very guarded in its report. It made some recommendations, but hedged later. It indicated that it would prefer to see a tax imposed on profits earned abroad rather existing tax in Australia. I suggest that that was not considering the principle, but rather the expediency, of the matter. To-day, whilst Ave are reducing income tax and other direct taxation, our general taxation per head of population is increasing. It would be possible for us to relieve our people from indirect taxation to the extent of many millions of pounds Avithout affecting the protective effect of the tariff except to improAfe it, leaving r revenue duties frankly imposedas such. On the Avhole, I find myself in agreement with the amendment. committee can only affirm general principles, and a principle is affirmed in clear and definite language by the amendment. If the amendment is carried, tbe Government Avill have to consult its advisers, and probably in another place, insert the proviso necessary to meet objections that The may be raised on such points as the taxing of exports. It may be necessary to alter the verbiage to include capital expended abroad for trading purposes, as Avell as investments. When one considers that the AOAV of capital from Australia abroad is growing, one realizes tbe need to impose a check. The honourable member for Swan instanced "" shadow"" companies that are exploiting Australia and evading taxation, here. We have people who are shareholders in such companies, actually making profits here, but crediting those profits in another country. I instance the operations of nn American film company, producing films in Australia. Those films .are sold in Australia at such a price that the Australian section of the business makes no profit. But profits are made by the parent company, and the shareholders Avho are resident in Austialia receive their proportion of those profits. Why should Ave encourage that sort of thing and penalize Australian taxpayers? If Ave imposed a taxon sueh activities, it Avould at least Avake up Australian shareholders and make them fight for tbeir end of the stick, probably resulting in the introduction of reciprocal taxation arrangements betAveen Australia and the United States of America. I appreciate many of the points raised by the Prime Minister, but the right honourable gentleman is responsible, Avith his Government, to see that these provisions are exthan increase the tended in such a way that they Avill increase our revenue enormously. That will reduce the taxation that falls so heavily upon our OAvn people, and will still allow us to put into effect protective duties Avhich will encourage and \ stimulate our industries.

177,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneymight properly be carried by tbe committee, and that it should then, be left to the Government to produce other amendments to f it into the scheme of the act. I consider that the committee should appreciate the real significance of the amendment in that regard. Our act was deliberately drawn upon the basis of the taxation of incomes derived from sources within Australia. The definitions in the act are based upon that principle. governing sections of the act are based upon that principle, as are the description of income, in section 16, and the deductions. To accept this amendment and to combine with the principle of taxation upon income derived in Australia, the principle of taxation upon income received in Australia from investments abroad would involve a re-casting of a very large portion of the act. Eor example, income from personal exertion is denned as certain moneysDerived from sources in Australia, consisting of earnings, salaries, charges, commisGregory). His proposal is fundamental sions, fees, &c. . . . Income from property means "" all incomes derived from sources in Australia and not derived from personal exertion."" And so on through the definition section. Section 13 is the governing section of the act, and it provides"" Subject to the provisions of this act, inhoarding thoir savings u n t i l a time of come tax sliall be levied and paid for each financial year upon taxable income derived directly or indirectly by every taxpayer from sources within Australia. . . ."" Section 16 provides that assessable income shall include certain specified matters. pages of the statute. As an. example of the difficulty that arises, I mention the trouble there is in dealing witb profits which have been distributed in Australia in the for m of bonus shares. A complicated set of provisions has been worked out to deal with that subject, which depends in part for its administration upon the date on which certain profits were earned by the companies concerned. The provisions are being applied to Australia, but to apply them to foreign companies would be impracticable. It could not be done, except by sending inquiry officers abroad to ascertain whether and .when and out of what moneys foreign companies distributed bonus shares. Provision is also made for the deduction of certain losses and outgoings'; but this likewise has been devised to meet Australian conditions, and could not be applied to ex-Australian income. Everything in the act bas been put tJhere with the object of collecting tax on income derived from all sources in Australia, and the measure would have to be entirely re-cast to make its provisions applicable to income earned outside The Australia. It is, of course, open to the committee to adopt an entirely different system. I have not risen to speak on the merits of the amendment. I suggest that the wise course for the committee to pursue would be to allow the Government to continue its examination of the question, and not create difficulty, and perhaps chaos, by inserting in the act an isolated amendment of this character. listened with attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Swan( Mr. in character. This subject has been considered recently in Great Britain, the United States of America, and Canada. The Senate of the United States of America bas been specially concerned about the practice of certain Southern Europeans who migrate to America of depression occurs, and then taking them back to their native land. It has also given consideration to ways and means of meeting the financial problems which arise from the practice of wealthy AmeriI t occupies more than four cans of taking large sums out of the country when tbey go abroad on holidays. Australia is not greatly concerned with that aspect of the matter, for we have numerous visitors from other countries who bring considerable wealth here. The discussions that have arisen in GreatB r it a in have turned on a different aspect. On Monday last I asked tbe Prime Minister, upon notice1. Is it a fact tliat recently in the House of Commons, in reply to a question as to whether Great Britain can continue to lend her resources to develop the enterprises of foreign countries. Mr Winston Churchill (Chancellor of the Exchequer) replied that he had always been lead to believe that such loans leave the country in the form of Britisli goods? 2. If so, will thc Prime Minister state whether the reply by the Chancellor of the",44,Eighth Assembly Wealth Obtains Nothing By Way Of Income

The riglit honourable gentleman replied that he had no information on the subject, but in spite of that off-banded way of dealing with it, be will have to give some earnest consideration to it before long. The question was raised at the Economic Conference at Geneva, but as that was a free trade body it also evaded the issue. It appears to me that something along the lines of the proposal of the honourable member for Swan will bave to be done sooner or later. At present a large amount of capital is being taken out of Australia annually, by persons resident abroad. It is well known that the members of the Tooth and Allen families draw very large incomes from their interests in Australia. They are not consumers, aud do not assist iu relieving the cost of government. This money should be taxed. ""We sball eventually bave to treat this question as one of major importance. was pleased to hear the Prime Minister express the opinion that there was a good deal to be said in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Swan on the grounds of national sentiment, necessity and obligation. This country is badly in need of capital, and we should do all that we can to see that Australiau capital is kept here to develop our resources, establish our industries, and provide employment for our people. That the principle underlying the amendment is sound cannot be denied, for it is a principle upon wbicb .British and Canadian taxation rests. I was not impressed by the statement of the Attorney-General, that from the machinery standpoint the amendment is impracticable. I have noticed frequently that while one man is busy saying that a thing cannot be done, another comes along and does it. I can see no reason why we should not provide machinery to impose taxation of this character. by a regulation. to do it. We could include another part ing sentiment of the Australian people in our act to deal''with it, and make it is that we should exploit every legitipractically independent of tbe taxation mate field of taxation before we increase of income earned in Australia. I was impressed witb tbe statement of the Prime Minister that the proposal was equitable and would enlarge the field of taxation. In my opinion it would exploit a wide and legitimate field which we have a perfect right to exploit. I know of an Australian citizen who, shortly after tbe outbreak of tbe war, removed practically the whole of his capital from Australia, although be remained under tbe shelter of tbe Australian navy and army and the protection of the British flag. It is no part of our business to shelter individuals of that description from dual taxation. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan has mucb to commend it, but at the same time it would not be prudent at this stage to graft it upon our present act. That would be a somewhat precipitate and almost a clumsy method of dealing witb this proposal, because it certainly requires more consideration than we can give it to-day. ber is raising tbe difficulty that was mention by the Attorney-General. are no insuperable machinery difficulties in respect to this amendment, but it would be unwise at this stage to graft it upon our taxation laws without giving it mature consideration. I have not the slightest doubt that the Commissioner of Taxation could soon frame new maehinery to make the amendment workable, and I suggest that he should prepare a measure to give effect to it. With reference to duality of taxation upon Australian manufacturers who export, the Prime Minister has given one of very few instances in the whole of Australia, and that is the Hugh V. McKay Manufacturing Company. That case, of course, can be met by a special provision dealing with such export products. Tbere is the possibility that, unless we carefully frame our legislation,, we may tax capital employed in our primary industries, and therefore legislative if the principle is right, the details are a its incidence upon our already heavily",45,Eighth Assembly Wealth Obtains Nothing By Way Of Income

I am aware of another citizen holding vast properties that are to-day almost unproductive, and he is paying high land taxation, both Federal and State, and other imposts, including municipal rates. His holding cannot be further developed at present, and there it remains as his monumental investment in Australia. Could he use capital that has been put into his property, say, in America, he would be receiving nearly treble the return that he is getting from his Australian investment, but he is content to go through this difficult stage of Australia's nnances unt i l conditions improve. There is little profit to-day to the man who is controlling industry. Our economic conditions are bad, and we are passing through a difficult stage. This is the time when we should see that those who are controlling liquid funds do not take tbem out of Australia to be used in countries in which' there is a big reward for investment in industry. Our first obligation is to Australia, and we sbould do all we can to safeguard its interests and keep capital in this country so as to build un our resources, increase our population and protect our people from the increasing incidence of taxation, by first exploiting this legitimate field of income taxation that is now available to us. hope that the honourable member for Swan will persist in his amendment and .that it will be carried by the committee. Tbe Attorney-General raised some technical difficulties under the present act respecting the amendment, but I venture to say that they could be overcome by delaying the bill for 24 hours so that it might be redrafted. The operation of this amendment it has been estimated would bring in a revenue of £2,000,000 a .year. It is a large sum, and well worth collecting, and not one argument has been advanced impugning the wis-dom of imposing this form of taxation. It is remarkable that it has not been proportunity to pass to obtain revenue from posed before. Those who derive income in Australia from investments abroad have enjoyed the benefits of citizenship in Australia. They had tbe protection of -our army and navy during the war, and yet have contributed little or nothing toward the revenue of this country. We have now the opportunity to make them bear their fair share of taxa* tion. If it were possible, I should go further ancl make the taxation retrospective for a few'years. I certainly would not delay levying the tax for another year. Tbese .people have not been good citizens. Rather than assist to develop Australia, they have invested their capital in other countries, and are receiving large profits from the employment of black labour. They care not wbo won the war, or who paid for it. Australia is to-day badly in need of revenue. There are thousands of returned soldier settlers in this country who, unless they receive immediate assistauce, will be forced to leave their holdings. Here we have an opportunity to assist them. Tbe Prime Minister said that there was a difficulty in levying this form of taxation, especially in respect of the firm of Hugh V. McKay. I have no wish to tax that firm in respect of its export trade, but, after all, its founder, when he died recently, left nearly £2,000,000. The difficulty mentioned, by the Prime Minister could easily be overcome; and as for the technical difficulties enumerated by the Attorney General, they are not worth a moment's consideration. I commend the honourable member for Swan for bringing this proposal before the committee, and I sincerely hope it will be given effect. I do not know whether the Lonorable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) intends to persevere witb tbe amendment, but I trust that, in view.of the support that he has received from both sides of the committee, there will be no backing down. Revenue is badly needed in this country, and we have to meet many liabilities. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) has shown that in the next five years we must redeem half of our national debt, close on £500,000,000. Therefore, we cannot afford to allow the oppersons who can well afford to pay for it. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has indicated that this is a method by whicb we can relieve the great body of the people of a portion of taxation, and at the same time not affect the protective policy of this",46,Eighth Assembly Wealth Obtains Nothing By Way Of Income

The bonorable member for East Sydney( Mr West) has intimated that this form of taxation has been receiving attention in other countries. I have with me an American record of various taxation systems. The Congress of the United States of America authorized an inquiry into tbe forms of taxation in operation in various countries, Including Great Britain, and no difficulty has been found in imposing a tax upon residents who invest their capital in other countries. Why should we not follow such an excellent example? It. may be said that this tax will injure our manufacturing export trade, but that difficulty is easily overcome.

I feel sure that the honourable member for Swan will recognize that, baving introduced the amendment, and having secured from the Government an intimation that it is considering the matter seriously, it is uot necessary for him to go further with it just now. The question is not so simple as it appears. We do not possess that measure of control over our citizens and their investments outside Australia which some honourable members seem to think. This system of taxation might prove to be a two-edged sword. I believe that people with plenty of money, even if they are living privately, are of advantage to Australia, and tliey are taxed in other ways than through the income tax. If we impose such taxation as is here suggested, we might drive such people out of good. However, I feel that much might be done along the lines suggested in the whicb it is suggested we' should adopt, namely, that of taxing aresident on bis",47,Eighth Assembly Wealth Obtains Nothing By Way Of Income

I agree that the British system was probably examined, and that due consideration was given to other systems before the present one was adopted. After such consideration, the Labour Government came to the conclusion that the best system was to tax incomes derived in Australia. But circumstances have altered, and I have already indicated that the Government has given serious consideration to whether, Avithout criticism of those Avho framed the present system, i ' : might not be extended to cover investments of Australian citizens abroad. Before this Parliament could commit itself to such a principle, hoAvever, we must have much more information as to the possible repercussions of such an alteration of the UIAV. This idea of taxing incomes derived from abroad Avas not, I presume, brushed aside as umvorthy of consideration when the original system Avas evolved, but it Avas not thought Avise, at that time, to adopt it. We are now considering whether it is not necessary to make some alteration, and Ave are collecting facts as to the probable effects on revenue if such an alteration Avere made. When Ave are in possession of tliose facts, it may be possible to recast our Avhole system of taxation. I suggest that, until Ave have that information, it Avould be extremely unwise for this committee to pledge itself to a principle Avhich might not produce the advantages that a great number of people believe IIOAV it Avould. The Government fully recognizes the necessity for considering this matter, and has already taken definite action. Therefore, I Avould suggest that the honourable gentleman withdraw his amendment which, I agree, is one of very great importance. This is one of the most important matters which has been considered during the committee stage of this bill. It has been made clear that there exists a large field of taxation Avhich remains untapped by the Oommonwealth. 1"" do not think Ave are justified in permitting this state of things to continue, in A'ieAv of the fact inconie, irrespective of Avhere it is derived. that our taxation is very heavy, and may have to be increased in the near future.

It is hardly fair for the Prime Minister to remind us that the present system of taxation Avas framed by a Labour Government. It is quite true that the system Avas introduced in 1915 by a government of Avhich tbe right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) Avas a member. It does not folloAv, hoAvever, that those responsible for a taxation system sbould be condemned because defects develop in it after its introduction, and it is seen that people are evading their just share of taxation. The committee should be given an assurance that the present system Avill not be allowed to continue unchanged. During the discussion yesterday the Treasurer stated that the removal of the tax on the incomes of absentee company shareholders would give an inducement to capital to come to Australia. The system by Avhich incomes derived from abroad are left free from, taxation, gives, however, a direct inducement to capital to leave Australia. considerable ? estimate.

The Prime Minister, I understand, says that he is prima facie, favorable to the suggested alteration, but has not fully investigated the matter, and is not fully informed of its probable effect on investment and general financial conditions in Australia. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who moved the amendment, is satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister that the problem will be investigated forthwith, and desires to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he may be permitted to do so. In the meanwhile I shall make my own position clear.

It is extremely doubtful, in any case, that the amendment could be carried in the face of the opposition of the Government. The inquiry should not take A'ery long, as it Avill be a simple one. But the potential taxpayer should not be alloAved to escape the tax on his income for the current year, and, therefore, I Avould like the Prime Minister to tell us Avhether he intends that the iiwestigation shall be made Avith such despatch as to enable Parliament to pass an amending bill early next year that will operate as if it Avere in force to-day.

That is not now the position. Huge profits are being made by Australian residents from investments such as those referred to by the honourable member for Swan. The Prime Minister has said that full inquiry will be made into the matter. Does that mean that another royal commission will be appointed, and that tbe honourable member for Swan will be the chairman of it? It appears to be a favourite practice of this Government to evade the responsibility of making important decisions by appointing royal commissions. Possibly it intends to appoint another royal commission on taxation. If so, it will probably use the commission's recommendations as the basis of a declaration of Government policy just prior to the next election. gentleman seems to be familiar with the way these things are done. with the methods of this Government. The honourable member for Boothby argued that if we adopt this proposal we shall probably drive capital out of* the ment a few hours ago withdrew a proappears to me that persons abroad who derive wealth from investments in Australia, and persons in Australia wbo derive wealth from investments abroad should be taxed. The Royal Commission on Taxation dealt with the subject of taxation of the income of Australian resigraph 35S of its report reads as followsThe Federal Commissioner of Taxation, in the course of his evidence on the subject of double.inconie tax, expressed the opinion that "" With'the disappearance of the double income tax there is no reason why Australia should limit its tax to incomes arising from sources in Australia."" (See also paragraphs 109 and 170 of Wiis commission's first report.) The Commissioner considered that, upon the elimination of double taxation in respect of incomes taxed both in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Australian residents should be taxed on their total incomes where ever derived on the basis of their ability to pay. He said"" It would mean that, instead of the Commonwealth losing income tax on large revenue derived by Australians-usin g the term in a general sense-fro m such countries as Japan, China, America, and South America, we should get the tax on it. There is no reason, to my mind, why that revenue should not contribute towards the tost of government in Australia.""",52,Honobable Members No

Neither the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) nor can I be certain of re-election, and if we do not vote on the issue to-day we may not bave another opportunity to do so. reason wby the Government should not immediately undertake to ask the commissioner to devise machinery to collect taxation of this character. It has been said that we have no information as to tbe amount of money involved; but we know very well that it is considerable, and therefore we are justified in acting. This field of taxation has been left untouched for too long. I should be quite prepared to tax incomes of this character three times as heavily as inoomes derived from sources within Australia. I trust that tbe honourable member for Swan will persist in his amendment, and that it will be carried by the committee. discussion that bas centred round tbe amendment moved by tbe bonorable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), bas been very interesting. Many bonorable members bave expressed views favorable to the taxation of profits earned outside Australia. I mucb prefer to see Ausment of Australia. Honourable members have at all times spoken of the wonderf u l potential resources of this country, and it is not pleasant to realize that large sums of money are being sent away for investment abroad. No blame can be attached to the honourable member for Swan for moving the amendment. Necessarily, he could not beforehand give honourable members notice of his intention to move it, but the discussion that has take place has induced tbe Prime Minister to promise that this taxation proposal will be investigated. I do not think for one moment that any member would like to see an important proposal like this hurriedly inserted in the bill, and later oh to discover that more harm than good had thereby been done. It is also unfair to ask the Prime Minister to give a definite promise respecting what may take place in the early part of next year. If this proposal to tax incomes from overseas investments is surrounded witb many difficulties, as we have been told, it necessarily calls for a close examination. There is also another aspect. We have not been told what taxation is paid by Australian investors in other countries, and we may find that it is considerable.

I would hesitate about taking any action that would result fn driving either individuals or money for investment away from Australia. It is also very important that this legislation sbould not be delayed pending the inquiries being made as the reductions in taxes apply to the operations of the present year. I think that tbe committee has made excellent progress in obtaining from the Prime Minister a promise that this taxation, proposal will be investigated.

UntilI heard the discussion this afternoon, I bad always imagined that honourable members, especially those of tbe Opposition, were of the opinion that Ave in Australia had evolved a better and more equitable system of income taxation than any other country in the world. At tbe time of its introduction, there were income tax laws operating in a great number of otbpr countries. I was under the impression that those had been examined, and as a result Parliament had deliberately adopted tbe present basis of taxation upon incomes derived in this"" country in preference to the systems of other countries. But to-day quite a different point of view has ' been taken. This question is nearly as controversial as the rival policies in this Parliament in the fiscal sphere of free trade and protection. A new light altogether has been thrown upon our taxation methods in Australia. Let me put this point to honourable members. Is not the outstanding feature of our federal income taxation its tremendous complexity, and yet that is almost entirely due to the desire that Ave have in the federal sphere to mete out justice to the taxpayers. Until to-day I thought that bonorable members had insisted upon that complexity in order that absolute justice should be done to every taxpayer. No matter what system of taxation is adopted, there will be complaints about its complexity, and, perhaps, suggestions from those Avho complain, Avhich Avould increase that complexity. This gradual leakage of capital from Australia has been occupying the mind of tbe Government for some time. To some extent Ave have approached the subject from the wrong angle. Honourable members must realize that, so soon as Ave tax incomes derived from overseas investments, Ave completely alter the fundamental basis of the income tax legislation of this country. If Ave changed tbe principles Avhich Ave have hitherto folloAved, I believe that we could simplify many of the complexities of the present law and obviate many of the calculations that are necessary under our present taxation system. The leakage of capital is becoming so serious that tbe Government has been considering whether there is not sufficient justification to alter the principles of our income tax legislation. But it has not embodied any alteration in its financial proposals for the present year, because these, of course, operate only in regard to the income earned last year and do c not apply to income earned this .year. The Government intends to make further and fuller investigations before it comes to a decision on a far-reaching alteration of this character. If it decides upon an alteration, it Avill not be possible to bring it down to honourable members until tbe next session of Parliament. I want honourable members to understand that any alteration Avould not apply during the present financial year. able gentleman prepared to apply the alteration to the next financial year? fectly clear that tbe Government at present is favourably inclined towards taking action in the direction suggested; but if , as a result of its further investigations, it comes to tbe conclusion that it is not",54,Honobable Members No

That paragraph (r) be omitted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 16 (Partners). asked that this clause be recommitted so as to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining its import more clearly. It must be evident to honourable members that the power conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation under this clause is very wide indeed. I listened patiently to the statement made by the Treasurer when he introduced this measure, and if I remember rightly, he stated that even when a wife put money into her husband's business, there could not be established a partnership between tliem. only pay, and the wife claim, interest for the money so advanced. submit that a man could have no better partner than his wife. If she possesses money of her own, and is entitled to invest it, there is no better way to do it than, to put it into ber husband's business. I am, therefore, anxious that Parliament should interpret its will in this regard, rather than that it should impose that power upon any person whatsoever. I recognize the need, for the clause under our graduated system of taxation. on the part of taxpayers to get together in order that they may divide their incomes, and so come under a lower income tax rate. sary that the Government sbould protect tbe income tax. act against such bogus partnerships, but the Minister should more clearly define under what circumstances a husband and wife may conduct a genuine business partnership. If tbe position is as I understood tbe Treasurer to say, that a wife is not able to enter into a business partnership with ber busband, I totally disagree. If a wife owns "" bona fide "" as used in reference to this farming property, and her husband also clause'? owns land, there is nothing more proper than that they sbould enter into a legal ship 'is bona fide or not in relapartnership in respect of sucb land, and that they should have their legal rights as partners preserved to them. General) [8.10] -Section 29 of the act provides that a partnership shall be liable to furnish returns, but that the partnership, as such, shall not be liable to taxation, and that the partners shall be separately assessed. That is a proper provision in the case of a bona fide partnership. This new clause is designed to deal with a fruitfu l source of evasion. It must be remembered that if a husband and wife are carrying on a business partnership, and have no outside source of income, the tax payable on tbe income of the business as a partnership is frequently less than it would be if the business were carried on in the name of only one of the partners, because the division of income allows a deduction of £300 from the income of each of tbem. Tbere are, I admit, many bona fide husband-and-wife The husband could partnerships, but there are quite a number which are not bona fide, but which it I is extremely difficult to prove are other than they are represented to be. The department has informed the Government that these cases are becoming more numerous. Many cases bave been observed in whicb a business has been carried on for some time by an individual as a sole trader. He then obtains advice from a taxing agent, and thereafter he carries on his business in the form of a partnership with his wife. The business may still trade under the same There is a natural desire name, but for taxation purposes it is represented as a partnership. Tbe claim for the existence of a partnership may be based on a specific agreement which is It is necesproduced, and it is difficult to establish, in such a case, that the partnership is not a bona fide one. If it is necessary to prove in a law court in every case that there is a fraud, tbese evasions will continue to take place.

If the honourable gentleman will refer to the Partnership Acts, as passed by the different State Parliaments, he will find that the mere lending of money does not create a partnership. This clause would not apply in cases where money had been merely lent. It would apply only in cases in which it is contended that a partnership exists as defined in section 29 of the act, and in which it is found that the partnership bas been formed to evade taxation liability. But where tbere is a contribution of real money to tbe capital of a firm there can be no doubt that a bona fide partnership in the business may be claimed. statement.

If some declaration of partnership I sbould not object, but tbere is nothing in the act to define for the guidance of the commissioner a partnership between husband and wife. It is quite common for a wife to hold land in ber own name and to work it witb her busband, but without any deed of partnership or annual balance-sheet, or distribution of profits. If this taxation is to be left entirely in the discretion of the commissioner a loose family partnership might lead to a charge by the commissioner of attempted evasion of taxation. Frequently it will be found that partnerships do not exist, and the commissioner's demand for evidence in tbe form of a deed, an annual balance-sheet, and a statement of profits distributed, might make the partners liable to tbe highest penalties under the act. The clause is too vague. not uncontrolled and arbitrary discretion.

We sbould be applying our surpluses to the reduction of our debt or to preventing an increase of it. It should be our endeavour to relieve tbe people where we can from the existing revenue imposts.

That is the basis of our protest against this reduction, and it bas already been discussed at considerable length.

We cannot move to increase the rate of taxation to the original standard, because that would be against the Standing Orders, and we cannot vote against the second-reading of this bill, because if we were successful, it would result in no income tax being collected. We can merely reiterate what we said on the Income Tax Assessment Act, so far as it applies to this bill. Tbere is one thing which I urge tbe Minister in charge of the bill to consider, and that me, to which the Treasurer took excepis the minimum tax charged. It may seem a very small matter, but tbe minimum of £1 operated harshly against many taxpayers. The reduction to 10s. will give a measure of relief, but I understand that some of tbe States collect a minimum of only 5s., and I suggest that we should reduce our minimum to a similar amount. A man may come into the taxable area with perhaps only £1 above the exemption. Legally speaking, under the terms of the scheduled rates, he should pay only a few pence, but'the minimum compels him to pay 10s. I suggest that 5s. would be reasonable. a considerable; time.

That may appear to be very reasonable, but when we examine it from an economic stand-point, we realize that it merely .causes trouble and places the nation at 'a disadvantage. An increased taxation on revenue derived from investments in this country means that the interest rate must go up, which is detrimental to tbe progress of tbe country. I also submit that under the present scheme the money invested in houses for letting We certainly saved the purposes is unduly taxed, so that it is the working man who actually has to meet the higher rate of taxation. Instead of being an advantage to Australia, it is a disadvantage. Foreign investors in Australia are not similarly penalized.

I understand that bis proposal to-night is that the rate of income tax should be the same irrespective of whether income is derived from personal exertion or from property.

If it were country if in the future we were to denot so serious, it would be laughable.

It appears incidence of direct and indirect taxation of vital importance to our economic life. I should rejoice in the proposed reduction of direct taxation were it not for the Treasurer did not refer to it in his budget fact that it is not a reduction in the totality of taxation, but merely a shifting of the amount involved from a direct to an indirect tax. maimer in which a country will submit to direct as against indirect taxation is, in my opinion, a test of its intelligence and economic.sense. A nation which prefers indirect to direct taxation is deficient in knowledge of economics. An axiom of taxation is that if a government bas to raise £1,000 in taxation very much less economic hurt is done if it clips the amount off a single 50 cuts of £20 each from the recipients of smaller incomes. Our indulgence in this orgy of indirect taxation is having a very bad effect upon our national expenditure. HadI known that to meet the expense of constructing certain works for which I bave voted in this Parliament in the last year or so, the electors would have to sign specific cheques to meet direct taxation instead of knowing, as I did, that the necessary money or the interest to be paid on it would be available from revenue duties, I them.

There is no indication anywhere of an intention to shorten sail. If the Government, wishes to relieve the burden of taxation and reduce fhe cost of living, let it do so in the most effective way, and that is by reducing indirect taxation. ""While I am not in favour of this bill, I recognize that it is useless to oppose it, because the Government has its majority and will put it through. We can, however, register our objections to the Government's proposals. ber can vote against the bill. so. If the records of this House are searched it will be found that I have voted in accordance with the way I have spoken more often, perhaps, than any other honourable member. I have never been afraid to back my opinion by my vote, even if, by doing so, I have been placed for the time being in an apparently anomalous position.. The Government should reduce the high customs duties. The burden imposed by customs taxation is not represented merely by the actual amount of revenue which is received by the Government. In the case of income taxation the burden on the people is represented roughly by tbe amount of revenue which the Government collects, but that is not. so with the customs taxation. In addition to the amount^ of revenue derived from customs duties, there is a huge, and often little realized, indirect, burden laid upon the people, which has been calculated by different authorities to be from four to seven times the amount of the revenue collected. When £40,000,000 or £45,000,000 from the people in customs duties, it represents an actual burden upon the country of £150,000,000 or £160,000,000 a year. When a ' Government, insists upon 6,000,000 people bearing so great a burden as that, it surely indicates a callous indifference on its part to the people's needs. Instead of reducing in'conie taxation, the Government should cut down the customs duties. For every £1,000,000 reduction in tiie customs daties, the people would be relieved, even upon the most conservative estimate, of a burden amounting to £4,OOO;OO0. I '.recognize that as the Government has huge commitments-som e of its own making-for which it needs a big revnue, we should be careful not. to reduce taxation too quickly. Tbe process should be gradual. If the Government wishes to secure a minimum reduction of revenue, with a maximum amount of relief to the people, it can do so by reducing indirect taxation. An honourable member has asked what serious crisis is ahead of us, and why we should use the argument of stern necessity when advocating economy. In the Sydney Morning Herald of this morning, there is a very striking testimony, one o£ a long I am prepared to do list of such testimonies given iin this country for some time past, ',to the pernicious effect of the present system of taxation. It is because of the evils pointed out by this article that we are required to raise such a huge revenue. I shall read a paragraph from the speech of thc President of the Bank of New South Wales, which . held its annual meeting of shareholders in Sydney yesterday. The President saidThe drain on local funds by Government and municipal borrowings appreciably affects the accumulation of deposits, and in turn the funds available for advances, and I desire to state here most emphatically that this continuous drain on our natural resources by the Government throughout Australia must be stopped if tlie country is to make headway, for it must be apparent to our thinking public 'that if the Governments persist in the policy they have pursued t""he last year or so of diverting whatever moneys they can collect to their own use, to the detriment of our grazing, agricultural and commercial development, so will they undermine private enterprise, which is the life-blood of advance : ment iu all progressive countries. thc Government collects That is the utterance of a responsible man at the head of one of our largest financial institutions.

One would think that in the face of these warnings the Government would realize that it was high time to shorten sail, but, in yachting parlance, instead of taking a rest, it is still running with tbe wind, with ringtails and spinnakers set, as if indifferent to the rising wind and the leesbore looming ahead. ber mention one instance of reckless expenditure? to go into this matter in detail if I bad been allowed to speak on the budget, but the honourable member, baving bad his innings, was amongst those who refused me an opportunity to speak. The reduction of the income tax and the maintenance of an undue proportion of indirect, taxation is not in accordance with the best teaching of economists and business men. The Government in continuing this policy has accepted a very grave responsibility. l*here are many aspects of the matter with which I could deal, but I sball not further detain the committee. I know that for tbe time being my protest is useless, but it is every man's a shortage of revenue. This policy is opduty to speak as he thinks. I wash my hands of all responsibility for this short sighted policy. That.the Government bas been aware of the approach of the present financial crisis is common knowledge. Three years ago the Prime Minister informed me that in his opinion Ave were galloping fast towards a serious financial crisis. What has he done to avert it? He is still expounding schemes for expenditure, still creating more revenues, still piling burdens on the people. I can do no more than enter my protest. It may be ineffective, but there is a growing rumble of discontent in the community; the people are becoming alarmed by the fears and dissatisfaction expressed by the press ancl responsible leaders of industry. It would be wrong for me to remain silent and disregard the true interests of this country. It is time we. retraced our steps. Over and over again tlie Prime Miinster has said Ave cannot do that. That is a declaration of weakness. A strong man, finding that he has made a mistake, Avill retrace his steps, and Avill not be afraid to take the responsibility of advising the people as to tbe course he considers rigbt and proper. The right honourable gentleman has in some States suggested that be agreed with the policy I have enunciated. He has indicated to tbe people of Western Australia on several occasions that he considers the present tariff policy is wrong, yet, by agreeing to a reduction of income tax he is shackling the high protective policy more firmly on the people. The idea that indirect taxation can be reduced by increasing customs duties is fallacious, and opposed to all I should have been glad experience. Each increase of tariff duty has been folloAved by a greater volume of importations and enhanced customs revenue. The piling up of duties, instead of reducing customs revenue, bas the reverse effect. We have evidence that this iniquitous policy is beginning to cause financial trouble among those manufacturing industries it is supposed to foster and protect. Yet Ave have before us a proposal to still further extend a system that is already stifling the country, ancl the Government is consolidating the evil by reducing income taxation, thereby rendering liigher tariff duties necessary in order to avoid posed to the teachings of experience and the advice of students; but, unfortunately, these matters are not decided after open debate and detailed consideration. During the last three days, Ave have had the rare experience of listening to a model debate, but on a lot of income tax details which, important though they be, are insignificant in comparison with great principles of taxation and general policy.

How can honourable members expect that there will be less revenue when the customs duties are increased? Failing the remedy which the honourable member for Henty said he had, when, speaking the other night, wby should the Government reduce indirect taxation ? All the newspapers throughout Australia havo been shrieking for a reduction in direct taxation. Probably 90 per cent, of t.he small wage-earners of the country pay no direct taxation at the present time. A few years ago the payment of a few pounds' income tax by the small wage-earners was looked upon as a great hardship. That burden has now been removed by raising the statutory exemption. It cannot be said, therefore, as was claimed by the honourable member for Dalley, that the Government proposes to relieve the wealthy of taxation at the expense of those wbo are less well off. Tbat is a most unfair statement to make in view of the record of the Government. 10,000 taxpayers whose average income was £5,000 a year, and who would each be relieved by this reduction to the extent the honourable of £191 a year in taxation. payers referred to have their money i i vested in enterprises which are vital to the welfare of Australia. A reduction of income tax does not necessarily benefit only a few wealthy persons living on private means. It benefits principally small companies. The great majority of companies operating in Australia are not wealthy. duals, not companies. nevertheless, have their money invested in shares, from which they derive their incomes. That is the usual form of investment in Australia. Eveni f they are relieved to the extent of £190 a year as tbe result of this proposed reduction it is a small amount when one considers the large amount of capital which tbey bave invested at great risk. reduction in income taxation, 'there has been an increase in indirect taxation. member can show how we can secure effective protection, and at the same time reduce indircet taxation upon the wage-earner, I shall be pleased to support him.

I disagree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) that a great catastrophe is threatening Australia. The honourable member did not indicate the nature of that catastrophe. When I asked him to do so, he said that I ought to know what it was, and that if I did not, I was not fit to be a member of this House.

If their income tax was increased enormously, as has .been suggested, they would have to go into liquidation. A.ti the present time one large manufacturing company contemplates going into voluntary liquidation, which would mean throwing 2,000 employees out of 'work. If there was a real danger of that occurring, this Parliament would be justified in taking almost any measures to keep those persons in employment. I regard employment as the greatest stabilising factor in any country. The duty of governments, both State and Federal, is at almost any cost to keep their people employed. There is no better way of doing that than by reducing taxation on incomes. Eveni f a few wealthy people benefit in consequence, what does that matter, so long as a great majority of the people do so? The worse thing that can happen to the workers of any country is that they be thrown out of employment. It does not matter to them then what in-, direct taxation they have to bear; they cannot keep themselves and have to accept charity. But give men employment at the high wages which rule in this country and under conditions approaching the ideal, and they have very little of which to complain. the honourable member to connect his re-' what I have long suspected in connection marks with the bill before the House. out that if direct taxation is not reduced, tbere will be unemployment, and that the worse thing that can happen to any country is for large numbers of its people to be out of work. When workers are receiving high wages, they are not so concerned about the burden of indirect taxation, but it is a different matter when they are out of work. The catastrophe that threatens this country is that of unemployment. If , by reducing taxation, the Government can reduce the risk of unemployment, it will do more to assist the country than any previous Government has done. sonal explanation. The honourable member for Now England( Mr Thompson) has misrepresented my position as a member of the Country party. I , therefore feel it my duty to make my position clear. I am pledged to a certain fiscal policy, namely, the abolition of protection in favour of a revenue tariff. At every Federal Convention, the Country party has declared itself in favour of the following objectiveCheapening and extending production by a reduction of duties on the staple necessities of the primary producer, and the admission of their implements and tools of trade free of duty when made within the British Empire. The constitution and rules of the Australian Farmers' Federal Organization, provide that among the objectives of the organization is oneTo put into practical effect the platform as promulgated from time to time by the conference of delegates. Honourable members will recognize that during the eight years I have been a member of this Parliament, I have acted consistently witb that platform. I do not desire to make a lengthy speech so late at night. In fact-, I come into the debate, as has so often happened recently, as a peace-maker, to pour oil on the troubled water stirred on the other side of tbe chamber by the course of the debate.

418,Mr Brennan (Batman) [10.37],"the hill so that my remarks shall not be irrelevant:-namely , that the Country party is not pledged to high duties, to low duties or to middle class duties; to an alliance with the Nationalist party, to its separate entity, to its conjunctivity; or, indeed, to anything on earth or in the heavens above. In that happy position I am prepared to leave him. of members .of tbe Country party is as understandable as it is deplorable. They are as uneasy as tbey deserve to be. It satisfies me, Mr Speaker, that they have the redeeming virtueorder. I understand that we are dealing with a bill for an act to impose taxes upon income. I fail to see the relevancy of the honourable member's remarks. able member for Batman has simply been criticizing tbe attitude of certain honourable members to tbe bill before tbe House. If tbe honourable member for Richmond( Mr Green) had been present during the whole of the debate, he would have beard otber bonorable members address the House in a similar strain. So. long as the honourable member for Batman confines himself to that-and I assume he will-h e will be in order. to confine myself to that, sir, because I had contemplated saying something about the merits and demerits of the bill. I understand that you, sir, with your usual perspicacity and keen observation of the essentials of debate, pointed out that tbe honourable member for New England had not up, to that point, wbich was considerably distant from tbe point of commencement, touched either the merits or demerits of the measure. member seems to be suffering from a fatal congestion of mental pabulum. moment of inexcusable weakness he admitted that in connection with taxation bills and all otber matters, he studiously reads all the newspapers. In that regard he reminds me painfully, of the chameleon whicb changes colour according to tbe colour placed in juxtaposition to it. If that colour is blue, it becomes blue; if the colour is red, it becomes red. Unfortunately somebody, testing it beyond its strength, placed a tartan alongside it and it burst. That has been the fate of the 0 honourable member. I notice that the Prime Minister has entered tbe chamber, and I feel very uneasy, because I conclude that be intends either to make a speech or to stop one, and neither prospect is very pleasing to me. Returning to the bill, I am against the reduction of direct taxationThe position especially that class of taxation which falls, as it should, upon those who by reason of their financial standing are peculiarly able to bear it-a t a time when taxation is being added and super-added by the indirect method to those least able to bear it. Wben the budget was under discussion we made frequent requests, backed by strong arguments, for a declaration by tbe Government"" of what it proposed to do to relieve an admittedly most unsatisfactory financial position. And the answer was, "" Not yet."" Since then, and, indeed, before then, the Government bas taken certain definite courses of action which have been deliberately designed to pile up the burdens of the poor and l if t the burdens from the rich. ^ ment, and ask that it be withdrawn. ber for Batman is within his rights of criticism. What he has said may' be an entire misstatement of the facts$ but be is entitled to state what in his opinion will be the general effect of the Government's policy. used the words ""deliberately designed.""

Whatever may be the intention of the Government, it is a curious and almost sinister fact that ever since this Parliament has been sitting in Canberra, the course of legislation has been directed along the lines I have indicated. Now, in the first definite measure with which the House has been asked to deal since the budget was so summarily and ignominiously disposed of by a deliberate declaration, tbe burdens are being taken off tbe rich and retained on the poor.

The records of the House, whioh I am not permitted to quote, show clearly what I said, and I well remember my statement. It was that those honourable members had been returned on the new State issue, and the tactics of their leader had been such that their efforts were barren of achievement.
