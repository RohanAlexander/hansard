It is in respect to that the Commonwealth Governmentbeen .conland that we are in negotiation with sulted in the matter; and how comes it that Messrs.

The question of land grants in those islands is not in a very determined position yet, because, as I have informed honourable members, negotiations are proceeding between the Governments of Great Britain and France to see whether some tribunal cannot be established to inquire into land disputes there; but there is a great deal of land in the hands of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. which is not, and never has been, the subject of dispute. I hope to be in a position within a few days to lay some papers upon the table relating to a contract which the Government propose to enter into, and which will, perhaps, have then been entered into, with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. in extension of the contract which they already possess with the Government of New South Wales, and which we are advised has become a contract under the Constitution of the Federal Government. I have been in negotiation with the company to see whether, for a slightly larger sum, the service cannot be carried on with white crews instead of with coloured labour. I hope, also, to be able to announce the speedy completion of an agreement under which, for a very slight additional rate, the service will be extended from the New Hebrides and the Solomon groups to the Gilbert and Ellice groups, and more frequent visits will be paid to the New Hebrides. I hope, further, to be able to announce that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. will be willing, in consideration of the contract, to throw open to settlers, at long leases and. at nominal they hold in the New Hebrides, they agreeing to bring the intending settlers and their, belongings to the New Hebrides free pose to itself become, or to attempt to",14,Setup

I think it will be found that this is a perfectly feasible arrangement, and that it will be carried out so far as the payment for the contract and the development of the mail service is concerned, at a very cheap rate j that it will be very largely in the interests of the Commonwealth, and that there will be reason to conclude from it that there will now be, for the first time, a proper and an open opportunity for English settlement to proceed in the New Hebrides at the same pace as that at which French settlement has been proceeding, an object very much to be desired. There are, however, obstacles, but I think I shall be able to over the Federal Government. I take it that come them. The contract between Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. and the New South Wales Government, although for a term of ten years, is terminable upon the failure or refusal of Parliament to grant supply for the purposes of the annual payments, and in any contract that we make we shall give the same opportunity to Parliament, so that the moment the vote comes on Parliament will be able to say whether it will or will not endorse what has been done by the Government. land grab like that we had in New Brothers and Co.'s electrical rock drills (which Guinea. a land grab. the Prime Minister if the land referred to is not land acquired in the first instance by the Australian New Hebrides Company, a company consisting of citizens of the Commonwealth, and formed to preserve British interests in the New Hebrides?

The firm of Messrs.

Australian New Hebrides Company was not a success, and parted with its rights, which were acquired as the French New Hebrides Company acquired its rights, to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. I understand, too, that the French New Hebrides Company has failed, and that an attempt to resuscitate it also failed. I see no reason to anticipate any withdrawal from their contract on the part of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co., and there are reasons why they should be prepared not to withdraw, but to work in a spirit of co-operation with under these circumstances any policy which leaves it open to tlie Federal Government, without permitting itself to become a landholder, to assist, even indirectly, the acquisition of British rights in the New Hebrides, will be one that will be accept . able to this Parliament.

Sir WILLIAM M c MILLAN (Wentworth) I should like to know if the Treasurer intends to make any statement in regard to this division ?' I ca!n scarcely imagine that after the debatewhich has taken place upon previous divisions-, and the general expressionof opinion against composite duties, he intendsto' proceed with the programme originally laid down by the Government. I do not think it would be expedient to allow the discussion to proceed with a view to seeing how the cat w i ll jump. There should be some declaration' from the Treasurer as to whether the proposal in the Tariff is the proposal which he really intends toplace before the committee. Personally I am very anxious, as are all the members on this side of the Chamber, to conserve time, and tofacilitate the passing of .the Tariff, and I therefore ask my right honourable friend if he does not intend to make a proposal which will simplify our deliberations ? to make any other proposal at the present time. that after the discussion which we had upon the proposed duties on' hats, and the general trend of our delibera>tions, the Government would have made some other proposal. The duties now proposed practically amount to-prohibition. I do not want to be continually arguing and re-arguing the same thing, but I feel bound to again point out that, despite the pledge of the Prime Minister that we should have a Tariff which would secure revenue without destruction of industries, and which would go neither to free-trade nor to protectionist extremes, we have, in regard to one of the largest industries in Australia, a proposal which practically amounts to the prohibition of importations. I wish to know from the Government if, after the pledges of the Prime Minister, and the votes that have been taken incommitteewhich place 10, 15, and 25 per cent, as practically the high-water mark of protection-the y now intend to propose what is, practically, prohibition? The Treasurer expects to obtain £30,000 of revenue fromNew South Wales from the proposed duties. A duty of 25 per cent, upon the importation of boots into New South Wales in 1S99 would have returned £73,000, and a duty of 50 per cent., which is a very low average for the duties proposed, would have returned £146,000. We find, however, that the total amount of revenue 1 expected from these duties on boots is £68,000, whereas, if the duties were reduced by at least one-half, the .revenue in> New South Wales alone would amount to£73^000. If this is not practically prohibition, I do not know what is. In spite 1 of the pledges made by the Prime Minister in his Maitland speech, we are asked to impose prohibitive duties' in respect to a great industry which has its ramificationsall over Australia'. If this division is passed as it stands, we shall practically shut out all importations of boots with the excep-' tien of afew goods of special kinds, whicb people would import under any circumstancesi We may be told that highduties were imposed in! some of the Statesprior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, but there is a great difference' between framing . a national Tariff and formulating a Tariff for single States whichhave their borders I am not prepared closed against the productions of their neighbours. We are making a Tariff which will apply only to goods comingfrom the outside world, and a Tariff which is I thought essentially designed, to a large extent, for revenue purposes. Of the boots used in New South Wales, 66per cent, have been made within the State under free-trade conditions, leaving only about 30 per cent, to be imported, and in view of this fact, where aretlie Government to look for revenue if enormously high duties are imposed? The' duty on men's boots will range from 61 to 33 per cent, under the composite duties which have been so cleverly designed in order to shut the eyes of the people to the real effect of the imposts. When the Tariff was introdnced we were told by Ministers that the duties provided for would range from 10 to 25 per cent. But here we find them varying from 1 31 to 66 per cent. Upon youths' boots of sizes above 1, the duties range from 58 to 30' per cent.; on women's boots, from 50 to 30 per cent.; and so on, the average all round being about 40per cent. We seem to be dealing with the Tariffi n a haphazard way, just as one of the State Tariffs might",15,Tariff
14,Sir George Turner,,16,Tariff
15,Sir William Mcmillan,"be dealt with after a dozen revisions. A national Tariff should be framed upon broad national lines. After ""having imposed a duty of 25 per cent, on clothing and 15 per cent, on woollens, how can we justify our action to the public if, with our eyes open, and with a f u l l knowledge of what is covered by these composite duties, we place upon boots imposts ranging from 30 to 60 per cent ? I really thought that, in order to save time, the Ministers would have told us that after the condemnation by the committee of the. principle of composite duties, the Government were ready to give way. The actions of the Ministry have proved that they either brought down proposals for high duties because they thought they might have to reduce them, or that they have been absolutely regardless of their pledges. The fact that they expect to derive only £68,000 from the duties on boots shows that rates have been fixed with the deliberate intention to shut out importations altogether. Is there any necessity for this 1 Is the boot industry one in which there should be no competition? I have heard honourable members sitting on the Government benches say that they would repudiate any attempt to impose prohibitive duties because they would kill all competition. The duties now proposed, however, are jiart of a project to destroy competition. It does not require any elaborate argument to show that these duties will give to the bootmakers of Australia a practical monopoly of the trade of the Commonwealth. I defy the Treasurer to deny it . What places the boot industry in a position different from that occupied by others ? We have reduced the duties upon many articles of a class exactly similar to boots, so far as the general public are concerned. No necessity has been shown for extending special consideration to the boot industry. Surely, when we reach a division of this kind, dealing with one of the greatest industries in Australia, we have a right to ask the Minister in charge to justify proposals for duties ranging from 30 to 60 per cent. 1 There has been no policy disclosed and no courage of opinion displayed by the Ministry in dealing with the Tariff. I asked the Treasurer if he had anything to say regarding this division, and he said "" No . "" The bone is thrown to the dogs to fight over, and the result will be seen after a certain amount of debate, and after opinions expressed by their supporters indicate to the 30 F 2 Ministry what they should do. W ill any honourable member say that these proposals are not an outrage of the sacred pledges of the Ministry with regard to the national Tariff? Some honourable members who have supported the Government have cared nothing for the promises made at Maitland, or for the Ministerial pledges, but have preached absolute prohibition. When we haveprotested that their proposals would keep out imports, they have retorted, "" A very good thing, too."" Perhapsi t would be better in the interests of the party I represent to allow this division to pass as it is, because if ever there were a damning proof of absolute breach of faith it is contained in this division. We do not, however, intend to resort to any such tactics. In the first place, a breach of faith has been committed, and secondly, there is absolute inconsistency between this divison and other parts of the Tariff, which Ministers ought to make some attempt to explain. We have not all been Tariff driven in Australia. We have not all been the slaves of a protective system, and surely the representatives of New. South Wales and other States where customs duties have not been so onerous as in Victoria, .have a right to expect from the Ministry an explanation why such outrageous duties as these should be imposed. In Victoria protectionist duties were imposed upon boots, but in New South Wales they were admitted free. Still boots were manufactured as cheaply in that State as in Victoria. The New South Wales manufacturers were able to supply two-thirds of the public requirements, and the only reason why boots were not sent to Victoria was that the manufacturers of the mother State were shut out by an absolutely prohibitive Tariff. Now we have placed before us proposals which, although not adopting the exact figures of the Victorian Tariff, embody the same principle and its very essence. Who is going to pay the piper for all this ? Isi t the rich man ? What does it matter to the'rich man if he has to pay a little more for the imported boots which he wears ? The poorer classes of the population will feel the pressure of these iniquitous duties, and under the guise of a great national policy there lies the hidden snake of protected monopolies and of a raid upon the working man. The boot manufacturing industry does not require elaborate protection. No elaborate machinery is employed, no trade secrets are involved, and generations of experience are not required in order to follow it up successwere desirous of obtaining from the better fully. It is a natural industry, similar to that of furniture making, in connection with -which we have imposed a duty of 25 per cent. Why should a distinction be made between the rate of duty imposed upon furniture, and that which it is proposed to levy upon boots and shoes ? W ill the Treasurer explain the difference between the manufacture of furniture and that of boots, from the point of view of protection? honourable.member who favours the Government scheme tell me-becaus e as sensible men we have a right to know these thingswhat is the essential difference between the manufacture of furniture, upon which we imposed a 25 per cent, rate last week, and the manufacture of boots, upon which it is proposed to levy a duty of from 30 to 50 per cent. ? I want that question answered. -the furniture have no votes and the manufacturers of boots have. That is the whole point. . .sults from the fact that in Victoria .an elaborate system, existed under which every duty was so carefully graduated .and planned that in each case it practically represented prohibition-the exclusion of the article upon which the tax was levied. 'There is no sense in such a system. In view of the pledges of the Government, the -committee, as a matter of consistenc} , 'fair7 play, and honesty, ought to demand the . abolition of all these composite duties,and the .substitution of a fair ad valorem rate having regard to the other industries with which we have already dealt. considering the matter I fail to see why such a determined set should be made . against the composite rates. I believe that in many instances they constitute the -fairest impost which can be levied, taking into consideration the fact that some . articles ought to bear a fixed duty. Where .a specific rate only is collected it usually represents a high duty upon the poorer class of goods, and a comparatively low rate -upon the better class. The proposal of the vGovernment was adopted w it h' a view to lessening the difference between the rates. ""Whilst imposing a fair protective rate upon Treasurer alter his system of making these -ihe lower and medium classes of articles, for calculations ? which we have a large local market, we class of goods a greater revenue than had been derived from them in the past. I regret that a majority of this committee appear to entertain views adverse to composite rates. I recognise that it is useless for me to attempt to fight for those rates in connection with this particular item. Therefore, I do not propose to do so. But I wish strongly to urge that the boot and shoe industry is W ill any entitled to a fair amount of protection in the form of a fixed duty-suc h a measure of protection as will give the local manufacturers an opportunity of competing in the poorer and medium classes of goods. Under these circumstances, I purpose asking the committee to impose, not ad valorem rates, but fixed duties upon the articles which are enumerated in the Tariff. The boot and shoe industry is not one which, can be said to employ only two men and a boy. It gives employment within the Commonwealth to between 11,000 and 12,000 people. We have been very careful, indeed, to avoid doing anything which would enable a large quantity of boots and shoes to be It reimported into Australia to the detriment of an established industry. That is' the evil against which we wish to guard, and I ask the committee to deal with the matter from that stand-point. Therefore, I appeal to honourable members to sanction the imposition of such a fixed duty as will enable the industry to continue, and our own people to be employed. In this connection I would point out that no less than 4,812 persons find employment in the industry in Victoria, and 3,953 in New South Wales. Of course I admit that it is difficult to obtain exact figures with regard to the manufacture of boots, but I may mention that I have today been supplied with a return by the Comptroller-General of Customs, having reference to the output of boots in New South Wales and Victoria during the vears 1899 and 1900. From that document I find .that in 1899 New South Wales manufactured 3,207,000 pairs of boots, as against 2,929,000 pairs manufactured in Victoria. In 1900 the former State turned out 3,269,000 pairs-practicall y the same number as was made in the previous yearas against 3,346,000 pairs manufactured by the latter.",16,Tariff

South Wales has been increasing. increased to any considerable extent during that the Americans, during the past two or the past two years. But in Victoria the three years, for various reasons, and not different results which have followed from solely on account of the large duty which the adoption of a protective policy are at operated in the United States, have been once apparent. In this State, the imports able to manufacture boots and shoes to an in 1898 were valued at £34,000 ; in 1899, enormous extent, and we all realize that the at £32,000 ; and in 1900, at £43,000.

32,Sir George Turner,"I think it is-evidenced by the statistics, that the exportation of boots and shoes from the United States is increasing at a rapid rate. The value of the exports of boots and shoes from that country last year amounted to £963,803, against £764,257 in the preceding year, and £405,088 in 1898. Honourable members will therefore see that im'mense strides are being made in the boot -export trade of the United States. A large portion of these boots were shipped to the United Kingdom, the importations from Americai n 1898 representing a value of £72,000, whilst in 1900 they had increased to £228,000. The importations from the United States into British Australasia in 1898 aggregated a value of £67,000, whilst in 1900 they had increased to £278,000. It is evident, therefore, that our friends in the United States are to a large extent capturing the boot trade, not only of Great Britain, but also of the colonies. It will be noticed that the larger portion of these Australasian importations found its way into New South Wales. An boots are better finished articles than are those locally manufactured -in New South Wales are persons who lieve that they are better finished articles. In New South Wales and Victoria we make boots of as good material and finish as are produced in any part of the world. America, however, isable to export to such -a large extent because her manufacturers specialize more than we do, and are thus -able to manufacture much more cheaply, having regard to our smaller population -worth. We ought to be careful not 'to cut Sir Treasurer's argument for prohibition 1 desire prohibition. I wish to have a real Australian industry for the Australians, if I can get it . No doubt the manufacturers of the United States are making rapid strides. They are exporting large quantities of. boots into Germany, as is evidenced by the fact that only a few months ago the Germans had to consider whether they would not increase the duties upon those articles in order to prevent the large inroads being made upon their own -markets. It -is wise,' in a case of this kind, ""to have fixed and not ad valorem duties. Fixed duties have been the practice in several of 'the States, and I know that in 'Victoria, several years ago, when we had ad valorem rates, we did not collect the amount of duty which ought to have resulted. From information I have from the Customs officers there is no doubt that ad valorem rates with regard to boots and shoes do not work well, and, in addition, I may say that fixed rates will give us practically the command of the market in the lower and medium-priced grades of goods, and allow the free importation of the better class of goods, which are consumed by those who can afford to pay for them. Honourable members of the Oppo. sition are wrong if they think that the poor man in Australia is going to wear imported boots. We hear very often that the farmer will be penalized, if not ruined because he has to pay more for his boots in consequence of the duty; but any one who has inquired into the question knows f u l l well that the farmer and labourer wear, not imported boots, but home-made boots, which can be got of good quality and at very reasonable cost. ' cheaper in Victoria than in New Southi t 'will be said that the farmers and labourers wear large quantities of better class imported boots and shoes. I ask the committee to consider this matter very carefully lest we take any step which will allow, not only the United States, but other countries which produce more largely and more cheaply, to send here their surplus products, which were described by another name a few nights ago by the honourable member for 'WentWe are 'told that 'there ought to be no I do not monopoly, but that we ought to have competition.

No one is more strongly opposed than I -am to any duty which may create a monopoly. 'But Avhen we .have competition with -'the outside world, and internal competition with -regard to -articles -we can well make, we have done all that we can be expected to do in the 'interests of the consumer.

It is not the rate of duty that the consumer is so much concerned about, .as it is the price he has to pay for his '.boots. . not affect the price, I suppose 1 say t h a t ; but if -we take off the duty, or put on too low a duty, and seriously injure .or cripple the industry here, the persons who import boots, and the persons who sell them in the exporting countries, and who have to allow a considerable proportion for the duty, will, once they get command of the market, raise prices very considerably. in New South Wales1 export much of these manufactures. ports a certain quantity. valued at £43,000. bagatelle. The manufacturers of boots and shoes have to pay duty on much of the material which they use, and it is to their credit that the local article is used to a great -extent. But there are some articles which have to be imported, and which necessarily bear some d u t y ; and the very fact that a large quantity of Australian produce is used for this purpose shows that the more boots .we can make here the more employment we give to the other persons engaged in that particular line. That consideration should-weigh with us .in dealing-with this question. We are told that 60 per cent, of the boots and shoes used in New South Wales are manu-factured in that State; but there ,is no doubt that a larger percentage would be of local manufacture if there were reasonable -protection. Customs authorities by Mr Enoch Taylor, of Sydney, it .is said that if a duty were imposed onerhalf of .the goods now imported into New South Wales would undoubtedly be made Surely that is something we -should help to bring about, if possible. The more employment we give to people in such an industry, and the more we manufacture, the more cheaply will each individual article be, and keen competition will undoubtedly bring especially when we know that manufacturers in the various States will have to .compete, not only with the outside world, subjeet to the duty, but amongst themselves on equal terms. Australia has been established in New duty does -South Wales under free-trade. I will not certain about that. We have had certain, figures quoted; but I think we have factories as large in Victoria. In New South Wales, those who are described as manufacturers also carry on the business of importers, and it is somewhat difficult to distinguish those .who are actively engaged in manufacturing from those who are engaged in the importing'branch. encouragement to labour ? certainly .does afford a certain amount of labour, but manufacturing gives employment to twice or three times .as many not only in the particular industry, but in other industries which are assisted by it . -That is not a We often hear of the great boot and shoe industry which is carried on in New Zealand under the duty .of 22 per cent.

I hope that in a few years, after we have got rid of flie little feeling which, perhaps, still exists, more or less, the people in New South Wales will feel more satisfied to buy boots from Victoria if they do not like their home-made articles, than those imported from the United States, Germany, and other places. We, in Victoria, shall also be very glad to buy boots made by our friends in Sydney, if these can be sold cheaper than our own make. We need not have any fear of a ring in connection with this industiy. I have here a statement which was sent to me a day or two ago by Mr Harkness, a well-known bootmaker. I have not been able to obtain the original of the extracts forwarded to me, but I may fairly assume that the information is correct. I want to impress this particular phase of the subject on honourable members, so that they may not be led away with any desire to make the duty too low and thus enable our markets to be flooded and our own makers to be thrown out of employment, as has been the case in Great Britain. Northampton is a place in England where the . boot industry was large and flourishing. A paragraph in the London Daily Express of December last statesNorthampton is the first English town seriously to feel the wave of depression now passing overEurope. Seven hundred men are out of work payment are said to vary in different factories, there, the unemployed women are counted by the but to be very low in all of them.

Northampton cannot make boots to compete with America? cause of the enormous output in America. The manufacturers in the United States have their own markets, and, as I said before, where there is an enormous output, the cost of the individual I think Vicarticles must be very largely reduced. In addition, where there is an immense population, particular factories are enabled to turn out special classes of goods, which, again, means reduced cost and cheap selling prices. and material is dearer in America than here. South Wales the President of the Chamber of Commerce, in August, 1900, drew attention to the great depression, more especially in the boot and shoe trade, and showed that from 1896 to 1900 there was an increase of only eleven in the number of persons employed. As to New South Wales, the Sydneg Morning Herald of the 2nd September last gave an account of the low wages said to be earned in the boot and shoe industry in that State. I do not want to enter into the question of wages as between the two States. Figures and averages as to the wages of men, women, and boys may be quoted, but unless one is perfectly sure of the ground, and that like is compared with like, it is very difficult to say whether the rates are higher or lower in a particular State. We have heard it alleged that rates of wages are higher in Sydney than in Melbourne. It is difficult to arrive at any standard, but this is what a Sydney journal saysW it h regard to the rate of wages the scales of be made to have them raised to something like a fair return for the labour given.

Here we have the statement made that the hoot operatives in New South ""Wales were working only half-time at the same time that immense quantities of boots and shoes were imported from America and other places. Surelyi t is not reasonable not to try to assist the boot operatives throughout the Commonwealth to obtain as much employment in their industry as they possibly can. I hope the committee are not going to take any step which will largely increase the importation of boots and shoes into the Commonwealth, but will rather take such a stand as will enable the industry to be carried on by our own people.

Personally, I trust that when Parliament revises the Tariff-sa y in ten years' time-honorabl e members will have realized the benefit of the composite duties. duties after the next election ! my honourable friend will be here to assist in tlie task. I should be sorry to miss him. I do not want to move an amendment at present, because I wish the committee to .have a fair opportunity for a general discus.sion. I hope, however, that the debate will not be long. The fixed rate in Victoria on this line is 60s., in Queensland 33s., and in ' South Australia 33s. I intend to propose a fixed duty of 40s. per dozen pairs on men's sizes above 5. The officers of the Customs have worked out the rates at what we think would be equivalent to a proper degree of protection. PerhapsI may be permitted now to quote the proposed new rates, so that honourable members may mark them down. On youths' sizes above 1 I shall propose that the rate be 25s. per dozen pairs; on boys' 7 to 1, 15s. ; women's sizes above '2, 25s.; girls' sizes .above 10,18s.; girls', 7 to 10, 13s.; leather slippers, 10s. Those rates are what we think would be a fair protection, averaging about 30 or 35 per cent, all round. amounts to SO per cent. honourable -friend think that 3s. 9d., boots -will be imported 1 I am perfectly certain that those who wear imported boots do:not buy boots-costing 3s..9d. per-pair. They are much more likely to buy boots costing 39s. per pair. I have now placed the matter as f u l l y as I could before the committee, and I trust that whatever is done we shallfixsuch rates as give a reasonable amount of protection. The advice I .have obtained from the experts of the Custom-house would be infinitely better to .have .fixed rates than ad valorem :rates. Jhouse officers prefer -fixed rates ? -posed them because the-fixed rates prevent the under valuation which experience showed took place with' regard to boots and shoes a :few years ago. Pixed rates' are also in line with the policy pursued by three Statesi n the past; they work out better in regard to numbers and sizes; and they give a better rate of protection. I do trust that, viewing the magnitude of this industry and the large number of persons employed in it , and seeing the competition we shall have, from the United States and other places, honourable members will not consent to a rate of duty which ^ ill not be protective -If they do, we shall be simply throwing open our markets to the sweepings of the surplus stocks of the old world; we shall seriously injure our manufactures; and in the long run I believe the consumer will suffer. Under all the circumstances I trust the committee will consent to place a fair amount of pro-' tection upon these articles, .and by the imposition of fixed rates of duty. worth) On behalf of honourable members on this side, I absolutely protest against this most extraordinary behaviour on the part of the Government. This matter has been gestating for an exceedingly long time, and yet at the very moment the committee is asked to deal -with it , we have an entire change of front. The Government abandon the ad valorem principle, and propose increased fixed rates of duties without any notice -to this committee or to the public, and without any chance of criticism being directed against the proposal.

81,Sir William Mcmillan,"ThisOctober, and this division has been in the hands of the Ministry, and it is only at the last moment we are informed of this big alteration in the proposals of the Government. The thing is absurd on the face of it, and shows that there is absolutely no kind of united consideration of measures by the present Cabinet. I have no desire to speak in any way against time. bers opposite all know the invoice prices of boots very much better than I do. tell my right honourable friend that what we intend to fight for upon this item is a proper ad valorem duty. An ad vedorem duty is absolutely tlie soundest duty to impose where we can get at the value of an article. It has been agreed to in this committee time after time, and when we have agreed to place a fixed duty upon any particular item, it has been simply because certain considerations and surroundings connected with the articles included have made it very difficult to get at their real value. Where we can get at the real value of an article, there is no question as between an ad valorem and a fixed duty, because an ad valorem duty presses heaviest upon those who are best able to bear it. It is a duty upon will be prepared to agree, but we are a graduated scale, by which the poor man pays only his proportion, and the rich man has to pay his. Of course, it is proposed here to vary the fixed duty, but a fixed duty has two objections. In the first place, it is a stupid mechanical operation, which does not touch the real per centage of value, and, in the second place, nine times out of ten it is a blind to cover what we are doing. am not going to decide upon this proposal without consultation. The Ministry, no doubt, qpnsult about what they are going to do, but we are also a party, and we have to consult amongst ourselves. I do not venture to get up in this Chamber and decide of my own will exactly what we are going to propose as a counter proposal to that of the Government. We have to consult amongst ourselves, and, meanwhile, the debate must proceed on this proposal, which has been sprung upon us by the Government, without any notice whatever. proposal from the other side. MrL . E. GROOM -Will the honorindustry, and that a moderate ad valorem able gentleman suggest what he thinks the duty in this case would be quite sufficient ad valorem duty ought to be ? not going now to fix what the ad valorem duty should be, but we have carried out the ad valorem .system in the case of almost every great industry in the country. We have agreed to fixed duties upon groceries and other things to which they are more applicable, but when we have dealt with the great manufacturing industries of Australia we have always carried out the ad valorem principle. As I said before, we are willing to agree to an ad valorem duty in connection with this industry, to place it on I will a consistent footing with the other industries in connection with which we have already imposed duties. I am not going to say what the duty should be in this case, but we have already agreed to ad valorem duties of 15, 20, and 25 per cent. hats and umbrellas. WhatI say now is that we will divide the committee on the question whether this industry has anything in its essence, or in the conditions by which it is surrounded, that differentiates it from all the other industries in connection with which we have agreed to ad valorem duties. I am not going to say now to what duty we absolutely and irrevocably opposed to a fixed duty, because it is a wrong kind of duty, and is absolutely inconsistent with the previous work of the committee. of the committee to say whether there shall be a fixed duty or an ad valorem duty. all that. We shall propose a certain duty which we consider a fair one as soon as the debate has developed. I have not had time to consult with honourable members on this side, but if we had had the notice which the Government should' have given us of this proposal we should have been able to announce some decision. The debate must now go on, and the Government must expect that members of this party, and others, will take breathing time before they come to a conclusion.

89,I Sir William Mcmillan,"I knowcomplaint of the honourable member for ""Wentworth in his second speech is that the Treasurer has sprung a proposal upon him as to which members on the other side have had no time to study or consult. The honourable gentleman says that the Government have had from October last to make up their minds about this particular industry, and should have been in a position to tell the committee at once, or, at any rate, some time earlier than to-day, what .they intended to do. But the honourable gentleman forgets, or fails to observe, that the very same thing is true of himself. In his first speech this afternoon, and now in his second speech, he has announced to the committee that honourable members opposite intend to support an ad valorem duty. Yet when he was asked by the honourable member for Darling Downs what rate of ad valorem duty he would suggest, the honourable gentleman replied that he had not yet had time to consult his party. The honourable gentleman, as well as the Treasurer, has had arerple time since October last in which to consult his party. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN lowed to say, by way of explanation, that the Opposition expected that the Government, because of what took place in regard to the duties upon hats, would propose an ad valorem instead of a composite duty upon boots. When the Government tell us, as they did in regard to tlie duties upon hats, what they intend to propose as an equivalent for the proposed composite duty upon boots, we can consider it ; but until then, as the honourable member knows, it is not our duty to decide what to do. That is why I am in the position in which I am now. cuse is better than none. WhatI said was that the honourable member in both his speeches this afternoon announced that it is part of the policy of the Opposition to advocate an ad valorem duty upon boots and shoes. If that is so,' he should be prepared to announce what rate the Opposition are prepared to accept in place of the rate fixed by the Government Sir WILLI AM McMILLAN before the day-closes. member tells us that he has not yet had time to consult his party, and in the same breath he said that he wishes to save time. If , before sitting down, he had proposed a certain duty, and had placed it against the Treasurer's proposal, he would have saved time, because then all we should have had to do would be to decide between his proposal and that of the Government. As one of the rank and file in this House, I rather resent the tone which he adopted in speaking upon the position of the Government and upon the attitude of those who support them. He referred to there being a monopoly of common sense upon his side of the Chamber. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I did not say that. member twitted the Government with having broken faith, and s^oke of the Opposition as a betrayed minority, and as a respectable minority representing a majority of the people of the Commonwealth. I do not grudge them their respectability. honourable member to confine himself to the item before the Chair. There is no amendment before the committee. M a y I be alduct the debate according to the established rules of Parliament, but I think that honourable members should be allowed to reply to remarkswhich are offensive to those who are endeavouring to do the best they can for the people whom they represent. The speech of the honourable member for Wentworth consisted chiefly of abuse of the Government and praise of the Opposition, but in dealing with the question before the committee, he said that the rich man does not care if he has to pay a little more for his boots. I do not know that we are to take into account the feelings of either the rich man or the poor man on this subject, but, in my opinion, it would be better ^for the rich man to have to pay a little more for his boots than for the poor man to have to do so. The imposition of a fixed duty upon boots is a better thing for the poor man than the imposition of an ad valorem duty, because under a fixed duty only the better quality of boots will be imported, and the boots worn by persons of the middle and poorer classes will be boots manufactured We shall doit within the Commonwealth.

An ad valorem rate could not give them the same amount of protection as the proposed fixed duties. Further, the boot manufacturers and operatives throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia all approve of the imposition of fixed rates, which is a reason, in addition to those given by the Treasurer, for adopting specific rates. The question asked by the honourable member for Wentworth as to why the Americans were able to manufacture boots, and to.send them into this and the* English market at lower rates than they could be manufactured foriocally, is a very pertinent one; but if he had studied the subject as I have, he would probably have arrived at the same conclusion-. I find that, in the early nineties, the Americans had, by reason of their immensehome market being -conserved to them, sodeveloped their trade that internal competition was stimulated to an extraordinary degree, and, as a result, they were enabled to specialize and organize their machinery in such a fashion as no manufacturers elsewhere were able to do. factories. tories were better equipped, first, be-cause of the splendid protection given to them by their Tariff; secondly, because of the immense volume of trade which it secured to them; thirdly, because of the competition which naturally sprang up between the different States, and, in the last independent investigations-notabl y those place, because of the specialization and organization which took place. can be duplicated here. they have not been duplicated here will be apparent as my argument proceeds, but before federation, no one State had a population . exceeding 1,000,000 people, Whereas the population of the United States of America runs into scores of millions. The Americans have so developed their machinery and resources, that at the time. I speak of they were unrivalled in the manufacture of boots and shoes, as can be proved by figures and statistics taken from trade journals throughout the world. Having all the benefits which I have enumerated conferred upon them, the time came when they must export, and they naturally directed their attention to those markets where the greatest field was offered to them, and seized upon practically the whole of the British possessions and Great Britain itself. They began to export to Australia in 1891 or 1892, just when our period of depression was at its very worse. The boot trade of Australia, which had been employing thousands of operatives in all the , States, feeling the keen competition of the American manufacturers, had first to reduce wages, and then to reduce hands, and when the operation of tlie Reid Tariffi n New South Wales began to be felt, still further additions were made to the unemployed market of that State. tion-to-its output of boots. presently. In Victoria, a tremendous agitation then sprang up for the extension of theFactories Act to the boot trade, so that a minimum rate of wage might be fixed, and the hours of labour shortened. That agitation has since extended to New South Wales, and the relief sought for is likely to be obtained by the operation of theArbitration Act which has recently been passed there. wages board defeated in the boot trade of Victoria1 board has fixed a minimum rate of 42s. per week, whereas, according to Coghlan, the rate in New South Wales is 33s. 8d. per week, and the actual earnings, according to of the Sydney Morning Herald-fro m 25s. to 28s. per week. days in the week honourable member not to discuss the question of wages.

I asked the honourable member to confine himself to an incidental reference to the wages question. I ruled that it was not competent to elaborate that point by giving examples of the rates of wages paid in Victoria and New South ""Wales. concluded my remarks upon that phase of the ^question. With, improved machinery,, and a large market, the cost of production, may be reduced without at the same time involving the payment of a lower rate of wages. There is a machine known as the consolidated boot laster, which, if not an American invention,is very largely used in that country. It is capable of turning off 400 pairs of boots per day with the service very largefactories in America. The of five men. If only 200 pairs per day are thus dealt with the services of five men are still required to work the machine; and thereaccording to the last American Boot Trade fore if the machine can be kept in full, work for six days as compared with three days of the week, the cost of producing the boots must necessarily be reduced. In the light of facts like these the bearing of an immense home market upon the use of machinery and the cost of production at once becomes apparent.. If we had a market equal to that of the Americans, we should be able to keep machines of this kind in f u l l work, and possibly reduce the cost of production to the same extent as they do. market is not equal to theirs, we could not possibly hopeto compete with them under conditions such, as those which existed pi'ior to the introduction of the federal Tariff.' I may mention another instance which w ill give ppint to my remarks. Glace kid which enters very largely into the construction) of the better class of boots, was at one time a purely French speciality. Later on it was manufactured by the Germans, but now its manufacture is piiactically wholly in the hands of the Americans. A man' named Foerderer discovered the way in which this kid was made, and owing tothelarge home market secured by the American Tariff and the consequent immensedemand,, he has developed such a trade that he is actually exporting glace-kid to other parts of the world. Mr Foerderer is thelargest single employer of labour in the world, and his business has been built up practically as theresult of the protection which has been afforded to the boot manufacturers of America. In the United States the factories are I gave no such rulworked on what is known as the "" one line "" basis. One manufacturer will turn out from 5,000 to 8,000 pairs of boots per day, and will make only two lines-certainl y not more than three-wherea s in Australia it is difficult to find a factory that does not manufacture, perhaps, 2.0 or 30 lines-. This specialization reduces the cost of production very materially. As the result of all this organization, and special effort on the part of the American's, the-Australian manufacturers had, prior to the introduction of the Tariff, to labour under another disability which, in the absence of a large market, it was utterly impossible for them to contend against. Specialization such as I have referred to has led to the establishment of Leicester factory in New York, has a daily out-put of 18,000 pairs of boots, and Journal the proprietor is directing his efforts to the increase of his plant and machineryso that he may work his factory up to a daily output of 30,000 pairs of boots. Such an enormous volume of production would not be possible except in an immense home market, a i d these large operations have been encouraged by the splendid protective duties which the Americans have imposed in order to assist their industries. Unless we are prepared to do something similar, how can we Inasmiuch, however, as our expect OUT industriesto be built up ? As the result of their magnificent trade developments the American, manufacturers' are sending their boots and shoes to all parts of the world-eve n to Great Britain itself. The increase in the value of the exports of boots and shoes from the United Kingdom between 1898 and 1900 amounted to nearly £250',000On the other hand the balance between English exports and imports of boots and shoes during the last nine years shows the round sum of nearly £1,000,000 to the bad. Practically the whole of this trade which has been lost to the United Kingdom has gone to the Americans for the reasons I have mentioned. happened in Germany? losing their boot trade to America for the reasons I have already given ; but theGermans' have taken special precautions",28,William Mcmillan The Affairs And I Know What His Answer Would

109,Mr Hughes,Has not a similar thing,29,William Mcmillan The Affairs And I Know What His Answer Would
110,Mr Hume Cook,"The Germans wereto conserve their home markets by increasing their import duties. The municipalities and corporations and guilds help the manufacturers in the United States. On a former occasion I read an extract from the American Ironmonger, which contained several advertisements showing that some of the municipal councils had special funds at their disposal for the purpose of establishing manufactories in their States. For instance, the State of New York can place large sums of money at the disposal of persons who may desire to start manufacturing enterprises. The smaller States are also adopting a similar policy, and hundreds of thousands of pounds are now available in the various States for the establishment of industries. As the result of this special assistancesuch as is not given in Australia, or in any other part of the world, so far as I know the American manufactures have gone forward by leaps and bounds. All the American organizations appear to be united in assisting the development of the manufactures of that great country. How, then, is it to be wondered at that we cannot compete with America? Even the English manufacturers, notwithstanding their immense capital, are not able to cope with the Americans. Some of the other disabilities under which Australian manufacturers labourhavebeen mentioned by the Treasurer, notably the fact that Australian manufacturers have to pay duty upon some of their raw material. In addition, large quantities of what may be termed the accessories in the boot and shoe trade are not made within the Commonwealth, and therefore have to be imported. The freight alone upon these goods, apart from any duty, adds to their cost and to the difficulty manufacturers have practically invaded of competing with American manufacturers, who, owing to the protective system in operation in that country, can obtain everyBritain lost nearly a million pounds' thing they require within their own borders. articles iipon the free list than has the boot exports represented a value of £1,586,5S0, industry. more articles on the dutiable list than has the boot industry. ber contend that the articles which are subject to duty are dearer in consequence ? not made within the Commonwealth. Again, owing to the wonderful development of the boot trade in America, the manufacturers there have been able to set the fashions in boots and shoes, and in that respect they lead all the world. The latest designs in boots and shoes, and the most tasteful and ornate articles of foot wear, practically all come from America. This fact in itself gives their manufacturers a great advantage over rivals in other countries, because if people will follow the fashions they must, to a large extent, wear imported boots. Then, again, it is a matter of common knowledge that in America ten hours constitutes a recognised day's labour, whilst in Australia the eight hours system prevails. These are factors which enter very largely into the cost of production. If our manufacturers worked their operatives for the same hours as the latter are being worked by the manufacturers of America, they might possibly have been in a better position to compete with the outside world than they have been in the past. America receive a higher rate of wage per hour. that. The Australian boot operatives do not work the same number of hours as do the American. It is quite true that in America the operatives earn, upon anaverage, more money than they do in Victoria. That, however, is due to the fact that, in the United States, the manufacturers have been able to specialize and organize; consequently they can produce boots more cheaply than can our local manufacturers; whilst, as a result of the larger profits thus derived, they can afford to share those profits with their operatives. I have -said that the American boot England. That is so. I further state that, between 1891 and 1901, Great worth of trade in connection with this particular industry. In 1891 the balance of whilst in 1901 it totalled £713,997, thus showing a loss of £872,583 within nine years. That, surely, is a startling fact, so startling that the ambassador from the British Court in Americadrew attention to this subject in an article which he forwarded to the Home authorities on the 5th February, 1901, and from which I propose to quote in reply to the honourable and learned member for ""Werriwa, who asserted by way of interjection that the Americans",29,William Mcmillan The Affairs And I Know What His Answer Would

Wheni t was decided, without a division I believe, that the composite duties on hats should not be enforced, the Government practically intimated that it was their intention to abandon that particular system of taxation.

On the original proposal of the Government in regard to boots and shoes we had an opportunity of ascertaining exactly how the duty would work out; but now we have had sprung on us a new proposal which "" o u t Herod's Herod"" in its iniquity.

We cannot insist on people buying either imported or locally-made boots ; but could anything be more unfair than to allow a man who can afford the better class of article to get off with 22 per cent., while the working man, who buys boots more suitable to his calling, has to pay 111 per cent. ? The proposal is monstrous in the extreme. I am prepared to give a substantial amount of protection for locally-made boots, but I do not believe in a system which penalizes the people in regard to their necessities, fines them because they are poor, and adds to their burdens because they have to buy a cheaper class of article. I prefer the original proposal of the Government to that which they now suggest. in Victoria these cheap boots were cheaper under protection than in the other States? opinion is that thousands and thousands of pairs of boots were smuggled into Victoria from New South Wales. of the question. gentleman believe that if this duty is imposed the manufacturers are such born philanthropists that they will not take advantage of it?

That would enable the committee to arrive at a determination whether the duty should be ad valorem or fixed. If the committee refuse to add the words "" a d valorem"" it will be an indication that they desire to have a fixed duty. am willing to accept the Treasurer's suggestion, but I do not wish the committee to run away with the idea that I tie myself down to a duty of 15 per cent.

The latest Statistical Register, for 1900, gives the number of pairs of men's boots, over size six, imported into Victoria at 15,102, and the value was £9,021, the average of which is. slightly over 12s. per pair. (Committee counted.) So that no working man would pay the amount that the honourable member for South Australia wished us to infer. came in. able member can prove my figures to be wrong. In the case of women's boots the importations numbered 24,525 pairs at slightly over 9s. per pair ; youths' averaged over 10s.; girls' over 8s.; and boys' over 5s. per pair. I fancy that the honourable member must have counted in straw slippers, or some other common cheapclass of' article, such as children's boots, which were on the free list and were invoiced at less than Is. per pair, and over 107,000 pairs were imported-to arrive at the figures he has given to the committee. Some honourable members object to the Treasurer's proI would posal in connection with this line, and state that fixed rates are an abomination, or, as the honourable member for South Australia said, worse than what the Government originally proposed.

162,Mr Tudor,"Yes they have, and Iper cent.; in ""Western Australia they had a mixed rate of 18s. on one class of boots, and 10s. on another; and if the invoice value was above 10s. per pair an ad valorem rate of 15 per cent, was charged. I do not suppose there is any trade in which there has been keener retail competition than the boot and shoe trade. The workers in the trade in Victoria had to suffer in consequence until the wages boards came into being under the Factories and Shops Act. But still they were no more hardly treated than are the workers in the trade in New South Wales to-day. The Sydney Morning Herald sent out a special correspondent to inquire into the rates being paid in the boot trade in Sydney, and he stated in October last year -befor e this Tariff came into operationthat the rates mentioned by the secretary of the Trades Union, some 25s. per week, were found to be correct by the correspondent. The operatives themselves complained of the wages paid. The secretary of the Boot Operatives' Unioni n Sydney, in a letter, statesDuring the last four (4) years there has been no uniform wage, no two factories paying the same rates. Eighteen months ago the union was reformed; it consists, mostly of ""makers"" and ""finishers,""very few of any of the other branches of the trade being members. Therefore I can only speak authoritatively of the wages paid to the ""makers"" and the ""finishers."" There are about 900 of the former and about 400 of the latter working at the trade at present in Sydney. Some time ago, iu consequence of the misleading figures given by Mr Coghlan regarding the earnings of ""makers"" and ""finishers,"" doubtless supplied by interested manufacturers, when there was no union in existence, I was instructed by my executive to collect statistics of the wages earned, and to find the average The majority of ""makers"" and ""finishers"" work piece-work, although many work on weekly wages. I found that the average earnings of ""makers"" was 25s., aud of ""finishers"" 30s. per week. Of course there are individual factories where the men average much higher than this. He goes on to speak of various factories in New South Wales, and he says that the manufacturers themselves admit that the rates he' quotes are correct. I have here a letter also from the largest manufacturer of boots and shoes in Australia. He is the largest manufacturer in Victoria, and he has also a branch in Sydney. He states in relation to the tradeAs regards the state and condition of the trade for manufacturers and work-people, there is no comparison between Sydney and Melbourne. Here tlie manufacturer makes all classes of work, thanks to the State protecive policy, his orders are lai-ge and consistent. He goes on to sayIn Sydney where the foreign importer has the run of the market, and gets the cream of it, and the local manufacturer has to take what is left; the result is that he is kept down to making the lower grades of work. paid. in America is from 12£ to15 dollars per week, while in Englandi t is only 28s. goods imported come from America. not come , from America. As a matter of fact, there is practically very little difference. The value of these articles imported from America is stated by Coghlan at £185,000, and the value of the goods imported from the United Kingdom at £176,000. There is, therefore, a difference of only £9,000 in favour of America. The employer to whom I referred statesWages are very low in Sydney. At our Sydney factory our manager has workmen applying for work continually, and he hears from them the wages they had been getting previously, which frequently had been not more than from 25s. to 30s. per week. letter 1 quoted from this letter in my speech on the address in reply. I have letters from the representative of the workmen's union, and also from the largest employer in the trade. It has been stated that when a wages board .fixes a rate the minimum becomes the maximum, but that is not so in this employer's factory, where, I believe, most of the employees get more than the minimum rate fixed by the wages board. We have had figures given by the Treasurer, and by the honourable member for Bourke, showing the import of boots into England, and the export of boots from England. Those figures show that the imports are increasing, and the ex1 ports are decreasing. We have also had letters read showing how the trade is going out of the hand's of the manufacturer, and into the hands of the importer. I have here a'copy of the Boot and Shoe Trades' Jowrnal, a manufacturers' journal published in England, and I find this stated in the issue for December 6th, 1901, ' with reference to LeedsThe lot of the shoe manufacturer so far as this centre is concerned, is just now far from being an",34,Willis How Does The Worth Of Boots Were Imported Into This

Ienviable one; indeed the condition of business could hardly be more unsatisfactory, and unless some unexpected orders or repeats come to hand, employers . will have the greatest difficulty to keep all fully employed to the end of the present working year. Some firms I know have been, and are even now making for stock, which in itself is a proof of the weak condition of the trade. Then, as regards Northampton, which has already been referred to as the first town in England to feel the effects of the depression. Northampton is the town in Englandi n which high-class boots are made, but the American boot is displacing tlie high-class boot in England. This is what the Boot and Shoe Trades' Journal has to say about NorthamptonIn the meantime the demand for autumn goods is practically nil, and those who have not yet started upon their next year's orders are finding themselves exceedingly short of work. We have heard from time to time that the reason the Americans can sell cheaper abroad is that they charge more to the home consumer. I have here a copy of the Shoe Manufactwers' Monthly, published at Lieoester, in England, in which I find this statementOne of the lightly flung assertions with regard to this competition has been the statement that the home consumer has to pay a higher price for his goods to enable the importer to sell at a cheaper rate what amounts to an over-production. This is decidedly untrue. Here we have an English journal stating that it is untrue that the American charges more abroad than he does at home for the goods he producesAmerican shoes are sold cheaper in the States than abroad, even when cost of transport, &c, are added. The competition is quite as keen there in the retail trade as it is at home. The one-priced shoe largely accounts for this. They have adopted the system there of specialization, as has already been pointed out, and that enables them to produce more cheaply than the English manufacturer, and, I believe, the Australian manufacturer, who have tried to cover the whole field of production. duties imposed to counterbalance specialization 1 .we should have duties imposed to counteract that specialization, but I remind the honourable member that it is under the American protective Tariff that that specialization has been perfected. honourable member opposite can deny that. I venture to say that if we walk down the streets of any city in Australia to-day, we shall find, not English, but American boots advertised, and in America they have had protection for the trade, and the workers are paid nearly double the rates they are being paid in England at the present time. them to invent new machines ? them the run of their own home market. They have been sure of that, and that has been an inducement and encouragement to the inventor. In England they have been slow in connection with this particular trade. I noticed recently that the workers, I believe of Northampton, decided that they would not work one particular kind of machine, and they intended to prevent machines of that kind being introduced into England. member tried to do that in connection with cigarettes the other evening. secure differential treatment, because it is admitted by all that the hand-made cigarette is superior to that made by machinery. I do not intend to proceed with that argument. In America they had the benefit of a number of inventions in machinery, and there perhaps they have better laws connected with the patenting of machines. They have taken advantage of that circumstance, and we know that England is more conservative than is America in the adoption of any new system. The honourable member for Wentworth stated that this was a natural industry. We know that it is, and that we can produce leather here in unlimited quantities. The tanners tell us that they can produce far more than can be consumed in this country, and therefore they can get very little protection for their industry. I trust, however, that when we have an opportunity later on we shall give them some COOK -Are we to have measure of protection. I have ' said that that the minimum wage in England is 28s. a week, and in America tlie average wage I have never said that paid is from 12£dols. to 15dols. per week for piece-work. In Victoria the wage is £ 2 2s., and according to Coghlan's Statistical Register the wage paid in New South Wales is £ 1 13s. lOd. per week. We are No anxious that our country should succeed.

We policy of protection in America has enabled American manufacturers to successfully compete with the English manufacturers, and to drive them out of their own market and also to beat them in oversea markets. I say, therefore, that this committee will act wisely by giving such a measure of protection to this industry as will enable us in Australia to do what the Americans have done in the United States. Ministerial benches when we are dealing with a sudden announcement of the imposition of very heavy duties upon articles of general consumption throughout the Commonwealth, compels me to take the view that the Ministerial supporters have been informed of the Government proposal, or that they are outside of the chamber because they are ashamed of its enor-mity, and are nowtrying to arrange some means of overcoming the difficulty. It is a most serious thing that the Treasurer should, without any warning, have proposed so heavy an impost upon these articles. {Committee counted.) The proposed alteration from the composite system of duties to a fixed rate ranging as high as 40s. per dozen upon boots and shoes is indeed an -enormity, and if such a proposition had been made by any other member of the committee but the Treasurer without due notice, it would have been very properly scouted. Tlie position has become so serious that the Opposition might do well to move the chairman out of the chair, and propose a vote of censure upon the Government. We can now understand the prophetic nature of the utterance of the Prime Minister at Maitland when he referred to ""the pattering of bare feet upon the highways of the Commonwealth."" I can now understand that the right honourable gentleman realized that the provisions of his Tariff would result in the actual fulfilment of the prophecy he made. Such a proposition as this was never before even dreamt of by the protectionists of New South Wales, who, when theyhear of it to-morrow, will realize the accuracy of the right honourable gentleman's prophecy, and will know that their children in proceeding to school, will very often have to go on bare feet. I cannot understand such a proposal in a country like Australia, where the raw material of these articles is a natural proknow that the practice of the duct of the country. To propose a duty of 40s. per dozen under such circumstances isabsurd, and I am astonished at the moderation of the leader of the Opposition in not moving the Chairman out of the chair, as a motion of censure. The Treasurer told the committee that he regretted that his experience showed him that a composite duty could not be carried, and that, therefore, he proposed a fixed duty. As a matter of fact, the only composite duty now on the Tariff is that relating to cigars. that I thought that a composite duty in regard to boots could not be carried. honourable member has ascertained that fact with the assistance of the Government whip. He went on to tell us that one of his reasons for preferring a fixed duty to an ad valorem duty is that he has been informed by the Customs authorities that a fixed duty is more easy to collect, and allows fewer evasions than an ad valorem duty. If that be so, why were not fixed duties applied to all the other articles in the Tariff1 Why, for instance, was not a fixed duty instead of an ad valorem duty applied to woollen piece goods 1 Surelyi t is easier for the Customs authorities to determine thevalue of an importation of boots than to de-termine the value of a bale of fine silk, or of home-spun 1 And why, if fixed duties prevent evasion, has the right honourable member allowed the revenue to suffer by the imposition of ad valorem duties ? What is proposed now, in place of the composite duty of 20s. per dozen and an ad' valorem duty of 15 per cent, upon certain sizes in men's boots, is a fixed duty of 40s. per dozen. That duty, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, is equal, on the cheapest kind of boots-the boots valued at 45s. per dozen, or 3s. 9d. per pair-to 88 per cent, ad valorem. Is any protectionist, however ardent, willing to agree to a duty of 88 per cent. ? When the people of Australia thoroughly understand the incidence of these fixed duties, those who vote for them will tremble very much for what they have done. Furthermore, while it is proposed to impose an ad valorem duty of 88 per cent, upon the cheaper classes of bootsthe boots worn by those who are least able to bear additional burdens-the better classes of boots, which are worn by men",36,Willis How Does The Worth Of Boots Were Imported Into This

177,Mri Wilks,"No doubt the rightwho would be able to pay even a duty of 88 per cent, are charged only 22 per cent. The Treasurer spoke of these duties as necessary for the protection of the boot factories of Australia, to which he referred with pride and admiration, and he was generous enough in that connection to admit the strength of the New South Wales factories. I propose however, with a view to show how little a Tariff has to do with the establishment of the boot industry, to quote some figures relating to the boot industry of New South Wales and Victoria, for the years 1899 and 1900. A t that time New South Wales had a free-trade policy, so that there was no duty upon the boots imported into that State, while in Victoria the duty upon boots was 60s. per dozen. In 1899, the New South Wales factories numbered 79, and in 1900, 94, an increase of fifteen factories, or 20 per levied under the Dibbs Tariff, namely, 10 -cent. in one year. Buti n Victoria the number of factories in 1S99 was 105, and in 1900, 10S, an increase of only three factories, or less than 3 per cent. Those are not figures culled from unreliable' statistics by a biased free-trader; they are taken from a return compiled by the Government, and laid upon the table in pursuance of a motion moved by a supporter. Sir Wales had fewer factories, but a larger population, than Victoria. maker's expression, to rivet the attention of the committee and of the community upon these facts. Furthermore, the importations of boots into New South Wales under free trade decreased year by year to an astounding extent, until they came to a minimum. The free-traders are not opposed to the establishment of factories ; they are glad to see local factories succeed and expand, but they are opposed to taxing the general community for the advantage of a few. In 1SS2 the boots imported into New South Wales were valued at £635,796. population of that State was then 817,468, and the boot importations thus represented a value of 15s. 6^d. per head. A 5 per cent, duty was imposed in those days. In 18S3 the imports were valued at £571,402, the population was 869,310, the value of imports per head 13s. l f d . In 1884 the imports were valued at £581,820, the population was 921,268, and the proportion per head 12s. 7^d. In 1S98 the figures were imports £316,650, population 1,346,240, and proportion 4s. 8-^d. per head; and in 1899, imports £348,295, population 1,356,650, and proportion per head 5s. l£d. The statistics prove that the policy of free trade does not stifle industries. The manufacturers in the mother State have gradually absorbed the trade in low and medium class goods, and it only remains for them to capture the trade in the better class of goods, such as are now imported from America. 1899 embraces the years during which the Dibbs Tariff was in operation. Dibbs Tariff was in existence for only two and a half years, and had no appreciable effect upon the manufacturing industry. AVe shall be quite content to agree to impose upon boots the same duty as was per cent. The Treasurer has referred to the exportation of boots from Victoria. He admitted that most of the boots required by the people of Victoria were made within the State, and that the manufacturers could very well look forward to the time when they would be able to supply outside markets, but the only markets that would be available to them beyond Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji, the native inhabitants of which would reI desire, to use a boilerquire to be educated up to the use of boots. In 1900, Victoria exported £60,000 worth of boots, of which £43,000 worth were imported into New South Wales. The mother State in her turn exported £25,000 worth of locally-made boots, of which £ 7 0 worth were sent into Victoria. Thus, apart from the Victorian boots sent into New South Wales, the mother State exported a larger quantity of boots than did Victoria. The honourable member for Yarra said that it was only right that the boot operatives should receive some assistance from the The State, and if we grant that, it is reasonable to inquire what amount of protection has been granted to the opeiatives of other industries of equal importance. ""It is estimated that the labour employed in the engineering trade, represents 60 per cent, of the cost of the finished article, and as a duty of 20 per cent, has been imposed, under this Tariff the manufacturer is given an advantage of 33 per cent, to compensate him for the higher wages which have to be paid to the Australian workman as compared with",37,Willis How Does The Worth Of Boots Were Imported Into This

191,Mr Hume Cook,"The protection mustfact that the American people had to import their leather, upon which they paid 15 per cent. duty. Here there is another reason why we cannot expect-and ought not to have-the same protection in Australia as manufacturers might have expected in the United States. It is true that we only manufacture the rougher kinds of leather, but we can look forward to making the whole of the kinds of leather which form nineteen-twentieths of the raw material used in the boot making industry. A policy of low revenue duties and incidental protection would have been sufficient to that end. I have received only this evening a circular from the Bootmakers' Association in Victoria asking that we should take the duties off some of their raw material, notably glazed or glac kid, French calf, and patent calf. I am prepared to take the duties off the whole of the raw materials that cannot be made in Australia, and off a great many that can be made here. The boot manufacturers would be better off with lower duties, and all duties removed from their raw material, machinery, tools, and everything they use. I believe that the success of the manufacturers in the neighbouring State of New South Wales has been due to the fact that they have not had protection on the manufactured article, but have had free-trade in connection with all they use in their factories. I shall be prepared to vote for making the duties on the raw materials used in the bootfactories as low as we can, consistently with getting revenue. The policy of the Government is not in any sense scientific. The proposal now before us is directly in conflict with the policy which has been laid down as scientific, that taxation should be laid on the shoulders of the people in proportion as they are able to bear it . The modification of the Tariff which has now been proposed by the Government is quite opposed to that policy. Notwithstanding what has been said in favour of fixed duties by the honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for Bourke, we must always look to the fact that so long as the duties stand, even though the boots are made here, the operation of those duties will be to advance the price of goods. But I shall be answered by honourable members opposite that we can, do, and shall make the cheaper class of boots within the Commonwealth. Certainly that has been the case in Victoria, and should be the case in the Commonwealth generally. But we have no reason to suppose that protective duties would operate in the same way now we belong to the Commonwealth as they operated in Victoria, where special circumstances have led to the production of the lower class of boots at lower prices than those for which, they could honestly and in the legitimate way of business be made. If throughout the whole Commonwealth we impose a fixed duty on tlie lower class of boots, the effect will be to advance their price as well as the price of boots of the higher class. There has been an absence of classification in the proposals of the Government. The classification in sizes alone is not sufficient for the purposes of this trade. I notice that in the Queensland classification more specific details are included, and there they appear to have been able to deal with the vexed question of the slipper which has troubled a good many of the Australian Governments that have gone in for protection. The slipper is defined in one way in one State and in a different way in another. I think the Government might have made some effort to introduce a more systematic classification which would lead to less trouble in the future. We are now face to face with the fact that the Government have broken faith with the people of the country in not giving us the compromise Tariff we naturally expected from their utterances. They brought down a much higher Tariff than any one expected as their defined policy, but at the last moment, after their original proposal has been thought over and skilled advice taken upon it, and after people like myself have been about seeking informationupon a definite line of policy, we are brought face to face with a totally different policy, which in very many respects, in its incidence, will be diametrically opposed to the policy first submitted by the Government. I allude now particularly to the proposal to withdraw the ad valorem duty, and submit a specific duty of 40s. per dozen pairs on men's boots. Some time ago, assisted in my calculations by an article in the Boot and Shoe Trades' Journal of England, I worked out tbe original proposals of the Government for compositeduties.and Ifound they amounted to a fixed duty of 36s. per dozen pairs for men's boots,"" and nearly 30s. per dozen for women's boots. The proposal the Government now make involves an absolute rise in the duty, and if the importations remain the same, it will certainly yield a larger revenue. And yet it is submitted as a concession upon the original proposals of the Ministry. In Tasmania there was a duty of 20 per cent., and that would amount roughly to a fixed duty of 24s. per dozen pairs upon men's boots. In South Australia the' duty amounted to 33s. In Queensland to 33s., and in New South ""Wales these articles were free. Isi t not notorious that the only reason for imposing so high a duty in connection with this one industry is the fact that a mistake was made in the State of Victoriai n imposing such heavy protective duties to start the manufacture of boots here ? No other reason exists for it. I say that the first twelve factories in Victoria at the present time would be benefited by a more moderate policy. It may be that some of the smaller factories would be injured by it , but while we might regret that, we ought not, as men legislating for the whole Commonwealth, allow it to influence us to impose heavier burdens on the people. The return I asked from the Treasurer the other day shows that in New South ""Wales for the first four months under the new Tariff £8,000 revenue was collected, and in Victoria £6,258, and a total for the Commonwealth of £27,598. were hanging back expecting lower duties. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Assuming that the importations would continue at the same rate for the balance of the year, those figures would indicate a total revenue of £ 1 1 0 , 3 9 2; but as the Treasurer has suggested we know for a fact that the extent of the revenue collected in the first month or two was due to orders given before the Tariff was tabled. We cannot expect that rate of importation to continue. Members -on this side, as well as the Treasurer, admit that that rate of importation could not be expected to continue if the original Government proposals were carried, and it is certain that if the proposal now submitted is carried we cannot expect much beyond the Treasurer's estimate of £68,000 for the whole of the Commonwealth. I ask in all sincerity whether it is to be thought for a moment that proposals that will bring in a revenue of £68,000 upon boots and shoes can be considered in any sense a revenue Tariff? Isi t not a Tariff proposed solely and wholly in the interests of protection ? It is not our duty and it is not a part of tlie declared policy of the present Government to introduce any duty proposed solely and wholly for the purpose of protection. There is no other industry in connection with which it has been done, and we have no right to do it in this particular instance, because it does not carry out the declaration of the Government that we should have revenue without destruction. This proposal in fact goes to the other extreme, and means the entire destruction of revenue we can ill afford to do without; of revenue that would impose no burden, but would give an ease of burdens upon the people of the Commonwealth. We could get three times the revenue under a moderate tax, and a tax such as I believe would give the incidental protection to existing industries in Victoria, to which they are justly entitled. I should be prepared to vote for such a moderate tax, but for this purely protection proposal for such extremely high duties I am not prepared to vote. The effect of the Tariff has been mentioned several times. We had an estimate made by Sir Frederick Sargood of what it would turn out to be in operation, and I believe that gentleman's estimate was perfectly correct. The only factor interfering with that estimate is this-that we do not as a nation largely import very cheap boots, upon which the fixed duty proposed would run up to a very high ad valorem percentage indeed, and we do import very many more of the higher priced articles upon which the ad valorem result of the fixed duties would be relatively very much less. But I do say that an extraordinarily high duty is proposed in the Tariff as submitted to us, and in the present proposal. In proof of that I have ascertained from two separate channels of information, firms acting as agents for manufacturing firms at home, and one of them as agent for one of the finest manufacturing firms in the old country, that as soon as the Tariff was tabled they received sheaves of letters from their customers cancelling orders. This shows distinctly that the effect of the Tariff, from the moment it was tabled, was not so much to protect the industries of this country as to utterly prohibit the products of the industries of other countries entering our ports. In one case, orders to the extent of £1,300 were declined, solely because people could not face these duties. I have here several letters in which it is stated plainly that subsequent orders could",42,George Turner Ne W South The Commonwealth Would Be The New
192,Sir Geobge Tubneb,"In Victoria theynot> be looked for, as the Tariff proposed would not allow of the importation of this class of goods. I have documents here from which it can be seen that upon an importation of these goods, invoiced at £145 3s. 2d., duty to the extent of £ 4 5 19s. l i d . was paid i i i Queensland. That is equal to a rate of 32 per cent. That was duty paid in Queensland, and the duty on tlie same line of goods under the original Queensland Tariff would have amounted to £ 2 5 19s., or about 17^per cent. Some of these boots were cheap boots. Sir dozen pairs would only amount to 17-jj per cent. Mr G. B. EDWARDS that to the right honourable gentleman, because this importation included a number of children's boots, which did not pay the rate of duty imposed upon general lines in Queensland. in this committee that we do not, and have not imported cheap boots, but I see here boots quoted at 5s., 5s. 9d., 6s., 6s. 3d., 9s., long that we shall see the Commonwealth 14s. 6d., and so on. ported into Sydney? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The importation in this instance was into Queensland, but similar boots have been imported into New South Wales. I think the reason for this is that these are special lines, and, as the honourable member for Bourke so frequently pointed out, success in this industry can only be obtained by specializing. So long as we cannot specialize in this industry we cannot expect to turn out some of"" this work as cheaply as it can be produced where the industry is specialized, and special machinery is provided for turning out particular lines of goods. We can make cheaper and better boots here, but these lines are required by the public, and are imported because they are special boots. A similar experience was met with in South Australia, where . orders had to be refused over and over again, in some instances at the cost of expensive cables to England to stop boots coming out. These facts might be claimed by protectionists as showing the necessity for protection; but I mention them as showing that proposals of this kind mean prohibition, and not protection, upon many of these lines, which will never be imported under such a high rate of duty. We shall have to make them, and at a considerably'higher cost to the consumer than the price for which they have been imported in the past. No one can accuse me of any desire to restrict in any way the operations of our manufacturers. I am a manufacturer myself, and I have always had a great deal of sympathy with men who have devoted their capital and energy to manufactures ; but I say that if we wish to devise a scientific Tariff which will incidentally protect manufacturers and healthy industries which will succeed, we should make the duty so moderate that it will to some extent satisfy both 'parties, and be such as will prevent years to come. I tell the Treasurer that if we decide this question upon the lines .he I can explain submits, it will not be many years before a fight will take place over the Tariff at the elections, and principally upon this item. Manufacturers and business men desire more than anything else that there It has been remarked before should be'some settlement of the Tariff, of such a nature that, if it will not last an ordinary hfetime, it will at any rate last so firmly established, and shall know the effect imof the duty before we shall need to consider the desirability of altering it . We cannot hope to secure a Tariff which will last that time unless it is a compromise Tariff, and a Tariff which upon this particular line will meet to some extent the views of honourable members on both sides without fully meeting the views of either. We on this side are prepared, against the political principles held by many of us, to vote for a substantial duty for this industry. too far apart-that is the trouble. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Unfortunatel y it appears to be as the right honourable gentleman says. member call a substantial duty 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS I think 15 per cent, a substantial duty. I carry my heart on my sleeve in this matter, and I say that if we cannot obtain a duty of 15 per cent, we will take a 20 per cent. duty. a 30 per cent, duty upon hats 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Thirty per cent, is an abnormally high duty upon hats, and it must be remembered that this industry is very much more firmly established in the Commonwealth than the hat industry.",44,George Turner Ne W South The Commonwealth Would Be The New

There is a great deal of energy and enterprise expended upon it, and a great many people are employed in it. I know that many have made a tolerable success of it in many instances. I was speaking to a protectionist gentleman engaged in the industry in Victoria, and I could see quite well that he would succeed whatever policy we adopted, because he knew, what he was about. But he would succeed far better if we imposed only a low rate of duty as a protection to the industry, and still lower rates of duty upon the materials required by the industry. This item brings the two sides of the committee face to face with a principle which divides it . rupt the regular work of local production, interI t is almost impossible to think that either side will get a victory upon it . Even if the Treasurer carries his proposal, the matter will not be finally settled. It is absolutely certain that the question will be re-opened, and it would therefore be better for him to show that tact for which he is so deservedly esteemed, and meet us in a spirit of compromise. If that is done, the manufacturers in all the States will be able to establish their businesses upon such lines that they will shortly control the whole Commonwealth market, and will ultimately be able to export boots to other parts of the world. ' But before we can export our boots, we must make our industry very much larger than it is now. Our factories must have better plants than they have, though there are many in both Victoria aud New South Wales which are well equipped now. Even those which are well equipped must take advantage of the mechanical improvements which have been invented in the United States, and when that is done, and our manufacturers are thoroughly abreast of those in other parts of the world, we shall, with our facilities for dealing with leather, ultimately come to compete with the people of the United States. The experience of Victoriai n regard to the boot trade does not justify the imposition of protective duties. started here under protection, the boot making industry, although it has had most protection, has succeeded least. The A'ge referred to this question on 16th January last, and in a leading article which appears in to-day's issue the opinions which are held by the protectionist party in regard to the boot trade are again put forward. I desire to show how very ineffectually the arguments adduced account for ' the present position of the boot trade in Victoria. The writer saysA protective duty is a permanent economic need to most industries long after the local product has gained a complete command of the home market. We may take the case of boots by way of example. The domestic boot supply has almost entirely ousted the imports. The dut3' is fairly high and acts almost prohibitively. Yet the price of the home-made article, owing to internal competition, is as low as those of England and America. Still the duty is as much needed as even:, because if it werenot there the Australian market every now and then would be made the receptacle of the ""sweepings"" of foreign markets, sold under the cost of production as the surplus stocks of firms which are bound to realize. Such ""sweepings"" would entirely disfere with regular employment, and create alternate gluts and scarcity, which are the bane of steady industry and regular trade. Just in the same way does the duty on mining and other machinery remain a need long after the local product has beaten the competitive prices of the importer. I think that those statements epitomize the views upon this question held by honourable gentlemen opposite; but the writer either does not know the history and circumstances of the boot trade in Victoria, or falsely misrepresents them for his own ends. During the past twelve years there have been more trade insolvencies and private arrangements with creditors among the boot manufacturers of Melbourne than in any other line of business in Australia. I was told by a gentleman, who seemed to know what he was talking about, that one manufacturer here has compounded with his creditors five times during the past twelve years, and another four. Most of the factories have been for sale for years past. There are in Melbourne several first-class establishments which are equal, if not superior, to many in New South Wales, but there are a number of others which would not have come into existence but for the abnormally high duties imposed upon boots. The credit of the weakest factories has been totally destroyed, and I Of all the industries do not believe there are six or seven manufacturers in the State whose credit. would begoodinany business transaction. Insolvent stocks have been sacrificed over and over again, and this has created a glut, the effect of which has been worse in many instances than the glut which the writer of the Age",45,George Turner The N 33s Per The Re Opening Of The Question For Some
197,Sir Geokge Turner,"And there is veryfears would be caused by the importation of the surplus stocks of foreign manufacturers. Men have been employed half their time, and allowed to work the other half of their time at their own homes, and more stock has been produced in certain lines than was required. The effect has been to create unhealthycompetition, under which honest men have gone down again and again. How is it that the sweepings of foreign factories were never dumped down into New South Wales, whose market was open to the world ? of the Opposition said they were. Mr G. B. EDWARD S -We had the sweepings of Victorian factories, if Victoria could be called a foreign nation. The only country from which boots were imported into New South Wales whose social conditions differed materially from ours was Germany. Most of our imported boots came from the United Kingdom, whose conditions must be taken to be something the same as those of Australia, and from the United States, where, it was admitted this evening, higher wages are paid than are paid here. Statistics do not always give a true account of the amount of wages earned in any trade. It is all very well to say that a man is earning at the rate of £ 2 2s. per week; but if he is employed for only three days he does not earn £ 2 2s. a week. The creation of a wages board was necessitated here in the boot and other trades by the high duties which were imposed, but if the system is to be carried out in its entirety, the advocates of it must go further, and regulate the pi-ice at which boots and other articles shall be sold at the retail shops. That is a necessary corollary to the imposition of protective duties and the creation of wages boards. wages boards in New South Wales, where facturers. In the United States the operatives in the past there have been no duties. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The Victorian longer and harder, and only because of that.

The trade has not yet recovered from if ordinary care and skill are exercised. the effects of the introduction of labour-saving Victoria has hitherto been able, after supmachinery, and it is possible that some manufacturers are trying to compete, by means of plying the requirements of her own market, 30 H evasion of the determination, with their rivals in trade who have the latest appliances Mr George Hall reports-The competition in this trade is very keen, and a further increase in labour-saving machinery is noticeable ; and although the volume of business in this trade may not be less than in former years, still I am afraid that the number of employees will show a decrease. There seems to be no end to the number and variety of machines adopted into this trade to save manual labour. One may now see boots and shoes, chiefly of the lighter description and common class, made and finished almost entirely by machinery. The manufacture of the better class article still gives employment to many workers. At the same time, the present system of making boots indicates that the factory operative, as we have known him, who could either make or finish a boot, as the ease may be, will shortly become extinct, and give place to the expert machinist,, who will not necessarily be a bootmaker. . . Miss J. H. Thear reports-The determination,, of the boot trade is, generally speaking, well complied with. There are a good number of' machinists who get over 20s. per week. For example, in a factory in which 29 girls who had. been over four years at the trade were employed,. I found that there were fifteen whose wages were above 20s. In a smaller factory where there are six minimum wage hands, three of the number were getting 22s. 6d.; but it is only in exceptional instances that more than 22s. 6d. is paid. Comparing that statement with the figures contained on the wages sheet of an establishment in Sydney which I personally visited, I find that in Sydney 26 out of 42 girls, employed were being paid over 20s. per-week. In Messrs. Enoch Taylor's establishment the wages paid compare very favourably with bhe wages paid in Vicboria,.. fourbeen years of age 6s. a week, and men. up to £ 2 15s. a week, while girls get from. 5s. a week, and women up bo £ 1 5s a week. He saysHe paid 100 of his employees over £2 per week,., so he was sure the statement made to the commission that £2 per week was the maximum rate paid in the Syduej' boot manufacturing trade didnot apply to his business. He did not think that worked about 58 hours per week. They earned more money than in Sydney because they worked story. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Perhaps so.

I believe that New South Wales would have been in a position to send almost as many manufac^ tured goods into Victoria as Victoria has exported to New South Wales, if Victoria had not closed her pouts against imports from neighbouring States. The Victorian manufacturers may now look for formidable -competition from the manufacturers of the -mother State. Sir 'operate to tlie benefit of the consumer 1 Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes; but tlie -chief advantage conferred by the federal union will result from the wider market afforded to our manufacturers. They have never had a fair opportunity in the individual States under either protection or free trade, but with the wider markets open to them from this time forth, they will have a much better chance to succeed. I believe that the opportunities for achieving success w ill be as great under the operation of a small duty as under the high rates now proposed, provided that the raw materials are admitted at as low a rate as possible. The imports of boots into New South Wales in 1899 included £33,000 worth from Victoria, and in the following year tlie imports from Victoria were valued at £43,000. The imports from the United Kingdom in 1899 were valued at £145,000, and in 1900 at £\76,000. The importations from America increased from £.121,000 worth in 1899 to £185,000 worth in 1900. Prom Germany -only £16,000 worth of boots were imported in 1899, and only £20,000 in tbe following year. I cannot see any force in the argument that if we impose only a moderate rate of duty our markets are likely to be flooded with boots made in Germany, or in -any other country where the social conditions of the working people are inferior to those of our own. Success in the manufacture of boots depends largely upon the -equipment of the factories with the best machinery, and upon the organization of the manufacturing interests, and I believe that all the conditions essential to success will be brought about in time without undue protection. methods has been amply demonstrated by the experience gained in connection with the boot-making industry in Victoria. We cannot conclude that high rates of duty will prove beneficial to the trade, unless Ave are same staff of men who sell the locally manuprepared to wholly ignore the statistics. The boot factories in New South Wales were never in a more healthy condition than at present. They are working to their utmost capacity. Wages have increased, and it is difficult to obtain the services of a sufficient number of hands to enable the manufacturers to execute their orders. Prom 1882 to 18S9 the imports of boots into New South Wales decreased to the extent of 45 per cent., and if the trade is developed upon the same lines within the next twenty years which all protectionists aim at, and will practically cease importing, boots. This will come about gradually and naturally. I was surprised to hear honourable members speak of the inability of our manufacturers to make the better classes of boots. In one factory in New South Wales which I have had an opportunity of closely inspecting I saw boots being made of as good quality as I ever hope to wear. The manager of the factory saysThe operatives here are certainly as well paid as those in the other States, in proof of which I enclose an accurate list of wages paid in the various departments of our factory. These figures we are prepared to verify to you by reference to our wage sheet any time you wish to inspect same, therefore yon can quote them with every confidence. They were practically the same before the Tariff was introduced, and, confirming the conversation our factory manager had with you, were considerably higher here under free-trade than in protectionist Victoria. Our factory was started in 1892, and since that date we have added machinery to the value of £16,600, making a total value of £25,000. This was done without any contemplation of duties to assist us; in fact, we have not added anything during the lost twelve months. We started with less than 50 hands, and now have 250. Our wages were, at the outset, a little over £100 per week ; they now total about £375 per week, and our output is six times greater than when the factory was started. The proportion of locally made goods to imported before the duties came on was 66 per cent, colonial and 33 per cent, imported; since the Tariff was introduced these figures have considerably changed, and, if the present duties are persisted in, we fail to see where revenue of any consequence is to be derived. It was pointed out in a previous discussion that some of the New South Wales manufacturers were also importers ; hut I would The futility of protective remind honourable members that it must add very considerably to the chances of success in any manufacturing business if those engaged in it are able to import lines which they cannot manufacture to advantage. The factured boots can also dispose of those which are imported, and the same management and the same organization can with advantage deal with both classes of goods. I am informed that the duties proposed represent a protection of 132 per cent, upon the cost of the labour involved in the manufacture of boots, and even though these figures may apply to an exceptional case, the protection given is certainly very much higher than that afforded to the labour engaged in the manufacture of any other article. There is no reason why we should impose exceptionally high duties upon boots. In France the duty upon boots amounts to 2s. 0|-d. per pair, and upon shoes 9^d. In Germany the duty is 70 marks, or 68s. 6d., per 200 lbs., and as imported boots on the average weigh 2 lbs. per pair, and shoes 1 lb. per pair, the duty would represent about Sd. per pair upon boots and 4d. per pair upon shoes. I have a table here to show very clearly what has been done in New South Wales with regard to the establishment of the boot industry under free-trade conditions. I have selected the figures myself, but in order that there should be no question as to their accuracy, I have submitted them to the statistical authorities of Victoria and New South Wales for verification. They embrace the period from 1891 to 1900. I have divided them into two groups, one of which covers the operation of the Dibbs Tariff, and the other the term of the free trade regime. The statistics show that in 1891. the population was 1,162,880; the imports represented a value of £640,298 ; there were 60 factories in existence, employing 2,806 hands, and manufacturing 2,634,254 pairs of boots. In the following year, under the Dibbs Tariff, the population had increased to 1,193,780; the' value of -the imports had decreased to £455,767 ; the factories had increased to 66, the hands had decreased to 2,708, whilst the pairs of boots manufactured had also decreased to 2,500,000. In 1893, the population had increased to 1,218,150; the value of the imports had decreased to £356,280 ; the number of factories had decreased to 54, the hands had increased to 3,090, and the pairs of boots manufactured had increased to 2,545,061. In 1894, the population was 1,244,460 ; the value of the imports had decreased to £286,984; the factories had increased to 68, the hands employed to 3,420, and the pairs of boots manufactured to 2,611,700. In 1895, which was 30 H 2 practically the last year of the operation of the Dibbs Tariff, the population rose to' 1,269,230, whilst the value of the imports increased to £ 2 9 7 , 7 6 3; the factories decreased to 66, the hands slightly increased to 3,743, and the pairs of boots . manufactured increased to 2,721,132. Then in 1896 the State adopted practically a free trade policy,'and under the Reid administration the population increased to 1,286,970, the value of the imports slightly increased to £381,233, the factories took a big jump to 82, the hands slightly decreased to 3,526, and the pairs of boots manufactured decreased to 2,567,169. During 1897, 1898, and 1899, the same increase in population and the same steady decrease in the value of the imports continued ; the number of factories remained almost stationary, the number of hands employed slightly increased, and the pairs of boots manufactured increased very largely. In 1900, owing to the process of "" loading up,"" described by the Treasurer, the imports increased to the extent of £464,691 . The number of factories in the same year rose to 94, the hands employed increased to 3,953, the pairs of boots manufactured totalled a record, namely, 3,269,938, and, for the first time in our history, there were 387,156 pairs of slippers made in addition, Summarizing these results, the position may be thus stated : In ten years the population of New South Wales increased by 201,620, the number of factbries by 34, the hands employed by 1,533, the pairs of boots manufactured by 1,073,123, in addition to which there was a new item of 387,156 pairs of slippers. The value of the imports decreased by £175,607. During, the five 'years covered by the operation of the Dibbs Tariff -and the term mentioned embraces the periods a little prior to the introduction of that Tariff, and a little subsequent to its repeal-the value of the imports decreased to £2,037,092, the factories increased from 60 to 66, the hands employed to 937, whilst the pairs of boots manufactured increased only by 8fi,878. During the next five years of the Reid administration the' value of the exports decreased ix> £1,814,448, thef actories jumped from 66 to 94, the number of hands employed increased by 427, and the pairs of boots manufactured by 802,769, exclusive of the slippers. If we cannot regard these figures as of value, what is the utility of statistics ? I have also prepared some figures relating to the progress of the boot trade in Victoria. Prior to 1891 there are no statistics available relating to the number of pairs of boots manufactured in Victoria, but from that date onwards I find that the increase is very slight indeed as compared with the increase in New South Wales. Prom 1896 to 1900 inclusive the population of Victoria increased by 10,287, the value of the exports by £23,188, the number of factories by ten, the number of hands by 724, and the pairs made by 948,522, whilst the imports declined to the extent of £9,349. During the same period the population of New South Wales increased by 77,530, the value of the imports decreased by £83,458, the factories increased from 66 to 94, the number of hands increased by 427, the pairs made by 802,769. These figures show conclusively that a very good industry was successfully established in New South Wales without any Tariff assistance being given to it , if we exclude the short period during which the Dibbs Tariff operated. urged by some people that the price of boots has not been very much enhanced by the imposition of increased duties. In this connection I took the trouble to get a very substantial retail firm in my own district to give me a signed statement which shows that in one case the price rose from 10s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. boots? Mr G. B.

In the first the Tariff? Mr G. B . EDWARDS upon some rough lines the increase does not tainty to continue up to the present, now represent very much. In a second instance, proposing a fixed duty and taking care to the price rose from 7s. l i d . to 10s. 6d., fix it at such a high rate that on the lower and in a third from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 3d. upon which those increases were charged the Treasurer has admitted, the duty will were imported prior to the introduction of range from 22 per cent, to 45 per cent., and the Tariff. Mr G. B. EDWARDS that that statement is correct, because the differ in quality and price more than firm in question purchases imported boots others, they are boots and shoes, and there week by week. I claim that this tax will ought to be an ad valorem duty so that the be felt by the people, and that there is no people may know exactly what they are justification for imposing such abnormal paying. The other night I had to protest rates upon boots and shoes, to protect an against a specific duty which was proposed industry which can be adequately protected by the imposition of one-half of the proposed duty. ing some of the arguments advanced by Ministerial supporters, I am surprised that one of these modern wiseacres did not submit a proposition, affirming that nobody should be allowed to wear a pahof boots that had been half soled. We all know that nearly every pair of boots gets half soled, but if we passed a law preventing them being subsequently worn, twice the number of boots would be required, and double the amount of labour would thus be employed. After hearing some of the ridiculous assertions made by honourable members opposite, one wonders that they did not proceed to that extreme. Such a proposition as I have outlined, is exactly on a par with the intelligence which they have exhibited in certain of their statements. It seems incredible that in a deliberative body Of course it is there should be those who advocate a system which leads to such ridiculous conclusions. I am glad that we have heard at last a statement from the Treasurer to the effect that it is not proposed to raise prices more than 5 per cent., even in New South Wales, where previously there was no duty. first resolution. only the first resolution, but we may take If that be so, how ask for a duty which runs as high as 60 per place a composite duty was brought down, I admit that and the Government have allowed uncerclasses of goods it will mean 88 per cent, in the committee ought to know where they I do not think stand.

207,Mr Conroy,"I admit that it wasfor the purpose of disguising the amount of tax to be paid, and it is perfectly clear that the present proposal has a similar object. If the' Victorian manufacturer cannot carry on business without an average duty of 40 per cent., how does he propose to meet the competition of his brother manufacturers of New South Wales, who have been able, without a duty, to develop the industry in opposition to the rest of the world 1 We have sometimes heard it said that Victorians are proud of their duty on boots and shoes. statistics are , wrong when they disclose a bad state of things in Victoria; but a lot of excellent gentlemen make statements such as that which the honourable member for Southern Melbourne now approves, but which 'they would not make in cold blood outside this chamber. Putting aside last year, in which there was undue inflation in every direction for a certain time, I should like to ask honourable members whether they are aware that in 1S82 there were' 3,700 hands employed in the boot trade in Victoria, when the population of the State was only 860,000 people, and that to-day, with a population of 1,300,000, employment is found for only 700 more men, while during the same period the number employed has, in New South Wales, risen from 2,000 to 4,000. The industry, it will be seen, has not kept pace with the requirements of the population. machinery accounts for far more than the difference. Mi'. CONROY -In New South Wales, without a duty, there are about 600fewer men employed, and yet they turn out on an average 250,000 pairs of boots more than those engaged in the Victorian industry. I admit that the big turnout in New South Wales is largely owing to improved machinery, and the Victorians cannot stop development in that direction. If Victorians do desire to stop that development, the simplest way would be to abolish machinery. I admit that the Victorian duties in the past were not so high as they were at the time of the introduction of the federal Tariff; but in 1895 the duty on boots and shoes was raised to 60s. per dozen, thus far exceeding the German Tariff, which placed the impost at 8d. per pair. It has been urged that we ought to put a stop to importations of any sort; and that will certainly be the effect of the Treasurer's proposal, which is even higher than that originally introduced by the Government. A duty of 40s. a dozen will amount to more than the composite duty which, roughlyspeaking, means 36s. per dozen. The Treasurer, however, did not tell us that the latest proposal means an increase. the poor man and lower for the rich man. policy of the Ministry. I am speaking of the great bulk of boots and shoes. On the better class of boots worth, say, 30s. a pair, the duty will be a little over 10 per cent., whereas on the working men's boots, invoiced at 6s. and 7s. per pair, the duty will mean 50 per cent., and even more. The more we examine thefigurestheclearer it becomes that the proposal of the Government utterly and entirely disguises the real amount of duty that the people will have to pay. If the duty does not raise the price of the article to the extent of the duty, then the latter is to a large extent prohibitive, and is, at the same time, unnecessary from a protectionist point of view. I use the word "" protectionist"" in the ordinary sense, and not as meaning a prohibitionist, just as by ""free-trader "" I do not mean a man who would abolish all duties, but one who would remove as many duties as practicable, and interfere as little as possible with trade. The Treasurer admits that the only revenue he expects to receive from this duty is about £70,000 per annum. The imports of boots and shoes into New South Wales in 1900 represented, in round figures, £350,000. Last year, in anticipation of the duties, the imports represented something over £400,000, but I prefer, in considering this matter, to take a normal year. The condition of the people of New South Wales remains very much the same, and if their purchasing power is not restricted, the imports of the Commonwealth will practically amount to £1,000,000. A duty of 15 per cent, would reduce imports to, say, £800,000, which represents a revenue of about £120,000 per annum. It will be seen, therefore, that the Treasurer expects to reduce imports by something Hire 90 per cent.; and that really is prohibition. The Treasurer asserts that only 6 i per cent, or 7 per cent, of the boots required will be imported under his proposal and if that is not",50,Geobge Turner That Will All We Shall Within That Period Attain The Result

212,Mr Conroy,"That is always theprohibition, we on this side would like to know what is. What argument can the Treasurer advance in support of his proposal to impose a duty which will have the effect of lessening the revenue to the extent I have mentioned? I have had my figures checked by two or three men interested in the trade, and they reckon that the revenue under the proposed duty will be about £ 1 1 1 , 0 0 0; but even that means a loss of over £40,000 a year.' The cost of the labour employed in the manufacture of boots and shoes ranges from 25 to 35 per cent. sented by 33 per cent., and material by 67 per cent. presented by 25 per cent., and it goes as low as 13 per cent. Sir making of ""swells' "" boots. mate of tlie honorable member for Wentworth is correct, although possibly it is rather high. perish. We imposed a duby of 30 per cent. Is the Treasurer in such a flourishing condition that he can afford to throw away that amount .of revenue ? If only 5 per cent, would be the amount of the increase in price, by adopting 15 per cent., I , for onethough I do not like such a duty, and would like to see none at all-woul d agree to pass it without further discussion. A duty of 15 per cent, would give the manufacturers a far larger margin than they really have any right to ask for. Why should a man, simply because he is engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes, be allowed to call upon buyers to pay an increased price for the article ? The Government, in pursuing this policy, are trying to do what the Legislatures of the Middle Ages failed to do, namely, to regulate prices. I regret that the Government have not learned what are those matters with which a Government cannot interfere, and what can be regulated for the public benefit. Their sole object seems to me to be to enable particular classes to derive advantages from duties imposed under the Tariff, and to carry that Tariff through Parliament by force of numbers. I should prefer to see ad valorem duties rather than these specific duties, which really conceal from the public the amount they have to pay through the Customs. wonder what is the reason for the conspiracy of silence on the part of honourable members opposite. I have been waiting to hear some of them defend the infamous imposition now proposed upon one of the necessary articles of consumption, and one which enters into the expenditure of every household throughout the Commonwealth. But, for some reason or other, they prefer to be silent. I do not know whether this conspiracy of silence is the result of a caucus, but it seems strange. Why should this duty be differentiated from all the other duties in the Tariff? We have dealt with many other articles of apparel, but have not imposed duties of so high a character as are proposed in this case. Indeed, it seems to me that the Government have adopted the cumulative idea, and that the further they go bhe higher bhey want to make the duties. Where is the need for these high duties? sion that the hat industry of Victoria was in a very parlous state, and that unless very high duties were imposed on hats it would Yet the industry has not perished. I believe it is extending at a very rapid rate, and that new enterprises are being established in New Soubh Wales. We have also imposed a duby of 20 per cent, on clothing. Last week we dealt with jewellery. We left the duty at 25 per cent., because articles of jewellery are luxuries. Then we have duties on cosies, furs, and gloves, and on confectionery and trimmings, ranging from 15 to 20 per cent. Yet when we come to boots, an article of common wear and consumption, we are asked to impose a duty ranging from 80 to 100 per cent. ad valorem. Why should this distinction be made between boots and other articles of apparel and consumption ? Isi t because the machinery in our boot factories is obsolete and out of date, or because we have no natural facilities for the manufacture of boots ? The figures show the contrary to be the case. We were told by the Prime Minister, when making his famous Maitland speech, that the only reason why the Tariff should be protective in its incidence was that tlie bare feet of the people of the continent might not go pattering over the pavements. I do not know whether or not the Prime Minister had in his mind the question of imposing a duty on boots at that time. If , however, these high duties are to be maintained, there will be many bare feet pattering",51,Geobge Turner That Will All We Shall Within That Period Attain The Result

I presume that the fiercest competition in this line of enterprise is between England, America, and the Continent. We bear nothing from the protectionists in relation to this item about the cheap labour of the Continent. Honourable members opposite have shifted their ground in connection with boots. We are now told that it is because of the skill shown abroad, and because of American enterprise, that a countervailing duty is required here. When I interjected in the course of the speech of the honourable member for Yarra as to whether protection stimulated the brains of Americans, he replied that the stimulation of the demand in America had stimulated the inventive faculties of the people. member for Bourke also actually believes that protective duties help a man to invent machinery for the supply of the demand thus created. It reminds me that I once heard a man solemnly argue that the single tax was a cure for the toothache! That was no more absurd than the statement of the honourable member that he believes that the imposition of a protective duty on an article will help to bring into existence advanced machinery for the purpose of producing it mere"" economically. We are told that because inventors in America have enabled boots to be produced with greater facility, we ought to have a duty so as to enable ouv people to stand up against the brains of America and the inventive faculties of that country. So that it comes back to the old condition of things that I have previously called attention to-that the procost of bringing those goods from the older tective theory goes right in the teeth of all countries to Australia is in every case more modern invention and scientific progress. Becausei n America they have greater facilities for the manufacture of boots, therefore we want a duty to protect ourselves from too much inventiveness. This shows how absurd the doctrine of protection is, as applied between countries such as those now under review. the force of the argument that, because of the down-trodden condition of labour on the cent, is the average cost all round ; but it continent of Europe, the pauper-like condiis more than that upon the inferior articles. tions under which the people work, and the low standard of civilization which I am speaking of. I suppose that in the We have been applies to many of them, a duty should be imposed to protect our labour. But no such argument is being raised in regard to boots and shoes. The protectionists shift their ground to suit the circumstances, and fall back upon the theory of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is always telling us that protection is a "" variable 'expedient,"" and not a principle. The"" variable expedient "" is now shifted round from the poverty to the richness, to the skill and ingenuity of the older countries of the world. We are told that because for many years past they have been making more boots with a less expenditure of labour we should build this high Tariff wall against them. We have the raw materials of this industry here in abundance. I presume that honourable members opposite will not argue that in America they get their hides cheaper than we do here. All the raw materials which go to make up these manufactured articles are to be found in profusion in Australia, and to a greater extent than, perhaps, in any other country in the world. The leather statistics show that. They show that we are large exporters' of leather, that we make more leather than we know what to do with,, and have to seek a market for it elsewhere. Why should not these articles be made as cheaply here as anywhere else in the world ? I shall be told by the honourable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Yarra that wages are higher here than they are in the old country. They may be to a certain extent, but it has been shown that the difference in our wage rates as compared with European wage -rates in connection with every class of article we have been considering, is less than the cost of importing those articles. The than the total labour cost in their manufacture. The Treasurer admits that the total labour cost involved in the manufacture of these boots is only 33 per cent. Why then does he desire to impose duties ranging from SO per cent, to 100 per cent. Surely that cannot be because of the difference in I can understand wage rates and labour conditions 1",52,Geokge Tubnek Tha T Is In The We Were Told When Hats Were Under Discus

The estimate of the labour -cost, according to many of the statisticians -who have addressed the committee before me, .brings it down to less than 20 per cent., but accepting the average cost as 33 per cent, is that any reason why the right honourable gentleman should seek to impose duties of 80 per cent, and 100 per cent. 1 an average duty of very much less than that. honourable gentleman tell us why so high a duty is needed 1 Will he tell us first of all why he proposes to make this distinction between boots and other kinds of clothing , .and apparel t .'in a speech of about an hour. , right honourable gentleman is only telling us . what a shocking case he had when after a -speech of an hour he was unable to convince the committee as to the necessity for differentiating in tlie case of this industry, though he is usually very clear. I should be very pleased to hear the Treasurer give some reason for these high duties. I should be , glad to hear him say whether he believes that ; this high rate of duty is necessary in order that the workmen here may be able to compete against the workmen of other countries. Does the right honourable gentleman subscribe to the theory advanced by the honorable members for Yarra and Bourke, that because America has put more brains into -the manufacture of boots, and has invented -better machines than we have, that is a reason -why we should seek to levy duties which will -make up the difference between our backward machinery and the advanced machinery in use in America? If he is prepared to argue in that way, no more need be said from this side. We have heard from the honourable member for Yarra that he desires this protection against American brains. That is a fine confession for the honourable member to make. Judging by our attitude at times one would think that we had a monopoly of that kind of thing in Australia, and now the honourable member tells us that they have more brains in America, and can apply them to the production of boots in such a way as to produce more with less labour, and we must therefore have stiff duties imposed here. If there is anything which states should carry only a moderate duty, it is the apparel of the working people of the community. . It has been shown beyond the possibility of contradiction, by reference to CogMan's statistics, with respect to our factories in New South Wales, that this industrial enterprise can be built up without any duties, owing to our isolation from the older countries of the world, and because I seek to impose of the enormous advantages .we have in the production, locally, of the raw material used in the industry. We have built up the the right industry in New South Wales without the protection of any Tariff duties, and to-day in that State there are more boots made than in Victoria. In addition to that, as showing the profusion of our natural capabilities in connection with this I tried to do that industry, we are exporting leather to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the older countries of Europe, after having almost supplied the needs of the local market. some leather. are. We imported leather to the value of about £80,000 in one year; but we have no duty in New South Wales upon leather, while over here in Victoria they imported £100,000 worth of leather in the face of a stiff duty. Perhaps the honourable member will tell us how the duties brought about importations into Victoria, and how at the same time, in New South Wales, we were able to almost supply our needs without any duties. What a farce it is to put these high duties upon either the r i w material or the finished articles, when we are large exporters of everything which enters into the composition of these goods 1 We ought not to be constantly trying to go in the teeth of nature and of science. I hope this committee will not stultify itself at the beginning of this twentieth century, when everything is being done to lighten the toil which goes to make up our necessities, when everywhere we are seeking in some way to lessen the arduousness of human toil, and to bring about greater and better results with less expenditure of labour.

Honourable members on the other side tell ns, in the most candid way, that these duties should be imposed because there is greater skill in America than in Australia. That admission goes far to destroy their theory, and to show that it is built upon a false basis. Seeing that we are making a Tariff for the whole of Australia, I hope we shall have no such scandalous blot upon it , as there will be, if the duties upon these articles are carried in the way suggested by the Treasurer. Some reference was made to-night to the effect of the Dibbs duties in New South Wales.

It is because you are departing from the moderate duties which were imposed then in New South Wales, and which our people swept away completely, after a trial of them, lis being utterly worthless to help the manufacturing industries of the State, that we object. Those were the duties which Mr facturer of Sydney, gives the following evi' Barton had in his mind when announcing his programme to the Commonwealth ; those were the duties in the mind of the Minister for Home Affairs when making his perfervid appeals to the people of the Hume electorate. But we now hear nothing about them. In stead of duties of 15 per cent, we are tonight offered duties of 50 per cent.; instead of moderate duties we are asked to accept extremely high duties.

MightI remind the Treasurer that 15 per cent, will more than make up any difference in wage rates between those employed in the industry here and elsewhere. than wage rates to be taken into consideration. is there to be considered? The argument has always been that we have to compete with the pauper labour of other countries. W ill the right honourable gentleman tell us what other factors there are which enter into the problem as he sees it, and which justify the imposition of the very high duties submitted in this Tariff? These duties so far as we know are higher than a»y in protectionist America; higher than any in Germany; and higher than any in any other part of the world. I should like to know from the Treasurer why we should impose these high duties in a country which has natural advantages for the production of boots and shoes which cannot be equalled anywhere else in the civilized world ? honourable member for Parramatta saj^s that more boots are manufactured in New South Wales than in Victoria, but upon inquiring from Victorian manufacturers as to the reason for that, I was informed that the quality of the boots manufactured in New South Wales is inferior to that of the boots manufactured in Victoria.

Por instance, Mr John Wright, boot manudence :What are the wages paid in your factory ?-The highest wages are £2 a week, they range from £2 down to 20s. How is it the3 can make boots in Victoria and r import them here, and still pay a higher rate of wages than is paid in New South Wales?-Becaus e the output of the factories is larger and more continuous.

We get the imports of all the world. ; they ship to us freely, and the purchasers-the uierchants and the shopkeepers here -ar e alwaj'S in favour of the imported goods rather than those locally produced ; that is one reason. Another reason is that a better class of goods, and more highly fashioned class of goods is made in Victoria than is the custom in New South Wales, and those goods are imported into New South Wales. We have not the chance to make them-ou r workmen are not trained to make them ; the material is not produced iu New South Wales. If we want a specially good class of leather we send to Victoria for it What do you pay your clickers ?-From 20s. to £2. The foreman gets £2. That is a very low wage?-Very low.

That means an all-round impost of 3s. 4d. per pair irrespective of the value of the boots. Under the original proposal, a pair of boots invoiced at £ 2 would be subject to a duty of 7s. 8d. If boots were invoiced at 20s. per pair the duty upon them would be 4s. Sd, .is against 3s. 4d. under the present proposal;. if they were invoiced at 10s. it would amount to 3s. 2d.; and if invoiced at 5s. it would represent 2s. 5d. It is abundantly evident therefore that the present proposal will press more harshly upon the poorer classes of the community than would the original proposition. Indeedi t appears as if the proposal under discussion were designed to reduce the duty upon articles which are used by the wealthy in order that an additional impost may be placed upon those used by the poor. The Treasurer has been candid enough to tell us that, as a result of the operation of this Tariff, he expects the importation of the cheaper sorts of boots to cease. Therefore we are to lose all the revenue that would come from the bulk of the boots imported, and to derive only a small amount from the importations of the superior article. more revenue by reason of the goods being made locally and the people spending their monej' here. beautiful figment in which the Treasurer has indulged from time to time, but which he will find it impossible to establish by any proof whatever. He has said that as a result of the encouragement given to local manufacturers the imports will decline to the extent of £5,000,000. How is he going to substitute for that £5,000,000 worth of imports some form of revenue production other than that of importation 1 I am convinced that the good sense of this committee will not tolerate the imposition of a specific duty of 40s. per dozen upon men's boots, and I hope that we shall finally resolve to levy an ad valorem rate which will afford to the boot industry all the protection for which it can reasonably ask. must congratulate honourable members upon the opposite side of the chamber upon their courage in leading what they must recognise to be a forlorn hope, by advocating in the first place the imposition of any duty at all, and in the second the imposition of such a stupendous rate as that asked for by the Treasurer. Surely when the right honourable gentleman proposes to levy from Is. I d . to 3s. 4d. per pair upon every description of boot used in Australia -whe n out of the 3s. 4d. which represents the power of taxation that he hands over to the manufacturers of the Commonwealth he will get less than 2d. per pair as revenue-h e is reaching the very extremity of a protectionist proposal. Yet he has frequently declared that he is not in favour of prohibition, and desires to see outside competition. That statement, however, is negatived to-night by the duties proposed upon the articles enumerated under this item. How can there be any outside competition when a duty of 3s. 4d. is operative' upon an ordinary pair of boots? The fact is, that if the duty is put into operation by the manufacturers-and they have power to do this by combination-the wearer of a fair pair of boots will have to give one pair out of every three pairs to the Customs authorities. Not only is the fixed duty upon the cheapest boots equal to that which is charged upon the very highest-priced articles, but the user of the cheaper article will consume more boots in a year than will the user of the more expensive. The working man, who travels chiefly upon foot, and works possibly amidst stone and rock, must require more boots in a year than the ordinary man who wears an article of better quality. Consequently the duty will be exacted from the former more often than it will be from the well-to-do man. There has never been a worse case made out for the imposition of a high duty than has been established in connection with this particular item. Is there not evidence that if a duty is demanded it should be a comparatively low duty? Is there not evidence that in New South Wales a very large industry has been established ; and that in Tasmania, with a population of not much more than a third of that of Melbourne, three or four factories exist with a 20 percent, duty? That State can successfully compete against the United States, which the Victorian manufacturers say they fear, unless they are given the benefit of a protective duty of from 50 to 60 per cent. Surely that fact is the best evidence that no such duty is needed, and unless the manufacturers combine to raise prices, no such duty can be taken",57,Geokge Tubnek Tha T Is In The We Were Told When Hats Were Under Discus

I do not desire to repeat the figures placed before the committee by other honourable members; but I should like to point to the delightful trust which the Treasurer has in those to whom he hands-over this power of taxation. The Treasurer has just stated that the reason protection is specially needed in the Australian boot industry is that theAmerican makers, after supplying their own marketand supplying that market at their own. prices-hav e surplus stocks, which they ship at extremely low rates to such markets as our own. There is the one reply to that statement that practice has not killed the boot trade in New South Wales. The Treasurer also said that he hoped Australian manufacturers would send their surplus to other places. done if other countries acted on the Australian principle, and refused to admit the goods. But supposing that Australian manufacturers did export their surplus, what would it mean ? Apparently it would mean the, repetition of what very often takes place in America,, where, owing, to the farming out of the high duties to manufacturers, high prices prevail within the country, and low prices without the country, so that the output, however large, may be disposed of. I am simply dealing with the Treasurer's arguments. I am showing that the very system which he says obtains in America, only obtains under a high protective Tariff, and if such a Tariff is adopted here, it may obtain within our own borders. I would also point out most emphatically that the Treasurer, while the kind. he has frequently declared that his desire was fairly to average the duties of the States, hasi n this case, attempted no average whatever. He has put Victoria against the rest of tlie Commonwealth. than a third of the duty off Victoria. have not tried to dwell upon State differences, but we cannot be silent when the-Treasui'er by his acts creates such preferences. The highest duties in the several States other than Victoria before federation were those in Queensland and South Australia, which were practically the same and compared with the present proposal are 33s. against 40s., 25s. against 35s., and so on. Even the duties of Queensland and South Australia were considerably below the duties now proposed by the Treasurer. The duty in Tasmania was only 20 per cent. ; in Western Australia it was 10s. or 18s. a dozen pairs, or 15 per cent., and in other cases on girls' boots and slippers, 15 per cent. Where, then, is the average? jNew South Wales, with no duty at all, is not considered. A duty of 15 or 20 per cent, would have shown some consideration, and some approach to an average. But the Treasurer, on behalf of the Victorian manufacturer, simply says to tlie rest of Australia, ""Whether you need these duties for your manufacturers or not, you shall have duties which are higher than have ever been imposed on the people of Australia outside Victoria."" That is not only unwise, but unnecessary. I do not believe that Victoria requires these high duties. I believe that she is just as well able to compete as any of the other States. If she is not, it is because her machinery is not up to date. Her people are well able to compete, but if we assume they are not then Victoria will have to go down in competition with other States which have shown their ability to manufacture under lower or no duties. I would also point out, in reply to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that his speech, in one part, was the most absolute condemnation of the proposal that could have been made by any honourable member. He stated that in 1896 he had given evidence to the effect that men were working, in the boot trade in Victoria for 15s. per week.",60,Geokge Tubnek Tha T Is In The We Were Told When Hats Were Under Discus

287,Mr Mauger,"I never said anything ofstated that that was the case in 1896. saying that I gave evidence. "" evidence,"" I merely meant to say that he had put forward that evidence, though whether he put it forward in Parliament or before a committee I do not know. able member that that was not a statement made by me. the fact, because the honourable member has already admitted that in 1896 bootmakers in Victoria were making boots for 15s. a week, and he says he was doing his best to raise them from that wage. Here is the statement to which I referMr S. Mauger, M.H.B,., Secretary of the Victorian Protectionists' Association, speaking on November 10, 1896, at the South Melbourne Town Hall, said:-It was said that the bootmakers wages were only 15s. per week. If that was true it was due to unrestricted competition in the trade. It was the very success of protection done in connection with the duty on boots which produced the reduced wages in the boot' trade, because every journeyman operator was able to start for himself, and so increase bhe cutright honourable gentleman of that famous throat competition. A t that time of distress the duty was 45s. per dozen pairs, or 3s. 9d. per pair which is higher bhan the duty which the Treasurer now asks us to impose. If the higher duty could save the worker, why did it not save him then 1 It did not. Low as the wages may have been in free-trade New South ""Wales they never reached so low a level as that. Now, I will allude to another statement made by the honourable member for Bourke. He said that what enabled America to compete so successfully was the large home market. Isi t nob a peculiar bhing that when bhe boot industry has reached such a level in New South Wales without any duty, and has been successful in Tasmania with only 20 per cent -in spite of the competition of Victoria, New South Wales, and the United Statesa higher duty is required just when we are enlarging our home market ? We are enlarging the home market, so far as concerns Tasmania, from a reachable population of 200,000 people to 3,500,000. We are enlarging it for New South Wales from, we will say, 1,500,000 to 3,500,000; for Victoria, from 1,250,000 to 3,500,000; and for South Australia, from less than 400,000 to 3,500,000. Isi t not an extraordinary thing that when we are doing that the Treasurer proposes largely to increase the protection in Tasmania, in South Australia, in Queensland, and in Western Australia ? Surely a duty even less than the duty which satisfied small Tasmania would be sufficient for the enlarged home market of Australia. I do not wonder at honourable members opposite not being able to get up and support this proposal. It is a credit to I can assure the honorthem that they let their consciences influence them to that extent. I only hope that the working of their consciences will affect those of Ministers, and that the latter will accept a much lower duty than that they now propose. sorry that the distinguished sbranger who graced our debate this evening for a short time is not now present. I refer to the Prime Minister. It is an unusual pleasure to see him here during the Tariff debate, and I am exceedingly sorry that he did not see his way clear to remain for a longer period, so that he might learn what is being and shoes. I should like to remind the speech which he delivered at Maitland, and which was carefully read throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Every word of that, speech was weighed carefully, and, rightly or wrongly, the right honourable gentleman led us to believe bhat he was the Prime Minister of a Government who would not favour anything in the nature of extremely high duties. He appealed to the sympathies of his audience and the people of Australia, and talked pathetically about "" the pattering of bare feet."" When speaking aboub the pattering of bare feet, he did not tell the people that his Government was going to propose a duty of 111 per cent, upon the poorest class of boots worn by the community. The duty we are now considering ranges from 22 per cent, to 111 per cent. It is now proposed by bhe Treasurer to substitute for the composite duties a duby of 40s. per dozen pairs, and if honourable members work that out they will find that, upon boots worth 3s. per pair, that duty will amount to 3s. 4d. per pair, or 111 per cenb. On boots worth 4s. per pair, the Government proposal will mean a duty of 88 per cenb.; on boots worth 6s. per pair, 66 per cent.; on boots worth 10s. per pair, 33 per cent.; and on boots worth",61,Geokge Tubnek Tha T Is In The We Were Told When Hats Were Under Discus

293,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"I am very15s. per pair, 22 per cent. So it--will go on until the more expensive boots will-i.be very slightly taxed indeed. I think we may say that the result of the federal elections would have been very different if the Prime Minister, at Maitland, in the same breath in which he talked about "" the pattering of bare feet,"" had said he was going to propose a duty of 111 per cent, 'upon the poorest class of boots used. AVe, on this side, are regarded, I suppose, as extremists, because we advocate an ad valorem duty of 15 or 20 per cent. Surely that is not an extraordinary proposal when we remember that a duty of 20 per cent, has been carried upon perfumeries and fancy goods, which are the luxuries of the rich. I should like particularly to refer to the statements made by the honourable member for Melbourne Porte in,the speech he made within the past hour. He referred to the very deplorable state of things that exists in England, and especially to . the sweating in the boot trade at Northampton. When I interrupted him to remark that sweating also existed in Victoria when a high duty was imposed itf that State, the honourable member could not see that the interjection had any application. He said that the sweating in Victoria was due to something altogether apart from protection, and that protection was not the. beginning and the end of the progress and prosperity of a nation. Why did the honourable member not apply that argument when he was trying to saddle free-trade with the sweating .existing in England? He carefully avoided applying, in the case of England, the argument which he applied with so much satisfaction to himself when dealing with Victoria. When he talked so much of the existence of sweating in England, the honourable member should have told us something of the condition of things existing in Victoria under high protective duties. I should like to refresh his memory on the subject, and io order to do so I will quote from a paper thab is highly esteemed by the honourable member. This appeared in the Melbourne Age of August 16, 1894. It refers to the state of things in the boot trade in highly protected Victoria at that timeWages in the boot trade, as in every other industry, has seen an enormous decline during the past few years. . . . . Acoordingto the report of a meeting, supplied hy the secretary of the Bootmakers' Union, the speeches indicated a shocking state of affairs in connection with the non-union shops, allegations being made that 30 I the worse forms of sweating were practised in the attempt to get wnges down to the lowest possible limit. The men affirm that they cannot be much worse off even witb no work than they are at the present starvation rate of wages. So much for high protective duties in Victoria. There is further a report of a meeting of operatives and others interested called to protest against the sweating in' the boot trade. That meeting was held in July, 1895, and the report of it appears in this estimable journal, The Age. We are told that Mr Trenwith, M.P., bootmaker, and leader of the labour, as well as of the protectionist party, moved the first motion at that meeting, which wasThat this meeting views with intense concern the rapid extension of the pernicious sweating system in one of our largest and most profitable industries, namely, the boot making, resulting as it has in the employment of large numbers of children for excessively long hours under tbe most unhealthy and brutal conditions, thus throwing out of employment scores of honest workmen. This was all under protective conditions. When I mentioned a statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports concerning the wages in the boot trade in 1896, the honourable member replied by saying that 1896 was the boom year, when the trade ought to have been flourishing. ' was the year when the' crisis came as the ' result of the boom. honourable member's contention is that it was the year when Victoria was suffering from the effects of the boom, and consequently was a time when the trade was:. perhaps in the worse possible c o n dition. It is singular, however, that the honorable member carefully omitted to-mention another fact which operated con? siderably in connection with the boot tradein Melbourne in that particular year. ' If he wishes a verification of what I say, he will find it in a report by the chief inspector of factories. What that gentleman Bays is that during that particular year an exceptionally large trade was done with Western Australia. It was at that particular time that the boom in Western Australia was at its highest, and a very large trade was done between Victoria and Western Australia in that year. That should have counteracted any bad effects of the collapse of the boom, which were made so much of by the honourable member.

295,Mr Kirwan,"I understand that theto refer to in connection with the honourable member's speech is one token from a speech delivered, at the South Town Hall, on 10th-November, 1896. In the course of what I am sure was a very eloquent and able speech, the honourable member for Melbourne Forts, who has so much to say about the benefits of protection in connection with the boot industry, saidI t was said that the bootmaker's wages were only 15s. per week. If that was true it was due to unrestricted competition in that trade. It is the very success or protection which produced the reduced wages in the boot trade, because every journeyman operative was able to start for himself, and so increase the cut-throat competition. I know that the: honourable member said in this House that he is in favour of the abolition of competition altogether. one of his political beliefs; but here is an 'admission by the honourable member' that the very success of protection produced the lowering of wages, and brought about cut-throat competition, and that is what he asks the Farliament to apply, not to the o£ Victoria alone, but to the whole Commonwealth. I understand that tbe number of persons engaged in the boot industry in the whole of the Commonwealth is something like 10,000, or at the most 11,000. Prom the remarks of a number of honourable members opposite, it would be thought that we. are' legislating merely in the interests of those 11,000 individuals. able members that, of that 11,000, nearly 4,000 are employed under free-trade conditions in New South Wales, and would not in any way be affected by the free-trade I certainly should like to see established throughout the Commonwealth in boots and shoes. In Tasmania they have the protection of a duty of only 20 per cent., and in Western Australia of a duty of only 15 per -cent. WhatI say 'is that it -'might be 'thought that this Parliament -was legislating merely in the interests of the 7,000 persons -engaged in this industry under what might be called 'protective conditions.. I prefer ""that, in legislating on the subject, we should take into consideration the 'users of boots, who number nearly 4,000,000. A great deal has been said 'to-iiight about the importation of American boots. I understand that when the question was -before the New South Wales the cry was that Japanese boots were going to come in. The Japanese boots did not Mr Kirwan. oome in, -and now we have the cry raised that American boots are going to come in. -Melbourne It seems after all that there are a number of members of this committee who think it would be a great misfortune to have cheap boots sold in the Commonwealth. To follow the protectionist argument to its logical conclusion, it would appear that the greatest misfortune that could come upon the Commonwealth in connection with the boot industry would be to have imported"" boots distributed free in this country. I suppose the honourable member for Melbourne Forts would be thoroughly disgusted at that, and would seek to prohibit the free distribution of boots. I do hope the Government will favour the fixing of this duty upon ad valorem lines, and that the duty proposed That is will not be higher than 15 percent. I shall certainly vote with the honourable member for South Australia. Progress reported.
