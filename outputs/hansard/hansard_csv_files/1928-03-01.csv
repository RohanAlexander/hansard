Debate Resumed F R Om 29th ""February (Vide Page 3469) On Motion By Mr That, In The Opinion Of This House, The Go","they sought other fields in which to vernment is deserving of severe censure for iU failure to adequately protect Australian industries and to limit migration to the nation's ability to absorb new arrivals, together my electorate are many Italians, and it with its neglect to formulate proposals to deal is a remarkable fact that for some obscure with unemployment. the House adjourned last night I was discussing migration and particularly the influx of Europeans. The majorit y of foreign migrants to Australia in recent years have been Italians, and I sought last night dispassionately partially migrants and to defend them against the extravagant been made f r om time to time in the press by politicians and other public men, mainly for political propaganda purposes. I pointed out that in 1926 approximately 3,000 Italians entered the Commonwealth,. and I proved conclusively that that influx was not a menace to the predominance of British character in our population. I m migration at the existing rate cannot change the character of our population. My reasons for choosing the year 1926 was because at that time the Labour party was in power in five of the six stales of the Commonwealth. How did those foreigners come to Australia? The suggestion has been made on many occasions that some secret arrangement exists between our Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and Signor Mussolini, the dictator of Italy. T l ar suggestion is fatuous to a degree and worthy of the source from which it emanates. The conditions under which Italians are able to enter the Commonwealth are, or should be, known to every honourable member, but in order to refute the charge that the Government is actively importing foreigners, and to educate those of the public who might be misled by statements of this kind, T shall briefly relate the facts. To any one who has studied 1 March, 19S8. the Bubjecti t is clear that the migration of Italians is a' world-wide movement. While immigration to the United States of (Hon. Sir littleton America was more or less unrestricted, Italians flocked into that country at the rate of hundreds of thousands a year. The migratory impulse in them was so strong, largely because of the economic conditions in their homeland, that when the application of the quota practically closed the doors of America to them settle and labour, and naturally began to give increased attention to Australia. In reason this race has shown a predilection' for the sugar industry in all parts of the world. Menf r o m It a l y are to be found working in large numbers in Kenya Colony, Damaraland, Manilla, and other parts of the Philippine Islands, and Cuba. Those who are in Australia and i mcame of their own volition and complied to do justice to those with the requirements of our immigration law. The majority were fired with charges that have the ambition to become landed proprietors, and being hard working, frugal, and t h r if t y , a very large percentage of them realized, that aspiration. The others continue as labourers in the sugar fields, but it is significent that they are welcomed into the ranks of the Australian Workers' Union, and that the Labour Government in Queensland' has never exercised its power to prevent these foreigners from gaining a livelihood in this industry. On the Queensland statute-book Is"" an Act to prohibit the employment of certain forms of labour in the production of sugar .and for other incidental purposes "" and for the information of honourable members. I quote from it the following provisions:The expression "" Certificate of having passed the dictation test,"" means a certincate under",13,Setup

2,Dr. Nott (Herbert) [2.31],"Whentlie hand of a State officer, authorized for that purpose by the Secretary for Agriculture, that, when the said officer has dictated to the person concerned not less than , 50 words in such language as the Secretary for Agriculture may direct, such person has correctly written them out in that language in the presence of tlie said officer. The expression "" Occupier"" includes owner in fee simple or for any less estate and lessee for life or for any term of years or at w ill , and whether on the share system, or otherwise, and any occupier under any form of tenancy or agreement whatever, whether express or implied, with the owner Of the land. The expressions "" E m p l o y e r"" and "" E m ployee "" have the same meanings as arc respec tively assigned to them by "" The Industrial Peace Act of 1912."" After the passing of this act, it shall be unlawful for any person who has not flint obtained in the prescribed manner a certificate of having passed the dictation test to engage in or carry on the cultivation of sugar-cane upon any land within Queensland of which such person, whether individually or in partnership or association with others, is the occupier. Any such person who acts in contravention of this section shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Ono hundred pounds, and the crop of sugar-cane so being cultivated shall be liable to be forfeited to His Majesty by order of the Court before which the offence is proved. After the passing of this act-( i ) Any employer who, either directly or indirectly or under any pretence or device, attempts to employ, or employs or authorizes or permits to be employed, in or in connection with the industry of the cultivation of sugar-cane and the manufacture therefrom of sugar, any person who has not first obtained a certificate of having passed the dictation test; ( i i ) Any person who has not first obtained a certificate of having passed the dictation test who is employed in or in connection with such industry: shall be guilty of an offence. The Queensland Labour Government has the power to restrict and even to prohibit foreigners of any nationality from occupying land in Queensland for the cultivation of sugar; but it has not used it. From time to time it bas stated for propaganda purposes by members Opposition that, the sugar industry of Queensland is passing into the hands of Italians, and that this is against the best interests of the"" people whom it pretends to represent and for whose welfare we are told it has the highest regard. If that is so why does the Queensland Labour party not use the power which it grants, just as I believe in preference to .has to prevent such an alleged calamity? returned, soldiers, and for that reason 1 Members' of the Australian Workers am glad that the Commonwealth ha? Union have also frequently asserted that Italians are a menace to the advancement of Australian industry; but the Queensland Government, which relies upon the Australian Workers' Union for its existence, has never sought to nrevent or limit the influx of Italians into the Queensland sugar areas or their acquirement of sugar growing properties. There is a good deal of humbug and hypocrisy in the efforts that are being made to saddle the Commonwealth Government with responsibility for the influx of foreigners into ; Australia. The statement that these people are a pressing and urgent menace to our economic welfare is neither more nor less than a myth whicli carries the approval of the Australian Workers' Union, and is encouraged and fostered by State Labour Governments in an insane desire to saddle the Commonwealth Government with a responsibility that in the light of facts it cannot be expected to accept. I wish now to discuss a little further and briefly the subject of British migration to Australia. In 1926 the CommonwealtL received 37,000 British migrants. But did this Government do any canvassing to obtain them? Every honourable member knows very well that it did nothing of the kind, for 98 per cent, of them were nominated by persons already in Australia, or were assisted to come here by some authority other than the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members opposite would have acted more honestly had they made this clear in the course of their speeches. Every one who has any knowledge of the subject is aware that the States are responsible for the requisitioning of nominated and assisted migrants. Labour Governments, which controlled the affairs of five out of the six States during the year of which I have been speaking, must bear the responsibility of having brought the -of the migrants here.' It is well that statements of this kind should be made. in reply to the loose and childish charges respecting migration which honourable members, opposite frequently lay at .the door of this Government. I believe in preference to British mientered into an agreement witb. the Briin certain quarters. This is not as it tish Government for the expenditure of should be. I shall be quite ready to Â£34,000,000 over a period of years on justify on the public platforms of this the development of Australia, with the country the action of the Government in object of encouraging British migration appointing commissions of this character. to our shores. No one could honestly say, after studying the record of this industries has been discussed at some Government, that it has not made a length during this debate. I congratugenuine and generous endeavour to inlate the Minister for Trade and Customs crease our population from British stock. ( Mr Pratten) upon the success of his Sneers have been cast at the Goadministration of his difficult departvernment because it has appointed a ment. I believe that every fair-minded number of commissions, and, particumember on this side of the chamber, or larly the Development and Migration the other, will agree with me that the Commission, problems of development which await with marked credit to himself and with solution in Australia; part I agree witb its policy in this every possible step to make himself cogregard.

The subject of tariff protectibn for our to investigate various Minister has discharged his onerous duties but for my advantage to the country. He has taken do tooccasions when tariff schedules have been Personally I support the GoAlthoughI that we should do this., even if it were necessary to impose an embargo on the importation of such commodities. In such cases there should be no objection to the Government imposing an almost prohibitive tariff to encourage local production. freely criticized by the free trader, it is essential to the progress and welfare of the people of Australia. The Prime Minister recently announced the renewal of the sugar agreement for a further period of three years. This has met with bitter and open hostility from certain individuals who are ill-informed concerning the possibilities of the Australian sugar industry. Such persons have never troubled to investigate the subject of sugar production in all its ramifications, and do not know that within the next two years Great Britain will be in the chains of economic bondage to the ring which controls the sugar markets of tbe world. . This will lead to starvation prices, which will not be exceeded by those which were charged in Great Britain during tbe war when Britain was tied to the European beet producers. It is wise,' therefore, to unprecedented squandering of public give our sugar industry an opportunity to expand and to supply the Empire with a commodity which is vital to its existence. ber must not forget peanuts. for Swan should advocate the production of peanuts in ""Western Australia. If he did that he would, I am sure, receive the thanks of the people in that State -he did. He fought the principle We are a primary producing nation, and np to the present have not been able to develop our secondary industries owing to various factors with which I shall deal in a few moments. Our primary industries provide a wide field for employment at lucrative rates during certain periods of the year; but unfortunately when the harvest is over there is a considerable amount of unemployment, and in the secondary industries employment is largely dependent upon an effective protective tariff. has been mentioned by honourable members chamber. difficulty is, as has been admitted by every one who has considered tbe subject, due to the fact that our secondary industries are not developing at a rate sufficiently rapid to absorb the unemployed during slack periods in primary production. We have had an enormous amount Although such a policy .is of "" sob stuff"" from honourable members opposite about unemployment. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) in referring to the subjecthe has been responsible for moreunemployment in Queensland than any one else-trie d to convince the House that the Prime Minister said that there was practically no unemployment in Australia. The Prime Mininter did not say anything of the kind, and the honourable member for Dalley.knows it. The right honourable gentleman gave certain figures, which were verified by the Miuister for Trade aud Customs( Mr Pratten) beforebe resumed his seat. I can say without fear of contradiction that one of the greatest contributing factors to the unemployment which we have in our midst to-day is. the financial.orgies of certain Labour governments in the various States which have gone in for an money. I shall quote the honourable member for Dalley, because he has a certain reputation in. Queensland for saying wise things, and an unfortunate --The . honourable memnotoriety for doing foolish"" things. The honourable member said on one occasion that they had imposed taxation practically to the limit in ' Queensland, and that he would combat the introduction .of a 44-hour week, which to his credit, to the last ditch; but subsequently he had to accept the principle as one that would bring about the millenium in industrial affairs. After eight years of maladministration by Labour governments of which he was the head, or a leading Minister, taxation had been imposed to,the limit! Would any one invest money or establish new industries in a State where taxation has reached saturation point? We cannot in such circumstances expect persons to erect facThat tories, establish industries, and thus provide avenues of employment. During his on both sides of the dissertation on unemployment the honorThe present unemployment able member pitched a harrowing tale, and gave to the House a series of explanations why men were unemployed. He",13,Charlton
3,Mr Gkegoey,,16,Charlton
4,Dr. Istott,"The honourable membershould know-: he is a specialist in the causation of unemployment, as his record in Queensland indicates. I was particularly gratified to hear him say at this period of his political career that he thinks that men who are not members of a union have the same right to a living as have unionists. That is one of the wise things the honourable member sometimes says. I hope that when put to the test he will not as usual swallow his words concerning those who are outside the pale of unionism; but will see to it that they have an opportunity to earn a living at all times. At this critical time, when Â«election ballots are taking place, honourable members opposite do not like to hear one of their own party advocating that the non-unionist should have the same right to earn his living and daily bread as has the unionist. I , for one, congratulate the honourable member for Dalley on his sane attitude. -The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Mr William Morris Hughes were direcAbbott) gave pertinent instances of the victimization of non-unionists-o n these examples I need not dilate. ""We have heard from honourable members opposite a great deal about the failure of this Government to develop industry, yet the honourable member for Dalley is so keen to foster developto the honourable member that the informent in Australia and to find employment for our workers that he has gone out of his way to become a director of an American firm which is importing goods into this country.

Groom) -This is not a point of order; but the honourable member is entitled to make a personal explanation. That is usually done at the close of the speech, though sometimes it is allowed at the time the statement is made. However, I am sure that, as he has given his assurance that he is not a director of the Celotex Company, it ' will be accepted by the honourable member for Herbert. assurance given by the honourable member for Dalley. By way of explanation, I should like to say that about three weeks ago, when in Sydney in company with the Director of the Queensland Intelligence Bureau, and 6ther gentlemen, I met the secretary of the Celotex Company, and he definitely told me that Mr Theodore and tors of the company. able member accept my statement? Dr. N""OTT -Certainly . misstatement ? mation came to me from what I took to be a reliable source. I have with me an extract from the Sydney Morning Herald containing a statement by the honourable member for Dalley, which, as far as I know, has not yet been denied. In it he gives great credit to this Government for assisting in the development of Australia. The extract relates to the Roma Oil Corporation, and reads*' Mr E. G. Theodore, M.P., a director, who seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, said that the Commonwealth had recommended against the utilising of the bore for gas production, since damage might be done to the producing qualities of the dome if tlie gas was drawn upon. The Government's advice was to carry out further prospecting and drilling,, at different sites and greater depths. The fact that the oil was so fine showed that it had' passed through some strata from a not far distant pool, and the Oil was probably present in commercial quantities.

Just as the discovery of coal convened by the Prime Minister in an made Great Britain, and just as the discovery of petrol, which has largely supplanted coal, helped America, so we believe that the discovery of oil in Australia will help to make this country. This Government is deserving of much credit for assisting in the search for oil ful influence to bear upon Labour memby the appointment of experts who practically occupy positions similar to those of the various commissioners who are now dealing with other phases of development in Australia. Govermnent is certainly to be congratulated for having adopted a far-reaching and effective policy in connection with tbe fostering of our industries, for what applies to the case of oil overcoming those obstacles which,, surapplies to the other industries which this rounded and shrouded by misunderstandGovernment continually tries to assist. I have no wish to unduly prolong the debate, but I must refer to the red herring that the honourable member for Reid has dragged across the trail by discussing during this debate the building of two Australian cruisers in Great Britain. The honourable member delved into history in a futile endeavour to explain what the Government should .do to foster industry. Honourable members opposite have contended, again and again, that the building of the two cruisers abroad has meant a great loss to the workers of Australia. If we search the records of Queensland during the administration of the honourable member for Dalley, we find that the honourable gentleman went abroad to obtain steel bridges, and that on other occasions machinery and locomotives were purchased abroad. The Balmain Federation of Boiler and Locomotive Makers passed a motion of protest against the actiou of the Queensland Government in placing orders for locomotives outside the Commonwealth, at a time when there was great unemployment in Queensland. I strenuously oppose the censure motion. It deals mainly with immigration, the protective policy of the Governorable member is well aware that it ment, and unemployment. Unfortunately tralia fully recognize that this Government is doing its best to give relief to the people, and to develop Australia along right lines. As an earnest of that, let me refer to the conference which is being endeavour to bring about industrial peace. I regret that, although among the Opposition, and in the circles of Labour generally there is a feeling that the conference should take place, it is possible that the paid agitator will bring his banebers to prevent the holding of the conference. I hope that wise counsels will prevail, and that in the interests of the development and prosperity of AusThe tralia the conference will be held. If the delegates attending it confer in an atmosphere of good-will and fellowship, and with a desire to achieve the object in view, we shall go a long way towards ing and suspicion in the past, have provoked, bitterness and strife among capital and labour, and employer and employee, with the dislocation of industry to the detriment of Australia as a whole. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion of censure submitted by the Leader of the OppositionThat in the opinion of this House the Government is deserving of severe censure for its failure to adequately protect Australian industries and to l i m it migration to the nation's ability to absorb new arrivals, together with its neglect to formulate proposals to deal with unemployment. I was rather amazed at the speech of the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott). His vain effort to blame the Queensland Labour Government for the influx of Italians into that State was ludicrous. He referred to a measure on the statute-book of Queensland, entituled the Sugar Cultivation Act, which he knows quite well was introduced in accordance with a request of the Fisher Federal Government, that, when the Sugar Excise and Bounty Acts were repealed, the State Government should pass legislation to prohibit the employment . of coloured labour in the cane-fields of Queensland. The honwas not intended that the act should",17,Charlton
14,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [3.10],"apply to a white race like the Italians. He also knows that if the Queensland Government applied the provisions of the Sugar Cultivation Act, which was intended to exclude coloured races to the Italians who came in with the approval of the Commonwealth Government, the Bruce-Page Ministry would be the first to protest. the State Government was acting unfairly, and was creating an international embarrassment that would probably lead to most serious trouble. The honourable member for Herbert knows better than anybody else that that is what would happen. If the Queensland Government applied the dictation test to the Italians coming in, he would probably be one of the first to object, and would ask the Federal Government to intervene. honourable member also said that the Australian Workers' Union in Queensland accepts Italians as members. Naturally, when, the Italians find employment in the canefields, the union 'has no option but to admit them to membership. matter of self-preservation. large number of men' would be employed in the industry for less than the award rate, and the Australian Workers' Union would be de-registered if it did not' admit them. Preference is granted 1 to the members of the union in the sugar industry of Queensland, and what standing would the union have if it refused membership to the Italians employed in the canefields? Italians who are good members of the' union, and abide by its rules. union refused to accept them it would create a big industrial crisis, because there would probably be a cessation of work in the sugar fields, and resultant loss to thousands of growers in the honourable member's electorate. please honourable members opposite, whatever they did. honourable member knows well that the only Government that could intervene to restrict the flow of Italian migrants is the Commonwealth Government. State Ministries are not consulted with regard to the Italians coming to Australia. These men arrive by boat loads. Over 9,000 Italians entered the country in 1927, and they came witb the approval of the Commonwealth Government. The Labour party is not opposed to the Italians as a race. We admit that they make good settlers,, and are It would say that useful workers. I recognize, too, that they are white men, and that their country is noted for its art, science and learning. Many of them have done good pioneering work in Queensland; but we say that it is unfair to them, and doubly unfair to the Australian workers who are pushed out of employment, when thousands of these unfortunate individuals, unfamiliar with our language and our local conditions, The and without friends, are dumped down in Australia, and forced to live on the ration dole unless they succeed in pushing an Australian out of employment. Certain honourable members opposite have a definite object in view in seeking to encourage the migration of Italians who do not understand our arbitration laws and industrial conditions. Tbese members hope to induce them to work for less than the award rate, and thus break down the conditions of employment operating in Australia. that. should stand for preference to Australian workers. Unfortunately, there are certain employers who prefer to engage I know foreigners. I was told recently that in the Childers district numerous gangs of If the Southern Europeans had taken the place of good Australian workmen who had their homes in the neighbourhood of Childers and Bundaberg, and had spent their earnings in the district. The blame for all that must lie at the door of the Commonwealth Government. When we protest against these things we are not taking exception to, the Italians as a race.

21,Mr Atkinson,"Why call it indiscriment. We are told that certain representations have been made to the Italian authorities. Our first duty, however, is to our own people, and to their relatives in Great Britain, who would make good Australians. The encouragement of an indiscriminate flow of migrants from Southern Europe, without provision being made to absorb them as settlers on the land, or in useful industries, is calculated to bring about discontent, bitterness, and probably industrial upheavals. If they could be absorbed I would welcome them. honourable member for Herbert evidently thinks that he personally was responsible for winning the seat he holds in this House, and on every occasion he tries to besmirch the name of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). a mission. had better taste he would realize that his attitude is a paltry one, and the winning of the seat was due to the misrepresentation practised by the Nationalist party at the last election. sentations in connection with the seamen's strike. A definite pledge was made by the Leader of the Government that if he were returned to power he would deport Walsh and Johnson. and its supporters depicted those men as outrageous individuals, as bolsheviks of the wildest type. were compensated. stead of being deported they were compensated for the inconvenience they had suffered because of their detention. allow Jock Garden to leave Australia. opportunity they roundly condemn''him; but when' he evinced a desire'to visit China tbey would not grant him the necessary permission. They were afraid he might stay there and are keeping him handy for the next election, to hold him up as a bogey man, because they fear that. Walsh and Johnson may not then be in the picture. I feel sure that greater alacrity is not shown in the payment of any bill than was displayed by the Government in connection with the compensation of Walsh and Johnson for the inconvenience to which they were put so that a political "" stunt"" could be worked on the eve of the last election. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) described the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) as "" the tragic Treasurer."" This and similar bogies were the deciding factor in the victory of the Nationalist party in the electorate of Herbert. The seat was not won from Labour, because The Nationalism had held it for eleven years. If we were to accept the statements of the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. -Nott) we should conclude that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) had ruined Queensland, and had been responsible for an unpredecented amount of unemployment during his leadership of the Government of that State. sider that he did. for Warringah was paid Â£1,000 a year to make statements of that character.

Dairy products from Â£3,899,000 to Â£0,G78,000. Pastoral industry from Â£18,800,000 to Â£22,000,000 (value). Savings Bank deposits from Â£10,000,000 to Â£21,500,000. Population from 070,000 to 850,000 persons. There was less unemployment when the honourable member for Dalley vacated office than there had been in. any previous period in the history of Queensland. The workers, instead of being unemployed, were much better off financially. They banked their savings Avith such regularity that the deposits per head of population in the savings banks increased from Â£14 19s. 6d. to Â£24 19s. Id., and the assets of those banks increased from Â£25,000,000 to Â£59,900,000. Moreover, the gentleman who is now the honourable member for Dalley was the only Australian premier who introduced an unemployment insurance scheme under which workers who became unemployed receive a weekly payment, not by way of charity, but as a right. When this Government went on the hustings in the last Federal election campaign they deplored the existence of unemployment, and shed crocodile tears over the plight of the unemployed worker and his starving wife and children. They then promised that they would legislate for national insurance including a comprehensive scheme. What have they done? Nothing. Why? Because any legislation in that direction would. strike a blow, at the profits of the wealthy private insurance companies in Australia, who are the principal contributors to the fighting fund of the spurious political combination which occupies the benches opposite. I refer not to individuals, but to parties. If the honourable member for Herbert were to speak truly he would say that the honourable member for Dalley gave a lead to the rest of Australia when he secured the Mr Fnrdis. passage of humanitarian legislation designed to alleviate the distress that existed in the community; that he was responsible for bold statesmanlike schemes such as the great Northern Burnett irrigation scheme in my electorate. That is one of the finest schemes of its kind in Australia. It embraces an area of 4,000,000 acres, and received the unequivocal recommendation of' the honourable member for Henty when that gentleman was Commonwealth Director of Migration. He was assisted by some of the most'capable land experts in Australia, and had at his command all the data in the possession of the government departments of Queensland. Accompanied by experts he traversed the whole of the country involved, 'and recommended to the then Nationalist Commonwealth Government that the money necessary to inaugurate the scheme should be made available. That government turned down the recommendation because the proposal had emanated from a Labour Premier, Mr Theodore, The Labour government borrowed money abroad, and the work is being carried out. I have a very great respect for the honourable member for Henty because of the action which he then took. Because the Government would not accept his recommendation he resigned a position which carried with it a salary of Â£2,000 per annum. He recognized that a large number of persons would be attracted from the cities and, together with many newcomers to Australia, would obtain useful employment. The other day I had a conversation with a man who came from the Northern Burnett district. He informed me that the farmers there are among the most ' prosperous in Queensland to-day. unemploymentinsurance The area in question is eminently suited to maize and cotton growing .and dairyingoperations. As a result of . the scheme three railway lines are nearing completion at Monto. They converge at that centre, which is in the heart of this great area. Thousands of men are making a good living where formerly only a-few wealthy pastoralists held land. As can be readily imagined, some of them, fought the scheme bitterly, and. supported the Nationalist party with the object of defeating the scheme. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. No t t ) put an entirely different complexion on the matter, but I have stated the facts. If I harbour one grievance more than another against this Government it relates to its dilly-dallying policy over the Northern Burnett scheme. Gepp has had the scheme in hand for some considerable time, but up to the present no finality has been reached. There has been too much delay; and it is imperative , that this Government should arrive at an early decision and provide the necessary loan money in order that the scheme may be carried to f r u i tion. It must be completed and a dam built across the Dawson river so that the necessary 1,250,000 acre feet of water may be conserved to supply the irrigable land in the neighbourhood which, unfortunately, is subject to periodical droughts. I shall probably be asked to state what Commonwealth job. It would establish I would do to create employment.

This Government should subsidize the State Forestry Departments in order that additional areas of Australia might. be planted annually, the subsidies to be taken out of the Â£1,196,000 which is collected annually from the duties on imported timber. That scheme would give employment to many thousands. The should also give effect to the desire of the Australian dairy-farmers that a stabilization scheme should be established in connection with the marketing of dairy produce, based on the cost of production, the farmer to receive the cost of production plus a reasonable amount for the work he, his wife and family perform, and plus a reasonable return ou.the capital invested. No one could cavil at that scheme. Other important matters needing attention are the establishment of a comprehensive national insurance scheme, embracing insurance against sickness, accident and unemployment, and a Commonwealth compulsory wheat pool for Australia. Further legislation should be introduced to provide for a scheme of childhood endowment -. Those matters have been side-stepped bythis Government, principally because their inauguration might jeopardize the profits of the wealthy combinations that supply the bulk of the fighting funds of the Nationalist party. In the course of his speech the Minister item No. 105. The 6-oz. minimum on for Trade and Customs claimed that much had been done by the Commonwealth Government to assist the Australian cotton industry. 1 admit that the industry has been afforded a measure of help by this Government, but uot so much as would have been given had this party been in power, as the Labour party was pledged to a bounty of 2d. per lb. by a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition. I endeavoured to induce the Commonwealth Government to grant a bounty of 2d. per lb. for ten years, or, failing that, at least for a period of five years. Instead of complying with my suggestion, the Government granted a bounty of lid. per lb. for five years. The only support I got was from honourable members on this side of the House. That bounty of 2d. per lb. could have Mr Forde. been paid, and still the annual expenditure would have been well within the limit of appropriation for the year. The appropriation was Â£120,000, and the bounty paid last year was only in the vicinity of Â£15,000, while a bounty at the rate of 2d. per lb. would have cost only Â£20,000. The cotton-growing industry is an important one, and I am vitally interested in it, because there is Commonwealth Government more cotton grown in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia. The cotton-spinning mills are having a bad time, and the grower consequently feels the pinch because the best market for his product is the home market. Many of these mills are not operating at all, or are doing so only to a limited extent, because they cannot compete with imported yarn. Such yarn can be landed here from England for ^d. per lb. less than similar material can be produced in Australia; while from America it can be landed for Id. per lb. less. Another matter which the Minister should take into consideration is that there is no bounty paid on cotton used in percentage yarn, that is, yarn containing both wool and cotton. The higher grades of cotton are used in the manufacture of this yarn. The imported percentage is sold here at a lower price than the Australian yarn. Tbe result is that the local cotton-spinning mills are working half time, or are standing idle, and are not able to buy the raw cotton produced in Queensland. Then take tariff cotton tweeds is being defeated by the Japanese, who are exporting to this country cotton tweeds weighing 5f oz. to 5Â£ oz. a yard. In December last, when the tariff schedule was before the House, ] strongly urged that the proposed increase of duty on cotton piece goods and socks and stockings should be made operative at once. It was the intention of the Government to make it operative from the 1st July of this year. Eventually the Minister agreed to have the duties brought into force in January, but the importing friends of the Government got busy in the meantime, and imported large quantities of yarn, with the result that the Australian cotton-spinners have not used up the raw cotton bought from Queensland last season, and they say that they will not be able to buy any more cotton from that, Statef o r the coming season. In -December last I quoted figures dealing with tbe importation of cotton fabrics from Japan, and I asked the Government whether it stood for the importation of goods from a country which workedlong hours for 17s. a week, when such goods were the means of throwing Australian workmen out of employment. portations from Japan were as follows:1923-24 .. 1924-25 .. 1925-20 .. .. . . Â£73,112 1920-27 .. .. . . Â£127,070 The result of this has been that the Australian manufacturer is being knocked out. So much of these cotton fabrics have been imported into Australia that the cotton-spinning mills here are practically idle, and the Queensland cotton growing industry is threatened with extinction if something is not done by tbe Government. It is no excuse to say that we have already dealt with the tariff. Has not this Parliament power to re-consider the questiou. to bring this matter before Parliament again, and to propose tbe necessary relief to the industry. In the Labour Review of the United States of America of November, 1926, there is a paragraph reading as follows:In Japan since 1923 the legal limit for factory hours has heen eleven a clay (without a weekly limit). The legal age for beginning work up to the present year was twelve. . . . In practice children of both sexes go to work as soon as any employer is willing to take them. Average wages are 19s. 3d. a week for male adults, and 12s. Od. a week for female adults. That is what the Australian manufacturer is being asked to compete against. It is absolutely impossible to compete, and it is quite clear that the measure of protection given by the Government is not sufficient. This protection should be increased to enable the Australian manufacturer to go on producing yarn and buying the raw cotton from the growers in Queensland. Last year the Australian cotton crop amounted to 4,S24 bales, and was sold by the Cotton Pool Board to the Australian manufacturers. The chief purchasers were G. A . Bond and Company, 2,038 bales, the Australian Silk and Cotton Mills, 1,873 bales, and Vicars and Company, 727 bales. Because of this local market the growers obtained a better price for their product, which realized. 5d. per lb. for seed cotton. If the cotton had been exported to Liverpool the growers would have been 2Â£d. per lb. worse off. That is why they advocate a higher duty on imported cotton fabrics in order to keep the product of alien coloured labour out of the country. Shortly after entering into contracts for The imthe last season's crop, the Australian manufacturers found that they were un.. . . Â£14,524 able to dispose of the manufactured goods .. . . Â£22,542 and yarn at satisfactory, prices, owing to the large importations of foreign goods from abroad. I appeal to the Government to do something, and to cease this lip-loyalty to the cause of protection. I know it is difficult for a man like the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, but as tbe Government was returned on a protectionist policy it ought to give effect to that policy. I give the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) great credit for the free trade influence he wields, although he is not i h the Ministry. I have been over in his electorate, where he It is for the Government makes certain promises to his constituents regarding tariff rates, and I -have no doubt that he plays an important part in keeping down the duties. is mistaken in saying that the members of the Cabinet come here pledged to a protectionist policy. H a l f of them are not pledged to any such policv. land every candidate supporting the Government described himself as a protectionist, whereas in ""Western Australia every Government candidate was pledged to a reduction of the tariff. In Victoria a "" shandy gaff "" policy was supported. To the credit of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) it must be said that he is consistent. Like the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) he would wipe out the sugar embargo and abolish the Arbitration Court to-morrow. able member to show, if he can, how Australia has profited by its protectionist policy. of the Cabineti n favour of free trade, and the remainder supporting what they term a ""reasonable protectionist policy,"" the sugar industry of Queensland would be in jeopardy if it were not for the unanimous vote on this side of the House",22,Charlton

45,Mr Forde,"W it h half the membersin favour of the embargo. There is no certainty that the Government will not at any time declare itself to be in favour of partial free trade. Members of the Labour party are united in their belief that, in tiie interests of Ausover-production of sugar, and be of intralia, and in order to keep out sugar grown by black labour, the embargo on imported sugar should be continued. While I am a firm believer in Empire preference, I do not believe in granting to Great Britain preference to the extent of Â£10,000,000 per annum and receiving in return preference worth only Â£500,000. Sugar entering England from foreign countries pays a duty of Â£11 13s. 4d. per ton. As the preference to Empire grown sugar is Â£4 5s. 7d. per ton, Australian grown sugar sold in England must pay a duty of Â£7 7s. 9d. per ton. In my opinion a proper system of Empire preference would admit Australian sugar into England free. That would make it possible for a large number of British migrants to be employed in growing sugar in the rich coastal districts of Queensland, where they could make a better living than could be made on some of the poorer country in other portions of Australia. I trust that, as a result of his visit to Australia, Mr Amery, the Secretary of State for the Dominions, will induce the British Government to wipe out the duty now imposed on Australian sugar entering England. That could be done without increasing the price of sugar to the British consumer. Empire preference. benefit on Australia, because it would mean an extra Â£2,000,000 per annum to the Australian sugar industry and provide additional employment in this country. Sugar to the value of Â£27,000,000 is imported annually into England from foreign countries, whereas the value of the sugar imported from within the Empire is only Â£6,000,000 per annum. meet England's requirements could, be grown in Queensland. system of Empire preference would enable our sugar iudustry to maintain a much greater population. I hope that some of the emissaries from Great Britain like Sir Robert Horne, whose ability and interest in the Empireare beyond question, will do what they can to induce the British Ministry to grant a real measure of Empire preference. Such a policy would solve Australia's problem of an calculable benefit to the Australian sugar growers, and consequently to. Australia as a nation. The Government should give earnest consideration to the proposal to construct a railway from the Northern Territory through Western Queensland to Bourke. During the recent drought in Queensland, 7,500,000 sheep perished. If we add to that number a natural increase of 2,500,000 sheep which also was lost, we have a loss of approximately 10,000,0.00 sheep, worth at least Â£10,000,000. Cattle to the number of 2,000,000 also perished in the country which would be traversed by the railway I have mentioned. Allowing for the natural increase, the total, loss of cattle would be probably nearer 3,000,000. The value of the live-stock lost during that drought in the area Avhich would be served by the railway would pay for its construction. In considering this proposal the Government should bear in mind that within the next few years millions of acres of good pastoral land along the route of the proposed railway will revert to the Crown. value if it is covered with prickly pear. a menace in the area which that railway would serve. I am not suggesting, that a line should be constructed along the South Australian border, but that, it should serve Winton, Longreach, and Charleville, following the best course to Bourke. Such a line would tap some of the best pastoral land in Queensland. It is estimated that every five years Australia loses merino sheep to the value of Â£22,000,000 through drought. The area most affected is, unfortunately, Western Queensland. The construction of the sufficient to line suggested would be justified, not only as a means of saving our valuable herds, but also as' a means' of defence. Economically it would be a sound proposition. The line would link the Northern Territory with the large centresof'population in the eastern coastal districts of Australia. The Prime Minister has had this matter under consideration, and I",24,Charlton

The great disadvantage obtaining in Queensland to-day was that they had three great railway systems running east and west, and they were not linked up in the western part of the State by a line running north and south,' and, if possible, running south as far as Bourke, in New South Wales. It might be advantageous to construct a line from the Federal Territory linking up the train systems of Queensland and New South Wales. I ask him to do something practical towards giving effect to that statement, and not to allow it to go by the board as have undertakings he gave on the eve of the last election in regard to unemployment in surance, and the provision of Â£20,000,000 to provide cheaper houses for the people. His speech at Longreach showed that he realized the importance of that great national project, and if he w ill only put his words into practice he w ill be helping to develop the back blocks. We hear frequent lamentations regarding the tendency of people to flock from the country into the cities. This project offers a chance to the Government to do something big and statesmanlike for the development of the great rich provinces of western Queensland and New South Wales. Another important aspect of the proposed railway, and one which has an important bearing on the welfare of the people in the large centres of population, is the threatened shortage of meat. Unfortunately, owing to the great war and the Argentine's defeat of Australia in the meat. markets of the old world, there has been serious depression in the cattle industry in Queensland. But I think that MrA . J . B . McMaster put the case well when he said recently, speaking on behalf of the United Graziers' AssociationI do believe, however, that with the great increase in the Australian population the cattle industry will soon become a paying proposition, which it has not been for a number of years. The great majority of Australia's cattle are in central, north and north-western Queensland, but they cannot be made available cheaply in the markets without improved means of transport. The absence of .transport facilities is one of the greatest obstacles to the development of the big spaces of Australia, and I believe that the proposed railway is justified, not only as a defence and economic factor, but also as a means of transporting hundreds of thousands of cattle from the north-west of Queensland to the southern markets. It is estimated that 80' per cent, of our cattle are killed for local consumption; therefore, if tbe Australian population were to increase by 1,500,000, we could consume all the cattle the country produces. When, however,' the beasts have to be travelled by road from North Queensland, from six to nine months is lost in this way, and further delay occurs in restoring them to market condition. A railway would put the cattle into the market much more rapidly and in better condition. I have a few words to say regarding the need for a policy for the man on the land. I expected that long ere this the alleged Country party would have enunciated a policy to assure to the farmer a livin g wage. When the party first came into being in Victoria, some years ago, its slogan was, "" A livin g wage for tbe man on the land."" It s leaders argued that the farmer had as much right as any one else to a living wage, and the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , who is a Ministeri n the present composite Government, became eloquent on this subject. Speaking as president of the Victorian Farmers' Union on 25th September, 1917, he trounced the Nationalists, who, he said, were prostituting the word "" n a t i o n a l "" and were political spendthrifts who were seeking to be returned to their snug billets under the flag of nationalism. He deplored the fact that the people were flocking from the country into the cities to swell the number of unemployed, and said that the farmers would have to band together in a separate party to get due recognition. To convince his farmer friends that he would not be found dead in a 40-acre paddock with the Nationalists, he saidPersonally I would be prepared to 'go down and die fighting rather than sacrifice any of those principles, the acknowledgment and adoption of which has caused us to band together. But did he adhere to those principles when the honourable member for Wimmera had to step out of the Ministry because he found he was being pushed by the hand of big business to do things against his convictions? No; he smugly stepped into the position vacated by his fellow member of the Country party and as an ex-President of the Victorian Farmers' Union is to-day one of the leaders of the alleged Country party wing of the composite Ministry. ber forgets that the light had been switched on by the Treasurer. of the Nationalists prior to entering into an alliance with them"" We switched on the light and compelled them to drop the loot"". Apparently the Treasurer and his colleagues followed the light and shared the loot. I am not surprised that an upright man like the honourable member for Wimmera refused to be a party to the methods of the composite Ministry, and it is little wonder that the unfortunate farmers who were described by the honourable member for Echuca ns serfs, have decided that if they cannot be represented by a genuine Country party, they will support the Labour party which, they know, is free and untrammelled and will help them, even at the risk of interfering with the profits of the middlemen who support Nationalism. After all his protestations,we expected them. the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) to bring forward a policy to help the dairy-farmer and the man on the land. He has always been ready to please their ears with platitudes and fulsome flattery. Speaking at Byron Bay on the 11th January, he saidTlie Australian Government has given the dairy farmers the machinery and the opportunity to succeed. Jfow what is necessary is on the job; they_ have smugly joined a complete 100 per cent, co-operation of all forces with the Nationalists and occupy the individual units of the industry. tion too. the Leader of the Country party to talk platitudes and to demand such an impossibility as the co-operation of 100 per cent, of those engaged in a complex and widely distributed industry. Such a thing is not possible in any industry, and much less in one so far-flung and scattered as dairying. compulsion. supported the request of the Queensland dairymen that the Commonwealth Government should introduce legislation to stabilize the marketing of dairy produce, providing for a compulsory Commonwealth butter pool. They were told that the Government was afraid that such legislation would be unconstitutional. Did it say that when it was asked by the Inchcape combine to legislate for the deportation of Walsh and Johnson? No;' Parliament was asked to pass the legislation and the onus of proving it unconstitutional was thrown upon somebody else. If tbe Government had been sincerely desirous of helping the dairyman it could have introduced the legislation asked for by them, and allowed the profiteering middleman to test it in the law courts. vernment at the last referendum ask for those powers, the lack of which it deplored ? it had not the constitutional power to do what the dairymen asked, tbe Government did not include a request for those powers in the last referendum on proposed amendments of the constitution. cally to include a request to the people for increased power over trade and comme.rce it refused to do so, apparently because the big business interests behind the Government were too strong. The alleged leaders of the farmers who said that they intended to get for the man on the land a living wage have fallen dowu positions which yield to them Â£2,000 a year and perquisites. The Producers' Review which is the official organ of the Queensland Cane Growers' Association, the United Cane Growers' Association of Australia, and the Queensland Cheese Makers' Association, referring to the Treasurer's speech at Byron Baysaid on the 15th FebruaryInstead of imposing that obligation on the dairymen themselves, we say it is the duty of Dr. Earle Page and his Government to. define",25,Charlton

61,Mr Forde,"WheD asked specifitho moans 03' which tlie dairymen of Australia should be able to carry on tlieir calling with at least the same safeguard and Government authority as are given to other classes of the community. The plans which are now being defined to help the dairying industry eminatcd from men in the industry who can devote only limited time to the gaining of their objective. The Federal Government should have time and the means to define remedies for the economic ills which affect an industry on which, to use Dr. Earle Page's words. 1,000,000 people in Australia, or one-sixth of our population are dependent. You, Mr Speaker, no doubt know tbe ability of those who control the Producers' Review, because it is printed at Toowoomba, the centre of your eleel orate, and also the centre of one of the finest dairying districts of Australia. Y o u no doubt recognize that the editor of that review has h it the nail on the head by saying that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Treasurer to come forward and do something practical for the dairymen of Australia; that it is his duty to help them in some tangible way instead of talking platitudes, and declaring they must have 100 per cent, co-operation in their industry. I told the Treasurer, when the Dairy Produce Export ControlB ill was before this House, that the favorable results he anticipated for the dairy farmers would be negligible, and that the measure would put nothing of a substantial nature into their pockets. He said that if the measure were passed the dairy farmers would derive substantial benefit immediately. A t Byron Bay he claimed that the D a i r y Produce Export Control Board had saved the farmers Â£120,000 in the years 1925-26-27 by negotiating w i th shipping and insurance companies and thus securing reductions in freights and rates. To my mind it is absolutely unreasonable to contend that the board was responsible for bringing about those reductions. They would have been made even if the board had not been in existence. But, assuming for the moment that'the board was responsible for saving Â£120,000, that amount divided among 143,000 persons who are directly employed on dairy farms in Australia was only 4d. per Aveek per individual. We were told by the Treasurer that, as a result'-6f the passing of the D a i r y Produce : Export ControlB ill there would be a 1 substantial increase in the weekly remuneration of the dairy-farmers. But again he was talking wildly. As a matter of fact, he secured his election to this House by telling the f armers"" and other electors of the Cowper division that he had only two objects in view in seeking election to this House -the u p l if t i ng of the mau on the land by giving him a living wage, and the establishment of new Statesi n Australia. He has failed to achieve either object. We are told that the Labour party does not stand for a livin g wage for the farmer. That is quite incorrect. Within the last three months, speaking in this House, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), the Deputy Leader of the Labour party, saidIf we insist upon a basic wage, and the observance of a certain standard of living for persons engaged in our secondary industries -and I stand four-square by tliat policywe must also extend protection to those engaged in other industries, whether as wage earners or producers. The people who work on dairy farms are subject to severe competition and the earnings of many of them are below the basic wage. They are entitled to have their standard of living raised, at least so far as that can be done by assuring to them a fair price on the home market. What could be fairer? We know that the proposed stabilization scheme which the Eederal Treasurer was asked to have enacted emanated from the Queensland dairy farmers. We know that Labour in the northern State has established a Queensland butter pool loard, which gives the farmers control of their own industry, taking it out of the hands of middlemen and dealers in Brisbane, much to the annoyance of the Nationalist Federation. The Ministerf o r Markets( Mr Paterson) can bear me out when I say that members of the stabilization committeeMr T. Elood-Plunkett and Mr Purcell, of Queensland, and othersare now asking the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria to enact similar legislation to that passed by the Queensland Parliament. No section of the community is more deserving of assistance than the man who toils on the land from daylight to dark, and whose average weekly earnings in my district amount to approximately Â£2 10s. :per week less. If it were not for the fact that these men are able to grow a certain quantity of vegetables and make their own butter they could not possibly exist on their earnings. It is they whom the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party said in this House we must have the courage to support and for whom we must do our utmost to provide a living wage. The censure motion is well merited. The Government has done nothing but appoint boards to control different departments. one end of Australia to another talking platitudes. They have issued propaganda to every newspaper in the Commonwealth booming their alleged statesmanlike acts, which when examined are anything but statesmanlike. They have done nothing towards the development of Australia. They hold on to office, and administer the affairs of the Commonwealth in a way that is best calculated to help their friends outside to make profits. They allow the importing interests to keep on importing goods to the detriment of our secondary industries. The time has arrived when a halt should be called, and I hope that when they have the next opportunity to ""do so the people of Australia will relegate this Government to obscurity and give a truly Australian government a chance to tackle the many .problems of the country in a statesmanlike manner. hardly congratulate the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Eorde) upon his belief in the freedom and liberty accorded in the Labour Party, but I must congratulate him on the modesty of his requests. I am sure he must have missed a few industries that might be in need of assistance, but I perceive some little diffiand steel manufactures that come to Ausculty infinancingsome of the very modest requests he has made. I thought that the object of this debate was to point to the industrial depression now existing, and suggest means for alleviating it. The honourable member's suggestions are to have child endowment and national insurance and a compulsory wheat pool. He also wants us to build a great national railway from Bourke to Camooweal and further on. He does not say what it is likely to cost. He does not tell us how the railways of Queensland have prospered. He wants bounties on all sorts of produce. There seems to be an insane belief in the minds of many honourable members that a man's election to Parliament is sufficient qualification for him to control'vail'.iindustries with success; in other words, that an industry can be better controlled by Parliament than by the people engaged in it.

This Parliament has imposed an extra duty on butter to prevent New Zealand from sending her butter to Australia; yet our Minister for Trade and Customs is to pay a visit to that dominion to ask for concessions. To my mind, it is a contemptible position in which to place Australia. Why cannot we rely on our own efforts, and fight our own battles? Are we to be always seeking concessions here and there ?

The Burnett scheme certainly comes within the purview of this debate. If we had people working on the Burnett lands they would be producing and providing a market for our secondary industries. But why did not Queensland do what Western Australia did? The Premier of Western Australia entered into an agreement with the British Government by which Western Australia got cheap money for opening up the south-west of the State. Queensland had a good case, why did he not do exactly the same thing? Queensland at the time, and when the Commonwealth Government turned down the Burnett lands proposal, my Government raised money in New York, with the result that there are now more than 1,500 settlers on those lands. very little about the matter, or whether it is a good or a bad scheme.

Such schemes will help secondary industries tremendously, for they will result in the settlement' of the people upon the land thus. providing markets.

An extract which I have taken from an article in 'The Times Trade and Engineering Supplement,, on Australian borrowing w ill , I think, appeal to honourable members opposite, as well as to some honourable members who support the Government. It readsI t is fatally easy for a wholly wrong impression to be derived by the people of a borrowing country as to its effects., for it is rather difficult to appreciate the wide ramifications of heavy borrowing. In the case of Australia, it has shown itself very clearly in the great rise of iinpoits, which in the your ended 30th Juno exceeded exports by Â£20,000,000. An adverse trade balance is not a desirable economic feature in the case of a debtor country. Overborrowing is also reflected in the customs revenue, which since the war has increased from less than Â£17/>00,000 to over Â£40,000,000. The buoyancy of the revenue has been largely due to loans. Loans are imported in the forms of goods and services, and, therefore, heavy borrowing means large customs duties. A year or two ago the Australian taxpayer was given a reduction in direct taxation out of the'large surplus on customs duties. In that case taxation was reduced indirectly out of loans. Another consequence of heavy borrowing is that prices and wages are inflated beyond the world level, and more and more protection is required by industry. ment iu support of the motion. member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), . asked how the States expended the money they borrowed. tion of the loan money which they raise from time to time is expended on their railways. . In the period 1914-26, the sum of Â£24,500,000 was lost in operating the various State railway services. That total includes an amount of Â£3,900^000 in respect of certain South Australian activities which perhaps ought not to be included. To put it in another way, we are losing not less than Â£1,500,000 per annum on the State railway services. the development of the country.

I ask any fair-minded man if he thinks it is fair to ask our railways commissioners to conduct services at a profit, whilst at the same time we appoint arbitration judges with power to impose all sorts of restrictions which make that impossible? I do not wish to cast any reflections upon our arbitration judges, but I do not think it fair that my old friend, Sir John Quick, should have power to determine the conditions under which such an important and essential service should be conducted. It is a stupid policy, and one which should not receive the support of reasonable men. orable member suggest ? was never intended under the Constitution that the Federal authority should have control over railways, particularly over State railways, the money for which has to be provided by the States. The control of State railways is essentially a State function, but we have taken the power from the State parliaments to control their own railway systems-. Would the honourable member for Ballarat tell members of a State parliament that they are incapable of legislating for the control of a service for which they find the money? Let the State mind its 'business, and we attend to our own concerns. Political, parties should not have anything to do with our railway systems, and political influence should be debarred. Here is a statement by Mr Justice Powers from volume No. 20 of the reports for i924, page 1141^ If the Arbitration Court fixes wages which the industry cannot afford to pay then tli'e industry should have recourse to the Tariff Board, which has been created by the Federal Parliament to make necessary recommendations for the granting of whatever protection is necessary. That suggests the vicious circle, of which we have heard so much, in the worse possible form. A judge in arbitration increases wages, the Tariff Board recommends Parliament to increase duties that raise the cost of living, and then the workers go to the arbitration judge again, and he says that, as the Tariff Board is in a position to protect wages. A request is then made for still higher duties, and so the whole business goes on. Where is it all going to end? ing power of the wages of the whole community is reduced. the position of the man on the land? Our wheat-growers have to compete with the wheat-growers of other countries, including India and the Argentine, where coloured labour is employed.

The paragraph readsA close alliance appears to have heen established between the so-called Pratten group of Eastern tin-mining companies, which has its head-quarters in Sydney, and Tin Selection Trust Limited of London. Final negotiations for the purchase of a large area of Eastern tin-bearing country from the AlluvialT in Malaya Company of Sydney were conducted in London by Messrs. H . E. and F. G-, Pratten late last year, when it was agreed that a subsidiary of Tin Selection Trust Limited should give Â£500,000 in cash and 250,000 fully-paid Â£1 shares in a company of Â£1,500,000 for the area. Sir William D. Henry, chairman of Tin Selection Trust Limited, has just announced to that company's shareholders t h a t as the result of the intimate relationship established with the Sydney group that body is to be financially interested with the London Tin Syndicate and the Anglo-Oriental Trust, tlie associates of the London Tin Trust Limited, in a reorganization which is now proceeding. Arrangements have been advanced for the appointment of London boards and the opening of share registers in the offices of the AugloOrientaJ Trust not only in respect to all producing companies at present managed by the Alluvial Tin Malaya Company, but to other established Malayant in companies as controlled by the Sydney group. Trust itself has arranged for the quotation of its shares by the Paris Bourse, so that its interests will have international attention. To obtain skilled technical advice it has decided to obtain the co-operation of leaders ,Qf the Yuba Consolidated Goldfields, the greatest dredging concern of the United States. They will also assist in financing a subsidiary company to be formed to work what is termed the lower Perak area of the Alluvial Tin Malaya Company.

It is do not feel so no wonder that we are beginning to think that there is something wrong with our policy of protection. The Minister talks about patriotism and the building, up of industries here.

127,Mr Gregory,"The honorablehonorable member knows where I stand. I believe that if we keep on increasing duties we shall greatly injure primary production; in other words, kill the goose that lays the golden' eggs. We cannot afford to permit an increase in the present cost of production. If the price of wheat falls, there will be a drastic change in the conditions in the industry. Great caution should be exercised lest anything be done that would tend to further increase the cost of production to the man on the land. Can Australia, with a territory as large as that of the United States of America, afford to tell the world that, despite its wonderful resources, it cannot find room for additional people ? Apart from the empty north, the mineral possibilities of which are yet unrealized, this country is capable of carrying an enormously increased population. Many times I have suggested that concessions should be made to encourage white settlers in our northern area3. It would be foolish to allow the impression to be gained abroad that we discourage the settlement of our vast northern spaces. If the subject of the maintenance of the White Australia policy were ever seriously raised before the League of Nations, I donbt whether two countries, apart from Great Britain and the United States of America, would be prepared to support it. we should tell the world that we refuse to allow white people into Australia. The Opposition holds that, until the people already in this country have been absorbed in profitable employment, we should not pay for the passages of further migrants. countries would reply that, if it were not for the economic conditions now operating here, Australia would have no difficulty in absorbing great numbers of migrants. The rich coastal belt in northern New South Wales and Queensland, between Grafton and Cairns, ought to be carrying millions of people. Some time ago I inspected the country about 60 miles north of Brisbane, and, as I climbed to a height of about 4,000 feet above sea level, the panoramic views were magnificent. I looked clown upon plantations of sugar, maize and pineapples. On the slopes of the range I noticed bananas growing luxuriantly, and, when I reached the top, I saw groves of oranges, mandarins and lemons. Below was a winding silver stream, and in the distance the mighty ocean. It was, indeed, an imposing picture. The growth of timber of all kinds in these hilly regions is wonderful. I am told that the country is equally fertile practically all along the coast. It ought to be carrying a population of 20,000,000, yet with our wretched Restrictions and political interference a great part of it is vacant and unproductive. Every honourable member who believes in promoting secondary industries should also encourage primary production. We should do as was done in Victoria years ago, when a bounty of 2d. per lb. was paid on all butter exported. Under that scheme every butter-producer benefited. We could give, also, a subsidy in the shape of cheap freights; but the whole system is bad and leads to corruption. When I was in office in Western Australia, we declined to send settlers out more than about 60 miles from Northam, because the country beyond was regarded as being out of the rain belt. We thought that it would be criminal to send men farming in the dry. areas; but to-day they are going hundreds of miles beyond the line that was formerly regarded as marking the limit of the safe wheat-growing country. Western Australia has a wheat area equal in size to the whole of Victoria. Much of it is second and thirdclass land, and it is impossible to make a success of agriculture on third-class country unless the production costs are low. We have no right to place men on the land unless, there is a reasonable prospect of their ultimate success. An enormous belt of wheat country, much of which will have to be cleared, is now being surveyed in my State. Roads and railways are needed, and the Eederal Government might consider whether it would be well for it to co-operate with the Western Australian Government in this matter, so that employment might more speedily be provided. I do not ask for concessions with regard to the interest on the capital cost of the work, but I suggest that the Commonwealth might assist in the matter of surveys and the provision of roads and",36,Spectre Oe Hunger Leers From Pantry Shelves

134,Mr Lacey (Grey) [ 5 . 2 5 ],"I cordiment has occurred in ""Western Australia for a long time. Australia states that it is more prevalent this year than for some years -past; yet, according to the honourable member for Swan, it is not acute, because ""Western Australia has a bounteous harvest. The newspaper article continuesThere were 2,000 men from Southern European countries on the books of the Timber Workers' Union, ancl a large number were employed on the goldfielda, and in the agricultural districts. A conservative estimate of Â£hc number employed in those industries would be between 4,000 and 5,000. They wore taking the places of British men and women. Western Australia could only absorb a certain number of new arrivals each year, and to the extent that people of foreign blood were allowed to enter, so was the admission of men and women from the old country in .danger of being restricted. The majority of Southern Europeans coining to Western Australia were single men. Under the migration agreement they undertook to introduce the stipulated number of British families which would add materially to the State's population. He thought the 2,000 foreigners in the Timber Workers' Union"" did not represent more than 2,500 people, but if they were British or Australian workers a very great number would be married and represent not less than 5,000. They would spend their money in Western Australia. The benefit to this State and Australia generally, by inopportunity to bestow praise upon the troducing people from Groat Britain was so obvious that the Commonwealth Government should take such action as would safeguard the position. My object in placing that on record is to show that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) was incorrect when he said that the unemployed position was not acute in ""Western Australia. It shows that,despite the bounteous harvest and the large area which was placed under crop this year, unemployment does exist in that State, the reason being the large influx of foreigners. ""Western Australia only a little while ago with an entirely different impression of the position. member's explanation, and hope that he also will accept the statement of the Premier of ""Western Australia. tinged with a little political colour. ber thinks so, he can reply to the Premier of Western Australia either personally or through the columns of the press. I feel sure that Mr Collier would not decry his State without reason. monthly statement outlining the progress of the State, and there has been no mention of the existence of unemployment. read gives Mr Collier's impressions. I wish now to reply to the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott), a big part of whose speech consisted of eulogistic references to foreign employees. I regard a foreigner in the light in whicn he is regarded by many other persons; he does not live up to thestandards that are observed by Australian workers. In view of the fact that such a large number of our own people are unemployed, too many foreigners are coming to Australia. They could well remain in their own land for the time being. My electorate contains some foreigners who migrated to Australia many years ago, and became very fine citizens; but I do hot on that account believe that indiscriminate foreign migration should be countenai>.ced. The honourable member for Herbert, and other honourable members who sit opposite, avail themselves ofevery foreigner. The honourable member for Herbert.said he had always found him to be a very fine workman,"" and inferred that he was better than tbe Australian. That, however, is not the reason for his eulogy. The reason is' to be found in interviews that were given a few months ago to a representative of the Melbourne Herald by a number of foreign Consuls. The honourable member for Herbert has no more time for the foreign than for the Australian workman, but he favours his migration to Australia because the foreigner is unacquainted with our language, and. as a member of a servile race is willing to work under condition 0 that Australians will not tolera.te. Tbe interviews given to the Melbourne Herald on the 30th September, 1927, read ai follows:Alien migrants in Victoria in many cases accept low wages in order to secure employment, according to statements made by several of the European Consulates to-day. The great bulk of the men, it was said, found employment in the 'country districts, but officii workers, mechanics,' and other city tradesmen found it difficult to secure work.",38,Maltese Migrants Influx Of Southern Europeans

142,Mr Lacey,"The article that I haveStatements summarized below were made by the consulates as to the position of tlie respective nationalities. Italians -Ninety-nin e per cent, of recent arrivals have gone to country districts, where they find employment at f u l l ruling wage rates. They refuse to take low wages, and they find ready employment. All hope to secure own farms, and many are now working on farms on share system, taking a percentage of the crop receipts instead of wages. The recent anti-migration decree of Signor Mussolini will almost completely check the (low of Italian migrants to Australia. Greeks -Al l recent arrivals nominated by friends in Australia. A few agriculturists go to the country, but the great bulk are city men, who find employment with other Greeks in the cities. A great number of the recent arrivals have accepted low wages in order to secure any employment offering. Cisecho-Slovakians -Not one unemployed in Victoria to-day. Tradesmen for the most part, many of them possessing high qualifications, they find ready employment in their several spheres. 'New arrivals frequently accept any work offering in the country districts u n t i l they become proficient in the English language. They then d r if t back into tlieir natural employment. Swiss -Farmers and mechanics find it most difficult to gain employment. Many are working in the country without wages, merely for tlieir keep, unable .to find profitable employment elsewhere. Many .others, particularly skilled tradesmen, are out of employment. Swiss Goveniment informed of position in Australia, but a few migrants still coming, hoping to secure work. Austrian* -Very few coming to Victoria; those who do have not been nominated, but in the majority of cases have-had'definite prospects of employment. Comprising mainly mechanics, cooks, nnd labourers, they find it difficult to secure work. Having to take any employment offering, they are forced to accept any wages named by the prospective employer in order to live. Danes -Of the few Banes who come to Victoria, the majority are farmers, with a few office workers.' Agriculturists placed readily in country employment, but city men have great difficulty in securing work, and then only at low \yagos. With those facts before us, what is the use of the honourable member for Herbert saying that these men become members of the Australian Workers Union and accept employment at Australian rates of wages and under conditions which our own workmen enjoy? They are willing to work for no wages if thereby they are able to obtain employment. It is not to be wondered at that unemployment exists in Australia. I know of companies which are giving preference in employment to foreigners. Only last Saturday fortnight I met in a portion of my electorate two young men who had walked 900 miles from Sydney in an effort to obtain employment. They had no soles to their boots and had not tasted food for 24 hours. They told me that it was their intention to walk further afield. They had approached the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited, but had not succeeded in securing employment. YetI was informed that on the very same day the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited had engaged 30 employees, most of whom were foreigners. One of these young men wore a returned soldier's badge, and the other also appeared capable of undertaking any kind of work. Companies who adopt such an attitude ought not to receive the protection of. this Parliament. They should give to Australian people the work which they have at their disposal. I shall seriously consider what action I shall take when any company which gives preference to those who come from overseas, while onr owu men are unemployed, approaches this House for assistance In the latter part of his motion the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) proposes tocensure the Government for having neglected to formulate proposals for .the relief of unemployment. It is the duty of this Parliament to deal with that problem. Honourable members opj)osite take shelter behind the plea that it is a State and not a Commonwealth matter. It would appear to be the policy of Ministers to interest themselves in matters out of which they are likely to gain an advantage in the country irrespective of whether or. not they are solely the concern of the States, and to refrain from interference when no political kudos is to be won. They were not asked to make road construction their concern. The South Australian Government evolved a scheme providing for the construction of roads in that State, and passed a law giving them power to impose a tax upon the users of petrol, but the Commonwealth Government had it declared ultra vires. Having embarked upon that policy this Government ought not now to shelter themselves behind the excuse that any particular matter in which their intervention may be sought is one purely for the States. Nothing ranks higher in importance than the fact that in Australia 100,000 persons are unemployed, and that children are not being sufficiently nourished because their breadwinners are tramping the country looking for work %iid failing to obtain it . During the recent recess I travelled between 1,200 and 1,500 miles in my electorate. A t no time -In my l if e have I seen so many young men -searching for employment. The reply of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) to the -charges of the Leader of the Opposition indicated a condition of placid indifference tfo the seriousness of the position. He even Went so f a r as to misrepresent the case, and surprised me by his attempt to show that the problem was not acute. I accept the statement that 100,000 persons are unemployed in Australia to-day, even though the Prime Minister claims that there are fewer than that number. The economic effect of the withdrawal from circulation each week of half a million pounds is felt by not only the workers but also every commercial interest. Those who are on short time are not numbered among the unemployed. The Prime Minister stated that there were 31,032 unemployed in Australia. Those1 figures are not correct. The right honourable gentleman refused to quote the figures for the last quarter of 1927, which are 3S,641. the Prime Minister had not the necessary information in his possession. had before him The Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics, from which the figures for the last quarter of 1927 are taken. the right honourable gentleman with w i l f u l l y misrepresenting the case, but the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) shows that he did so. The Prime Minister stated that the figures quoted by h i m were correct, and as supplied by the trade unions. I was a trade union official for some years, and was never asked to furnish a return of 'the unemployed members of my union. No doubt other unions are in a. similar position, and have not recorded their unemployment figures. Those 3S,641 unemployed are from a trade union membership of 445,9S5, Avhereas the total trade union membership of Australia is S51,47S. On tlint basis, the Prime Minister quoted only half the number that is unemployed. In addition to them there must be taken into consideration the nomadic section of workers who travel round the country seeking .employment, but do. not in for m their unions when they are unemployed. Then there is a further large section who do not belong to organizations. In the circumstances one may, with justification, conclude that there are at least 100,000 unemployed in Australia to-day. Statistics are hot always infallible. Those given officially for 1921 intimated that there were 40,549 unemployed in Australia. It so happened that the census was taken that year, and it disclosed that the number of unemployed, due to the scarcity of work, was 79,338, almost double the number given by the official statistics. The honbrook) is obsessed with the idea that the prevailing unemployment is entirely due to strikes and industrial disputes. The honourable member has so frequently broadcast that threadworn propaganda that he has almost convinced himself that it is true. Curiously, and significantly, the 1921 census indicates that only 3 per cent, of the then existing unemployment was due to industrial disputes, whereas 50 per cent, was due to scarcity of work ! The Prime Minister insinuated that the year has much to do with the present unemployment. He saidT h e Prime Minister Because of the poor harvest this year, the banks and other financial institutions in Australia have restricted advances, and towards the end of 1927 the number of unemployed I have no desire to charge was greater than the figures supplied for the 31st December last. The prevailing unemployment is not due to a poor harvest. Admittedly, 1927-28 was a lean year, and many people were hard-hit, but, by and large, the harvest was not so bad as to increase noticeably our unemployment. I shall quote figures for our wheat crops and wool clips for the last six years, and honourable members may draw their own conclusions from them. They areÂ° Wheat Harvest. Wool Clip. Bushels.

However, the difference is not startling. My table. shows that the argument of. the Prime Minister is unsound. It is rather amusing to notice that the Australian High Commissioner in London has apparently been instructed to use just the opposite argument. appeared in the Daily Guardian of the 25th February last:"" GLOOM "" REPORTS. NEWS . Thanking The Guardian for its suggestion tliat a statement should be issued from Australia House counteracting exaggerated reports of flood damage in Australia, Sir Granville Ryrie said steps had been taken unofficially which he hoped would have the desired effect. Several papers to-day published The Guardian's figures of the State's wool and wheat harvests, showing that the country's prosperity is not materially affected condition of Australia. We cannot agree by local dry spells and floods. There is a repudiation of the suggestion that adverse seasons are responsible for our unemployment. Because of our modern time and labour-saving harvesting implements the partial failure of a crop does not make so great a difference in the unemployment figures of the nation as it would in the early days. Any one understanding agriculture will agree with me on that. The Prime Minister also statedI draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that in the period covered by the last twelve years Australia's oversea exports have exceeded her oversea imports by Â£50,400,000. Why did the Prime Minister go back for a period of twelve years? If the right honourable gentleman desired to defend his own Government he sliould have confined himself to the last five years, during which period he aud his party have held the reins of government. The Prime Minister went back over a period of twelve years, so that he might make the comparison as favorable as possible to his Government. I shall segregate the last five years from the first seven years of that period, so that honourable members may see the significance of the right honourable gentleman's artifice. The figures for the two periods areImports. Exports. Â£ Â£ 1915-22 (inclusive) . . 684,202,000 . . 777,996,000 Excess of exports over imports, Â£93,734,000. Imports. Exports. Â£ Â£ 1923-27 (inclusive) . . 745,873,000 . . 692,844,000 Excess of imports over exports, Â£53,029,000. The following cablegram I wonder what would be the action of the Prime Ministeri f the manager of a private business concern in which he was interested submitted a report that for ten years there had been a profit of Â£10,000, when for the last year there had been a deficit of Â£5,000? No doubt the right honourable gentleman would decide that it was time to cliange his management and investigate the reason for the failure. So, I contend, the people of Australia will draw their own conclusions as to who is responsible for the existing deplorable economic to go back twelve years in order to obtain favorable figures so that the people may be misled. The Government should deal with the position as it exists, and tell the country the true position in regard to our trade balance. Nor is it only those things which happened more than five years ago which have brought about existing conditions. The events of the last five years are sufficient to have produced the effect of which we complain. During that period we have drifted gradually, as our trade figures show. In his opening remarks the Prime Minister dealt what he intended to be a backhander to the Leader of the Opposition, when he said, in effect, that the Labour party was opposed to immigration. He said that that was one of the reasons why the censure motion was moved. That is not true. The Labour party is not opposed to immigration. Our platform on this point is perfectly clear, and has been placed on record upon numerous occasions. Personally, I join with those who say that we have not sufficient people in Australia, but we should bring immigrants to this country only in such numbers as will keep pace with the progress we are making. Tbat is generally accepted as a sound policy. The Prime Minister",41,Maltese Migrants Influx Of Southern Europeans

The Labour Government did not prevent immigration; as a matter of fact it encouraged migrants. Those were the peak years of immigration, but we had less unemployment then than at any time since. It is well for the people to analyze the position and to realize why the Labour could bring such large numbers of migrants into Australia without causing unemployment. were 39,000 arrivals in Australia, and in that year, according to the Commonwealth Year-Book, the percentage of unemployment was 4.7. In 1912 there were 46,000 arrivals, and the unemployment percentage was 5.5. In 1913 there were 37,000 arrivals, and the unemployment percentage was 5.3.' These figures are an effective reply to those who say that labour is opposed to immigration, and they prove, furthermore, that, notwithstanding the influx of migrants at that time, there was such a high degree of prosperity in Australia, due to labour rule, that there was practically no unemployment. During that time, lands were thrown open and made available to the people, and, in addition, all public worksundertaken were carried out from revenue, and not from loan money. 1910 to 1913, Â£30,000,000 worth of land was subdivided in Australia, and that undoubtedly, was one of the reasons for the prosperity of which I have spoken. All honourable members will agreethat prosperity follows in the wake of land development of that kind. Speaking this afternoon, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), with .whom I do not agree on most matters, referred to the 1 benefits which usually follow the subdivision of land, such benefits as the growth of small towns, increase of population, and greater sale for goods and machinery. Duringthis same period there was also abnormal development in the Postmaster-General's As a matter of fact, its operations constituted a record up to that time, and all the work was done-out of revenue. ""What Mr Lacey. is the position regarding the department during the last few years ? Practically all the work has been done from loan money, During those years Labour and not from revenue. Since the Estimates came before the House, we have seen that the vote for the Postmaster-General's Department has been reduced by Â£360,000, and many people who were relying on the promises made to them for telegraphic and postal facilities will not get them because of this curtailment. faked surplus. that. If more money is not spent by this department we shall have much more unIn 1911 there employment than now. I submit that the time has arrived for the Prime Minister to call a conference of State Premiers to go into this momentous question of unemployment. This matter is already engaging the attention of municipalities, district councils, and other bodies, some of which have only recently come into existence for the purpose of dealing with the problem. The position will become worse in the near future, because many of the seasonal occupations which have hitherto provided employment for large numbers of men are closing down for the year. The wheat crop is still being transferred from railway sidings to the 'wharfs, and thence to the ships, giving employment to many men. The fruit picking season is not yet quite finished, but in the winter months ahead, From when this, and other activities will have ceased -for the year, there will be twice as many unemployed as at the present time. ""While the Prime Minister may sit back and convey tbe impression that this is of no consequence, I believe that the people of Australia will insist that something be done All work that the Federal Government can possibly put in hand should be -undertaken at once. Let me remind the |Government that at the beginning of'-'this season'il'made a present to a few people of Â£445,000 a year through the reduction of the Federal land tax.

149,Party Mr Lacey,"Perhaps it is due to do much to relieve the unemploymentsituation in some of the States. I wish the Commonwealth Government would make such asum available for unemployment relief work in South Australia. Then again, the recent cut in the income tax has relieved taxpayers to the extent of Â£1,300,000 -a year. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot say that it is financially embarrassed while it is giving away -huge sums yearly by way of tax remission. Not only is the Government not going on with public works which have been approved, but it is actually closing down some of the works already started. Take, for instance, the Kyogle-Brisbane railway line. This, and other works have, I understand, been closed down from the end of last year. In my own electorate the men engaged in ballasting the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie line were dismissed while on their Christmas vacation, and they were dismissed in a manner that reflects no credit upon the Government. Those men were working under an award or. agreement which entitled them to be paid for their holidays at Christmas time if -they were on the job on the 15th December and on the 9th January. I am not quite certain of the dates, but I think that those are correct. That. provision was inserted so that the benefit of holiday pay would apply to permanent men. Last September I waited on the .Commissioner of Commonwealth' Railways because there Avas a rumour circulating to the effect that this work might close down. commenced, . include the Garden Island The Commissioner.told me'that the work was not going to close down as they had sufficient money to carry them on tp next June. The men were notified that that was the case. At the end of the year they left their goods and chattels on the job, and went to their homes for the Christmas holidays. Later they were notified by a press ' report that they , were "" sacked,"" and could not go back to the job. Not only that, but when they applied for holiday pay they were refused the money, and the Government still declines to pay it to them. The Government threw these men out of work, and is not prepared even to pay them what.they are entitled to. I do not agree with the closing down of this work. It should have been carried on, and the men, some of whom went for their holidays to Western Australia and Victoria,' should have been allowed to return to the job. "" Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. Government in ceasing work in connection with the ballasting of the' trans-Australian railway just before Christmas not only added to the number of unemployed; it was also a breach of faith, because the men had been told that the work would continue until June, 192S. The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) himself told me that that would be the case. The Prime Minister said that the responsibility for providing employment did not rest with the Commonwealth, but was a matter for the States. I desire to remind him that there aro many works of a purely federal character which should be proceeded with. In addition to necessary work in the Postmaster-General's Department, a number of other proposals, favourably reported on by the Public Works Committee, could be put in hand. The committee reported on the 24th April, 1926, in favour of the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill. Although that inquiry was undertaken by the committee as an urgent matter, nothing, has yet been done. The committee reported on . the . 15th June, 1926, in favour of.the erection of permanent administrative offices at Canberra, but so far the only contract let has been for the foundations. . Other works reported on by the committee but .not yet wharf, reported upon 29th, June, .1926; Commonwealth offices, Sydney, 10th March, 1927; National Museum of Australian Zoology, Canberra, ,17th March, 1927; Commonwealth offices, Brisbane, 23rd May, 1927; Automatic telephone exchange, Oakleigh, Victoria, ,5th October, 19.27; and Automatic telephone exchange, Cottesloe, ..Western Australia,... .12th October, 1927. All those works, ..which would be reproductive, have been reported on favourably by the Public. Works Committee after exhaustive inquiries If the Government desires to relieve unemployment, work in connection.with them should be put in hand without delay.

150,Mr Lacey,"The cruel action of therailway between Port Augusta and Red Hill, and realize that I shall not be permitted to refer to -that matter again at length; but I desire to quote from the evidence of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, Mr Bell, before the Public ""Works Committee, as to the advantages which would accrue from the construction of that railway. Mr Bell saidClause2 -'T t would permit Of passengers and loading being conveyed direct from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie, 1,240 miles, obviating the delay and expense at present incurred in transhipment at Terowie and Port Augusta. Clause 11 -It would increase the revenue on the Trims-Australian Railway by approximately Â£35,0.00, due to the stimulation of the througli traffic, whidh ""would obtain for the reasons mentioned in clause 2. Seeing that there are at the present time 100,000 men unemployed in Australia, many of that number being in South Australia, surely the Government could proceed with the construction of this necessary work, and thus relieve a situation which is indeed acute in that ""State. I agree with the honourable member for Sput'h Sydney( Mr E. Riley) that the position throughout Australia in regard to unemployment is so serious as to justify a conference of State Premiers to discuss it. South Australia has signified his willingness to attend such a conference, if desired, and to do all ""in his power to assist at arriving at a solution of the difficulty. It 'Would be ""a gbdcl thing if a conference of the Premiers and 'the Leaders of the Opposition in the Several State's ""were to meet and discuss this important matter. At an earlier 'stage, *fihe honourable member for 'Franklin( Mr Sea'brodk"") asked what the States were doing in the ""matter of unemployment. I am not intimately acquainted with what the governments of the other States are doing, but I can speak with some authority regarding the attitude adopted by the Government of South Australia. During the ten months that -it has been in office, the Butler Government in South Australia has dismissed 7,000 men from the Government service. The position in that State is worse than it has been for 30 years. In the Adelaide Advertiser of the 4th February last the following statement appeared:The Superintendent ( Mr A. C. H. Richardson) MrJ j a c f y . that during January 2,020 labourers, 100 youth labourers, and 799 tradesmen registered at the Central Office of -the exchange and branch agencies. 'Of that number 449 labourers, 15 youths, and '63 tradesmen were provided with employment, leaving a -balance of 3,082 on the books. This number was 941 more than for December, and 2,289 more than for the same period last year, when the number was 793. Again, on the Sth of February, the Advertiser contained the following:THE WORST FOR 30 YEARS. -Nearly 4,000 Men on 4lic Books. The Superintendent of the Labour 'Bureau( Mr A. C -Richardson) stated on Tuesday that there was more unemployment in South Australia than 'there had been at any previous time since the bureau 'was established in 1898. . There were upwards of 4,000 men on the books, and at the branch offices throughout the country, and 'the number was increasing each month. The iTanuary returns showed an increase of '941 over those -of December, and the list was growing daily. Mr Richardson said 'that 90 per cent, were genuine cases, and the list was growing daily, and'all trades were represented. The building trade appeared to -be 'particularly slack. He had never before 'known more men connected with that trade 'unemployed, and there appeared to be little prospect of the men securing work. The Leader of the Opposition in Mr Richardson, who speaks with a knowledge of the unemployed problem in'South Australia since 1898, says that 'the position 'to-d'ay is ""worse 'than it has 'been 'for 30 'year's. -Like other honourable members representing South -Australian -constituencies, I have received a 'letter from -the secretary of the South Australiau branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, Mr Dalziel. The letter, which is dated 20th February, 1928, readsI t having come to notice that it is tlie intention of the Federal Government to authorize still further retrenchment among Â£he employees of the 'Federal Public Service, it is desired on behalf of ex-service men concerned to seek your assistance with n view to preventing, wherever possible, a (""till further increase -in the already deplorably great number of unemployed in the various 'States. It is realized that the Government are confronted with a great difficulty at the present time in finding employment for those already -out of work, and at the same time it is thought something may he done through the various departments to prevent further retrenchment, which, if carried into effect, will of the Labour Exchange increase these difficulties, 'and the distress stated yesterday already suffered.

Giving evidence before the Federal Constitution Commission to-day, Mr E. W. Holden said that the question of removing the works of Holden's Motor Body Builders to Victoria had at least .been considered. Such removal would cost Â£100,000, but the saving on two items, wharfage and taxation would be Â£50,000 a year. Therefore the cost of removal would be recouped in two years. He gave instances of' disabilities under which South Australian industries suffered through higher taxation and wharfage rates. Whilst the removal of that industry, may benefit another State, it w ill be to South Australia a very bad knock. .The statement by Mr Holden indicates the extraordinarily heavy burden that the Butler Government.. has imposed. upon industry.. W h i l o . it is resorting to these extremes in. order,to raise money, and is practising economy, and keeping the workers on the bread line, it has appointed. Senator Barwell to the position of. Agent General in London upon terms much more generous than were, enjoyed by his prede,-. cessor. The appointment arose out of the desire of the Commonwealth Government that Senator, Barwell should not stand for re-election at the end of this Parliament, and after certain overtures Mr Butler canie to the 'rescue by providing for Senator Barwelli n London. Notwithstanding the financial straits of the State he has been appointed for' five years instead of the usual three years, the allowance pertaining to his office is to be increased by 'Â£800 a year, and, in addition, he is to be provided with a secretary. It is rumoured that the Publicity Agent of the Liberal Federation in South Australia is going to London to act in a secretarial capacity. The South Australian of Public Works has stated that no build up for themselves ,a, reputation for Government hand' unless it will pay interest capital cost.

If the policy that the 'Labour party is advocating be adopted, development can proceed, and employment w ill be found for many hundreds of workers.

157,Mr Fenton,"^The honourable membergovernment channels, I most .strongly believe that money can rbe more economically and more profitably employed when it is spent by those whose personal concern it is to see that it is employed in a lucrative manner. If the amount of unemployment ie due to the wages fund of the community, at any particular time that fund will be a more or less definite amount. It may vary from time to time according to the prosperity of the country; but at any one moment it will be a more or less definite amount, and if the wages payable .out of it are doubled the number of : .people .who can be employed put of it is .halved. I state the .case in that way to .make clear the general preppsitipn that every increase of wages out of a fixed fund must diminish the amount of unemployment .that can be given .by the fund, and that the idea;that we can continue to increase the amount of the wage indefinitely without diminishing employment is a fundamental fallacy which is at .the ,rpot pf qur arbitration.system. As I ;haye set out more fully in .other speeches .in .this House, .by .the action ,pf .the .Arbitration Court in .constantly .increasing wages a definite increase .of unemployment was bound to be brought about iin .Australia. We have .such .state^ ments as the extraordinary one that an -.industry which cannot ,pay .the w.ages laid down by an arbitration court should cease to .exist. The economic fallacy of that situation is .abundantly .clear. The p.n.ly alternative, .apparently, which honourable members ,ef the Opposition can offer in .that .case is that .an industry which cannot pay the wages laid down by .an arbitration court should .receive a subsidy from the Government to .enable it to do so--as if that would make -it any more a payable propositipn. Let me take another point of view. If with a fixed wage fund we have a definite wage, and we double the cost of goods, it naturally fplipws that we halve the wage, OJ-, in ether werds, lower the .standard of living. If -we halve the wages of a man we reduce by hajf his purchasing power and his standard of living. suffer. hut the honprable member does not seem to analytical way with the .relation .of remember it when he .votes for measures Secondary and .primary industries to the w.hich increase the cost of goods. To -interpose sympathetic utterances is all very well; but I have pleaded in vain with honprable members net to do that which the honourable member for East Sydney now admits is imposing a hardship on the wives and children of the -.porkers. .An increase in the cost of goods, with,a consequent reduction of wages and lowering of the standard of livingis the first and principal result of the .protective policy .of Australia. Two forces are operating .at the same time-that which tends to increase wages and thus diminishes .employment, and that which tends to increase the price of goods and so diminishes the value .ef wages. They have been at werk in Australia for a long .time. While the .principle involved was carried out in a partial degree only, people did .not mind.

161,Mr Mam F . ^,"I understand that thenot diagnosing the disease. He asserted that one of the principal causes of unemployment was slackness of trade. But that does not get us anywhere, and counts for nothing. What is the meaning of the term "" slackness of trade,"" and how is it that such a condition is brought about ? The honourable member made certain observations on this aspect of the subject, but shirked the real issue. Slackness of trade occurs when manufacturers cannot sell their products. Why cannot our manufacturers sell their' products? The reason is that the prices are so high that the people have not the money to pay them. These are simple facts which cannot be denied. Our high tariff and the awards of the Arbitration Court jointly make the cost of production in Australia altogether too high. have hit every man in the community very hard in his pocket. Because of them shopkeepers in our"" cities are unable to make a sufficiently large turnover to pay their way. It is for this reason that numerous small businesses . are closing down every day in our cities, and that "" to let"" notices are appearing in so many shop windows. Less trade is being done. It is for this reason also that meetcost of housing is also taken into conings of creditors are increasing to an alarming extent in most of the business centres in Australia. Business cannot be done because our cost of production is too high to make it profitable. . And we shall not solve our problem by simply providing the worker with higher wages. That will only accentuate our difficulties. Apart from the effect of the high cost of production upon individuals, let us think for a moment of its effect upon our public utilities. enormous increase in the cost of government. We have heard a good deal tonight about railway construction. One of the reasons why railway construction cannot be carried on as. it should be in Australia is that the price, of material' is absolutely prohibitive Steel rails may be purchased' in Europe to-day for Â£4 17s. 6d. per ton, while in Australia the price is Â£12 15s. per ton. Structural and commercial steel cost Â£4 10s. per ton in Europe, and Â£14 17s. 6d. per ton in Australia. How can it be expected that under such conditions we can build railways and undertake other large-engineering works which are Mr Mann. necessary to our development, and which would provide employment for thousands of men? The plain fact is that because of the artificial methods that we have adopted prices have increased to such an extent that government and other public bodies cannot do the work that they would like to do. They have found that in the last analysis the money must come out of the pockets of the producers, and it is not possible to take out of their pockets more than they hold. How is the ordinary man in the street affected by our high cost of production and living? The official figures issued by our statistical department for last month show that the index figure for the cost of living to-day is' 1787 compared with 1100 in 1911, which year, as honorThey able members know, is always taken as the standard of comparison. We have gone 687 points to the bad since 1911. In other words, the cost of living, according to the Statistician's figures, is 75 per cent, higher to-day than it was then. Unfortunately, as I have constantly pointed out, this does not tell the whole' story The index figures refer generally only to food and groceries; though in -some cases the sideration; the point that we have to remember is that they never take into account the increased costof clothing. It may be that there are great difficulties in obtaining reliable figures on this aspect of the matter, but I venture to say that the cost of do thing has increased'more since 1911 than any other item of household expenditure. If this is also taken into account the cost of living figures will be considerably raised.

As a fact, the very things which the Prime Minister said would follow upon the extreme application of high protection are happening in Australia to-day as a result of the high protection which this Government has introduced. Our position is due, not to the need for further prohibitory action, but because we have already gone too far. Throughout the country there is a demand not for higher duties, but for a reduction in the excessive customs tariff under which we are labouring.

172,Mr Mann,"Progress is not a science,disconcerting fact, and I think the honourable member who interjected is strongly suspected of holding these views. At any rate it is extraordinary that there is no such thing as a scientific tariff. There is no foundation in scientific teachings for the theories embodied in the principle of protection. ' All writers of economics unite in condemning it as a policy, and it is extraordinary that despite this there have been busily engaged for a long time are masses of people who believe in protection. They do so solely because selfishcontained, but we shall never be able to ness is their guiding principle. Instead of the members of the Opposition having a leg on which to stand in censuring the Government for the heavy importations, we find on every hand that we already have too much protection. The conditions ancl standards are unreasonable, and we cannot afford to support a policy which embraces them. Such conditions and standards have to be paid for. An industry which cannot pay is not profitable to any country. An industry should operate under proper commercial and competitive conditions, and should not be artificially maintained by means of subsidies, duties 'and the like. The expression which we have often heard that ""goods are being commercially manufactured in Australia,"" is a gross misuse of words, hecause many of such goods are .not being so manufactured. They cannot be, in the proper acceptation of the term, -unless ""under competitive 'conditions. When .goods are manufactured 'with the assistance -of subsidies taken .from the pockets of the people, who have to pay for the benefit -of a certain section of the community, they are not being manufactured on a commercial basis at all. They are an incubus, a curse, not a blessing, to a country. We speak of establishing industries, when they have to have splints to enable them to stand upright. Establishing industries! What do we mean by that? An irdustry is established if rendered stable. It .sets out all the facts and conditions I l is not stable if it would fall down if which the conference had before it, and not propped up by a duty. It is useless to manufacture goods if we cannot sell therh. We cannot sell them to-day owing to the high prices which are due to the high cost of production. The high prices naturally drive buyers to purchase cheaper importations from other countries. They do that instead of buying our own goods. We can preach until we are black in the face about buying Australian-made goods, but every one will buy only what his purse permits him to buy, and he is right in so doing. We also speak 'of countries being self-contained, and, when the occasion demands, honourable members opposite reiterate the catch phrase that it is our duty to make Australia self-contained. We in the endeavour to make Australia selfkeep it so, because we are placing such an undue strain upon its natural wealth that we have to resort to overseas borrowing. When we cease borrowing the true position confronts us, and we are loth to face it. We have brought about a condition of affairs which cannot lass. The results which we see about us are due to economic pressure. The difficulties and distress which is prevalent in this country are the nesult of our own folly for which honourable members opposite must take a large share of responsibility. Experience teaches us that we have made mistakes, and if Ave are wise we shall retrace our steps But we have something .beyond our own experience to .guide us.

180,Labour Party ( Mr Charlton),"Customs, whose zeal for protection is an unquenchable flame. Only last night he delivered an oration which, will live inhistory long after Cicero, Demosthenes' and Percy Brunton have become mere fading memories. Minister for Trade and Customs unfortunately slipped on galvanized iron that he did not slip on the item of barbed wire. iron makes an impression. His illustration of the goods that were inevitably brought into this country because they could not be manufactured here was unfortunate, in that he quoted galvanized iron as a striking example. But though the Minister is enthusiastic, it has to be borne in mind that even the fires of fanaticism itself must pale in the cooling chamber of political necessity. Has not the pact been ratified? Not in the electorates, so far as I know, but certainly in the governmental caucus, where -self-preservation is undoubtedly the first law of nature. The pact requires a number of things. It requires, first of all, that the Government shall give hostages to fortune. It requires, unfortunately, tliat tbe people as a whole, whatever they may-do in regard to the national debt, shall pay the full price of the pact. A little while ago, when we were in-recess, the Minister for Works' and Eailways( Mr Hill) happened to be in Canberra, and, 1 think, almost alone. Under the inspiration which pleasant solitude sometimes brings to us, he gave an interview to a pressman, who called to ask him what he thought of Mr Bruce now that he had completed his five years of distinguished service to Australia. The Minister, forgetting for the moment, perhaps, that his reply would be published,turned to the pressman and said, ""What a statesman it is! What urbanity! What capacity! What dignity! What suavity!"" I am not certain that he used those actual words, but he finished-and it is a pity that such a glowing eulogy should have finished so lamely and ambiguously"" He i<* one of us."" Whether, from his point of view, the Prime Minister is ""one of us,"" or "" we are one of him or both, or perhaps a little of each,"" the real phenomenon is how, notwithstanding the dangerous conjunction implied by these words, the Country party still retains its separate entity. I hope that it will not be inappropriate^-and I am sure it will not be out of order-for me to suggest that It is true that the the Ministry includes, in fact, a Minister for High Duties and a Minister for Low Duties. I think it would be greatly It was a good job for him improved if the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) were addfd as a Minister for duties applicable only to apples, maize, timber, and other commodities that are produced in the electorate which that honourable member represents ! If that were done, these representatives of various fiscal beliefs could, in due course, meet in the Cabinet room and report to the Prime Minister, who, by the way, is also Minister for Royal Commissions and Minister for Public Urbanity, how they were getting on, with their divergent fiscal views, in their several electorates 1 There are to-day from 100,000 to 120,000 people out of employment in this country, and it must be very cheering to them to know that the Government has introduced a new phase of constitutional -government. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott), endeavouring to explain the reason for these violently conflicting opinions among government supporters, said that there was. ""nothing in them!"" "" It is true,'' he said in effect, ; "" that there are varying opinions held-on this side of the House."" ""There is, for instance,"" he said, ""the honourable member for Forrest, but he is out of date."" "" There are other members "", he explains, "" who are before their time, but after all, I,-the honourable member for Herbert, am here to play upon the middle register, and preserve the balance between them."" The honourable member also accused somebody of having drawn a red herring across the path in the shape of a cruiser! Worse than that, he' associated the honourable member for"" Dalley with the tremendous feat of swallowing the millennium! The honourable gentleman, since he became the accidental member for Herbert, appears to deem it his special vocation to constantly heckle and lecture the honourable member for Dalley. May I suggest to him mildly, because I would not think of pursuing the subject, that if he would address himself to Herbert, so as to",54,Elliot Johnson The Y Are A Nificently Beneficial Grievou S Harm Has

182,"Mr Beennan""","Even galvanizedsecure by design what hitherto he has enjoyed by accident,he would be better employed ? I do not think I need say anything further to the Government on the fiscal issue. I turn to migration, and it is here that an ounce of experience is shown to be worth a ton of theory. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) well expressed the situation when he said that, a motion of censure having been moved against the Government in respect of the immense volume of unemployment, and its failure to deal with the problem, the Prime Minister emerged from his rural and exceedingly comfortable surroundings in retirement at Canberra, rushed into the House, and, just as a knight of old in an emergency would have said, ""Varlet, bring me my sword,"" exclaimed, "" Bring me my bluebook!"" Ou the floor of the House he endeavoured to show by fractions and decimals that there is no serious amount of unemployment in Australia. Let me make a suggestion to him. There are some narrow streets in Fitzroy, which is within my electorate. The accommodation in some of the houses there is not great; but I will arrange, if necessary, to have a room put at his disposal. ' On the front door of the house a modest notice might be erected bearing the legend, after the fashion of prime donne and others, ""Bruce'is here."" If he did that, I assure him that he would have such substantial proof of the large volume of unemployment, even in that particular district, that he would not only hasten back to his sylvan surroundings at Canberra, but for the rest of his life would be loth to leave them. It would be unkind of me to say anything further about the Prime Minister's unwise choice of figures. It was mentioned to-day more than once, in the course of the debate, that some, friends of the right honourable gentleman said his attention had not been called to figures which conflicted so palpably with those he had presented to the House, and which to such a material extent substantiated the case submitted by the Opposition. Well, I was here when the right honourable gentleman was speaking. The honourable member' for Dalley was just in front of me, and he, with a manner and modesty that I could not have' displayed in the circumstances, more'' than once called the right honourable gentleman's attention to the figures. To me it was most extraordinary 'that the Prime Minister, in spite of this kindly assistance from the Opposition, lost the opportunity to inform himself upon a vital part of the case ""he was presenting. Migration is a subject which more than any other tends to illustrate the incapacity of this Govermnent. The Government's chief defence is a misrepresentation of Labour's policy. The Prime Minister contents himself -with the statement that Labour does not want any kind of migration, and does not mean what it says. I do not know why he suggests that Ave do not mean Avhat we say. If Ave do not mean it, I fail to see why Ave should say it. I give the Government f u l l credit for -meaning Avhat it says, and for what it does in this matter: That is to say, it permits and encourages an inrush of migrants, with little consideration of how they are to be employed or disposed in this country. As a. matter of fact, Labour not only means Avhat it says, but, during its last three years of office, gave some proof as an earnest of its meaning in the matter, with the result that those years of Labour rule Avere conspicuous for the fact that immigration Avas comparatively high and unemployment IOAV to the point of being negligible'. There are certain basic theories underlying the subject of immigration. The fatuous theory of the Government is that population necessarily spells wealth. The answer to that is so obvious that it hardly needs to be stated; but, obvious as it is, apparently it has not been assimilated by the Government and its supporters. If population necessarily spelt wealth, countries Avith the densest populations would naturally he the richest; but, as Ave know, that is not so. Population usefully employed and Avith hope in its heart is an asset; population that is unemployed, discontented, disappointed, deceived, is a liability, and a very heavy liability, too. The basic theory of the Labour party is that the natural advantages of a' well-governed and prolific country attract a constantly increasing AOAV of desirable migrants. But this Government moves in a vicious circle, in the familiar style of a dog chasing its own tail, and is not justified any more by the fact that it has a long and wobbly tail. More unemployment, more migration ! More migration, more unemployment! And so it goes on with its endless chain. You, Mr Speaker, have no doubt heard the expression, though it has little application to your own virtuous life, of taking a hair of the dog that bites one. That is the practice of this Government. They apply bane and antidote, in succession, as they think, quite sure whether he had any facts at with the result tliat, to use an expression that is not entirely parliamentary, they are, from the migration point of view, on a perpetual ""bender."" It seems necessary to remind the Government of the fact, so constantly ignored, that the artificial stimulus of migration connotes and requires an artificial preparedness all along the line. It ought to be evident that if migrants are to' be recruited and despatched from England, or elsewhere, as a phase of State socialism, then, also, as a phase of But the trade of the nation is directed State socialism they must be accommodated in this country in such a way that they can become wealth producers, and not merely wealth users. I appreciate the fact that these are homely axioms, almost platitudes ; but, if they cannot be understood, it would seem that there is no other way of having them comprehended by the Government than by their frequent repetition. If the lands of this country were liberated, if the products of the primary industries were being adapted to the requirements of the people by the labour of the people, then, of course, a real impetus could be given to the development of those products in respect of which we are able to . compete in the world's markets on equal terms. But what are the facts ? A scalding indictment was made against this Government in this House in thelatter quarter of last year. .Et was pointed out that we have incurred tremendous commitments by way of loans for enterprises that are not only nonproductive, but also, in some cases, inherently vicious, and necessarily carried on at a loss. "" Point was given to the drift of the national finances resulting in the monstrous anomaly of a high tariff with a flood-tide of imports, Mr Brennan. a high cost of living and increasing unemployment, tremendous taxation at the customs house on the wage earner, and. at the same time the remission of taxation by this Government-the removal of the burden from the shoulders of those, best able to bear it, and its imposition, on those least favourably circumstanced.. , The Prime Minister, not being able torn ake up his mind whether to admitor deny the existence of any considerable body of unemployment, and not beingall on the subject, weakly recommended us to the States for a solution. I . admit that we are greatly hampered in. our national efforts by the absurd juggling with responsibility that proceedsfrom the system of government under which we live. I admit that the provision of mere temporary amelioration of unemployment is the duty of the States, rather than of the Commonwealth, because a far greater variety of enterprisesis necessarily carried on by State governments than by the Federal government.. by the Commonwealth and not by the States-, and to an increasing extent the finances of Australia are controlled by the Commonwealth authorities. The safety of this nation lies largely in unhampered and vigorous production. Although the trend of legislation cannot be held responsible for all unemployment, it certainly is responsible for what is unquestionably a cancerous growth upon the body politic, small though the percentage of the unemployed may be to the whole population. It is because of the use of the national funds in the manner I have indicated, through failure tocooperate with the States in making land and money available to the people of Australia, and through apparent lack of. interest in. or their want of a sense of responsibility towards these problems, that we condemn the Government as inept and unworthy of public confidence. On the 28th May, 1926, the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) moved the second reading of a bill, whicli subsequently became an act, providing for the creatio -i of a Development and Migration Commission. 1 remind this House that honourable members of the Opposition then advanced what I believe were telling arguments in support, of the view that the Government were putting the car!, before the horse-whic h the Country party, at least, ought to have avoided-in making tbe stream of immigration r u n side by side w i th the appointment of a commission to inquire into developmental proposals. position has been absolutely justified. Although the measure became law nearly two years ago, the commission has barely touched the fringe of those subjects which it was appointed to inquire into. I have no desire to reflect in any way upon that body. case, a different result was not possible. In the report which it presented to Parliament for the period which ended on the 30th June, 1927, it dealt, amongst other things, with the subject of 1 employment and unemployment. shall quote from that report* to show the f a t u it y of hoping that the commission would, within a short time of its appointment, discover any practical relief for unemployment, or be in a position to f u r n is h any really useful annum; they have immensely increased tabulated information covering the i m mense field of inquiry which it was required to traverse. ported^ in regard to unemploymentThe commission has been in consultation with Senator J. D. Millen, the chairman of the Royal Commission on National Insurance, and with the Commonwealth Statistician (both prior and subsequent to his recent visit to Europe) and is now formulating proposals for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government to deal with the problem in the following respects:(a) Collaboration with the Commonwealth Statistician, and through him with the statisticians of the States, with a view to the continual to say upon that point is that I and, supply of data regarding the incidence of unemployment in tlie various trades and industries. (6) Consultation with the States regarding the operation of Labour bureaux and exchanges, with a view to effecting a uniform system and standard throughout Australia, (o) Inquiry into specific trades and industries, with the object of recommending steps which may be taken by the Commonwealth and States, and the industries concerned, to eliminate as far as possible seasonal fluctuations, and ensure regumember for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) larity of employment throughout 'the year. {d) Consideration of the directions in which Government departments and public bodies can assist by tlie judicious operation of their constructional programmes, both by planning works ahead over a term of years and deferring non-urgent works until periods of depression. It is anticipated that a report will be available for the Government's consideration at an early date. I now point out that the OpThat is a most inspiring and helpfu l document for those who are wondering how they are going to get bread and butter next week! It does not reflect upon the commission, but merely emphasizes the correctness of our attitude when we said, "" Y o u have no business to carry on Because of the necessities of the migration under this agreement with GreatB r it a in at the rate of so many thousands of pounds a month u n t i l you have made the inquiries and done the work proposed to the commission."" The policy of the Government in I regard to migration really accentuates in a variety of ways the hardships of the people as a whole. In the first place, they have built up a vast Government department, which has increased expenditure at the rate of over Â£50,000 per our interest bill by borrowing money for the purposes of migration under the name This is what it re"" ""Works ""-a totally irregular use of borrowed money. The adoption of this policy has led to the displacement of labour, and the creation of a feeling of discontent, involved in which is a suspicion, that becomes more strongly founded each day, that the. Government are pursuing this policy for the purpose of depressing the labour market, and making available a cheap for m of labour. The Government are pleased to doubt our good f a it h . All I have I think, the party to which I belong would welcome approved representatives of all white races proportionately to the opportunities offering. We naturally prefer our own kindred, who in a certain sense are members of our own family, and speak our own language. I do not refer to them as members of our race, because that term is very much misunderstood, and has no connection whatever with nationality. When the right honourable speaks of the desirability of a homogeneous race he surely misunderstands the position, and forgets that the British people are not a homogeneous race, but a combination of races, wbile their civilization is of Mediterranean origin. The futur e of this country must depend largely upon our native born, but I am convinced that the strain w ill be i m proved, both intellectually and physically, and, indirectly, morally, by drawing in moderation, when migration is justifiable, upon the best representatives of all the white races of the'world. Like my leader, I have no prejudice against Southern Europeans, as such, and none against Italians. "" Man does not live by bread alone."" The world owes much of its spirituality to the art and literature of It a l y , a land of which might be said what was said of a sister countryChosen home of chivalry, the garden of romance. I have beengreatly struck w i th the truth contained in a very interesting article which was contributed to the Melbourne Argus last Saturday 'upon the subject of Italy's present misgovernment, by a well-known contributor, whose pen name is Elzevir, and whose contributions I regularly read w it h keen interest. He has summed up the position admirably in the following statement. I have an immense liking and admiration for the Italian people, and an utter loathing and abomination for the present Italian Government and all its works and ways. I accept that judgment, and hope and pray that the present odious misgovernment of It a l y is but a temporary phase of a great nation's development. Mr LA.ZZA.RINI -Misgovernmen t Australia as well as in It a l y . Australia, as my f r i e n d pertinently in terjects. There is another view to be taken of this question. I invite honourable members to say whether, in connection w it h this migration scheme, they consider that we are doing f u l l justice to our brothers in the British Isle's; whether this system which is receiving such enthusiastic support in certain quarters in GreatB r it a in does not really involve expatriation and the shirking by the British Government of responsibility in regard to its own people. Are we making ourselves a party to the determination of that government to shirk the obligation which it owes to its,own people?. In a speech that he delivered in .the House of Commons on the'23rd March, 1927, Mr. Mackinder, M.P., a recent visitor to this country, saidWe had the advantage of hearing Mr Angwin, recently Minister for Lands and Immigration in Western Australia, and he stated that even in the States most favorable to immigration it would cost at least Â£1,800 per family. I am afraid if we are going to dump down our surplus of one and a quarter millions of unemployed at a cost of Â£1,800 per family, it is going to cost more money than either Western Australia or the whole of Australia can afford. I do not admit that there is a surplus population of one and a quarter million people in GreatB r it a in ; I do not admit that there is a surplus population in any country. I quote from the same debate the following remarks of Colonel Gault, M . P I would remind him He was referring to a Mr Riley, M . P . Persons of that name are frequently encountered in the ranks of statesmenI would remind him that we have a population of 43,000,000, but our acreage is only 38,000,000, and that the available acreage of arable and pasture land only amounts to some 30,000,000. That is interesting in the first place because of the words "" the available average of arable and pasture land."" But Mr Riley makes a pointed interjectionMayI remind the honourable and gallant member on that point that we had 4,000,000 acres more under cultivation 50 years ago than we have now. in The Empire Settlement Act was reprinted in connection w it h this report of In both It a l y and the Migration Commission and I shall re fer to the debate on it . I have taken the trouble to extract some very useful expressions of opinion by Colonel Wedgwood, M.P., who, on the 26th A p r i l , 1922, is reported as having said in the House of CommonsOnly three yearsago, we were going to make this la.nd fit for heroes to live in. Now it is not this country, but Western Australia and the Valley of the Darling that is going to lie made fit for heroes to live in. '. . . I am quite aware that honourable members are only too glad to bolster up any scheme which will put money into the pockets of their friends, but fortunately this, scheme is exempt from that particular vice. I would however, ask the House whether there is not plenty of land in this country. Colonel WEDGWOOD -In tliat case may T just quote the facts as to the growth of deer",55,Elliot Johnson The Y Are A Nificently Beneficial Grievou S Harm Has
183,Mr Brennan,"forests, the object of ...which is amusement. In 1883, according to the report which has been issued to-day,'the deer forests in Scotland covered 1.975,000 acres. In 1912, that figure, after 30 years, had grown to 3,584,000 acres. That is a development of a form of cultivation which inevitably results not only in driving sheep and cattle off the land, but in driving away human beings as well.. That is in the Highlands of Scotland. Sometimes I turn to an interesting column in Saturday's Argus' wherein a lady writer under the pen name of "" Sib,"" contributes interesting social notes from high places in B r it a in . I have taken this quotation from one of her letters. ferrin g to the movement of society towards the shooting areas and hunting in GreatB r it a in and Scotland, she writes:One Scottish peer has let his moors for the next fivo years for Â£85,000. A rent of Â£3,000 for three months and 3,000 brace of grouse, is said to be a common figure. .Expenditure on dogs, beaters, keepers, and entertaining brings the amount spent in shooting in Scotland between August and November, up to Â£10,000,000 "". If honourable members take tbe trouble to look it up they w ill find that in England, as in Australia, the movement is from the country to the cities. I am not disposed, therefore, to accept for one moment as proven the assertion that there is any surplus of population in England which justifies the expatriation of her own. people. In England, as in Australia, the land is held by a few grandees, and the legitimate owners of England are being herded in the big cities and reduced, I am sorry to say, to destitution in millions. tion of the problem * it is proposed to foist those unfortunates on the people of Australia. My answer to that scheme is that we welcome our kinsmen from B r it a in as friends and brothers, but we should like to populate Australia not from the ranks of despair, but from the ranks of hope. Our. view is that justice should be done to those people in their own country, by their own government ; that they should not be arbitrarily transported as part of an expensive immigration scheme, to Australia, to add to our volume of unemployment, to create discontent and bad feeling, and generally to retard the process of development. The Prime Minister stated, and others have adopted the language of the right honourable gentleman in one for m or another, that it behoves us to populate Australia in order to j u s t if y ourselves before the League of Nations. By uttering such sentiments the PrimeM in ister is guilty of weak-kneed surrender of his duties as the trustee of this country, and is promoting *a feeling against Australia which he should be the first to prevent, and which in no circumstance"""", is justifiable. ""Who are the natural owners of this country? MrE . RILEY And what is the League of Nations? Retruly be said of tbe League of Nations that it possesses a sufficient sense of justice to be able to appreciate tbe Australian view-point if the facts were put before it . Unfortunately, the facts have not been promulgated by the Prime Minister. This country lay unused throughout the centuries u n t i l Captain Cook arrived upon its shores. It. has been conquered by its present possessors and their immediate predecessors, not by the arbitrament of war, but in a manner much more effective and less bloody, and much more calculated to make their title secure. We, if I may say so without boasting, are tbe conquerors of this country, by the spirit and courage displayed by our explorers and pioneers, and by the application of scientific methods to our rural industries and manufactures. Our birth-rate is high, our occupation is real. The League of Nations need have no fear of our aspirations, unless its view of the facts is distorted by As a soluopinions expressed by and on behalf of this Government. I am satisfied that the case against the Government is a sound one. I believe that Ministers have been callous in regard to unemployment. Last year, when fro m the Opposition benches we asked whither we were d r if t in g, the Government should have taken appropriate action. It is very serious that unemployment should be critical at this period of the year. We expect a little unemployment in the depth of winter, but when the summer is with us, when ordinarily we may expect harvests of f r u it or grain, there should be no unemployment problem. This Government cannot shift its responsibility on to the States. It is expected to speak for the whole of Australia, and, if necessary, to call together State.Ministers to.consult and to act. upon the. situation before it",59,Honourable Members No
184,Mr Brennan,"I believe it maybecomes, over acute and widespread. I heartily support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. did not at first intend to speak on this motion-, but after hearing the misstatements and shocking misrepresentations of the honourable member for Grey( Mr those plucky settlers who havegone into Lacey) regarding the Government of South Australia, I felt that I could not allow the occasion to passin silence. Up to the dinner adjournment I was prepared tocongratulate the honourable member upon having made a very excellent speech. After that, however, his statements regarding the South Australian Government were not only inaccurate, but, in some cases, borenorelation to the facts whatever. The South Australian Government has had a very tough job. It has had many difficulties to face, and has faced them manfully, with a courageous determination to do the right thing. It is setting itself out not to court popularity, but to do what it believes is right. in. which' it is to-day. At last, however, I do not wish to slander the previous Government, but there are certain facts which a man is bound, in common honesty, to make clear to the people of this country. The previous Government in South Australia, as a Labour Government, was possibly the best in Australia * --possibly a long way the best-and that is not saying very much. It did some extremely good things. I u regard to education it probably did more than any of its predecessors. T candidly admit that. But in other matters it was a very extravagant Government, and was not getting anything like 20s. in the Â£ value on some of the works it had undertaken. It was not even getting 12s. in the Â£. I propose to give the facts regarding the particular work that the honourable member for Grey made such a song about. I refer to the Tod Eiver scheme on the west coast. This is peculiar country, and although some of it is well watered, there is a large area extending for hundreds of miles where water is very scarce. Since this development scheme was taken in hand there have been unceasing labour troubles. I do not know of any other instance in which so much trouble of the kind has been experienced. The Labour Government began the work on the day labour principle, and it was known everywhere throughout the State that the Tod Eiver scheme was costing a tremendous amount of money-a , most unjustifiable amount of money. The present Govern-: ment determined: that there should be no more foolery of this kind, because it realized that the enormous expenditure w;as. going to be a perpetual burden on this country to make it productive. The Government told the men that they would have to accept piece-work conditions. It said that it had obtained the advice of independent experts, as to what the work was worth, and told the men that that was the price it intendedto pay. If the men were not prepared; to. accept that price they could get. off the job. Then the labour agitators got to. work and induced the mento refusethese terms. These agitators are the ruin of the working men of this country. Australian workmen are. as good as those of any other country, but it is the agitators who have placed Australia in the distressful condition I believe the working men are having their eyes opened. The men of whom I am speaking went on strike, hut they came back eventually, and tackled the job with a will. They made up. to. 2s. a day more than they were making before, and the cost of the work was only one third of what it had been under the day-labour system. If the honourable member for Grey is not aware of these things let him ask the Pre-: mier of South Australia, Mr Butler, or the Leader of the Opposition in that State, Mr Hill, whether the statement. I have made is correct. The information which I obtained first hand shows the amount of cleaning up there is to do. work now. are working at piece-work rates. they have gone back to day work. That they have gone back to piece-work is the talk of all South Australia.

The honourable member would not know a Brahmaputra hen from one of the Cochin China breed. The Government of South Australia asked Mr Young and Mr Darling to investigate the financial affairs of that State, and offered' them the assistance of the Under-Treasurer and the Auditor General, two of South Australia's most resourceful and capable men. Without fee or reward, but solely in the interests of the country, Mr Young and Mr Darling undertook the task. The Government then had to decide whether theliability should be spread over a term of three years, or drastic measures taken at once. It determined that, if possible, it would make the books balance this year. I believe that it will succeed. I do not say whether it was wise or unwise to place sueh a big burden not very well able to bear it. The honourable member for Grey had a lot to say about the tax that will be paid by the servant girl who receives 14s. a week and keep. She will have to pay Â£1.

The State Government is tackling its financial responsibilities and is increasing by 25 per cent, the people of South Australia in their the income taxation for last year, which was characterized by a good wool clip and a very good wheat crop.

""When the honourable member goes before his constituents at the next election how will he explain the drift of Queensland, the richest State in Australia, and one of the richest places on the face of the world? The trouble with South Australia to-day is that it is engaged in rehabilitating its railways. If it were not for the expenditure involved in that work its financial position would be much easier. The rehabilitation of its railways will cost the State a lot of money, but it will pay handsomely in the end.

We speak of the need for efficiency; but what do we do to acquire it? We have efficiency in some of our undertakings in South Australia, and, for' the consolation of my dear old friend the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), an original member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I admit that the Newcastle steel works are efficient; but they cannot do everything. The report of the In dustrial Delegation to which I have referred was signed by two members of the Australian Labour party, who attached an addendum to the effect that certain of the recommendations of the Delegation would not be applicable in some of the States. Honourable members opposite are not free to express their opinions on those recommendations, neither are they free to send representatives to the industrial peace conference. If they are anxious that Australia should prosper and to destroy the fellow who is ruining it, they should send representatives to that conference, which has been convened for the purpose of securing industrial peace and a better understanding between capital and labour.

Thousands of Labour men bave read it and taken it to heart, and they certainly will refuse to follow blindly the dictates of their leaders who are bent on dragging them to destruction. I suggest to the Prime Minister that the report of the Australian Industrial Delegation should be laid on the table of this House and debated. If it were given effect it would mean the salvation of this country. We have the Arbitration Court, and I fear that we shall have to continue its work for some time yet. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. HouBe adjourned at 11.12 p.m.",66,Honourable Members No
