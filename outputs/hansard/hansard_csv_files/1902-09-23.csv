The statement which has appeared in our newspapers, to the effect thai; the proposal is that the present contributions of Australia and New Zealand shall be about doubled, is generally correct. There appears to have been, however, a contingent proposal that either the whole of the increase, or a large part of it, shall not be paid as a direct subsidy, but shall be applied by Australia for the purposes of its own naval defence in connection with the Imperial navy. A t present the details of neither proposal have reached us. -agreement which has appeared in the newspapers substantially correct'( will have no validity until it is ratified by this Parliament and by tbe Parliament of New Zealand.

Queensland, in an interview published in this morning's newpapers, is reported to have said thatThe Federal Government proposed to differentiate between the treatment of the pearlshelling industries of Queensland and those of Western Australia. I wish to know from the Acting Prime Minister if there is any truth in that statement ? proposed, or is being made, between the treatment of the pearl-shelling industry in Torres Straits, at Port Darwin, and at Broome; the same policy is being pursued in each place. Misapprehension appears to have arisen from the fact that a deputaA s the right honourable tion which waited upon me in regard to the industry dealt with the effect of the Immigration Restriction Act. In the course of some observations made to them. I called attention to the fact that there was a material difference between the administration of .that Act in respect to Thursday Island-which , although an island, is practically a part of the mainland-and in regard to Broome, which, although on the mainland, is for all practical purposes really an island, as it is completely separated from the white settlements of Western Australia. No ; nor has the I then pointed out that the Immigration Restriction Act required to be enforced at Port Darwin and Thursday Island with more stringency than was necessary in the case of Broome, because, whilst successful attempts had been made to evade the Act at the first two places, all efforts of a similar kind at Broome had failed. The other matter referred to was the fact that the owners of the pearl-shelling fleets at Thursday Island had secured a f u l l supply of labour for the E x a c t l y ; but I have present season prior to the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act, whereas those engaged in the pearl-shelling industry at Broome had not been able to do so.

19,Mr Kirwan,"In view of the factSir WILLIAM LYNE I am not in a position to make a definite reply. An item is included in the Estimates in connection with which this question can be discussed. I think that every facility should be offered to honourable members of both Houses, not only to visit Western Australia and other States, but also to take their wives with them, because it would be extremely advantageous for honourable members to obtain the fullest information possible regarding the conditions of all the States. I intend to make a statement when the proper time arrives, and, if the House is in accord with me, I shall ask my colleagues to approve of my proposals, and give an opportunity to honourable members to see the country for which they have to make laws. to ask the Acting Minister for Defence whether he is now in a position to give us particulars as to the manner in which the ten drill instructors recently sent to South Australia will occupy their time 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE ful l information on the subject, because I have not yet been furnished with all the particulars for which I asked, in the last minute I wrote to the General Officer Commanding. I understand that it is proposed that one drill instructor shall be stationed at Adelaide to instruct the Mounted Rifles, including ""the members of rifle clubs, and that three instructors shall be employed in drilling the infantry forces and members of rifle clubs in Adelaide. One instructor will be Stationed at Yankalilla' to drill the Mounted Rifles, and two at Mount Gambier to drill the Mounted Rifles and infantry, including the members of rifle clubs. A t Wallaroo there will be one instructor for the Mounted Rifles, and two for the infantry. A t Jamestown one instructor will be provided for the Mounted Rifles, and at Gladstone one for the infantry. In addition to this information, I have been furnished with a report which gives particulars as to the number of places -som e thirteen or fourteen in all-in the Adelaide district at which in all 731 men will receive instruction. A t Yankalilla and other places in its neighbourhood 209 men will require to be drilled, and at Mount Gambier 286. The Mounted RiflesA t present and infantry in the west central sub-district numbering 266, and in the east central sub-district numbering 794 men, will be drilled by the instructors at Wallaroo. The instructors at Jamestown and Gladstone will drill 346 nen in the north central sub-district, and 628 in the northern sub-district. I have also a memorandum written by the General Officer Commanding in reference to this question, but I should like the honourable member to read it for himself, because I cannot. ' to know whether the information which the Minister has communicated to us really means that each of these drill instructors will be engaged for only two hours per week ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have given the honourable member all the information I can. The General Officer Commanding told me that he could not give any further details desire at present, because arrangements for allotting the hours of duty for the drill instructors have not yet been completed. I know that the officers are endeavouring to obtain f u l l information, and I cannot ask them to do impossibilities. As I am not a military I have not officer, I cannot say whether or not the duties of the drill instructors will occupy them for two hours only per week. Minister ask for that information ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes ; and the General Officer Commanding has given me all the particulars which he is in a position to communicate at the present time. I have already explained the reason why full details cannot be supplied just now. why the information has not been supplied is obvious. whether the Minister is satisfied with the Military Commandant's palpable evasion of the questions which have been put to him ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I scarcely think that that question is a fair one. I do not believe there has been any palpable evasion on the part of the General Officer Commanding, who has supplied me with all the information that can be obtained ab the present time. could be obtained in half-an-hour.

That is how the matter stands at the present time. I may further add that he has given the Commonwealth Government two months to vacate it . Mr G. B . EDWARDS -Has the opinion of the Attorney-General been taken upon the subject ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE nions will be submitted. I may also mention, in connection with the transfer of a reserve, in Hobart, which is one of the choicest spots in that c it y I refer to the and what I have been trying to get from old barrack square-the Minister for Lands visited Melbourne for the special purpose of interviewing me and, I think, the Acting Prime Minister. He submitted a proposal that the Commonwealth Government should abandon that reserve, as the State authorities desired it for a city park, and accept in lieu thereof a site near the Domain with a water frontage. We agreed to that proposal, and accepted the less valuable site. That is precisely what I suggest should be done in connection with Da\ves Point, which would be an expensive place to purchase. It is a beautiful spot, and, in my opinion, should be added to that portion of Sydney which is now being improved. There need be no trouble whatever if the State Government will only be reasonable, and accept our suggestion in this regard. whether the Acting Minister for Defence is determined to avoid the necessity for taking over the enormously expensive city water frontage of Dawes Point, and whether, considering the enormous area of land which is dedicated to military purposes in the neighbourhood of Sydney, it is necessary to obtain any substitute in the way of a citv water frontage ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE is not the desire of the Government to take any expensive water frontage-in this case 7 or S acres of what is practically park land-whic h could be better utilized in beautifying that particular part of Sydney. As to taking the whole of the other lands which have been occupied by the military authorities, it is quite impossible to say at the present time whether they will be all required For instance, there are the Victoria .Barracks, and some water frontages, notably from Athol Bay to Middle Head, and in Middle Harbor. I think, however, it is necessary to retain these lands, not because they are required immediately, but because they were reserved many years ago by, I think, Sir James Martin, for defence purposes, in case of an attack by a fleet. A t the present time, however, there is no particular spot held by the military authorities close to Sydney, where the Defence department No doubt opican obtain a deep water frontage or wharfage suitable for embarking or disembarking troops, or for the landing of naval or military stores. Such a frontage is what I desire, the State' Government, not with the idea that they should give it to the Commonwealth, but that we should be able to buy it for less than we should pay for the Dawes Point land. If there were a spot close by which we could turn to account, we could very easily give up Dawes Point, but there is no such spot either at Circular Quay, Darling Harbor, or Wolloomooloo Bay, at one of which places there ought to be a water frontage, which the Defence department may use as desired. It does not follow that there would be an exclusive right on the part of the Federal Government to the use of this frontage or wharfage; they might lease it to a company, reserving only the power to utilize it at certain times. I have, I think, suggested a practical settlement of the question. I desire to ask FEDERALCAPITAL SITES. ask the Minister for Home Affairs a question in reference to the proposed sites for the federal capital. Two or three weeks ago the honourable gentleman told the House that he would submit the question of the selection of the committee of experts to the next Cabinet meeting. Has he yet done so, and is he in a position to make any comI am sure it munication to the House on the subject ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have in my hand a motion of which I had intended to give notice to-day, though I question veiy much whether it would be wise to deal with the matter in that way. This motion does not deal with the names of the experts, but with the names of the sites.

I have prepared a mass of information, although for my own sake I have epitomised the details my speech would be a very long one, and would become tedious to honourable members if I were to give the Committee all the figures in my possession. currence of honourable members, I propose to give not all the details, but in most cases merely the results. I shall submit the details to Hansard, and as the report will be published to-morrow morning, honourable members who desire to look carefully into the whole question will have the fullest to do so. By that arrangement members, as well as the States will be able to obtain the fullest information, while I shall avoid the necessity of making my statement tedious. possibly can with the figures. I do not possess the eloquence of the General, nor have I the graceful diction of Sir Philip Fysh, whose budgets are always poetic. I can the somewhat difficult and complicated problems connected with federal finance. I desire honourable members in the first instance to consider that though we may appear to be dealing with large figures, we have been used in the past to deal only with State figures. Therefore, when we come to deal with federal figures, though the totals may appealto loom very large, when we bear in mind that we are dealing with the figures for six States instead of for one, it will be seen that, comparatively the figures are not large. There is another point which will be found to be of great importance all through the statement, and that is with regard to certain works and buildings. We last year proposed a certain expenditure amounting to and this year we are proposing an expenditure of £180,000 out of revenue. may appear to be a rather large but as a matter of fact very little of last year's provision was expended, and we are really now providing for two and a-half years' requirements-eighteen months that Sir George Turner. In are passed, and the twelve months which we have just entered upon. If honourable It is, therefore, members will compare the Estimates with the actual expenditure of last year, they will find that during last year we were able to make very large savings upon our Estimy figures and ascertaining mates, and in the Defence department alone to the extent of £100,000. Thereand fore the amount that will be shown as the difference between the estimated expendito a very great extent, ture of this year and the actual expenditure of last year is necessarily much smaller than if we made the comparison between the Estimates of the two years. Therefore, with tlie conWe also had to provide in 19012 for large arrears of the previous year amounting to £315,000. This year we have to provide for arrears to the extent of only £83,000. Honourable members will see that the amount for arrears is therefore very largely reduced, and I hope that in the next financial stateopportunity ment the Treasurer will be able to leave honourable the question of arrears out of consideration Treasurers, altogether, as that will to some extent simplify any statement which he has to make. I have always felt very strongly unduly long and that it is our duty to make every effort to I propose to deal as simply as I give back to the States, as far as possible, the amount of money they were collecting Attorneyfrom Customs and Excise revenue just before federation, plus the cost of carrying on the new expenditure. But unfortuI desire simply to state as fully as nately we have to provide for very large sums which have been forced upon us by action taken by, the States very shortly prior to federation. They have all been sinners in that respect. are charged with extravagant expenditure, people are apt to forget the significant fact that the States dealt very liberally in many directions just before federation, apparently speaking, thinking that the Federal Government would have some fund of its own out of which the expenditure involved could be paid, and forgetting that whatever was paid would subsequently have to be paid back by the individual States. In some instances £116,000, volunteer corps were turned into partially paid forces. Rifle clubs were established That right and left, and that meant enormous amount, expenditure. In the State of Victoria the ammunition reserve was allowed almost to run out altogether. On the 1st May, when we took over the defence forces, there were only 500,000 rounds of ammunition in hand,",21,Budget 1902 3

54,Sir George Turner,"When weand the result was that last year I had to put £24,000 on the Estimates to secure a sufficient reserve of ammunition in Victoria. Then during the year troops have come hack, and while in the previous year the expense they involved was saved, we have now had to provide for them. New services were started in some of the States involving payments to the railways. Increased postal facilities were afforded, and while in Victoria the penny post was brought into operation, the effect was to hit us both ways, because we lost revenue to the extent of between £40,000 and £50,000, and the expenditure was considerably increased. In New South Wales a new classification scheme in connection'with the public service involved a large increase of expenditure, and in Victoria we had the recommendations of a reclassification board to carry out, and that meant a very large increase to State servants, especially in the Postal department. dealt with as regards increases to public servants, though in some respects the recommendations of the board were not carried out. Then there is a large amount of expenditure involved in connection with increments to which public servants are entitled by law, regulation, or custom prevailing in the States for a number of years. That has the effect of adding a very considerable sum every year, and it helps to swell the expenditure. Theni n connection with our Post-office, we must realize that expenditure very naturally increases every year if we are to give proper facilities and maintain a proper service. Looking through the Estimates carefully, I can assure this House and the people, that there is no extravagance in any of the transa serious difference in the amounts we areferred departments. We have tried our best to cut down the expenditure. Ministers have been careful, heads of departments have watched, and I believe the officers throughout have endeavoured to keep the services going at as small an expense as possible, giving at the same time proper efficiency. W it h regard to these Estimates I know of no items in connection with which reductions can be. made to any large extent. I have been through them all very carefully, and I have compared them with the previous expenditure. Customs, we have to endeavour to estimate what will be the receipts during the current 43 F year. In order to do that. I had prepared a return which showed the total amount collected in each State, month by month, on each item. ThatI propose to submit for the information of honourable members. I submitted it to the various collectors, and received from them estimates of what they considered would be received during the j'ear, taking into consideration the special information they had. Many communications have passed between us, and in some cases I have come to the conclusion that the amounts that will be collected will be larger than the amounts which the collectors themselves have estimated. Acting upon these lines, it will be seen that I cannot be charged with any attempt to cut down the amount that is likely to be derived from Customs. Honourable members will naturally desire-it is their right, and I hope they will do so caref ully-to check the items which will be supplied in regard to the* anticipated Customs revenue, in order that we may gain the benefit of the informaI t was tion of those who have local knowledge, and who may be able to give us information which is not within my control. In doing so, I would ask the committee to consider a. few points-first , with regard to loading up,., which to some extent still continues. On* the other hand, goods are now being moref reely imported than some time ago, because they had not been sufficiently provided for up to the end of the financial year. Then, as we went along, we made reductions in rates, and a large number of items were made absolutely free. It will be seen that it would not do to take nine months' collections and estimate the return for the twelve months from them by adding a certain proportion, because we have changed the duties . from time to time, and those changes make likely to collect. On the other hand, byomitting tlie exemption with regard to State duties, we shall receive a sum of about £245,000 extra. gentleman made any calculation as to the effect upon the revenue of these changes in the Tariff? my calculations, Where no changes have beenmade, I have worked from the nine months'' receipts, taking into consideration the quesW it h regard to tion of loading up, and, where chauges have been made, I have worked on the receiptsfrom the. date of the changes.

58,Sir George Turner,"In makingmeans I think I have ascertained fairly the amount likely to be received. Then we must not forget the unfortunate drought which we have had over a great part of our continent, the high prices of the necessaries of life, and the fact that Governments and others are likely to expend less money. Under all these circumstances, it will not do for us to be too optimistic with regard to our -estimates. But, at the same time, I quite -admit that we should not cut them down to an unduly low figure. ""With regard to the item of sugar, I have estimated that the total consumption will be 170,000 tons. That is a very large amount to estimate. ' The average will be something between 160,000 and 170,000 tons. I estimate that out of that amount, 75,000 tons will be imported, and will pay duty at £ 6 per ton ; 40,000 tons will be grown by white labour, and pay at £ 1 per ton ; and 55,000 tons w ill be grown by black labour, and pay at £-3 per ton. I have estimated the total 'receipts from that source at £675,500. 'That is certainly a large amount, and I ihave some little doubt in my own mind as *fco whether that sum will be fully realized. But, on the whole, I think I have made a fair estimate in the amounts I am about to submit to honourable members. I do not desire to go too far, because the States Treasurers, if we give them back less money than we promise them, will naturally iblame us. In fact, some of them blame -.the Federal Government and the Federal ""Parliament for not having given them back -already, not what the Federal Treasurer said he would give back to them, but what the States Treasurers themselves estimated that they would receive. As a matter of fact, however, the Fe'deral Government has in all cases, except in that of Queensland, given back to the States Treasurers more than I estimated when I made my Budget statement on the Sth of October last year, ;SO that they had a full opportunity for cutting down the expenditure when they knew that the amount they could expect to >receive was less than their own estimates. Government is not responsible for the deficits in the States. should be very glad indeed if the Customs and Excise revenue which I expect to receive is exceeded, because if that is so it will give the States' more money, which in some cases I am well aware they will require. If honourable members will be good enough to follow me through the papers which I have circulated I will now explain them fully, but as briefly as I possibly can. Sheet No. 1 in these papers gives the monthly details of the revenue received from Customs and Excise during the years 19001 and 1901-2. It shows that in 19012, during which the uniform Tariff was introduced, we derived £8,692,750, as against £8,189,529, which was the amount received in the previous year; or an increase of £503,221. To that we have to add the receipts from the special Western Australian Tariff, which during the nine months brought us in £201,569. Government -had nothing to do with that. into consideration, in dealing with the uniform Tariff, the special Tariff of AVestern Australia, in order to draw attention to what the amount received, or likely to be received from that source, will be. However, I do not myself place veiy much reliance on the comparison between these figures which I have mentioned, because the loading up for the vear 1900-1, made a considerable difference. I simply give the details because they are useful to honourable members in looking at the results, and in considering what has happened since the Federal Tariff was passed. B ut I prefer myself, as I have always done, to try to make a comparison with the year 1900, particulars as to which honourable members will find on page 2 of the papers which I have circulated. Looking first to New South Wales we find that that in 1900 the total amount received in that State was £l,7S5,7Sl, and in 1901-2 £2,812,722, or an increase to that State of £1,026,941. I estimate a further increase for 1902-3 to the extent of £337,278, estimating the revenue for New South Wales at the sum of £3,150,000. In the State of A^ictoria in 1900 we collected £2,342,485 : in 1901-2 we collected £2,376,483-a n increase of £33,998. I estimate for this year that there will be a decrease of £76,483 as against last year, and I place the estimate for the State of A ictoria at 7 tlie sum of £2,300,000. on account of the falling off in trade ? due to various causes-the abolition of the tea duties, the lowering of customs rates,",23,Budget 1902 3

64,Sir George Turner,"It will beand so on. In Queensland, as against a revenue in 1900 of £1,561,486, we received last year £1,297,664a decrease, unfortunately, in that State of £263,822. I am forced to anticipate a further decrease for 1902-3 of £97,664. The revenue we anticipate to receive from Queensland for the year is £1,200,000. In South Australia, in 1900, we collected £639,004, and in 1901-2 £698,696-a n increase of £59,692. I anticipate a decrease to the 'extent of £18,696, putting down the amount to be collected in 1902-3 at £680,000. Western Australia, in 1900, the sum of £944,746 was collected, and in the following year, 1901-2, under the uniform Tariff, the amount was £1,134,044. gentleman include the Northern Territory in the South Australian estimate ? SirG EORGE TURNER -The Northern -Territory is included. In Western Australia the collections show an increase of £1S9,29S, and, adding £201,569 increase on the special Tariff, the total amounts to £390,867 more than in the previous year. We anticipate an increase in 1902-3 to the -extent of £25,956 from the uniform Tariff, and £23,431 from the special Tariff-the special Tariff having been in force for only nine months in the previous 3'ear-and that gives a total increase of £49,387. . The total uniform Tariff revenue anticipated is £1,160,000, and from the special Tariff £225,000, or a total revenue for that State of £1,385,000 from customs and excise. enormous revenue. I do not know how Western Australia can continue in that course for many years. However, there are the facts, and I believe that the amount ' I have stated will be received. Of course, in dealing With the finances of Western Australia, we have to take into consideration the fact that in a short time there will under the sliding scale be a reduction of 20 per cent, in the amount of the duties collected from Inter-State goods, and that means that there will be a reduction of importation of over-sea goods in many cases, and consequently a large reduction on the total amount collected. : surer estimates an increase? increased population I think there will be an increased revenue in Western Australia, 45 F 2 because we shall have the Tariff iu operation for twelve months instead of nine. There is no doubt, however, that we may anticipate an increase in the Inter-State trade, and that to some extent will affect the over-seaimports. I u the case of Tasmania, for the year 1900, tlie collection was £489,151. Unfortunately last year the receipts fell off to £373,141, a loss of £116,010 for that State with its comparatively small revenue. I am forced here again to anticipate a further decrease to theextent of.£33,14.1, leaving the' revenue In anticipated to be received from Tasmania at £340,000. Taking the totals, in 1900 we collected £7,762,653. Last year we collected £8,692,750, an increase of £930,097 : and, adding to that the receipts from the special Tariff of Western Australia, a total increase of £1,131,666. Honourable members will see that the increase anticipated to be received under the uniform Tariff for this year is £137,250, and from the special Tariff £23,431, a total of £160,6S1 : so that altogether I anticipate this year to receive £8,830,000 from the uniform Tariff, and from the special Tariff of Western Australia £225,000a total customs and excise of £9,055,000. The figures I have just given will be better understood from the following tabulated statement:NEW SOUTH WALES. 1900 £1,785,781 1901-2 ... 2,812,722 A very heavy revenue.

In Western Australia there was a considerable increase, if the revenue from the special Tariff is included ; but if it is omitted, the proportion collected was just about the same. In £489,151 Queensland and Tasmania we had decreases. 373,141 The total proportion is, however, practically > £116,010 the same. Of course, honourable members will realize that during this year great £33,141 changes will take place in connection with that proportion, because a larger sura, on the £340,000 whole, will be derived from this source, and a much larger sum in two of the States. If £7,762,653 honourable members will now turn back to page 2, they will see the f ollowing statement, £930,097 showing the amount collected per head in 201,569 1900 and the amount estimated for 1902-3; I am not comparing the figures with those of £.1,131,666 1901-2, because I prefer to compare them with those of 1902-3, when we shall have £137,250 a whole year's experience of uniform Special 23,43.1 Tariff:£S,830,000 1000. 1002-6. 225,000 £ s. d. £ S. d. £9,055,000 New South Wales1 6 4 2 5 0 Victoria1 19 3 1 17 10 Queensland ... 3 3 8 2 6 7 South Australia 1 .15 8 1 17 2 Western Australia 5 6 2 5 10 6 Special Tasmania2 16 0 1 18 10 -2 Commomvealth ... 6 5 2 5 6 withontspecial rfar ff",25,Queensland

The last statement given on that page shows the proportion of the collections as compared with the population and our anticipations for 1902-3. In New South Wales and Queensland the amount collected will be practically the same as the amount per head in the Commonwealth. In Victoria and South Australia it will be much less.

In the first part of my speech I gave a statement showing how much I anticipate fco receive, more or less, in each State. I also propose to circulate a statement. I have had prepared, which shows each item of the Tariff, the alterations made in it, and the amount collected each month, including July and August, so that honourable members will have before them the information relating to eleven months of the year, and can check the various calculations that will be distributed. HadI possessed the f u l l information with regard to July and August when I made these calculations, I might have varied some of the details, but I do not think that I should have varied the totals. I believe that the totals will come out as given, taking those months into comparison. I have since discovered that in Queensland a considerable sum about £37,000 is lodged on deposit. riot been taken into my calculations. I did not know of its existence, and the Queensland revenue at the end of the year may be increased by something like that sum. headed credits and debits. That refers to duties which are collected under section 93 of the Constitution in one State, and have to be credited to another. It shows to some extent the effect of goods passing from one State to another. It is as follows :9 months. 1902-3. £ New South Wales collected for other States ... ... 24,644 40,000 Victoria collected ... ... 61,314 100,000 South Australia collected ... 4,749 Queensland received from other States ... Western Australia received ... 1,765 Tasmania received ... That shows that a large quantity of goods are imported into New South Wales and Victoria and ultimately find their way into Queensland and Tasmania. On page 9 I give further information with regard to customs and excise receipts for the months of July and August, which I could not include in the large statement. It is as follows :July. August£ £ New South Wales ... 305,089 302,226 Victoria 213,723 216,308 Queensland 112 532 110,611 South Australia 64,076 58,836 Western Australia... 118,033 10.1,417 Special 26,146 22,400 Tasmania... 28,610 29,002 Total uniform ... 842,063 819,000 Honourable members will find that in J uly we collected £842,063 and in August% £819,000. Of course if this rate were to continue, the amount I anticipate would be very largely increased. I have communicated with the collectors of Customs and they are all of opinion that the amounts now being collected are abnormal, and are accounted for by re-stocking and the importation of summer goods, and that that rate cannot be maintained during the That amount has year. Therefore it will be very unwise to attempt to ascertain the amounts likely to be collected by multiplying the figures for either of those months by twelve. August shows a falling off as against July, and as Honourable members will see one line far as I have obtained the figures for September, they show a further falling off as against August.

Honourable members, when dealing with* the figures which I am supplying, must not run away with the idea' that, because the revenue for any one month is a certain £ amount, the revenue for the year will be twelve times that amount, though it is a common way of calculating the receipts for the year to multiply the receipts of any one 6,000 month by twelve.

A t first we were of the opinion that it should be regarded as ""other"" expenditure, but,"" as I shall explain when I come to deal with works and buildings generally, we now consider it fair to regard it as transferred expenditure..

I will presently give full information in regard to increases generally. It is only fair to say that in the year which has just passed the departmental expenditure was largely increased by the amount of arrears from the previous year which had to be paid, and it has been pointed out by some of the postal officials that the year's expenditure practically included the expenditure for five quarters. This year the arrears are smaller, and therefore a better result 'will be shown. The statements give the actual receipts and payments during the respective years. My desire is that in every department, wherever possible, every liability shall be paid during the year in which the expenditure was incurred, so that the amount of -arrears may be as small as possible.

I endeavoured to have them placed in the same form in each case, but there was some difficulty in the way, and, therefore, I have not attempted to compare details, but simply show the total for each State. dinary increase in the amount expected to be derived from the sale of stamps is due to the operation of the bookkeeping clauses ? these increases I have included amounts which were not previously collected in some of the States. In three of the States each department had to pay postage upon the matter sent through the post, whereas in other States this practice was not followed. Asi t has been determined under the Post and Telegraph Bill that all the States shall pay postage upon their correspondence, and for telegrams, there will be an increase of revenue in Victoria to the extent of £16,500, in Queensland of £12,000, and iu Tasmania of £5,000. This new practice will not interfere with the receipts in the other States, where it had previously been the rule for the departments to pay for the services rendered by the post-office. This item, must be borne in mind when we are dealing with the amount of the surplus to be returned to each of the States. Three of the States will now have to pay for services which have hitherto . been rendered free of cost.

I did see some figures relating to this matter, but I do not recollect them at the moment. Although they might in themselves appear large, they do not' represent a very large amount compared with the total revenue to be collected in each department.

When, however, we compare the Estimates for this year with the actual expenditure of last year, we find that they provide for an increase of £243,080. The transferred expenditure this year is put down at £3,629,291, as compared with £3,422,572 last year,an increase of 206,719. The other expenditure for the current year is estimated at £295,473, as compared with £259,112 last year, an increase of £36,361, making a total increase over last year of £243,080.

Honourable members will no doubt be startled to find that we are asking for such a large amount in excess of the expenditure last year, but the explanation is a very simple one, and it involves the question of works and buildings.

In that connection, we provide this year for the expenditure of £69,317 for further works and buildings, and there are a number of other items which I shall bring under the notice of honourable members at a later stage. In 1901-2 many items were for part of tlie year only, and i u 1902-3 we provide for the whole of the new works for practically two years.

That is one of the items I have insisted on now being brought into our expenditure, which is necessarily increased, but at the In the military same time this also increases the amount on the revenue side.

What we have to provide for is expenditure in different places, and I have brought together in one Budget statement tlie expenditure in each department. Carrying out a promise made, I think to the honourable member for Bland, I also show the Estimates and actual expenditure of 1901-2, as compared with the expenditure of 190.2-3, so that honourable members may see at once where there are increases, and where there are decreases.

We have to provide for increased business, as well as for the heavier charges caused by tlie drought in connection with our mail services. We have the telephone and telegraph lines ever extending, and, necessarily, more expenditure is involved in maintenance. In Queensland, we have had to reconstruct two lines which were destroyed, and we have charged that expenditure against revenue. That accounts for £3,700 of the increase in that particular State. Tasmania shows an increase. crease, however, is accounted for by the fact that Tasmania has now to pay the whole of the subsidy in connection with the Eastern Extension Company's cable between Tasmania and the mainland, whereas in former years the payment of the subsidy was distributed among the States. The agreement under which the subsidy was paid by the different States lapsed, and unfortunately the whole expenditure now falls on the island State. I believe .that the authorities there endeavoured to make arrangements with the other States in regard to the subsidy, but did not succeed. The total increase on the whole of -the Estimates is £243,080. in our proposed expenditure are the new works, which represent £180,598. Of that sum £111,281 is practically a revote from the previous year, so that the additional works provided for on this year's Estimates represent an expenditure of £69,317. have already stated that we have provided for about £10,000, for which previously no provision was made, the amount being credited merely to expenditure. There is also a sum of £10,000, which we have paid to the States for supervision and for auditing. The disturbing item is that relating to new works and buildings. The amount involved under that heading is large. I returned the Estimate for reconsideration by the responsible Minister, in order to see whether it could not be reduced in view of the difficult position in which some of the States are likely to be placed. After reinvestigating the whole matter, however, my honourable colleague thought that we were bound to proceed with certain public works, and those which are submitted for construction out of revenue, are not only necessary, but perfectly justifiable.

This year there will be none, while in connection with the Coronation there is a reduction of £4,118 in the amount charged to the present year.

Honourable members will see that I have separated from the general expenditure that which I consider to be due to federation. I think that I have every justification for dividing our "" Other expenditure"" into two classes-that caused by federation and that which would have taken place-even if the Commonwealth had not been established.

A t the same time we hope to be in a position to considerably reduce the electoral expenditure, so far as that particular item is concerned. Honourable members will recollect that under section 87 of the Constitution certain accounts have to be kept between the Commonwealth on the one hand and the States on the other.

I propose simply to show how Tasmania much more of the States' money we could have expended than we have. We are 45' c; accused of having taken the whole one-fourth of the revenue to which the ComI t is only monwealth is entitled. It is said that we expend the whole of that one-fourth, but that is true only in regard to Queensland. With regard to the other States, we gave back in the case of New South Wales £316,408, to Victoria 188,454, to South Australia £114,682, to Western Australia £244,486, and to Tasmania £41,854. We spent more than the one-fourth in Queensland to the extent of £19,842. That was accounted for by the very heavy expenditure necessary in that State in connection with the Post-office department, which there, as I have already pointed out, shows a very serious loss. Dealing with this year, we shall give back to all the States, after providing for the works and buildings that I have mentioned, a total of £915,779, which we might have expended. Last year the total amount we gave back was £886,000, which we might have expended. Balance. able gentleman proposes to borrow £500,0001 to that subject presently.

W it h regard to Victoria, I might mention, in passing, that the Treasurer of that State estimates that he will get back £100,000 more than I expect he will receive.

I have nob the figures for New South Wales, but I have the best information I could obbain-the "" balance at the debit of the consolidated revenue fund on the 13th June, 1902.""

We have a greab deal bo do wibh the finances of the States, for the reasons I have previously mentioned. In Victoria for the year 1901--2 there was a deficit of £437,611 ; in Queensland bhere was a deficib of £431,939 ; in Soubh Australia there was a deficit of £222,315 ; and in Tasmania there was a deficit, of £44,279. In Western Australia there was a credit balance of £123,185, which would not have been the case there had it not been for the ope'rabion of bhe special Tariff of bhab Sbabe. Ausbralia, £113,080 more; Tasmania, I have in the next document which I have circulated, No. 46, made what I think should be a very interesting comparison, and what in years to come will be a very necessary one. A t the end of the bookkeeping period it will have to be determined whether bhe surplus to the Stabes shall be returned on the presenb bookkeeping sysbem or whether it is to be returned on a population basis. I think it is well, bherefore, that in the intervening years we should gather information with regard bo whab would have happened if we had not had the bookkeeping sections in the Consbitubionhow the surplus revenue would have been returned if it had been returned on a population basis, and what difference ib would have made to the individual States. We have often heard ib said bhab New South Wales was going bo carry the whole of bhe burden i 1 have not of federation, but these figures show rather a different result up to the present. I am reckoning on the supposition bhab we had nob had the bookkeeping sections ab all, and estimating how the distribution would have taken place as compared wibh what has taken place under these That particular sections. We find that on the figures as they stand, New South Wales in 19012 would have received upon a population basis £192,634 more than she received by means of the distribution under the bookkeeping section. Victoria would have received £344,360more ; Queensland would have received £42,546 more ; South Australia would have received £67,048 more; Tasmania would have received £11,053 more, whilst Western Ausbralia would have borne bhe whole burden,' receiving £658,24.1 less. iniquibous bhab sysbem would have been 1 with my right honourable friend. I have We have a always been strongly opposed to the bookkeeping secbions, but still I was forced to admit that if federation was to bake place those secbions were absolubely necessary. The nexbfigures show what would happen if the amounts paid to the States in 1902-3 were distributed on the basis of population. New South Wales would receive back £38,166 less than she would receive under the bookkeeping sections ; Victoria would receive £399,828 more; Queensland, ""£107,330 more; South £60,014 more; whilsb AVestern Ausbralia would again bear..,bhe brunb, and would receive £642,0S6 less. So that honourable members will see, when they come to think over the matter, that everything confirms the view of those who took up the position thab during bhe few years ab bhe commencement of federation we must have some sysbem of meeting the ordinary requirements of bhe Stabes. Those views were righb, so far as experience has shown. made with,.regard..to a distribution on a basis of male population. tion was that the return should be made on a population"" basis, and personally I should be very glad to see the whole subject dealt with on apopulation basis, because that would make our accounts much more simple.",41,Commonwealth

People 301,483 reading that statement will read it as mean888,645 ing that the transfer of certain departments to the Commonwealth has cost that sum. Similar statements have been made in other 62,998 States, and I have endeavoured for some 280,264 time past to get reliable figures in order to 608,404 be enabled to compare our actual expendiplace in the States for some years prior to federation. from these figures that there has been no extravagant expenditure, as has been sometimes alleged by those who either do not care to ascertain the facts for themselves or -who do not know what the facts are. Now, the statement was made by the Treasurer of Victoria, as reported in the press some time ago, that the transferred in Victoria, under federation, were costing £100,000 a year more than they did before. That statement is absolutely incorrect. have, in the papers submitted, taken a good deal of trouble to ascertain and. give the fullest information for the purposes of a comparison, in order that the figures may be challenged. which has been made musb have originated in a misapprehension, which has probably arisen from the fact that the comparison was made between ten month's' expenditure in one year and fourteen months' expenditure in another year. Victorian practice, during July and August, payments were allowed to be made on account of the previous financial year, and were charged against that Under our Commonwealth system we shut down sharp on the 30th June-the the financial year. The consequence of that is that payments on account of the past year have to be made out of and charged against the revenue of the -current' year. they have had bo pay five quarters' expendibure in the one year. Thab is the only means by which I can account for the grave -error which has been made in the statement that federation has cosb Vicboria in respecb of bhe transferred £100,000 extra. Last year, compared with the previous year, during the greater portion -of whioh tlie departments were under State control, the post-office cost Victoria £11,954' extra, and of thab sum £9,000 extra was caused by action taken by the Stabe jusb prior bo federation in reclassification and the adoption of penny postage, the burden of which action we have had to bear, and which was not due to any action of the Federal Parliament was a change in the port of call in Wesbern Ausbralia, and that caused a considerable extra expenditure. .will also realize thab, as I have mentioned already, the exbension of telephone communication must necessarily involve increased expenditure in all the Sbates. Then Sir George Turner. I shall be prepared to show in connection with the Defence department we have expended in Vicboria £20,442 more than was spent in the previous year, but thab amount is far more than covered by one ibem, which I have already mentioned. ' We had to provide the large sum of £24,000 for supplying a reserve of ammunition. The State had allowed it practically departments bo run oub, and, as a matter of facb, bhe amounb so expended should in sbricbness have been charged bo bhe previous year, and I baken off bhe year for which we are responsible. Ib would blien have been shown bhab our working of the Defence department was much cheaper than was the case before federation took place. The Customs departI think that the statement ment was worked, if I recollect aright, at a lower expenditure of £3,489 under federation than previously. The tobal exbra expendibure in Vicboria was £28,907 ; and I unhesitatingly stabe that that was caused not by any action taken by the Federal Under the Parliamenb or bhe Federal Governmenb, bub by the action which had been taken by the Sbabe Parliamenb previously, and for which we are nob in any way reyear. sponsible. I propose also to endeavour bo geb bhe best statement. I can with regard to bhe end of obher Sbabes on similar lines to thab which I have given in regard to Vicboria. I have been able bo make the statemenb I have made wibh regard bo Vicboria, because I have some knowledge of bhe finances of bhe Thus, in the posb-office State, and could readily pick out particulars with regard to the departments. These charges to which I have referred are commonly made in Victoria, and there is no doubt that they have also been made in some of the other States. Unforbunately departments the public read the charges, bub bhey do nob stop to inquire and investigate. They take the statements for granted-as being absolutely true-and consequently come to the conclusion that the Federal Parliament is extravagant, and is wasting the moneys which belong to the States. It is unfortunate that those opinions should be given expression bo, because bhey creabe in bhe minds of our people an impression thab could not exist if they had the Then bhere true facbs placed before bhem, and knew exacbly whab was taking place. The State Treasurer also said that federation Honourable members has cost Victoria £426,937. Probably that statement is correct. I cannot dispute his figures. I wrote asking him to give the details, but I have not received them, and therefore I cannot bell whether he is right or wrong. I think he must have included the large sum which was spent on the celebrations-probabl y £100,000 or £120,000, but it was probably all returned in extra oustoms duties and railway fares. I do not believe that the celebrations here cost more than £20,000 or £25,000. I do not believe that they cost very much more than that sum in New South Wales. I believe that all the money, expended came back to the various State T-reasurers. the amount. the Treasurer takes that into consideration in other items. ing now of the charges that are made with regard to the cost of federation. Wheni t is published broadcast that federation has cost Victoria £426,937, the people naturally think that it is owing to something which we have done. The total amount in eighteen month s charged to Victoria is only £ 140,283. Of that sum £91,422 was due to federation, and £30,699 to bhe celebrations. All that money was spenb in Victoria, and contributed principally by people from other Sbates. Vicboria gob bhe benefit of that .large expenditure, and her people ought not to complain of the amount charged bhere. The balance of the £140,283 represents the expenditure on New Guinea and bhe cosb of some loan works amounting in all to £18,162. A contribution to the Government of New Guinea was being made by the State, and the amount expended on loan works will be refunded. Looking at the figures which I have been able to ascertain, and which, I believe, are correct and reliable, I declare bhab all these charges, so far as Vicboria is concerned, are absolutely without foundation. I believe that when we can properly investigabe the position in obher Sbabes-eve n in Queensland, where I notice bhab allegations are made of the enormous extra expense of federation-it will be found that the Commonwealth has conducted the business just as cheaply as the States would have done, allowing for the extra expenditure which must necessarily be caused by the additional work which has bo be done, and bhe exbra amounb which is earned by the different departments. W it h regard to increments I mentioned thab we had to provide a certain sum for bhe Post-office. The incremenbs provided for all the departments come to £25,000, as follows :£ New South Wales ... 9,734 A ictoria ... r ... ... ... 3,330 Queensland ... ... ... 3,100 South Australia ... ... ... 3,628 Western Australia ... ... ... 3,460 Tasmania ... ... ... ... 2,200 25,452 In ""Other Expenditure,"" viz., for new departments ... ... ... 1,037 26,489 I think that Of bhe bobal, £23,060 is in the Post-office.

EDWARDS -I s that owing bo bhe minimum wage ? the salary of an officer, up bo £ 1 1 0 after he has atbained his 21st year. Thab amount is only based on the assumption that every person will get bhe increment. Probably a considerable number of them will not be able bo qualify. who would have got an incremenb under ordinary circumstances ? of the ordinary increment is not included. That sum represents the extra amount which this year would be required. If a man were receiving £ 9 0 , and got an increment of £10, bhab money is included in bhe amounb of the obher incremenbs I have given, and bhe balance of £ 1 0 would be included in this sura. I have nob included the full amount in the Estimates for the reason thab I was not satisfied that it would be required, and I desired that further information should be obtained regarding that question.

Those amounts may appear to be comparatively small, but I-desire honourable members to bear the fact in mind in connection with the proposed loan expenditure. If Parliament decides that the expenditure which we propose to charge to loan account shall be paid out of revenue, and charged as "" other "" expenditure, the result will be that Victoria will have to provide £56,873, South Australia £9,873, and Tasmania' £15,765 more, while New South Wales will provide £17,434, Queensland £49,984, arid Western Australia £15,093 less than will be expended in those States respectively.

Mi-. HIGGINS -The Treasurer assumes, then, that loan expenditure must be charged upon a population basis ? that loan expenditure for large public works is properly chargeable upon a population basis, but I shall.deal with the matter more fully when I come to refer to our loan proposals. I mention these facts now so that honourable members may bear them in mind in dealing with those proposals. We propose to expend £174,09S out of revenue, and £571,295 out of loan funds. If this is charged as transferred expenditure, no doubt, when we come to settle with the States for the buildings hauded over by them to the Commonwealth, the whole matter will have to be taken into consideration, and the money will have to be repaid. So far as I and my colleagues are concerned, if we could see any way to avoid loan expendiwhere it could be avoided, and while Treasurer of Victoria I was blamed fornot borrowing and expending very large sums. Buti f I had adopted the policy my critics then advocated, Victoria would to-day be paying in interest £200,000 or £250,000 more 70,290 62,797 minus 7,493 than she is now paying. 23,103 plus 7,352 toria nor any of the States will ever be 9,419 minus 4,008 bankrupt, because the Commonwealth will 7)852 minus 3,393 come to the assistance of any State that gets into difficulties.

143,Sir George Turner,"Neithe r VicService Act to which I have just referred will be about £12,500, that she will have to pay about £35,000 on her State imports, and about £16,500 for her postage, while about £75,000 will have to be provided in compliance with the provisions of a State Act passed just before federation was entered into, providing that Victorian public servants transferred to the Commonwealth shall be placed in as good a position as those occupying corresponding positions in other States. an increase of about £40,000 a year in the salaries of Commonwealth officers transferred from the Victorian sendee, but I have taken the amount at £30,000 a year, and, as we must provide in this year the increase for last year and for six months of tlie year prior to that, the total amount will be, as I have said, £75,000. Victoria, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, will be £182,500 worse off than she was last year, and as her Treasurer has stated that he expected to get £60,000 more than received last year, it will be seen that he will be considerably out in his calculations.

We have, however, taken all such opportunities away r from them, and I feel very strongly that we ought to be very cautious not \o adopt any course that would prejudice their finances. I do not say that we should place them in a financial difficulty, because any such statement might be misconstrued. I believe the States .will always meet all the demands made upon them. If any State drifted into a difficulty the Commonweal tli would have to come to its assistance, different and difficult one, and one which because we could not afford to allow its good name to be tarnished. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -D o not encourage that idea. want to do that; but, on the other hand, I do not wish to use an expression that might be construed by our enemies as meaning that any State might be allowed to fall into financialdifficulties. If the loan proposals contain any sums for maintenance or repairs, they ought to be eliminated. But I do not think that they do. The expenditure provided for in the Loan Bill is absolutely necessary. Take the case of Victoria. There is no doubt that the telephone system of this State is an immense one. One.cannot walk through the streets and contemplate the wires overhead without becoming conscious of the great danger which their presence constitutes. If we are to avert that danger, it the same purpose by devoting very close i.= absolutely necessary that we should do in Victoria what is being done elsewhere -introduc e the metallic circuit and place the wires underground. In New South Wales, too, it is imperative that this work should be proceeded with, on account of the induction caused by the adoption of the electric tram system there. The whole of the expenditure which is here enumerated appears to me to be absolutely requisite. While I am free to admit that we might distribute it over a, couple of years, if honourable members deem it desirable to adopt that course, the fact remains that if we are to have proper services these works ought to be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. Already we have charged large amounts against the revenues of the States, and I do not think we are justified in going further in that direction than we have done. discussion upon the Loan Bill, and when that measure is again under consideration I trust it will be debated in that good spirit which ought to animate every one of us, and that we shall be able to devise some means by which necessary works can be undertaken without involving the States in any financial trouble. Of course, in the case of New South Wales and Western Australia the difficulty could be easily overcome, because those States have plenty of revenue, and we could charge the outlay as transferred expenditure. The position of the other States, however, is a very has given me very great concern. This matter must be very speedily settled, because if we are to construct all necessary public works out of revenue, I shall be obliged to I do not submit additional Estimates dealing with that particular phase of the question. I do not wish to detain honourable members at any greater length. In making this 'financial statement 1 have felt that the Commonwealth Treasurer occupies an altogether different position from that of a State Treasurer. While I may have imduly trespassed upon the patience of honourable members. I have endeavoured to omit all the figures which I possibly could, because I have arranged that they shall be circulated in Mansard to-morrow morning, so that honourable members may have an opportunity of seeing how I arrive at the conclusions which I have drawn from them. Of course, the committee could accomplish attention io the printed Budget papers which have been circulated, but the task occupied me a considerable time, and in attempting it honourable members might possibly fall into error, and thus arrive at inaccurate conclusions. I therefore thought it wise to arrange that the details upon which I have based my conclusions should be fully set out in Mansard. I do not know that there are any other matters to which' I need refer. I am pleased indeed to have had an opportunity of making a second financial statement, and I .trust that the information which I have supplied to honourable members will be found useful to them. I invite them to fully investigate the figures put before the committee, -with a view to determining whether or not they agree with my estimates of revenue and whether they think that any further We had a very interesting saving can be effected in my estimates of expenditure. My colleagues and myself will welcome all suggestions which may be",49,Compared With Expenditure I N State
154,Sir George Turner,"offered with that end in view. I thank honourable members for the great patience which they have exhibited in listening to my remarks. A t no time is a mass of figures interesting, but I hope that the information supplied this afternoon will be found useful to honourable members, and that in the future, as in the past, our legislation will be upon such lines as will avoid giving to the States any just cause for complaint upon the ground of extravagant expenditure upon our part. perience I know full well that the States require every shilling that we can return to them. That is the sole reason why I some honourable members wish me to go, by advocating the construction of the whole of our public works out of revenue. If we adopt that course I fear that we may injuriously affect the finances of the States, and I ask honourable members to seriously consider that aspect of the question before they determine to reject the Loan Bill. I do not know that there are any matters to which I should have alluded, but to which I have omitted to refer. Should there be any figures which honourable members cannot understand by a perusal of the Ramard report of my remarks, if thej will be good 7 enough to drop me a note, pointing out their difficulty, I shall be only too pleased to supof money, most of which, I admit, is taken ply them with the fullest possible details, because I hold that it is the duty of the Treasurer to place unreservedly before the public all the information at his disposal relating to the financial position either of the States or of the Commonwealth. mitting his financial statement to-day I am convinced that the Treasurer might have been assured in advance that he was addressing a friendly audience, because honourable members on both sides of the House make no secret of the high opinion which they entertain of him as one of the guardians of the finances of the Commonwealth. I have never concealed my admiration of the right honourable gentleman in that respect, and although we sit upon opposite sides of the Chamber, I feel sure that I shall never have any occasion to alter the good opinion which I have formed of him. A t the same time it would be unreasonable to expect any one to follow the Treasurer now. heaven-born financier-and I do not pretend to be one-to at once grasp the mass of tabulated statistics which accompanied his speech. ' A t the same time. I thoroughly approve of the way in which he has sought, by means of those statistics, to give honourable members the fullest possible information in regard to the position of the public finances. They will be of great value to us when we have time to examine them. A t this late period of the present most trying session, I . do not intend to ask for the usual adjournment of the debate. From exUnder ordinary circumstances it should be adjourned for a week, but in view of the pressure of public business, I shall be perfectly content if the Government will concannot go the length to which sent to an adjournment until the day after to-morrow. I think that is a reasonable request. however, I may be permitted to make one or two observations. These will be brief, but, I hope, of importance. In the first place there are two ways in which to look at the enormous amount of customs revenue which the returns of the Treasurer disclose. We must not forget that the £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 do not represent any new gold-mine which has been discovered, and which enriches the country. It represents an enormous amount out of the pockets of the people of Australia. Under any financial system'some heavy drain is absolutely necessary, and' it would be very unfair to put the matter in any other light. But from our point of view, the principle on which this mode of collecting public revenue is based, is one which does not lead only to an enormous burden in the shape of direct taxation at the Custom-house. There is also an enormous burden caused by the extent, to which revenue is prevented from flowing through the Custom-house, thus enabling a large army of extortionists to fleece the people behind the shelter of high duties. These are matters which do not provoke us to any strong feeling of congratulation. We on this side of the House wish to giv6 the fullest credit to members who, though they did not belong to the Opposition, had a great deal to do with that to which I am about to refer. Those who joined, in a most praiseworthy way, in preventing tlie imI t would be impossible, even for a position of high taxes on a number of articles in common consumption, such as tea and kerosene, have now an absolute justification",50,Compared With Expenditure I N State

157,Mr Reid,"Even at the present stage,in the fact that, in spite of the public having been saved from this taxation, the revenue has been several hundreds of thousands of pounds greater than was expected by the Treasurer. who helped the Opposition to relieve the people of some of these heavy could have a more complete than the fact that, after having saved the public taxation, estimated at from £750,000 to £1,250.000, the money lodged in the Treasury during the lasttwelve months has been hundreds of thousands of pounds in excess of the amount anticipated. in itself is a subject of congratulation, at any rate to members on the Opposition side of the House. I donotwant to deal with this matter at any greater length at the present time, but to refer to other subjects which seem to call for immediate notice. Will the Treasurer be good enough to explain a singular omission in the financial statement? have had our attention drawn to various small items, but what word have we heard of the engagement entered into by the Prime Minister of this Government as to doubling the subsidy in respect of the naval squadron 1 had not been altered in this year's Estimates. ter, in Imperial Conference, agrees to submit such a proposal to this House, the Government are pledged to place the amount required on the Estimates of public expenditure. If the Government are bound to insert items in connection with a probable expenditure on a post-office, surely if they have entered on an undertaking to submit to Parliament a proposal in reference to the naval squadron, provision ought to be made for it in the Estimates. The Estimates are not an account of money actually spent; but should be a faithful statement of the money which is to be expended during the next twelve months. The fact that the Government have not put a sum on the Estimates days or weeks after they have committed themselves to the item at the Imperial Conference done. the case that the Prime Minister agreed that the Government of the Commonwealth would submit such a proposition to Parliament. It is a most undesirable state of affairs that the interests of the Commonwealth should have been dealt with in a conference, and that we in this Chamber should, be absolutely ignorant of what has been I do not suppose that those done. We must be a singularly tame body of representatives of the people if we do burdens not resent the secrecy which, is observed in justification reference to these proceedings. Isi t not a fact that some decision was arrived at ? member went to England as a Premier we had to wait until he returned for information. in EnglandI took up an attitude which did not compel me to submit such propositions, to the Parliament of New South Wales? If the Government have committed themselves to an obligation to the Imperial Government, they ought to let this Parliament know what that obligation is-wha t they We have agreed to submit to this Parliament. thing has been done. porters of the Government will say that they do not know what has been done, and, if they dared, they would say they do not I said the amount want to know. That is not the attitude that, fair-minded representatives of the people should take up. What was done at the conference does not affect merely tlie Prime Minister or the Government. The authority which enabled the Prime Minister to appear there was that given to him as the delegate of this Parliament and the Commonwealth. That was an authority exercised by virtue of his position as head of this House, and on]}' that authority enabled him to negotiate in the name of Australia. I am not now making any unreasonable request I asked the Acting Prime Minister this afternoon if he could give us any information as to any decisions arrived at by the Imperial Conference, and he could not; but he referred me to the newspapers, and said the Government were in possession of some additional details. But are we to receive our information partly from the newspapers and partly from Ministers? Isi t not right that we should have a proper statement from the Government as to what are the obligations into which they have entered 1 I . do not want to discuss the merits of any such obligation until the question is properly submitted fo us.

The Estimates are not a statement of our probable obligations, that is, if the Government intend to stand by what has been done by the Prime Minister. intend to abandon any promise made, all right; but we are entitled to be told about the matter. There is another remarkable fact to which I desire to refer, and I particularly desire the attention of the Treasurer and the Acting Minister for Defence to it, because an answer to the question I am about to ask may save a great deal of trouble. Treasurer and the Minister for Defence tell us that on these Estimates to-day a reduction of £175,000 has been effected in the military expenditure for the year 1 what is the meaning of the expression as to the saving of £175,000 ? mates this year are £175,000 less than the Estimates for last year, and that the promise made by the Minister for Defence was that a reduction of £131,000 would be effected. that £175,000 is made up. I could not understand, and neither, I think, could any member of the House understand, the statement made by the Treasurer that there is a reduction of £175,000. I was favoured with an advance copy of the Estimates which were laid on the table this afternoon, and I naturally turned to see how the £175,000 was arrived at. I find at page 132 of the Estimates that the total amount provided for the current year is £762,014. mated expenditure Sir expenditure. I compare the Estimates for this year with the actual expenditure for last year. friend. I find set against that proposed expenditure of £762,014 a statement setting forth that the actual expenditure for the year 1901-2 was £826,012, which shows a reduction of some £64,000. able friend is unconsciously falling into a mistake. mistake. by the Minister was that he would reduce last year's estimates-no t the amount of last year's expenditure-by £131,000.

Treasurer's own statement, in order to see how this saving of £175,000 i& made up. When listening to the right Do the honourable gentleman's speech a few minutes ago, honourable members believed that a saving of £175,000 had been effected in tlie estimated or actual annual expenditure upon the defence forces. Would any one have drawn any other conclusion ? I should think not. B ut I propose now to turn to the printed statements-and these statements are sometimes inconvenient as well as voluminousI said that the Estiwhich my right honourable friend laid upon the table when he delivered his Budget speech on the 8fch October, 1901. BeforeI quote from those statements,' I desire to follow up this matter a little I want to point out how further. I have before me the Estimates for the year ending 30th June, 1902, which were laid upon the table in April last. Those Estimates apparently show a total of £937,000, as being the expenditure of the Defence department for the year 1901-2. If we take the £762,014 set forth in the Estimates laid on the table of the House this afternoon, we see an apparent reduction of £175,000, because if we deduct £175,000. from £937,000, we have a balance of £762,000. I come now to a document Against that the total estiwhich discloses a puzzling state of affairs. If honourable members will turn to page 12 the Government in connection with the Budget speech delivered on the Sth October, 1901, they will find this heading :I thank my right honourable Statement showing the estimated balance to be returned to each of the States under sections 89 and 93 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. To get at that statement the total revenue from all the departments is given, and is set down at £10,339,750. The expenditure which had to be defrayed out of this revenue during the twelve months I do not wishfcomake any ending 30th June last is also given, and in that statement the expenditure for the Defence department is set down at £727,232.",52,Compared With Expenditure I N State

As a matter of fact, they appear to have'liked their whipping so much that they bettered their instructions. They were not asked fco save £175,000, but they got so fond of that sort of thing that they grovelled a little more. Honourable members will recollect the indignation of 1113' right honourable friend the Treasurer, and the remark he made at the time, which was heard by more than one, as to what his action would have been if he had been in a more responsible position. He showed what he thought oE the way in which the Government were being treated. The committee insisted upon a reduction to the extent of £130,000, and the Government liked the instruction so much that they have gone further by another £40,000. Either that has crippled our military defences economy. fences, at the dictation of a majority in a committee, is an act that no responsible Government should be guilty of. We have spent too many millions upon these military defences to have them reduced to a state of inefficiency because the Government have been frightened. They should try a turn of frightening the other fellow. When they found they were getting foncl of being frightened, they should have tried to frighten their supporters a little, and they would haA'e come round. If I had been in their place I should have given my supporters a little of what they gave Ministers, and they would have come round right enough. From a public point of view, I say that it must lead to a profound want of confidence in the financial strength and discernment of this Government, to find that whereas they put forward defence estimates in which they asked for £937,000, as being necessary in bad times, they now tell us that they have reduced that amount by £175,000. Will they tell us that the military service is in an efficient state, in spite of that reduction ? If they do they condemn themselves as having sought to spend an enormous sum of public money upon military display, and not upon military efficiency. efficiency is not maintained. still worse. As I said in opening my remarks, I have the most absolute confidence in the Treasurer. This is not a mere statement of to-day, because the way in which that right honourable gentleman managed the finances of Victoria during a trying time has always extorted my admiration. I say again that I would take his word against all the documents ever published. All I can say is that this return is very misleading. I do not desire to go into general matters connected with the financial arrangements at this time. But I shall' ask the Acting Prime Minister, in fairness to honourable members, to let us know before we go any further, what obligations the Government have entered into with reference to the naval squadron ? the' Government do not intend to enter into any during the next twelve months ? Because if that is so the Estimates are all right. because I do not ask the Government to provide anything in the Estimates for the twelve months if they do not intend to submit any proposition during that twelve months. ThoughI am perfectly satisfied' with the assurance of the Acting Prime Minister, I would still ask the honourable gentleman whether, apart from that, there is anything which we are entitled to know ? the right honourable gentleman shall have it. has ""anything else?""

247,Mr Joseph Cook,"Why should wetold us to-night that he thinks that he will give notice of a specific motion. He told us three weeks ago that he was going to submit the question definitely to the Cabinet. We understood that he was going to appoint these experts as early as he conveniently could. He does not say now that he is going to appoint experts, and he does not know yet what is going to be done. He proposes to allow the House to decide for him. This question has been trifled with for the last six months in a way that does not do him any credit. During that period he has told many stories concerning the selection of a site. A t every week end, when he goes over to Sydney, he has an interview with the press, and he leads the people of the State to believe that he is engaged in a death struggle with his colleagues over this very important question. But to-nightwefindthat he has put no definite proposition before the Cabinet. He does not know what he is going to do, and he only decides to-day that he thinks he had better to-morrow take some definite steps to bring forward the question, and let the House decide it for the Cabinet. Here is another instance of the way in which responsible government is carried on in the Commonwealth. We hear a great deal about the restoration of responsible government in Victoria. A tonic of that kind would do the federal Ministry no harm, especially in the determination of this federal capital question. I have been referring to the Minister's last statement on the subject in Mansard. On that occasion he definitely told the House that he was going to consult his colleagues at the next Cabinet meeting, but we find to-day that he has done nothing of the kind. An expenditure of £3,000 was authorized four months ago, and the experts were to be appointed immediately afterwards. the pulse of the House once more, the honourable gentleman says that he thinks he had better consult the House to-morrow as to what ought to be done. That will come as a bitter disappointment to the people of his State, who have been led by the honourable gentleman to believe that the question has been discussed and re-discussed in Cabinet, and that if he had had his way, it would have been settled long ago. He ought by this time to know what he is going to do. When the visit of inspection was to be made, he told us more definitely than he has done to-day what he was going to do. A t that time his policy was a clear one, but ever since it has been growing more and .more nebulous. The newspapers here keep tilting at this question of the federal capital, and asking that the seat of government shall remain in Melbourne, and the Minister seems to be succumbing to their influence. It is time, therefore, that the Minister for Home Affairs made up his mind upon the subject. If he cannot do so, he had better put an end to these weekly interviews in Sydney. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister for Home Affairs) I shall not allow the occasion to pass without replying to the vicious and uncalled-for statements of the honourable member for Parramattastatements and insinuations which were evidently made for the purpose of getting paragraphs inserted in the Sydney press. interviewed every week, as the honourable gentleman does. Sir WILLIAM LYNE If the honourable member for Parramatta had done one-tenth of what I have done to further this cause, he might have been justified in making the speech which we have just heard, and in writing the letters which appear weekly in the Sydney press complaining, amongst other things, that the Ministry have set down the Albury site for consideration. I regret that the Constitution does not require that this matter shall be dealt with as quickly as possible; but we must conform with its provisions, and I would point out that, even if a body of experts had been appointed, and had investigated the qualifications of the various sites, the question would not have been advanced beyond its present stage, because it must be patent to every one that it could not have been dealt with this session. It will not be ripe for dealing with until a body of exAfter feeling perts has inquired into the qualifications of the various proposed sites. of the matter being dealt with next session. want to move from Melbourne 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is the intention of the Government to appoint a body of experts to inquire into and report upon the various proposed sites.

It must be understood that I shall not allow experts to decide the question of policy connected with the location of the federal capital. That is a question for the Ministry and for Parliament to deal with. The experts will be asked merely to inquire into the suitability of the various sites, and to report upon them. The honourable member for Parramatta is not one of those who has helped to f urther the settlement of this matter, or who has assisted me to bring it to a head more quickly. He has rather caused delay and obstruction in connection with it .

Sir WILLIAM LYNE take any notice of the honourable member, because I am quite accustomed to his interjections. the same untruthful statement to the representatives of the Sydney press the other day. Sir WILLIAM LYNE laugh at what the honourable member says. When he was attacking me he could not help laughing, and I knew that he was speaking for the purpose of securing a little notice in the Sydney press. The honourable member said that I had not made up my mind, and that I did not know what to do. I think the honourable member is aware that that is not quite correct. He should have known that this matter has been under the consideration of the Cabinet more than once, and that as the outcome of their deliberations it has been decided that a certain number of sites shall be reported upon by experts. Minister stated that they were all to be reported upon. member is quite wrong. I stated this evening, when a question was put to me, that I T intended to give notice, of a motion. It was thought that we could economize time by allowing the discussion upon the' proposal to appoint experts to report upon the capital sites to take place in connection with the Estimates. Since then, I have been spoken to by several honourable members who desire to add one or two sites to those which have already been selected for report. In deference to their wishes, and in view of my statement that I would submit a proposal if it were desired, I intend to give notice of the motion which I read to-day, so that the whole question may be fully discussed. selected before we go into recess ? may not be selected.

TheI generally experts will occupy two or three months in making their examinations and inquiries, and another two or three months must elapse before their report can be presented to Parliament. The report cannot be ready before next May or June, when it is expected that both Houses will re-assemble. In view of this and of the fact that the selection of the site has been so long delayed, I shall ask the House to pass a motion in favour of the elimination of those words in the Constitution which restrict us in our selection of a site for the federal capital.

Supposing that a site were chosen now, where could we obtain the money with which to build the capital ? Sydney and Melbourne are the two great cities of Australia, and Parliament must meet at some place within easy reach of these centres. If the course I suggest were adopted it would result in an immense saving of money and in benefit to the community generally. We can scarcely hope to do anything with regard to the erection of the federal capital before the next general election, because we have no money available for the purpose. that we have £1,000,000 surplus this year. recess iu about three weeks, and we cannot possibly receive the report from the experts before next session. We shall not meet again until May or June next, and it is not likely that any action will be taken with regard to the federal capital . until towards the close of next year I should not have risen but for the stateTherefore the adoption of my suggestion would involve no loss of time. Personally, I have never entertained the opinion that the federal capital ought to be located in the wilds of New SouthW ales. I trust T that when Parliament re-opens next session the Government will see their way clear to give honourable members a free choice in this matter. If they do so, I feel convinced that a site will be .selected -within easy distance of the New South Wales capital. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) I certainly share the view that there has 'been an unnecessary delay in the selection of the \future federal capital site. In support of my contention, I would point out that four or five months have elapsed since the parliamentary inspections of what were regarded as eligible localities. It is perfect nonsense for the Government to tell honourable members that in the interim it has been impossible to obtain experts to report upon the respective claims of the rival sites. There has been ample time, not only for the appointment of a board of experts, but for their report to have been laid upon the table of the House. This is a matter which should have been dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity. The Government should have assumed the responsibility of narrowing down the choice of thesites already inspected to two or three. Certainly we should not be warranted in expending money to obtain expert opinion upon more than four of them. As matters stand, it is probable that the board of experts will not be appointed t ill a month or two after Parliament has gone into recess. Consequently next session will have opened before we are in possession of their report. As the general elections take place next year, honourable members will naturally be desirous of getting to their constituencies as early as practicable, and, as a result, the consideration of that report will be again neglected. It seems likely, therefore, that the term of the first Commonwealth Pailiamenfc will pass without any definite action having been taken in this connection. The Government appear to bo very reluctant to touchthe question, although it certainly ought to be above all party considerations. I trust that it will be dealt with in that spirit.

I hold that the Government propose to adopt an eminently proper course. No better method of securing its determination could be devised. But I blame them that the necessaiy action has not yet been taken. If the Minister for Home Affairs had asked Parliament some months ago to narrow down the eligible sites to about fivej with a view to obtaining expert opinion upon them, and that opinion had been received, it would not have been more than a week before the House would have been in a position to come to a decision upon this matter. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, nor with certain press organs, that the construction of the federal capital will involve an outlay of untold millions sterling. If I entertained that view I should be in no hurry to see the site selected, but by nursing the territory upon which the capital will be located, as well as the surrounding country, I hold that for a small initial expenditure wo can establish a model city. We should not be deterred from settling this matter by financial reasons. I trust that the Minister for Home' Affairs will submit a motion in the direction I have indicated at the earliest thus rendering useless all the expenditure possible moment. Let us confine our attention to five sites, and secure expert evidence Parliament. upon their eligibility. Undoubtedly in New South Wales and in the other States the feeling is growing that the Government are shelving this matter, and the only way to remove that impression is by proceeding upon the lines I have suggested. I trust that the cry for an amendment of the Constitution will not be raised before we have given that instrument of government a fair trial. I am satisfied that, with the exception of the financial provisions which will expire in a few years, experience will reveal that it will meet all our requirements. The very highest spirit which we can develop amongst the people of the Commonwealth is that of loyalty, to the Constitution. desire to say only a very few words upon this question, because I recognise that this matter can be dealt with when the motion is submitted. I endorse the statement of other honourable members, that since the inspection of the sites there has been unnecessary delay. I do not think the Minister is to blame for that, but if not he, the Cabinet is to blame. There have been opportunities to appoint a committee, which should now be at its work. But I recognise the danger that a committee, unless limited, might take such a long time over an inquiry as to render its report quite useless to this Parliament ; and that is a result we ought to try to avoid. I understand that the motion which it is intended to submit will deal with the appointment of a committee, as well as with the question of the sites. with the principle of appointing the committee, but does not name the experts to be appointed. cide the appointment of a committee to examine certain sites. time limit ought to be fixed.

The Minister for Home Affairs will testify that his colleagues have at once approved every suggestion he has made. The object of the Government is to have the question of the federal site finally dealt with b j ' the present Parliament. But I can assure honourable members that the consideration of various questions, such, for instance, as the choice of experts, is of such moment that to my own knowledge they have occupied the Minister for Home Affairs at such times as he could spare ever since the inspections by honourable members. To my knowledge he has been inundated with applications from all over Australia by persons claiming to be qualified ; and as this is to be an Australian commission, it has been necessary to make exhaustive inquiry with regard to the",61,Turner

I am also aware that the Minister for Home Affairs has been collecting information of every kind that can be placed in the hands of the experts, with a view to facilitating their task ; that information, so far from representing time and labour thrown, away, will materially accelerate the progress of the inquiries of the expert commission. I cordiallj' concur in the suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney, that a period should be placed to the inquiries of the expert committee. It will be necessary to pay its members, and to pay them well. They should give their whole time to the work, and be prepared to submit an exhaustive report by the date suggested. I am as hearty a supporter of the Constitution in this particular as is the member for South Sydney, and agree with that honourable member that the provision made in the Constitution, whether wisely or unwisely, is the one to which Ave should adhere and give effect. J think every one of my colleagues concurs that the earliest possible selection of a site is Avhat Ave should strive for. slightest obstacle in the Avay, but, on the contrary, to assist in the selection. In my opinion,, home, may be master in its own House,, this Commonwealth will not enjoy that entire independence of provincial influences Avhich is to be desired until the Parliament is housed in its own buildings on its own territory. As to the expenditure, my idea is that all. the provision needed for some time wil] be purely of a temporary character. The conception of a great city built of permanent material and of magnificent architectural design and proportions being constructed before we enter on our Avork there is to me preposterous. The CommonAvealth cannot afford to construct a palatial capital at once. The desire of the people has been for the selection of a site controlled in such a manner that it may, so to speak, pay for itself. There is certainly no need for us to delay our transfer until the magnificentand luxuriousaccommodationhas been provided for ns that some people have been pleased to picture. I hope that in the course of generations the Australian people, like the American, will be able to possess a capital city which Avill Avin the admiration of the civilized Avorld. But even the Americans, Avith their immense population and vast resources, have taken more than 100 years to partly accomplish their task. generations to provide a federal capital worthy of, and characteristic of, this great Commonwealth. Our concern IIOAV is to acquire at the earliest reasonable time, after Ave haA'e satisfied ourselves that we have made the best selection in empower, a site on Avhich temporary buildings may be erected in economical fashion to provide for AvhatI trust will be the short sessions of the future. We shall then, I hope, devote the session uninterruptedly to legislation, and having accomplished the business set before us, those Avho then represent the people may be able for the rest of the year to keep in touch with the parts of this great continent by which they haA'e been returned. To many present members that has been rendered impossible by our prolonged sittings. They have, after eighteen months' absence from their homes, ceased in a sense to be representatiA'es, haA'ing lost that intimate association with their districts which is so desirable for both representatiA'es and constituents. For every reason, therefore, it appears to be desirable that Ave -should hasten, as far as Ave reasonWe undertake not to throw the ably can, the selection of a site where the CommonAvealth Parliament entering its own prepared to accommodate itself in buildings, no matter how plain and inexpensive, so long as they fulfil the purposes for which they are intended. that we shall have another opportunity to discuss this matter more in detail Avhen the motion, which has been referred to, is submitted. I must say, however, that I think the Acting Prime .Minister was Avell advised in making the remarks to Avhich Ave have just listened, and in placing the position of the question fully before the electors, not only of Ne%v South Wales, but of the CommonAvealth generally. There has been a considerable amount of delay, and some suspicion has been created ; but I think the declaration of the Acting Prime Minister Avill do much to remoA'e any feelings of the kind, and bring about that proper understanding Avhich is so desirable on an important question like this. I am glad to know from the Acting Prime Minister's utterances that the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa-that there should be another referendum, Avith a A'iew to altering the Constitution-doe s notmeet Avith any We may safely leave it to future sympathy from the GoA'ernment. I agree",62,Turner
273,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I presumewith the honourable member for South Sydney that it is our duty to interpret the Constitution as it is sent to us, and not to devise means to alter it . An y alteration which may be found necessary should come from the electors, and certainly the people of New South Wales, who are so vitally affected, should have a say on this question. The Constitution has been accepted by a majority of the electors in that State, and, so far .as I am aware, there has been no movement in favour of ' any such alteration as that indicated by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. Personally, I think it would be very ill establishment of the capital. I think that advised, on the part of this House, to try and force on the electors anything in the nature of the suggested alteration. I am very pleased to hear the declaration of tlie Acting Prime Minister that it is the intention of the Government to have this matter settled as speedily as possible. I agree that a good deal of useful and valuable information for the assistance of this Parliament can be obtained by means of the committee proposed. been already gathered. agree that it is not desirable to remit to the committee the whole of the sites which have been under discussion. Only those sites which have some special claims for final consideration by this House should be investigated by the experts, and every effort should be made fco have the inquiry completed in time for the question to be settled next session. In my opinion, the matter should be taken into consideration early next session, so that the House may have a reasonable opportunity of considering it in its different phases and arriving at a proper conclusion. This House has already given some attention to the matter, and considerable expenditure has been incurred in connection with our inquiries. If the question is delayed until after next session, the probabilities are that it will not be dealt with by this House, but will be remitted to a new Parliament, and we shall not be able to bring to bear that personal knowledge which the House as at present constituted should possess as the result of its investigations. [ understand that the Minister for Home Affairs proposes to deal with the question by way of motion, but I think it would be advisable for the Government to submit it in such a way that the merits of the different sites may be reviewed by us. I also think it would be advisable for the Government to appoint the committee, or to inform .the House of its proposed personnel by the end of the session. Authority should .not be given to the Government to appoint the board after the session closes, so that Parliament will be debarred from criticising the appointment. I am pleased to learn from the declaration of the Government that it is not intended to enter into what some people describe as the expenditure of millions of money in connection with the the lines foreshadowed by the Acting Prime Minister are the best, safest, and the most acceptable upon which to work. Some of the suggested sites already possess the nucleus of fetfclement and railway conveniences which would form a suitable beginning. If one of those sites were selected, the city might be gradually built up on the lines Suggested by ,the honourable member for South Sydney, and the territory used as a means to raise funds towards the has construction of the capital. What is. desirable is that at the outset the city should be properly laid out so that it may be built to design. I trust that the board of experts will be appointed before the session closes, and that it will have definite instructions to report to this House at the beginning of the next session, so that we may then be in a reasonable position to deal with the question. quality more than another which' I admire in a politician, it is that of consistency. My honourable colleague, the honourable member for Kennedy was complaining just prior to the recent adjournment of the House, of the amount of expense which an election would occasion to the 'Commonwealth. Now, he turns round coolly, and wants to put the State from which he comes to an expenditure of millions of money. It is idle for any honourable member to say that we should choose a site and build a federal city merely for the sake of 1,000 or 2,000 people. I have been over twenty years in the bush, and I am satisfied with Melbourne. Melbourne will remain the place of meeting of the Federal Parliament as long as my vote can assist to that end. The honourable member for Canobolas cares nothing about the expenditure of millions when such an expenditure is likely to benefit his own electorate, but when the",63,Turner

Where is his consistency? I , for one, cannot see it. If . the question were of such importance as honourable members from New South Wales would lead us to believe, one might reasonably expect that they would be here in f u l l force when it was being debated. How many honourable members from New South Wales are present tonight? Not half-a-dozen. Yet this is a question of great moment to New South Wales, involving the expenditure of millions. Honourable members from that State are quite satisfied as long as they can get thenspeeches into Hansard and make the people of New South Wales believe that they are kicking up a fuss about the federal capital. in the House at the present time. am viewing this matter in the same way as the honourable member for Canobolas and the honourable member for Kennedy regarded the question' of the .cost of the federal elections. Each State will have to bear its proportion of the cost of building the federal capital. said Queensland would have to pay millions. events, before the question is settled, it may cost Queensland millions. I am not going to see the State which I represent robbed for the advantage of another. I am quite happy and contented here. We could not be better off than we are now, even if we were meeting in a federal city. We have everything that one could desire. Of course the Melbourne climate does not suit me, but if the Federal Parliament meet only in the summer months, I shall be very well satisfied to remain here. I do not imagine that we shall be here for another session of the length of the present one. I hope such a long session will never again be experienced. Philp is going to jerk all the Queensland members out, so that the question does not affect us very much ; but, so far as I am concerned, the seat of government is all right where it is. When we have plenty of money-whe n all the States are on the upgrade, and have a few millions to spare, it will be time enough for us to begin operations. We are very good lodgers, and the people know when they have good lodgers. The only reason why I say we should remain where we are is that the forming of a new capital may involve an expenditure of millions. Everyone knows the position of Queensland. . It is suffering from over-legislation, from drought, and from too much "" tick "" : in fact it is chronically insolvent at the present time. MrL . E.

The honourable member knows very well that we do not propose to part with the lands of the federal capital to begin with. If he knows anything about the growth of a big city, he ought to' know that the increase of land values alone will speedily overtake the entire expense of establishing the capital, wherever it may be. I regret to hear that, according .to the honourable member, Queensland is in such a terrible condition. He told us something very different about that State a month or two ago. He said he could assure this Parliament that Queensland did not want its sympathy, because she was in an admirable position. Now, he tells us that Queensland is bordering upon bankruptcy, and he does not know what will happen if the seasons do not quickly change. I sympathize with the honourable member and the State he represents to the fullest, extent, but I have been rather surprised to hear him talking .in the way he has done to-night. If there has been in this Chamber an enthusiastic advocate for the removal of the federal capital to New South Wales, it has been the honourable member for Maranoa. I am not sure that he has not been the most enthusiastic member in the House upon this -question. Time and again we have heard him declare that he would be glad to get out' of Melbourne, and get into New South Wales. AH at tented to settle down in Melbourne. This is evidently one of his moods and tenses. I do not know exactly how the moon is just now, but I do know that the honourable member is assuming some very strange attitudes upon this particular question. I tell him again that the removal of the capital to the honourable New South Wales, and the establishment of a modern, up-to-date federal capital need not, under proper business management, 3ost the State of Queensland, or any other State of the group, a single penny of additional expenditure. Now, with regard to the Government, the Acting Prime Minister has made one of his soporific speeches, in which he has completely satisfied honourable members on my own side, and there is therefore not much use in my saying more. That speech has apparently done a lot of good. Every one on this side has said that he has been pleased to hear it . But I again say, as I said before, regarding the honourable gentleman's speeches, that I regret that honourable members on my side should be so easily pleased with them. I almost feel myself guilty while I hear him speak. The honourable gentleman has the faculty of making this world appear the very best of all possible worlds to live in, this Parliament the very best of all possible Parliaments to be in, and of suggesting altogether that our surroundings and environments leave, nothing to be desired.

I trust that if we are going ment will put everything aside, and meet to sit on Saturday aud Monday there will be the House on both occasions.

It is with. the Electoral Bill from the Senate. travelled 500 miles to attend to-day, when we might as well hare stayed at home. We have only given an audience to the Treasurer, and, of course, we have obtained some information from his statement. I protest against this way of conducting the business. We ought not to have been called upon to travel all that distance. did riot send down the Electoral Bill that we have to adjourn. I had hoped that it would have been returned. been called upon to travel such a long distance, and then be asked to adjourn shartly after the dinner hour. This is not the first time that it has occurred. On several occasions we have travelled long distances, only to find that there was no work to be done.

340,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I desire to enterfederal capital site has been introduced at the last moment. If the Minister for Home Affairs will ask leave to. proceed with the motion of which he has just given notice it can be dealt with to-night. If the Acting Prime Minister is so zealous to got on with the business, then in order to deal with the Electoral B ill straight away to-morrow, let us settle the question of the federal capital site to-night. This zeal on the part of the Government is displayed at a late period of the session. If it hod been manifested eight or ten months ago no doubt we should have been in recess now. It is no' amusement to me to be here. I would much sooner be amongst my constituents. No honourable members are more anxious to bring the session to an end than are those who come from the distant States. I am only too anxious to assist the Acting Prime Minister to get on with the business. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I quite agree with the proposal of the Acting Prime Minister. I hope that we shall sit not only on Fridays,' but even on Saturday morning if necessary, and on Monday. It will take three weeks at the outside to dispose of the business. Honourable 'members ought to be willing to make a little sacrifice. I daresay that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, will be able to make the necessary arrangements to stay, which he was unable to make because he was not aware that it was intended to sit later this week. I hope that the suggestions of tlie Acting Prime Minister will be carried out. I believe that if the House would make up its mind to deal with the business it could be 'disposed of within three weeks. I would ask honourable .members to consider the position of those who come from the north and the north-west of Queensland, because after next month it will be almost impossible, if we are going to have a wet season, to get anywhere near our constituents until next March. Question resolved in the affirmative House adjourned at 8.50 p.m.",69,Adjournment Extra Sittings Prorogation
