Anyway, the minister ran a million miles So those are the existing transfer-offrom this recommendation and many of the business provisions. Had the government had other important ones we talked about a real problem with them as they apply to yesterday. Just consider the situation that Queensland state sector employees, they Premier Newman has to face. Yesterday, we could have done all this before 2007. They saw a story that said that the individual in did not tell the Australian people or the IR Queensland's top bureaucratic job in the final community, by the way, that they were months of the Bligh government pocketed reinstating old law in the transfer-of-business more than a million dollars in less than a provisions.

I am not suggesting that this Queensland state employees because they individual would be in trouble in terms of stuck to the principle that, unless a finding another job, because they probably jurisdiction has referred its rights in this have plenty of savings.

We would never dismiss the difficulties and obviously, from the action that has had that employees face. But what we would like to be taken there, in New South Wales-a to see is governments that make it easier for public sector workforce that is crying out for those employees to pick up another job and restructuring. Whenever you see a gap make it easier for employees to keep the job between the same task performed by the they have with a new employer. Give those Public Service compared to the private employees the right to choose-to say, 'I service, and you see the additional cost might stay in my same occupation. My terms loaded onto the Public Service, alarm bells and conditions might be different, because should ring, because that is not going to lead the previous terms and conditions were to efficient operation, either of the sector that unsustainable. But it is my choice.' This we might be talking about or of the state takes away employee and worker choice. economy as a whole. I will now sum up some key facts left out I will reflect on just one example from my by the minister. Queensland and New South own electorate of Farrer. I do not really want Wales public sector employees are not to mention water in the context of this billcovered by the Fair Work Act because there is a lot of discussion about water in the successive state Labor governments decided House at the moment-but the water bailiffs not to refer their powers to the that are employed by private irrigation Commonwealth. How about respecting that companies do pretty much the same job as decision? Labor's transfer-of-business regime the water bailiffs employed by the New leaves workers and employers worse off, something that has been admitted to and contractor would be required to meet all addressed in Labor's own Fair Work Act existing employment entitlements. In review. Another fact is that Labor's own essence, this is the government imposing modelling projects 4,200 full-time jobs to be their own employment framework onto the shed from the federal Public Service, with private sector, taking away the private further modelling showing federal Labor will sector's ability to choose what terms and cut more than 12,000 employees by the end conditions of employment they offer their of 2014-15. So it is okay if the federal own employees-and, obviously, all within government cuts its Public Service but not if the confines of the Fair Work system and a Liberal National Party state government under current modern awards. does it? Similarly, in Tasmania the GreensThis is a push from a government that ALP alliance is shedding jobs-big time, completely misunderstands the landscape. I when you consider the size of the Tasmanian am thinking of examples where contractedeconomy. We know that that is because of out jobs might apply.

AndI know So, if you listened to the minister on this many do, such as my own state government subject, you would think that only the in New South Wales. The logical group to coalition cuts jobs in the public sector. I take on that work probably is the charities think the minister needs to remove those sector. We know that the charities sector rose-coloured glasses and get up to speed does a great deal with very little. But I do not with what his counterparts in the Labor know that the charities sector could take on states-when they were Labor states-were the wages, terms and conditions of public up to, even in the state of Tasmania. sector employees. The fact that the nonUp close, this legislation is alarming. All profit sector has other things they can offer employees, should they meet the criteria, an employee-such as fringe benefits tax will be eligible to transfer their existing exemptions that flow on to salary sacrifice terms and conditions of employment opportunities, because of their charitable regardless of whether or not the status-just does not count. It does not get redundancies were voluntary and regardless offset anywhere. So again you might find of the generosity of the package. that, in the move from state government to Furthermore, the government has confirmed private provider, the employee is not that that the transfer of business from a state much worse off because they end up with a government to a private sector employer, for set of terms that are different but are still not the purposes of this act, is for changes from a that bad.

However, if any of these I said that the coalition will be opposing people were to work for the new contractor this bill.

We look forward to something more sensible coming question of whether this is more of a political through from the government when, in the matter than a matter of substantive protection other place, it has an opportunity to being offered to those workers. reconsider its own legislation.

Secondly, its than just grab the headlines. It is time to take substantive effect will be to make workers a serious look at whether the shift that was worse off.

As I have pointed out, and as other As has been pointed out to the House, coalition speakers have pointed out, there is there does appear to be something of a a yawning contradiction between the contradiction between the bold actions of the minister's so-called bold actions here and his minister in this case and the minister's failure to take action in other situations. shrieks of silence when, in its 2011-12 That is a powerful piece of evidence that budget, the previous Queensland Labor what the minister is engaging in is a pure government introduced redundancies to piece of politics. His actions are redolent reduce staffing by 3,500 positions over 2011 with contradiction, but perhaps that is not to 2013. There were similar shrieks of surprising for a former national secretary of silence from the minister, this apparent bold the Australian Workers Union who is also an defender of state public servants, when the old boy of Xavier College and also a former South Australian Labor government son-in-law of a Liberal member of announced it was reducing the Public parliament. Service by 1,400 positions. And in Tasmania The next proposition that I want to put to there will shortly be 2,300 Public Service the House this morning is that the actions workers made redundant due to actions taken that the minister has taken through the by that state Labor government. legislation that he is introducing are in substance going to make workers worse off. Proposed section 768AK of this bill Let us analyse the effect of these provisions. describes something called a copied state When a worker is made redundant from a employment agreement. That copied state state government department, that worker employment agreement will apply by will in quite a wide range of circumstances operation of the law to the employee as that find himself or herself in the position such employee goes to work for the new that, when they seek employment with a employer. The practical consequence of that private sector employer, the previous terms will be that private sector employers of conditions will attach to them and it will considering employing somebody who has not be open to a private sector employer to this particular albatross around their neck are employ that worker unless those terms and likely to conclude that the potential conditions apply. That is so regardless of employee is not somebody they wish to take whether the redundancy was voluntary or not on. Instead, they will choose to take on and regardless of the terms and generosity of somebody who is not subject to those the redundancy package. particular terms and conditions. In other What is more, it is clear-and the words, we have a bill before the House that government has confirmed this-that the is going to impose upon a certain class of transfer-of-business provisions will apply at people who have been made redundant by a a whole-of-government level and not just at state public service a set of terms and an individual departmental level. Let me conditions that will bind a certain class of explain what that means. If it is the case that employers who might be considering taking the department of education has engaged in them on. The effect in substance will be to an outsourcing process but an employee make those individuals less attractive to from the department of health is made future potential employers. A recent survey redundant and seeks employment at the of human resources managers conducted by organisation to which the department of the Australian Human Resources Institute education has outsourced certain activities, indicated that 37 per cent of respondents then that employee will also be subject to agreed that the transfer-of-business these transfer-of-business provisions. The provisions had a negative or very negative effect will be that redundant public servants impact on business. seeking employment with private providers The third proposition that I would like to will potentially be disadvantaged. put to the House today is that this is a poor What is more, as the government also has piece of policy. In arguing that point I would confirmed, if a private employer refuses to like to quote from an article written recently employ a redundant public servant because by former Keating government minister Gary of the transfer-of-business provisions, then Johns. He wrote: that person is not in a position to do anything Bill Shorten not only delivered the Ben about that.

It is motivated by a Shorten wants to protect state public service political stunt of the minister, a former union entitlements where a state government outsources work or sells assets to private-sector employers secretary, wanting to appear a hero.

That is a good analysis of the impact of this to speak on the Fair Work Amendment When you analyse the relevant provisions (Transfer of Business) Bill 2012. It is hard of this bill, including proposed section for me to find my feet. You could have 768AD, the test as to whether there is in fact knocked me over with a feather when I a connection between the old state employer found out that the member for Bradfield does and the potential new employer is extremely not support this legislation.

When you go Australia's history, precisely because of the through the facts, when you look at their carbon tax. The government says, 'Look, a modelling, when you analyse the real world, lot of the price pressures were built in the carbon tax is an electricity tax that is beforehand.'

191,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (16:58,"IThursday, 1 November 2012 Calare Electorate: Thales Small Arms Factory Calare Electorate: Army Reservists defence industry in Calare. Last week I attended celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of operations at Thales Small Arms Factory in Lithgow. There are not many members in the House who can boast a factory in their electorates which has produced arms for our troops posted around the world. But in Calare we can be proud that our part of the world is home to a factory that has produced one million weapons to equip our men and women on the front line for a century. The Thales Small Arms Factory was opened in 1912 in Lithgow due to its proximity to a steel mill and its distance from the coast and potential enemy attacks. The factory's first job was an order to build 20,000 303 rifles for our Defence Force, and in every conflict Australia has been in since soldiers have carried weapons made in Lithgow. Lithgow Thales now employs 140 people, around 12 per cent of the local workforce, and is currently producing the Steyr being used by the Australian Defence Force today. It is incredible to have an industry like Thales in my electorate and I congratulate all involved on a fantastic 100 years for what started off as the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. It was very disappointing that, following the high of this event, a bitter disappointment for local veterans and their families was brought to my attention. I was contacted by local veterans organisations angry at news they would not have reservists attend their Remembrance Day service. They had been advised that Army reservists would not attend commemorations in an official capacity due to 'challenging fiscal times'. That was terrible news for such an important event. Due to these funding restrictions, I am told, training days for Army reservists have been slashed by 27 per cent. Without any shadow of a doubt, those opposite are to blame-not the Defence Force, whose obvious priorities clearly must lie with the training and equipping of troops on the front line. But this government is spending $20 million advertising a failing National Broadband Network scheme. It makes it pretty hard to swallow when they can fund that but they cannot fund reservists on the 11th of the 11th.

The $5.68 million Commonwealth government investment includes three new classroom complexes, a canteen and building refurbishments. Like so many other BER announcements across the country and in my electorate, Keysborough Primary's facilities offer first-class, open-plan learning spaces, allowing for a change in the way our children are taught. Old, standard square classrooms have been replaced with flexible open areas that allow for interactive, communal and individual learning. Over $100 million has been invested in schools in my electorate under the BER program. Principal of Keysborough Primary School, Margaret McKenzie, could not have summed it up better when she said: Our BER project and the wonderful facilities we now offer help ensure students in the local area will have access to a high-quality sustainable educational future in buildings appropriate to 21st-century learning. Investing in education and our children's future is a hallmark of our Labor government. That is why we have established the schoolkids bonus and that is why our government is committed to improving school education through the National Plan for School Improvement. I would like to congratulate Margaret McKenzie, students, parents and teachers for ensuring this project was a resounding success. On 18 November car and truck traffic on one of Melbourne's most important roads, EastLink, will stop as thousands of cyclists ride in Hanover ConnectEast Ride for Home. The ride will help raise funds to get homeless kids back to school and help their parents find safe and sustainable housing, education and employment opportunities. I will again be participating in this year's 75-kilometre ride. Last year more than 7,000 riders came together to raise a record $318,000, and this year Hanover has set an ambitious but achievable target of $450,000. Recently the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Brendan O'Connor, and Hanover Chief Executive Officer Tony Keenan joined me to launch this fundraising campaign and to hear how donations will support the excellent work that Hanover does. Our government is committed to supporting those most in need. Since Labor came to government an unprecedented $5 billion has been invested to challenge homelessness along with $15 billion in housing programs.

195,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (09:36,"Last week I was proud to be involved with the launchMinister Howard. I know the work we put in for years and years to try and get Labor interested in a project that I described in February 2004 as 'no other single endeavour that would support the vitality, the viability and liveability of our community'. It has proven to be true. We have got a feeway rather than a freeway, but that crucial piece of infrastructure is there. It was almost deja vu: we had the same battle with the Frankston Bypass. Again, the state Labor government refused to engage on the crucial need to make sure that the Mornington area and the southern peninsula could connect to the infrastructure to our city, to places of work, to where we learn, and to make sure our community had livelihood opportunities reasonably within reach. It was a grand battle to get the state Labor government interested in that-$150 million needed to be put on the table by the coalition to get the state Labor government to be interested. Now that project is well advanced and will be supporting our community. South East Water is coming to our city as their headquarters, consolidating their operations in Heatherton, Dandenong South and Lynbrook. We are seeing that vision of an Australian Technical College get moulded and shaped to Labor's liking, but still we are making progress on that issue. So there are many things going on-lots to love in our city. I thank the member for Isaacs, a notorious passenger on these issues, and you can always count on him to turn up for the glory pic when everyone else has done the hard work. We have got more opportunities ahead of us but more challenges-the infrastructure challenges we need to continue to focus on; and extending the Frankston rail line, so we get a proper park-and-ride service in and around Baxter to work with the Frankston Bypass. The reality that a steel coil will now be imported by rail from Port Kembla into Hastings is going to put further pressure on the Frankston rail line. I think we need more sections of third rail where commuter trains can work their way around those industrial and those commercial freight trains-important in both respects-but we need to find a way to make sure it is quick and attractive to travel between the city and our satellite city. Finally, the green army-what a crucial contribution they make to the natural attributes that are part of this 'lots to love about greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula'. The coalition has made some commitments in that area. We can partner with the local community that loves our natural environment, and the green army will support that endeavour. Franklin Electorate: MoneySmart Week and Saver Plus Program Ms COLLINS (Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (09:39): I want to talk about a visit to my local primary school, Rokeby Primary School, in my electorate during MoneySmart Week in September of this year. For many people MoneySmart Week is a week when we have a close look at our everyday expenses and learn about simple steps which can make a big difference to finances. My visit to this school also gave me the chance to hear about some of the work the Smith Family is doing in and around Hobart and its suburbs, particularly through the Saver Plus program. For those people that do not know, the Saver Plus program is run by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the ANZ and of course the federal government. It offers eligible people a chance to meet their savings goal. So if they manage to save $500, it will be matched through this scheme. It allows them-for eligible purchases-to be able to assist with some of the costs, for instance, of a particular holiday or a laptop for their child to go to school. It is a really great program. The important thing is that their priorities are their own in terms of what they save for. It was a great time for mums, dads and the kids to actually talk about what are the priorities. They had mums and dads there running workshops as well. I had the opportunity to play some games-financial literacy games-with the students and of course talk to the students about how many of them are saving and what are they saving for. It was a great day indeed. They responded with things about saving for a family holiday, saving for an electronic game-of course, that was very popular-but it goes to show that children in our schools right across the country and out and about in my electorate are aware of the importance of saving for important things. The Saver Plus scheme for their parents is also a good way in which we can help them achieve their savings goals. We offer a range of services. The Smith Family offers-funded also by the government-emergency relief, financial counselling and money management, and also the no-interest loan scheme by Good Shepherd Microfinance, which the government funds with the National Australia Bank. It is also an important scheme to help low-income earners, and those loans are an average $800 to $1,200. The government is funding a range of programs to help vulnerable and low-income Australians, and MoneySmart Week was a great opportunity to actually highlight some of those. I particularly want to thank Verity and Alison from the Smith Family for running the games and the workshops on the day in MoneySmart Week, particularly for the work they do right across the state of Tasmania with their Saver Plus program, working together with the ANZ Bank. I also want to thank Tracey Johnston, the principal of Rokeby Primary School, for hosting us that day, and to the wonderful students that were able to play the games and talk about some of the important decisions that they are making every day about their finances and to give them an understanding of the decisions that their parents make. Forrest Electorate: Cancer Council Relay for Life Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (09:42): This weekend the Cancer Council's Relay for Life in Bunbury in the south west will celebrate its 10th anniversary and will almost certainly pass the $2.2 million-mark for total funds raised in the past decade. It is an extraordinary feat for a regional community and one that brings the community together. Everyone that is involved in this really should be applauded. It is quite clear the relay has been embraced by thousands of people. It is truly something special and it is all for the fight against cancer-a cause which sadly touches all of us. More than 2,500 people will be at the opening ceremony on Saturday to begin what is really the biggest 24-hour party to conclude a year of fundraising. The teams will have themes, and I cannot wait to see some of those. The Bunbury event is the second-longest running relay in WA and has been the state's second biggest in terms of fundraising in the past four years. It has grown because of the hard work of the volunteer committee, a core group of about 30 teams and of course very generous support from the community. Some of the proudest people at the 10th birthday celebrations will be former Cancer Council members Wendy Maslin and Margaret-Anne Canet-Senior, who were fierce in their commitment to establish the Relay for Life in Bunbury. In the second year, Wendy recruited team coordinator Jo Trench and catering coordinator Michael Bell, who are still with relay today. Kym Ashby kept momentum growing during her three years as chairperson. Her successor, Russell Donovan, has been involved for nine years now with the Summit Stars Team entered by Summit Realty South-west. This team alone has raised $450,000 for relay by this weekend-a truly remarkable effort. All funds raised by the relay stays in WA to help regional areas. The Cancer Council has a very proud history of community involvement and reducing the incidence and impact of cancer. Each year more than 2,000 new cases-that is why we need this-of cancer are diagnosed in regional areas of Western Australia. I want the Relay for Life to continue to grow and to capture the community's imagination and passion, and at the very end actually make a real difference to people's lives for many more years to come. I know that there has been some very innovative fundraising. There has been a masquerade wedding dress ball, and this weekend we are going to see blokes 'rocking their frocks' at the Relay for Life. Hands Oval will be the epicentre of the Relay for Life this weekend. I am looking forward to it and I know the community will support it, as they have done to date. Vietnam: Human Rights Oxley is distinguished by a range of fantastic communities. In particular, it has a large and very important Vietnamese community which spans the western suburbs of Brisbane. Like many people in Australia, they are passionate about human rights and concerned about the well-being of others. In particular, as you would expect, the Vietnamese community are concerned about human rights back in their country, so I regularly take the opportunity to lend my support and my voice to that cause. I have spoken on these matters a number of times and written to either the embassy here in Canberra or the Prime Minister of Vietnam highlighting the cases of dissidents, democracy activists, freedom-of-speech activists and even musicians and artists who have been jailed for pursuing their right to have a voice. Again, unfortunately, I need to come into this House and raise these issues to bring them to the attention of the Australian community, the parliament and the Vietnamese government. Two activists and musicians, Vo Minh Tri, better known as Viet Khang, and Tran Vu Anh Binh, were convicted and received jail sentences for composing songs critical of the Vietnamese regime. The songs the men penned were critical of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and the response of the Vietnamese government to the Chinese claims. Both men were arrested and detained in late 2011. Vo Minh Tri was sentenced to four years jail and two years under surveillance. Tran Vu Anh Binh received six years jail and two years under surveillance. This decision has been described by an Amnesty International representative as part of a 'very disturbing trend of repression against those who peacefully voice opinions the Vietnamese authorities do not like'. Vo Minh Tri had uploaded his songs to YouTube and they went viral, showing that the regime is struggling to control the new medium of social media. It meant they had raised too much concern. It seems almost incredible to us here in Australia that anyone could be arrested and jailed for doing something as simple as writing a song or voicing their view-a right that we treasure in this democracy and this parliament. Whether it is in Vietnam, in China or in any other part of the world, people ought to have that most basic of human rights-to be able to express their own view in a peaceful, non-violent manner. The reality for the people who live",141,Constituency Statements
196,Mr Ripoll (Oxley,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:45): My electorate ofin Vietnam is that these things are a daily occurrence. I very much understand and sympathise with the views of the Vietnamese community in my electorate when they want people here to speak up on their behalf and on behalf of their families back home. (Time expired) Maranoa Electorate: Resources Sector the development of the resources sector in my electorate, particularly in the Surat Basin, and the new job opportunities that is bringing into the communities, particularly for young people, who in the past have been our greatest export from western Queensland to the cities, where they go in search of jobs. We now have an opportunity for young people to get jobs that pay well so that they can remain in our communities of western Queensland, close to their families. With the growth, of course, come great challenges. I will give you a snapshot of the sort of growth that we are seeing in the Surat Basin with the development of the coal seam gas industry and the coal industry to follow. My own home town of Roma three years ago would have had 10 flights into the town a week. We are now getting 55 flights a week, largely with the fly-in fly-out people servicing the development and the growth in the construction phase of the coal seam methane gas industry. But this growth is going to continue, because there will be people permanently located in these communities once the construction phase ramps down. There will still be significant numbers of people remaining-subcontractors and the people who continue to develop and manage the resource areas in the Surat Basin. The Western Downs Regional Council-in a town of 1,700 people-recently had to release 1,200 housing blocks. Those towns have not seen growth like that ever. They have got to build 500 houses per year for the next four years in one community alone to cater for this extraordinary growth, creating job opportunities and of course wealth for this great nation as well. There has been a failure to plan for this growth in the past. I refer now to the Warrego Highway and the corridors that are needed for this expansion that is just unprecedented in our communities. We have got to see a four-lane highway constructed from Toowoomba right through to Chinchilla. The Warrego Highway goes through the town of Dalby and it is not unusual to see 50, 60 or 70 trucks lined up at the lights going through the centre of Dalby, mixing with the local traffic and children returning from school to their homes. Tragically, in the last three weeks on the Warrego Highway, we have seen two people lose their livesbecause of this extraordinary growth. I want to see my LNP government in Queensland and the minister responsible to start the planning for an alternate route through Dalby and upgrade not only the highway immediately between Dalby and Oakey to four lanes, and passing lanes at least, east and west of Dalby through to Chinchilla. It is a frustration, I am sure, that adds to people's anxiety from time to time. I am calling on the government to plan for future growth(Time expired) Calwell Electorate: Bhutanese Community Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (09:51): I represent a very diverse and very rich multicultural electorate. Like most members-and some have spoken here today-I am very familiar with the challenges migrant communities face when they first settle, certainly in the suburbs of the federal seat of Calwell. Successful integration into the broader Australian",144,Constituency Statements
197,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Second Deputy Speaker) (09:48): I want to talk aboutcommunity and successfully carving out a better life for themselves and for their families is very much the narrative of the Australian migrant story. It is for this reason that I want to speak about the Bhutanese community, which is one of several emerging refugee communities in my own electorate of Calwell. Over the period of time since settling in our local community, the Bhutanese community has adjusted I would say successfully to the Australian way of life. Their participation in our community has progressed now to such an extent that they are themselves in a position to begin making their own unique contribution to the broader community in which they live in and they very happily call home. Very recently, I wrote a letter of support for the Bhutanese Organisation of Australia to receive funding for their annual festival, called 'Celebrating Multicultural Victoria in Harmony'. I am very pleased to inform the House that my community has received a $5,000 grant and that this coming SaturdayI am going to have the great honour of being their guest at this very wonderful and newly emerging festival in the federal seat of Calwell. When one takes into consideration that the Bhutanese community are, as I said, an emerging refugee community, one has to say that they have come a very long way. They have done so despite many of them having spent many, many years in UNHCR refugee camps. They have been victims of torture since their eviction from Bhutan, especially from 1990 onwards. They are people who have come to this country with a whole experience of hardship and difficulty-stuck in camps, as the member for Chifley rightly says. Many of them have settled here under our humanitarian program. The festival that I will be attending on the weekend is their contribution-a contribution they are very proud to be making-to the Australian community. It is a festival about harmony and about sharing. One thing that I want to say about the Bhutanese community is that they are the most gentle of people and, unlike other communities, they are not very aggressive in their pursuit of grants. They feel very, very privileged to be receiving assistance from us. Our aim is to teach them how to lobby effectively. I am very proud to be involved in that process. I look forward to attending the festival on Saturday. (Time expired) Gippsland Electorate: Mardan Hall Centenary Celebration writes so beautifully, wrote about the Mardan Hall centenary celebration: In its glory days, 400 people would dance the night away at balls at the Mardan hall. Sometimes there were two orchestras, one at either end of the roomI know, Deputy Speaker, you are identifying with everything I am saying at the moment, because you know country communities like I do. She continued: When the first took a break, the other band would start up providing continuous music. At 3.00 a.m., revellers would retrieve their horse and cart and travel home … this could be many miles away. This little country hall has retained its place at the heart of the Mardan community, and on 27 October it celebrated its 100th birthday. I was there as one of the participants. Built in 1912, the hall was used for meetings and celebrations such as weddings and birthdays, but during the war years the hall had a more sober duty. During those years, it was the place to farewell and welcome home local soldiers. Since then it has been used as a public library and for indoor bowls. The grand old hall, the cornerstone of a proud community stands",145,Constituency Statements
198,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (09:54,"Jane Ross, a craftswoman of great ability whoas a testament to all those who have come before-the people who through wars, depressions, droughts and Gippsland's long, cold wet winters saw the potential of the fertile farming land in the area in which the hall is built. Mr Mackey MP, a member of the state government at the time, was meant to open the hall on the day in 1912, but government business kept him in Melbourne. In his place, he sent his wife to open the hall. Mrs Mackey was apparently very, very impressed with the country hospitality and the spread laid out-which I might say was just as good last weekend. The ladies of the Red Cross catered-and put some weight on me! Ms Ross went on to say: When the hall was opened a bevy of white-clad women served a sumptuous banquet. Timed for 5.00 p.m. and peppered with many toasts, it was all cleared away by 8 for a night of dancing. Congratulations to Committee President Robert Gray, who emceed and spoke at the end of the night, and Faye Marshman and Karen Anton, who did an enormous amount of work, along with the rest of the community. My lovely staff member writes here, 'Oh, if those hall walls could speak.' Well, something wonderful happened. There was a singer to sing our national anthem, and he had bemoaned to me the fact that we were not singing God Save the Queen. When the piano accordionist came up, I whispered in his ear, 'After we finish the national anthem, we're going to sing God Save the Queen as a surprise to the singer.' The hall shook and trembled as we began to sing, 'God save our gracious Queen,' and everybody felt it was just like that moment in 1912! Stroke who had come to Canberra to participate in a stroke forum. Kevin is a stroke victim and Pat, although having a full-time job, is Kevin's wife and carer. They were in Canberra because, like so many other people throughout Australia, they understand the daily struggles of stroke victims and their families and wanted to contribute to the national forum. Kevin and Pat believe much more could be done to lessen those hardships. Stroke can affect any person at any time. On average, in Australia, there is a stroke every 10 minutes. One in three people die within a year of having a stroke. Almost one in five people who experience a stroke are under the age of 55. Strokes are responsible for one in 10 deaths in Australia. When a stroke occurs, steps can be taken which will make a huge difference to their residual effects. Most importantly, there needs to be much greater awareness that, when a stroke occurs, every minute is critical to the level of recovery. Every minute of delay before medical assistance is provided causes more damage. We need to create greater awareness of risk factors and how to immediately recognise the signs of stroke so that medical assistance is not delayed. There needs to be the right medical treatment at the hospital and opportunities for appropriate rehabilitation programs afterwards. And there needs to be more at-home support and easier-to-access information about support services that may be available. This was a point that Pat and Kevin stressed to me: finding out what help is available and where to get it is very difficult. The effects of stroke are inevitably life changing for both the victim and the victim's family. Stroke victims are often left with a disability, but they are not disabled. Many of them continue to work or volunteer their time, as does Kevin Sleeman. However, most require support from family members. That in turn places additional demands and stresses on home life. Over the years I have interacted with stroke victim support groups throughout my community. I am familiar with the barriers and difficulties",146,Constituency Statements

I understand the difficulties they have not only in their mobility and getting around the community but also in getting to the services that they quite often require. I understand very well the huge demands that places on family members who are in most cases left to care for them because they love them dearly and because they are the ones that are closest to them. That in turn totally changes their way of life. We have indeed come a long way over the years in responding to strokes, but there is still much more that we can do in terms of both medical treatment and research into the kinds of treatments that might be available and the services that can be provided. I will bring those concerns, on behalf of the Sleemans and so many other people that have suffered a stroke, to the attention of this parliament. time for members' constituency statements has concluded. Afghanistan Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the document. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (10:01): It is a pleasure to expand upon the Prime Minister's comments and the further information that was provided by the Minister for Defence in relation to our deployment and our mission in Afghanistan. We understand that this has been a long haul for the Australian people, who always remain curious-as they should be-and interrogative about our mission, our objectives, and the likelihood of success of our investment of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. I know of course that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, will be very interested in these issues because of your commitment to the Australian Defence Force and your proud record of supporting and serving our men and women in uniform during your time in government. It is wonderful to be able to relate the progress that has been made by our people in Afghanistan. I have talked before about some aspects of that, but I want to emphasise today that people should not misunderstand what this process involves at the moment. Although it is called transition, people should not assume that it is a retreat or that we are running for the exit and abandoning Afghanistan, and there will therefore be the risk that all of the good work that our people, and indeed many other colleagues in uniform from around the world, have done will be undone. That is not the case. We have certainly learned a lot of lessons in this country over a history of quite often being given responsibility in provinces such as Phuoc Tuy and in the Bai province where I was in Somalia, in Al Muthanna in Iraq and of course now in Uruzgan in Afghanistan. We are seeing an overall international or national situation deteriorate around us after all our good effort but we are determined-and I am very proud and pleased to say of course that the coalition is also determined-to make sure that that effort does not fall into the same category. We are committed. This transition is about the mission objectives in the first place. The mission for Australian security forces-whether it be the AFP or the ADF-in Afghanistan is to make ourselves redundant. We do not want to build dependency. The",147,Constituency Statements
200,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"In accordance with standing order 193, themission is entirely about ensuring that the Afghans could take control and take responsibility for their own destiny. That is what we have been aiming for. In my various trips to Afghanistan and the briefings that I have had both in Australia and in Washington recently I have been pleased at the progress that certainly we have made in relation to 4th Brigade in Uruzgan, but I have also been very pleased to see the progress that has been made by the Afghan National Army in general throughout Afghanistan. One of the most important things to understand about our mission is that we must build an attitude within the Afghan people themselves about taking control of their destiny and the confidence that they will have in their own security forces and institutions. A very detailed study by the Asia Foundation-the most detailed analysis yet done in Afghanistan-has been produced recently. I was fortunate to receive a briefing by David Arnold, President of the Asia Foundation, in Washington recently at the Pentagon. The statistics were extremely revealing. The overwhelming majority now of Afghans do not support armed resistance to the Afghan government. There is very strong support of course-around 83 per cent-for continuing efforts in reconciliation for those elements that are opposed to us or who engage in conflict with us who are not of the extreme ideological variety with whom there is an unlikely negotiated outcome. Effectively, the challenge there will morph into a counter-terrorism type of regime and response requirement. We have greatly degraded over time the ability of the forces we oppose to conduct subunit level attacks and assaults, and so the ability of the Afghan security sector in the future will mostly be reacting and responding to terrorist-like incidents. The progress of the Afghan National Army has been recognised by the Afghans themselves in the study that I mentioned-93 per cent of Afghans said that they felt the Afghan National Army was honest, fair and improving in its competency, although they acknowledged that some level of international support was still required, which was also a good thing. But their attitudes to confidence in the delivery of services by the government was increasing dramatically in relation to education and water. Improvement in their faith in the rule of law is pleasing to see. There is still great concern in relation to issues of corruption, unemployment and some aspects of the delivery of electricity, but their confidence in the central government and at provincial level was high, although there are still some concerns at the municipal level. It was also pleasing to see what the study revealed about their attitudes to gender issues and the status of women in Afghanistan, which I know we are all greatly concerned about. In that respect, they indicated that they were overwhelmingly in favour of women getting educated, participate in the political process and being able to vote. The one area where there is obviously room for improvement is their attitudes to women in employment, and that can partly be seen as a factor of the high levels of unemployment in Afghanistan, which is still an issue. Overall, the attitudes are along the right track and greatly improved and a good outcome of the investment of all of our efforts in Afghanistan. In particular, I know a lot of people are focused on women's issues, and our effort has been unstinting in that respect. We will recall that women suffered greatly under the Talibanthousands of sex slaves, 70 per cent of the teachers in the education system were women and were all thrown out of the system, which effectively destroyed it. They were not able to be educated. They were not able to be employed. They were subject to brutal punishments such as stonings where a hole would be dug and filled up to restrain them to the shoulder and head level. It was very prescriptive in the way they would be dispatched in that they could not be executed quickly. The stoning had to be drawn out so that a maximum amount of suffering would be imposed before a coup de grace was delivered. We have also seen that attitude illustrated in the recent horrific incident of the attempt to kill Malala Yousafzai, an incredibly brave young schoolgirl, which has focused our attention on exactly what this is all about. It is great to see the moderate Muslim world uniting in one voice against these medieval attitudes, which are quite often based on traditional attitudes and completely fly in the face of the Koran. I think it is going to galvanise the international effort to continue to oppose these extreme ideologies. In Uruzgan province, Australia has helped construct 227 schools, including 39 girls' schools, and I was privileged to visit the Mala Lia Girls School, which is doing great things320 girls have been engaged in community education. We have helped 500 women participate in literacy groups. We have helped 80 per cent of women in Uruzgan receive at least one antenatal visit-and this is really important in the context of the high level of deaths in childbirth. We have trained 30 female master teachers, and these trainers are training a new generation of Afghan women teachers who will be vital role models and mentors for girls in the future. We have committed $17.7 million to tackle violence against women and invested heavily in training midwives, including 44 female health workers in Uruzgan and 25 women who have been involved in new midwifery schools as well. This is really pleasing to see. I know this is an issue of great concern to Australians. In relation to the completion of our security task in Afghanistan, the reorientation now is-as those who understand the military environment will know and the member for Fadden, who is here with us today, will appreciate this-we have been through a phase where we had an urgent security, on-the ground threat that needed to be tackled, getting boots and guns out there to tackle a high-level threat. But the ultimate objective is to build the structures that sustain a security force: the key enablers, the key command and control, the logistics and support environment and the training regimes that will support the growth of an effective and professional security force into the future. Our focus now reorients to build that regime, that structure and those enablers. We will be putting a lot of effort into the training of the command and control capacities of the 4th Brigade, the 205 Corps, and we will also be looking to assist in the continual improvement of the two Kandaks that relate to combat support and combat services support. For those who are uninitiated in those, the combat support area will deliver intelligence, communications and combat engineering capabilities; and combat services support will be the key logistics enablers of transport, maintenance, servicing, health services and the like. These are the things that give a force capability and confidence, and enhance and amplify their ability to operate and grow into a professional force. That will be our focus from this point forward, which means that our people will be less exposed as they pull in from patrol bases and forward operating bases back to the more secure and safe facilities of Tarin Kot. That does not mean that they will be completely free from threat-unfortunately, Private Sher was one of those victims of indirect fire. There will always be that risk, and any movement always comes under threat of improvised explosive device activities and actions. They will not be completely free from threat, but the threat will be slightly diminished. We have flagged that we will be pursuing engagement with Afghanistan in relation to their special force needs. It is reassuring to see the professionalism that their own special forces are achieving-the Wakunesh,the NDS. We had very good reports on their capabilities when I was last in Afghanistan so that is encouraging. The international community has been willing and enthusiastic to provide ongoing special forces support, notwithstanding that conventional support is being withdrawn or is transitioning. The capability and the support will be there to provide our Afghan partners with the confidence that we are not abandoning them. In addition to that, as people who understand counterinsurgency know-and I have spent my entire military career immersed in counterinsurgency, written much about it, and one of the reasons I got into politics in the first place was the establish the Australian Civil Military Centre to enhance our approach to counterinsurgency-the equation is usually a 20 per cent security challenge and an 80 per cent social-political-economic challenge. As we move forward, with the Afghan forces taking the lead role, our investment and engagement will reflect that. So $100 million for three years for the security sector, but we are building to a $250 million a year commitment in that social-economic-political space. It is absolutely critical that the 2014 elections go well, but we also want to make sure that we are investing in governance, rule of law, education and the economy. One of the best areas you can invest in, in that respect, is in the building of roads, because this enhances people's ability to get to health services, their economic activity and security response times. It generates employment and it is harder to disguise and embed IEDs and the like-that is obviously going to be a valuable area. We will have to put a lot of work into making sure that our road dollars are landing effectively and well-there is no doubt about that-and there remain ongoing risks and threats to success through levels of corruption, bedding down better governance and getting the political infrastructure and regime ethos to grow and mature properly in the way that we would like. As has often been said, we are not looking to transplant a Westminster or Jeffersonian democracy. What we want is a stable government that is on a maturing track towards a better and more acceptable political polity and social and economic environment. Our engagement in that sphere will be for decades to come but, hopefully, our security task is nearing the end of its most intense involvement. Also, of course, from my personal point of view, now that we have equipped them to conduct straight military operations and exercise military skills, I am now looking, as we are moving into more of a Defence Cooperation Program type relationship, to also start addressing issues to do with their ethos and levels of own conflicttheir human rights training-across the security sector spectrum. We cannot just relax in that respect as they conduct independent operations. It will be important for us to have confidence, for the Australian people to have confidence, that we are engaging with security forces that respect the rule of law, that respect the code-of-ethics approach that modern professional warriors must always have when they take to the field. That is to sustain both domestic support to win that hearts and minds battle on the ground in Afghanistan and to give the international community confidence that they can support these security sector forces. I am very confident that we are on the right track, but there are no guarantees. For a success it means we must stay committed and engaged, and I welcome the fact that we have that unity across the parliament in respect of this great challenge. It is in our national interest but it is also just the right thing to do. the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, in providing a response to the Prime Minister's statement on Afghanistan. Having just returned from my fourth time into the Middle East and my fourth operations brief in the J3 at Al Minhad, it is a great pleasure to provide comments on this. We are now in what I call phase 7 of combat operations in Afghanistan. For the sake of history, it is important. The post 9-11 phase 1 of our operations commenced in October 2001, when we sent a combat operations group to defeat the Taliban and government, ending in 2002. Phase2 was what I call 'the hiatus', from January 2003 to July 2005, where literally we had two uniformed officers in Afghanistan-two men-rotating through the United Nations and land mine clearing operations. Phase3 was a Special Operations Task Group phase from August 2005 to June 2006. Australia re-entered the conflict. The government announced that, at the request of the Afghan government, the US and allies, we would deploy a force of approximately 150 personnel for 12 months to undertake security tasks similar to what we did from October 2001 to the end of 2002. Special Operations Task Group, based primarily around the Special Air Service Regiment, was deployed on 24 August 2005 and, of course, in March 2006 an Army CH-47 was deployed. From July 2006 the task would change again-mission phase 4, the Reconstruction Task Force, the RTF. On8 May 2006 the 1st Australian RTF for Afghanistan was announcedabout 240 personnel. On9 August the government announced an additional 150 people would be deployed to augment the 1st RTF. It quickly began a whole range of 'backyard blitz' projects to build faith and demonstrate effectiveness. A major redevelopment of the Tarin Kot hospital occurred, as did an all-weather causeway. Trade training schools were put in place, likewise airstrips at Tarin Kot were built. On 10 April 2007 Prime Minister Howard announced further special force troop rotations, and by mid-2007 to the end of 2007, phase 4 with the Reconstruction Task Force numbered about 1,000 personnel. At the end of 2007, of course, the Rudd government came and we entered phase 5. The Reconstruction Task Force mission changed to the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. On 19 February 2008 the new defence minister, Joel Fitzgibbon-that is three defence ministers ago-announced the government would maintain its current commitment but would place a new emphasis on training the Afghan National Army. US President Obama's election victory further reinforced that mission change from an open-ended US commitment of troops to a mission of training Afghan forces and leaving the country when they were ready. On 29 April 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that MRTF1, Mentoring Reconstruction Task Force 1, would increase from 1,100 to 1,550. Incidentally, though, that increase included no extra bayonets-no combat troops on the ground. Phase6 of our mission began when the Dutch withdrew after the collapse of their parliament regarding their Afghanistan involvement. On 23 June 2010 the then new defence minister announced that there would be a new structure for the US-led mission in Uruzgan province, which was the Combined Team-Uruzgan approach. Now we enter phase 7. Not only are we commanding the Combined Team-Uruzgan, but, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, our task of mentoring has now changed to advising. Lieutenant-Colonel Trent 'Wobbler' Scott, who is the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion",148,Ministerial Statements
201,Mr Robert (Fadden) (10:16,"It is my great pleasure to follow my friend and colleague,of the Royal Australian Regiment will soon take his men and women out of combat operations in the coming weeks and hand over to the 7th Battalion. 'Wobbler' took in 750 men as part of the 3RAR Task Group which was to mentor the Afghan forces. His job was to ensure that their mentoring was complete and they were ready for independent combat operations. Accordingly, yesterday, 'Wobbler' handed over the third-last forward operating base and by the end of November he will have handed over the last two operating bases. 7RAR will have 300-odd fewer soldiers-about 450 in total-and their job is to advise. They will not be living out in the badlands outside the wire of TK in forward operating bases. Within the next three weeks we will have abandoned every one of our forward operating bases. Only the Afghan forces will man those 30-odd forward patrol bases, forward operating bases, out in the various valleys of Chura, Mirabad, Baluchi and so on in Uruzgan province. Those 450-odd men of the advising force of the 7RAR Task Group will be behind the wire in Tarin Kot, advising the Afghan 4th Brigade on the conduct of independent operations. It is interesting to reflect that since June 2010 government ministers have made 54 statements, including yesterday, dealing with the time line for withdrawal from Afghanistan. The past and the current Chief of Defence Force have made eight statements. From 2010 to early 2012 all of these statements set out a path to 2014 as the eventual withdrawal date. This changed in February this year, when Minister Smith spoke of a withdrawal date of 2013. He backed this up with his comments on 9 February, 24 May, 31 May, 17 July, 16 August, 9 October, 11 October and yesterday. Of the current Prime Minister's 15 statements on a withdrawal date, they all framed 2014, except for her comments on 23 May, when 2013 was set as the date-backed up yesterday. Likewise, the current CDF, General Hurley, has made four comments that have all set 2014 as the withdrawal date, except for his comments on 28 May, where he used the same time line as the Prime Minister had used five days earlier of 12 to 18 months, representing a drawdown of our forces on May-November 2013. That drawdown has commenced because, by the end of November, the 7RAR Task Group, whose mission is to advise, will not be engaging in sustained combat operations in partnership with Afghan forces as the 3rd Battalion or the 3RAR Task Group, which leaves in a few weeks time, was. The only force disposition outside the wire effecting a kinetic impact upon our enemy will be the men of the Special Operations Task Group. This change in time line to a withdrawal date of May-November 2013 is now being reflected by that force disposition on the ground. We will also see, of course, a further up tempo logistics effort. As we wind down now from combat operations and partnering with Afghan forces in the badlands and move towards an advisory role for independent operations, we will ramp up our logistics effort as we seek to bring home something like $3 billion worth of equipment from a country that is literally landlocked. This will require extensive movements by air and extensive movements by land, which will of course necessitate the opening of the Pakistan-Afghan border to effect that quickly. This will be one of the greatest logistics exercises we have done since Vietnam or, indeed, since World War II. We are entering the time now of the 'loggies'. The Special Operations Task Group, made up of men and women of the SAS regiment and the 2nd Commando Regiment, with augmentation from the 1st Commando Regiment, will be the prime force disposition to engage kinetically with the insurgent forces we face, to disrupt and dismantle their enemy command, control, communications and IED networks. This number will generally reduce over the non-fighting season but will increase again across the fighting season. On a separate note, 60 to 70 RAAF Air Defence Guards are being sent to Tarin Kot as we speak to bolster the security of Tarin Kot and replace the existing Slovak forces that have been providing this capability. The government has indicated that, from the withdrawal of our combat troops in 2013, there will be a fourth disposition that will remain, of which it enjoys the full support of the opposition. An SOTG element will establish or remain until 2014 and depend upon the command structures being envisaged under NATO has the propensity for longer engagement. The government has agreed to assist the Brits in the Afghan officer training institution that the Brits call 'Sandhurst in the Sand'-which I think is a misnomer: it should be 'Duntroon in the Desert'-which we think is a fabulous idea in terms of continually supporting and training their officers. I would encourage the government to continue to keep the command of the Afghan National Army Artillery School in Kabul under Australian command. We currently have something like 200 embedded officers at US command levels at either the ISAF joint command level or the ISAF level. The coalition's view is that a range of those embedded officers should continue until such time as those US headquarters draw down, and post 2014, if there is a NATO headquarter replacement, we should continue to engage strongly in that headquarters as well as keep a current two-star level J5 appointment, which is a Plans appointments, where we currently have a two-star as the J5 on the ISAF IJC. For those reading this, if you are not up on your military acronyms, that is the Head of Plans for the three-star corps level headquarters, which is actually running the operation, which is the ISAF Joint Command Headquarters. I would also encourage the government to maintain our air liaison officers for the US in Qatar. We have a ship in the frigate on its 29th rotation. We have had that ship there since 1991. I would encourage the government to maintain that ship as part of the counterpiracy work that is being done there, working in concert with our allied forces. Of course, we have logistics and headquarters staff in Dubai at our forward mounting base at Al Minhad. Again, I would say to the government that it is our strong contention that we do not-now or ever in the foreseeable future-abandon our forward mounting base in Dubai, Al Minhad. We need an administrative footprint on the ground from which to sustain and maintain our operations in Afghanistan and the littoral region. Our relationship with the government of the UAE, and especially with Dubai, is exceptional. It is a strong working relationship. We exist on that base in concert with other nations as part of the coalition of the willing, and the government should do everything that it can to ensure that we retain that footprint as our forward mounting base. As always, the government enjoys a very strong bipartisan support from the coalition-a support we have been very strongly committed to ever since the government changed in 2007. The government can expect a very strong bipartisan commitment from the coalition. I thank the government for its continual support. The point I have made continually as the senior shadow for Defence in the House of Representatives is that bipartisanship is not a blank cheque. It requires strong engagement by the government, high levels of trust, and high levels of access-all of which the government has provided-signified by the joint visit to the Middle East last week by the Minister for Defence Personnel and me, where all of the briefings were joint, including the current ops brief at a classified level, and I thank the government for that. contribution to the mission in Afghanistan in a different place. I want to begin in East Timor on 29 August of this year. Along with Senator David Bushby, I was in East Timor as part of the parliamentary engagement with Australia's military forces. We were posted as part of the Australian mission for a period of days. On 29 August, we were at the forward operating training facility where Australian forces, along with New Zealand and American forces, were training the East Timorese military. They were teaching young Timorese soldiers critical physical skills in terms of engineering, road works, maintenance works, machinery works. They were also teaching young Timorese soldiers and the officer corps about broader soldiering skills relating to peacekeeping, interaction with civilian communities, the laws of war. During the course of that morning, a Kiwi officer came in and gave his commiserations. He was the first to pass on the message that three Australian soldiers had been killed due to an insider attack in Afghanistan. The deaths of Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Private Robert Poate and Sapper James Martin were sadly added to on the same day when subsequent news came through of the deaths of Private Nathanael Galagher and Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald, who were killed in a helicopter crash. That day turned out to be a very bleak day for Australia, for the Australian forces and, most particularly, of course, for the friends and family of these five magnificent young Australian soldiers. When this news came through, the room I was in contained a number of Australian enlisted soldiers and officer corps members. Many of them had served in Afghanistan. One was an extraordinary warrant officer who had recently been cross-posted back from forward operations in Afghanistan to East Timor. This gentleman was not only one of the most impressive Australian soldiers I have ever met but one of the most impressive Australians I have ever met. He had served in many of the most difficult front-line operations in Afghanistan. We did not know the names of those who were lost at that time, but, because they had been doing exactly what he had been doing in Afghanistan, he knew that it was highly likely that at least one, if not all of the three, would have been known to him. This warrant officer, who was described by a senior officer as one of the 'princes' of the Army, looked at Senator Bushby and me, and said: 'Gentlemen, we know the risks of what we do. We understand the dangers, but we believe in the mission intensely, passionately and deeply and it is our choice to do these things. Please take back the message to the Australian parliament that this terrible loss should not be the basis for retreat.' At this moment, I am in small measure giving honour to his words. He was speaking on behalf of the Australian enlisted soldiers not just in East Timor but also in Afghanistan. It was a profoundly important moment, because, at that moment of tragedy, one of those who had been at the absolute front line still expressed his deep, profound belief in the mission. I have no doubt that that warrant officer was speaking on behalf of the overwhelming majority-I presume virtually all-of the Australian soldiers posted abroad at this moment. He had a sense of deep, personal commitment to the mission on the basis of having been part of the mission, having seen what is being achieved and understanding the deep strategic context. I now want to turn to a second experience. That was five years ago, on 12 October 2007, in the lead-up to the election. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,",152,Ministerial Statements
202,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10:28,"I want to begin this reflection on the Australia. I had the sad but extremely profound honour of representing the Australian government at the fifth anniversary of the Bali tragedy. I was in Bali with the Australian families. Five years on, the grief of those families-and my understanding is that 202 people died, including 88 Australians, as a consequence of the first Bali bombing-was still raw, their emotion was still high and their resolution to attempt, to the limits of human endeavour, to ensure that the events of Bali were never repeated remained firm. The commitment I made and the commitment the Australian government made-and it did not, and I mean this in the best sense, matter whether it was a Liberal or Labor government; the commitment was made on behalf of both sides-was to continue the push to ensure, to the extent of our ability, that Australian citizens are safe no matter where they are. That brings me to the three points I want to make about the Afghanistan mission. I want to speak at the strategic level, I want to speak about the progress which has been made and then I want to speak about the future. I have referred to my recollections from five years ago of the event I attended marking the Bali bombings 10 years ago. We also recently marked the 11th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York. The strategic context of these events is a push by al-Qaeda and its affiliates and those within the Wahhabist movement for an Islamic caliphate. They are deeply unrepresentative of the great Islamic faith around the world. Indeed, many would argue that they are antipathetic to the broader movement-even heretical. It is offensive for anyone to presume that theirs is a representative view. Nevertheless, from that sliver, the push is for a caliphate. That means the political goal is to take, in the medium term, one of the great Islamic states-Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan or Indonesia. The mechanism for doing that is to destabilise and to assume control of part or all of Afghanistan. That was the status of the Taliban and its relationship with al-Qaeda prior to 11 September 2001 and subsequent coalition operations. Since that time, the strategic underpinning of al-Qaeda has been progressively undermined. It has been eroded both through public activities and through the close quarters work undertaken in Afghanistan. It is has come at a terrible price to the coalition as a whole and to Australia in particular. The 39 Australian soldiers who have lost their lives, five of whom I have referred to in particular today, have paid the ultimate price and their families are the true victims of this defence of Australia. But, 10 years ago, who would have imagined that the US homeland would have remained effectively free of any further attacks? In the context of September 11, you would have thought that the United States was almost certain, over the following 10 years, to have suffered other major terrorist attacks or a dirty bomb. The same could have been presumed for Australia. We did see Madrid and London. They were early additional activities by al-Qaeda and they were indicators of a much grander design. But the constant activity in Afghanistan, in Iraq and through homeland security in Australia, the United States and across the Western world-as well as activities in states such as Indonesia, where there has been tremendous co-operation-has largely undermined the capacity of al-Qaeda for forward operations. It is not gone; the threat remains. But the threat is significantly less than it was and it is certainly dramatically less than it might have been had we not engaged in these activities. That is the grand strategic context. The human side of this, which is the progress, is that in Afghanistan today what we see, to quote the Prime Minister, is that 'all of the provincial capitals and 75 per cent of the country's population are in areas now where the Afghan National Security Forces lead on security'. So they lead on more than 80 per cent of security operations and make up more than three-quarters of all uniformed personnel in the country. That transition is what we are engaged in now. That is the security success, and the security success has led to human success. In Uruzgan province, where the Australians have primary responsibility, we have seen a six-fold increase in the number of schools operating-again, to use the Prime Minister's facts-and a tripling in the number of active health facilities. That is real. Health and education and security are dramatically better. There will be difficult days in Afghanistan once the coalition draws down and there will be a continuing role over many years, but our primary security operation will pass over the next 18 months and we will have small support operation but we will have effectively drawn down. That is the right thing to do. But it is this process of transitioning the whole of the country and then knowing it will be an imperfect time. That then takes me to the forward side of things. Over the coming five years, it will be the progressive draw down. Firstly, in the next 18 months, will be the maintenance of backup in terms of a special operations provision to assist with particular crises. No group of Australians has done more on the front line than our special operations forces, who have literally been the best of Australia that we could hope to present. Then we will have the development role of encouraging and supporting the Afghan National Army and the police force. There will be internal difficulties, but those difficulties are part of the process of giving them the best chance of being the most independent and the most stable and secure that they can be. It will be a long and imperfect process over 20 and 30 years. But, going forwards, that is the only way that the country can aspire to a degree of internal stability, which will allow the health, the education and the personal opportunities resulting from the dramatic and radical transformation of much of the country, which was under the thrall of almost medieval leadership in the Taliban, into a modern state which will be going through a long period of development. We look to the way in which Indonesia has been a beacon to the world in managing democracy and a range of religions but in a situation where it is, essentially, a successful Islamic state. I praise Indonesia for their cooperation. I set that out as a model in terms of the long-term direction for Afghanistan. Above all else, I thank our soldiers for the extraordinary commitment that they and their families have made and I extend my bipartisan support to the mission and those views as to the long term. Afghanistan. I welcome the opportunity to acknowledge another year of military operations in Afghanistan and to honour the difficult and dangerous job that Australian forces are undertaking there. I thank the Prime Minister for updating the House on the many aspects of Australia's successful contribution to Afghanistan's progress to transition, particularly in the Uruzgan province, where transition began this year on 17 July. Australia's 4th Brigade has been taking the lead on security operations in that area, and more recently Australia assumed command, on 18 October, of Combined Team-Uruzgan. In 2010, the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the International Security Assistance Force, in conjunction with the government of Afghanistan, came to the agreement for Afghanistan to become solely responsible for its security by the end of 2014. In terms of Australia's withdrawal from the region, I understand that the Prime Minister expects that transition should take between 12 to 18 months to occur, after which the vast majority of",155,Ministerial Statements
203,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (10:43,"I rise to support the Prime Minister's statement onAustralian troops will return home. Now after three months since the commencement of the transition period this expectation remains the case. I echo the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, who noted that: Australia went to Afghanistan with our allies and we will leave with our allies. By committing to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, we are not abandoning them but we will leave knowing that our training, anti-terror role and capacity-building projects made a difference for Afghanistan and its people. A worrying development is the continuing increase in green-on-blue attacks by Afghan soldiers and police when conducting joint operations. Regretfully, Australians have been the victims of this ruthless tactic by the Taliban which aims to reduce the effectiveness of Australia's relationship with the Afghan military. As a result, NATO has suspended joint operations with Afghan military personnel, and I understand that NATO is continuing to vet personnel and monitor the situation more broadly. These attacks do not, however, affect Australia's commitment to a safe and secure Afghanistan. In August, I was fortunate to be involved with the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program to visit Afghanistan and experience the conditions first hand. When Australia does leave Afghanistan, our Defence forces will leave with their heads held high. I point to the many key contributions Australia is undertaking in Oruzgan province, including the construction and opening of many infrastructure projects: roads, schools, health and education facilities, and river crossings. These projects greatly improve the lives of, and capability for, the local people and assist in the delivery of the Afghanistan International Security Assistance Force's counterinsurgency strategy. I have spoken on many occasions in this place about the enormous contribution our servicemen and women make, from my maiden speech to the many condolence motionssadly, far too many-to the simple recognition of the debt and obligation that we as a nation owe to so many brave Australians. I speak as someone with strong personal connections and commitment to our Defence forces. Most importantly, I speak as the federal member for the electorate of Ryan, which includes Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera which recently welcomed home another 300 soldiers from the 7th Brigade on 24 October and previously welcomed home around 1,000 soldiers from Afghanistan, including the 7th Brigade. I was honoured to acknowledge our troops at both of these welcome home parades, most recently with the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison AO, and Brigadier Greg Bilton CSC ADC, Commander of the 7th Brigade. On 25 September, I was also honoured to represent the shadow minister for defence, Senator the Hon. David Johnston, at the farewell parade hosted by the 1st Brigade at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. On that day, we farewelled 400 personnel from 1st Brigade, including my son, who were deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Slipper. This marked an important opportunity for family, friends and the wider community to formally farewell their troops. We welcome those days when our troops return to Australia alive and well. However, we have also observed in this place the deaths of the 39 Australians who have lost their lives during Australia's fight in Afghanistan and, importantly, the many who have suffered physical and mental injuries. An obligation to these fine Australians and their families is an enduring one. They must know that when they go into battle on behalf of our nation we are with them, and our support thereafter will be steadfast and strong. It is the least our nation can do. Most recently, fallen combat engineer Corporal Scott James Smith returned home to his family and comrades in Australia-another proud Australian who the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison, recognised as, 'a fine young man and a great soldier' and who recognised his sacrifice in serving his country. If we take a step back from Afghanistan, as we look both to the present and future of the Defence Force, and particularly the domestic Defence Force industry, we see many worrying signs. Over the weekend, the Australian government released the Asia white paper, which stated that: The effective management of a number of regional flashpoints will become increasingly urgent … and Managing competing maritime and territorial claims will be particularly important In that context, I worry that we are not funding the Defence Force appropriately to deal with future security challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. This year alone the government cut $5.5 billion and, since coming to government, has cut $25 billion from the Defence budget. The government's cuts mean that Defence spending is at its lowest level since 1938-at 1.56 per cent of gross domestic product-and next year it will drop even further to 1.49 per cent. These are shameful figures from this government. If we look at the present situation, those in the military have taken the very rare move of speaking directly to the public about what those defence cuts mean. Recently, the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison AO said: We are approaching a point where doing more with less risks becoming a cavalier disregard for the ability of forces to survive against credible peer competition. We do not want to send our troops on operations if they are not properly equipped and supported by the Australian government to do the job. I remind the House that these cuts will have an impact not just today but in 30 years time. Prior to the 1999 East Timor crisis, Australia realised that Defence had been seriously neglected and required a substantial increase in investment. Today, however, there is no doubt that recent cuts will have serious ramifications for the future readiness of our military forces and that the cuts are creating a growing capability gap. One of the primary reasons why we must look long term is because procurement projects can take decades from first consideration to final delivery. As Lieutenant General Morrison noted, the capability of the army: … can be relinquished disturbingly rapidly if it is not carefully developed and sustained … At the same time, when we discuss the cost of procurement for submarines to the tune of $40 billion-or $16 billion for the Joint Strike Fighter-we are only talking in terms of delivery, not including the ongoing costs of maintenance. In many instances, the initial outlay might cover only one third of a project's cost over its lifetime. When I talk to those within the Defence industry, they tell me that they are extremely worried about what the future might hold. Already 5,000 Australian jobs have been lost in the Defence industry. They are fully aware that during recent Senate estimates the Defence minister admitted that out of $230 billion outlined in the 2009 Defence White Paper, $200 billion of that total is still unfunded. As a result, in three years time, there could be a complete shutdown of naval ship building to name just one area of Defence industry. There is no surprise at the anxiety that exists within the industry as a result of this government's lack of commitment to Defence. It is therefore incumbent upon any future Australian government to recommit to Defence, and I continue to make that commitment. To conclude, I say to the families and friends of Defence personnel serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Solomon Islands and elsewhere in the world that they have every reason to be incredibly proud of the outstanding commitment to their mission of defending the security of Australia and the globe. Afghanistan has a complicated past, but I know that all Australians hope for a successful future in that nation and I commend Australia's ongoing contribution to that goal. Finally, let me say this: any cabinet that fails to properly equip our troops at war must accept, as a cabinet and individually, the cost of that failure. I do not say that is the situation today, but the failure to properly fund our Defence forces today must resonate in the immediate future and must inevitably increase the risks and challenges that our troops will then face. many years ago-trained freely in Afghanistan. As we tragically found out, the objective of that training was to kill Australians; and to unleash its worse against our allies, the United States of America. The transition has begun, thankfully, and by the end of 2014 we are told that the transition plan is for Afghanistan to take charge of its own security. The process of transition is on course: it began on 17 July 2012. Our Special Operations Task Group will continue to operate and do its work well against the insurgency. Our advisory taskforce will retain a combat-ready capability, and this is the course that is taking place in Oruzgan. The Australian Federal Police has undertaken extremely important work training the Afghan National Police at the police training centre in Tarin Kot. As the transition continues, our future efforts will focus on leadership training and strategic advisory support at a national level. This will help the Afghan National Police manage its own transition from paramilitary activity as part of the important counterinsurgency to a constabulary force performing what police are supposed to do-that is, regular police work, civilian policing roles. We heard our Prime Minister yesterday say that our development aid effort will continue. Australian aid, the Prime Minister said, is making a real difference to the lives of Afghan people. That is certainly so. It is helping the Afghan nation on the path to development and peace which is of course so important. We heard the Prime Minister say that in Uruzgan, the Australian-led provincial reconstruction team does great work, contributing to a six-fold increase in the number of schools operating, tripling the number of active health facilities and enabling a stronger provincial administration. As transition proceeds in Uruzgan, the Prime Minister said that our aid workers and diplomats will continue their important task. Of course, her words were backed up by the opposition leader, Tony Abbott. Across the political divide, this has bipartisan support. Our important work, our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, have cross-party political support, as they should have. Our troops on the ground, our Navy, and our air men and women need all the support they can get. They need to know that we, as parliamentarians, who have the responsibility for sending them there, are right behind them-and we are.",157,Ministerial Statements
204,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:53,"Under Taliban rule, terrorists once-not thatYet there are challenges. There are huge challenges to our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan. The Iraq war became known as the conflict which bought the horror of improvised explosive devices to global infamy, and, sadly, the Afghanistan conflict is becoming the face of a new and even more hideous form of deadly violence-the insider attack. The Prime Minister referred to that yesterday. Known in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation as 'green on blue'-green representing friendly national forces and blue representing international forcesthese attacks have increased dramatically in 2012. Last year, 31 troops died in these insider attacks, and that figure is significantly and dramatically and tragically higher this year. The numbers are so high that some military analysts have claimed that they may represent the highest incidence of intentional friendly-fire attacks in recorded military history. In response, the Commander of the International Security Assistance Force, United States General John Allen, ordered that all coalition soldiers carry loaded weapons, even at the larger secure bases, inside buildings and even at meetings. The Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, blamed the recent surge of green on blue attacks on foreign countries-a reference to Pakistan and Iran-infiltrating the Afghan National Army and brain-washing vulnerable or disenchanted soldiers. The Pakistan based spiritual leader of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, said that his fighters had been instructed to infiltrate the Afghan National Army and coerce Afghan soldiers to assist attacking coalition troops. He said: 'Thanks to the infiltration of the mujaheddin, they are able to safely enter bases, offices and intelligence centres of the enemy. Then, they easily carry out decisive and coordinated attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy both in life and support.' Terrorism knows no bounds. It is gutless. That is another reason why we need to continue every effort to keep our soldiers safe and certainly to continue our efforts in Afghanistan, because the Afghan people need to know that our support is with them. They need-as everybody does-to have a free country. We need to leave our troops in Afghanistan. Progress is being made on our goal to help stabilise the country, but there is a lot of work to do, obviously. Unfortunately, there are many people in Australia who do not understand the progress being made. Media programs often show a negative side of war. Of course, it is important that they do show those tragic ramp ceremonies, when our diggers have unfortunately made the ultimate sacrifice. Quite often the media do not represent good things being achieved in Afghanistan. We heard the Prime Minister speak yesterday about the great strides that the coalition has helped to make for education, for minorities and certainly for women, and about the good work we are doing to ensure that there is no safe haven for terrorist activity in Afghanistan. That is not always reflected as much as the tragedy of soldiers being killed on the battlefield and certainly in green on blue attacks. The soldiers believe that what they are doing is making a difference-and they should know; they are right there in the trenches, in the camps and in the streets of Afghanistan doing good work. If they get pulled out now, they believe the 39 fallen will have died in vain. Certainly those 39 who have lost their lives in Afghanistan are the bravest of the brave; the best of the best. Afghanistan is our war. Everyone deserves freedom-Afghans too. If we leave too soon the country will turn back to the chaotic situation it has been in for the past 30 years. It has been a terrible situation for decades. The soldiers know the risks; they also know the job at hand and they will know when it is finished. As we heard the Prime Minister say yesterday, the end is nigh but certainly we need to stay there until we get the job done. Until democracy and the rule of law is brought to failed states, we need to continue to play our part. The coalition has achieved so much with so few casualties-though sadly we have had 39 killed and more than 240 injured. Those 39 fallen have paid the ultimate sacrifice, but all in all our soldiers and our Navy and our Air Force since 2001 have done mighty things. The people of Afghanistan are depending on us to continue the work we have done. We cannot leave them with warring tribes, terrorist schools and mediaeval treatment for women and minorities. We must see out a tough fight; we must see out a just fight. Defence lobbyist Neil James, who served in the Army for more than 31 years and who still serves in the reserves, has commented that some Australian soldiers were undertaking too many deployments as a result of budget cuts to the Department of Defence. Mr James is Executive Director of the Australia Defence Association. As the ADA official spokesman, he is also responsible for the association's contributions to day-to-day public debate and for helping maintain the long-term and informed perspectives the Australia Defence Association has long brought to such discourse. Mr James's military experience over almost four decades has spanned a wide range of regimental, intelligence, liaison, teaching, operational planning and operational research positions. He said: One of the reasons that people are having to do … too many tours, is there aren't enough of them and the reason there aren't enough of them is that the defence budget is too small. Unfortunately the defence budget was cut by $5½ billion in the May budget. Mr James went on: The people of Australia refuse to vote for politicians who will invest sufficiently in defence to give us strategic alternatives. He said the price was being paid by 'a very small part of the national family who are doing most of the country's war fighting.' He is right. The budget cuts were extremely tough, and they will continue to be tough on our military. I know the working accommodation that was planned for the Kapooka army base at Wagga Wagga, where all recruits for the Regular Army are turned out, has been put on hold because of these cuts. When we are on the battlefield the job of the Army is always to bring the troops in. Of course if they are injured they are brought in but if they have sadly fallen and died they have to be brought in and then looked after with the greatest respect when they get back to Australia. I plead for the government, and I implore our own side, to ensure fair indexation for military pensions and superannuation into the future. I know that times are tough and I realise that sometimes cuts need to be made. But these people signed up to fight wars to promote freedom and to help our country and other peoples, and when they come home they need to be looked after with respect by the parliament which sends them to wars. This morning a brave Australian soldier is going to be awarded the Victoria Cross. I do not know his name yet; it may well have been announced since I started speaking. At any rate, the Governor General and the Prime Minister will make an announcement this morning that another Australian soldier is going to be a recipient of the highest honour for valour in the field. That is a tremendous thing. We know what great things Ben Roberts-Smith, our last Australian VC recipient, did to earn that remarkable honour for courage, and the latest recipient will join the long line of khaki heroes to receive a VC. The first Victoria Cross was awarded in the Boer War and, since that conflict-through Gallipoli and all the other struggles that Australia has been involved in-men have reached the highest point of valour by putting life and limb on the line in a way that is beyond what most mere mortals would even contemplate. It is a great to think that today another VC recipient will join the other military heroes which Australia has turned out. The war in Afghanistan on Australia's part needs to continue. We are doing great work. We have built airstrips and schools and we have helped many women to rise up from the medieval state that they were in. Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists thanks to the great work that Australia has done as part of the coalition. That is to be acknowledged, and it should continue. I acknowledge the Prime Minister for her words in the House of Representatives yesterday during debate on Afghanistan. Our efforts need to continue until the job is finished. all those in the chamber that we congratulate the soldier who will be receiving the Victoria Cross today. Debate adjourned. That the Federation Chamber do now adjourn. Chifley Electorate: No School No Play Initiative represent a young electorate. About 15 per cent of people in the Blacktown local government area are under 30 and, in the electorate I am proud to represent, about a third of people are under the age of 19. This means that preparing young people for life after school is a big focus for many families, parents, schools and community organisations. In consideration of this, it was a delight to be able to kick off the No School No Play program in the Chifley electorate. This year we ran it again. No School No Play is a federal government program involving various sporting codes and I was delighted that we could join up with Basketball Australia this year. Basketball Australia was funded to roll this program out at three other sites around the country and they agreed to run the program with us in Chifley. They would run the program as long as we could find local support to fund it, so we teamed up with some sponsors. For their support I thank Steve Holmes from Woolworths in Plumpton and Natalie Samia from Woolies corporate; Rob Ewin and Marcus James from Westpac; and Walter Kmet from WentWest, the new partner that runs the Western Sydney Medicare local. There are 120 students and six schools: Chifley College and its Bidwill, Mount Druitt and Shalvey campuses; Evans High School; Plumpton High School; and St Clair High School. The students were put through their paces in coaching clinics led by Western Sydney boy Ben Knight. He has played basketball here and overseas and is a former Sydney Kings captain. He was just tremendous. I really valued his input. Teachers and students welcomed the care and diligence that he committed to this program, along with ' Mr Basketball, Bob Turner, NBL Hall-of-Famer and coach extraordinaire. He now heads up the Sydney Blue Sox in the Australian Baseball League-a true gentleman I have spoken about in the House.",160,Ministerial Statements

207,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (11:08): I have said before in this place that IThe message was: professional athletes do not just turn up on a playing field or a court; they have to work at their skills. Linking the power of sport to motivating students to engage in school and build their personal bank of skills to give them more options later in life was the big aim of this program. Ben Knight said to the Mt Druitt and St Mary staff that, 'It is not about winning or losing. The program is about fuelling bodies, building teamwork and improving school attendance.' The local paper and also the Blacktown Advocate have been fantastic in putting a positive light on the achievements of local youth. Ben Knight, as I said, mentioned fuelling bodies. I was delighted that our new partner in this program, WentWest, supported our work by sending along nutritionists who gave insights into how healthy eating can help in daily life. After the gruelling six-week coaching clinics, we held a terrific carnival and graduating ceremony, with Opals and Canberra Capitals coach Carrie Graf present, along with Mr Magic, NBL legend and Sydney Kings senior vice-president, Steve Carfino, who joined BA's CEO, Kristina Keneally, Ben Knight and Bob Turner. We presented every student with a certificate and a Spalding basketball. I want to thank Russell Sports's Anita Kradzins for her help. The kids were just over the moon about receiving these certificates and balls. I want to read some evaluations. One is from Sarah Hamad from the Shalvey at Chifley College. She said, 'My principal was very happy with the outcomes of the program and pleased to see our school, Chifley College Shalvey, in the media in such a positive light. Students are still talking about it. I even heard one the other day talking about eating wholemeal bread instead of white bread because it was better for them.' Amazing! Evans High principal Kay Smith-and thank you for hosting the graduation, Evans Highsaid, 'We identified a number of students who were perhaps on the edge of their attendance and we thought, ""Let's engage them,"" and it has been very successful.' I just want to thank: Sarah Hamad from Chifley College, Shalvey; Marilyn Hill, the Aboriginal education officer, and Tanya McEwen, the teacher who attended the carnival from Chifley College, Bidwill; Karen Attard from Chifley College, Mt Druitt; Plumpton Highs's Claire Lehn; St Clare's Catholic High's Brian Pestano and Robert Portelli; and, from Evans High, Michael Hoareau. Thank you to all of them. I want to pay tribute to the leadership of Kristina Keneally and Basketball Australia, who understand the value of basketball in building community links to help deliver valuable life lessons. I also wanted to acknowledge Basketball Australia's school engagement officer, Elyshia O'Neil-cool, calm, collected but, importantly, committed. She went above and beyond and is a tremendous asset to BA and this program. Schools exceptionally value her work. Finally, I want to make an important recognition of every single student who participated in the program. You are all an asset to our area and to your families, and I look forward to you all evolving into our own local legends. Everyone associated with the program wishes every student the best possible success in their lives. Riverina Electorate: Citrus Growers import, depending on our season, between 500,000 and 600,000 in equivalent tonnes of",163,Adjournment
208,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:13,"Australia grows 500,000 tonnes of citrus. Weconcentrate orange juice. In an average year, with a favourable dollar, we have been able to export up to 130,000 tonnes of citrus mainly to America and Asia. The real troubles for our growers began when Brazil began dumping its concentrate orange juice into Australia because it was being rejected by other countries. According to Griffith navel and Valencia grower Louis Sartor, Brazil has been doing this in earnest for 20 years and this has absolutely hit our industry in the past two years. Our growers have also been hard hit by our dollar hitting parity. Shed hands in fruit-packing houses working in California are paid $8 an hour. In Griffith, it is $18 an hour, plus on-costs such as superannuation et cetera, making it about $25 an hour. Picking a bin in California costs the orchardist $7.50 plus delivery of $1.50 a bin. So that is $9 to get the fruit from the tree to the packing house. In Griffith, in the Riverina, it is $33 to pick a bin and $5 in freight per bin to get it to the packing house. In South Africa, they can pick it for $2 a bin. Our efficiency is way ahead-world's best practice-but costs are killing our growers. We saw last week on A Current Affair how tragic the situation is, with fruit growers right throughout the Riverina pulling out trees, dumping oranges into paddocks and then churning them into the ground. We run the largest orchards with the fewest people. Mr Sartor is also gravely concerned about what he terms 'our ridiculous labelling laws'. He said: Three years ago the Labor government conducted the Blewett report and have not implemented any of the recommendations in that report. Therefore consumers are finding it difficult to make purchases of Australian product and the Labor government should be absolutely ashamed of itself for denigrating the Australian farmer to the point where the Australian farmer's product is not able to be recognised on the Australian supermarket shelf. It should be implemented immediatelythat is the Blewett reportand on fresh fruit and in particular on fruit drink and fruit juice products. On 23 October 2009, the ministerial council announced that former Australian health minister, Dr Neal Blewett, would head up the panel to undertake a comprehensive examination of food-labelling law and policy. Dr Blewett was a pioneer of Australia's universal Medicare health system and is a strong advocate for the rights of consumers. The review panel completed two rounds of public consultation and received more than 6,000 submissions. I also acknowledge the work of Senator John Williams of the Nationals in the area of proper labelling. On 28 January 2011, the review panel officially presented its final report, Labelling Logic. It was publicly released on the same day. Another Riverina grower, Bart Brighenti, said: The glut is the symptom not the cause, the cause is the cost of doing business in Australia (regulated labour and conditions, deregulated growing industry, domestic supermarket duopoly, government policy like carbon tax not applied to imports and labelling). … We keep pulling trees out till there is nothing left here. Deregulation and free trade is destroying Agriculture and for WHAT benefit? We are net importers of fruit/vegetables/juice and fish (aren't we surrounded by ocean?) and this has delivered the consumer in Australia with the fastest increasing food prices in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Choice is either we do business in Australia or not. I recently wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig, raising these concerns: 1. A ten-fold increase of Federal Government charges associated with registering a facility for export 2. Lack of drive and support for opening and maintaining export market access 3. Failure to impose the same quality restrictions on imported goods as Australian produced goods. My letter continued: Orchardists recently received a notice from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry advising new fees and charges to be imposed to register sheds for packing oranges for exports. The new annual charge for registered charge for registered establishments under Tier 3, protocol markets, increases from $550 per annum towait for it$8,530. This is a significant increase which orchardists have no way of recouping. It took almost two months, but I got the standard response back from the minister-which provided no comfort or relief whatsoever to orchardists within the Riverina area. The Riverina is of course already beset not just with the carbon tax, like everywhere else in this country, but also with deep and worrying concerns about water availability and security into the future. I implore this government to implement a decent Murray-Darling Basin plan. (Time expired) Disability Services Support Workers Conference and awards evening put on by National Disability Services Tasmania in Launceston in my electorate of Bass. We know that disability support workers are committed to achieving dignity and equality for people with disability and for their families and carers. The awards highlighted the commendable work of people who are striving to make a difference in the lives of people with a disability. They recognise the remarkable dedication and commitment support workers demonstrate in their professional lives. The conference was a fantastic opportunity to recognise individuals who assist the most vulnerable people in our community. There was some excellent discussion on various issues of importance to people with disabilities and to those who help them and care for them. Disability support workers are on the front line, supporting people with disability to reach their full potential. They support people with disability to achieve their goals and aspirations and they help to create a more inclusive and accessible society for people of all abilities. We recognise the invaluable contribution they make to the lives of Australians with a disability, helping them to meet the needs of daily life. I am proud to show my support for these remarkable individuals who are making a difference in the disability sector. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the award winners at the conference and dinner. The Elizabeth Boon of St Michaels Association and Adele Doyle of the St Michaels Association. The winner was Elizabeth Boon, who was with St Michaels for the last five years, beginning as a cleaner and being recognised for her caring and nurturing attitude.",164,Adjournment
209,Mr Lyons (Bass) (11:18,"I recently had the pleasure of attending the CelebratingThe HESTA Long-term Service Award finalists were: Maxine Stewart of Veranto Lifestyle Assistance, Max Richards of St Michaels Association and Lynne Swan of Star Tasmania. The winner was Lyn Swan, who joined the Star Tasmania group-then known for supporting housing-16 years ago and has been recognised as a leader among the staff, providing services that are personnel-centred and supportive of people she works and lives with today. Finally, the ME Bank Outstanding Achievement Award finalists were: Debbie Haines of Life Without Barriers, Mathew Adams of Optia and David Watts of the St Michaels Association. The winner was Debbie Haines, who has worked with Life Without Barriers for many years. She has been recognised for the development of a variety of programs that have enhanced social inclusion for participants and her demonstrated commitment to the disability sector through continuous learning and development. I congratulate all of the finalists and award winners. This is a fitting recognition for the wonderful work that they do. Our government knows that the continued commitment of carers and trainers is fundamental to the success of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and this government is committed to supporting people with a disability, their families and carers. We will support the disability sector, its workforce, its carers and people with a disability as we implement those changes. As the Productivity Commission reported, people with a disability are often faced with a system that is unfair, unfunded, fragmented and inefficient. The Gillard government is committed to delivering the biggest reform in this country since Medicare. Through the National Disability Insurance Scheme we will deliver a system that supports people with a disability no matter where they live, no matter how they acquired their disability. The success of this historic reform will be determined by the integration of care and the coordination of services, which will remove unfairness, fragmentation and inefficiency. The NDIS will mean that people with a disability will receive a care and support package that is individually tailored to their needs and that the people with a disability have a greater opportunity for decision making and power about their care and support. The National Disability Insurance Scheme will give people with a disability the kind of care and support that we expect, and we will give all Australians the confidence of that. If they acquire a disability, or a child or a grandson is born with a disability, they will get the care and support that they need. It will deliver quality care and support, and provide opportunities for the people with a disability and their families and carers. In conclusion, I would like to again thank and congratulate those individuals who are selflessly assisting those in need in our community. The conference that I attended in Tasmania was a terrific way to thank those people, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. Wild Dogs place that pretends to care about the environment but does absolutely nothing to protect native wildlife and farming stock from the impact of wild dogs in regional Australia. I do not have much time this morning, Deputy Speaker, so I will keep my message very simple-so simple that perhaps even the minister and his greenie mates will understand what I am talking about. You have blood on your hands. Minister, while you sit in this place and",166,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
210,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11:23,"I rise to condemn the Labor-Greens alliance in thishide behind your department's advice, wild dogs are killing stock and native animals in my electorate every day of the year. For the people on the ground who have to clean up this mess, it is devastating, it is traumatic and it is soul-destroying. The minister and the Greens pretend to care about the environment, they pretend to care about animal welfare issues but they allow wild dogs to kill native species and rip the guts out of livestock in my electorate and right throughout regional Australia every day of the year. I say to the Greens, those animal rights activists that we often hear about on television, and I say to the minister for the environment: you are hypocrites of the highest order. If any of these people who pretend to care about the environment and pretend to care about animal welfare issues actually gave a damn, they would support all measures to control wild dogs in Australia-including aerial baiting in Victoria. My local community and the Victorian state government are doing their best to control wild dogs, and the federal government is actually obstructing their efforts. The federal government is obstructing the efforts of the Victorian government to control wild dogs. The Victorian government has sought Commonwealth approval for a trial of aerial baiting to complement its increased funding for other measures like trapping, ground baiting, fencing and the newly introduced bounty on foxes and wild dogs. For its part, the Commonwealth department has demanded additional research, leaving Victorians with a choice. They can fund additional research-waste their money that was going to be used for wild dog control on research-or they can spend that money on actually killing dogs. I am right to say 'waste'-and I am not against research; don't get me wrong there-because the research has actually been done. I urge the minister to read the New South Wales department of environment fact sheet on wild dogs, which I have here with me. It reports on the research it undertook in relation to aerial baiting of wild dogs and the impact on native species like quolls. Keep in mind that New South Wales has been aerial baiting for more than 30 years, and the research found that aerial baiting had a minimal impact on the quoll populations: While individual quolls may die from 1080 baits, this research suggests that aerial baiting is unlikely to have an impact on quoll populations as a whole. In fact, aerial baiting which suppresses local fox and dog populations may benefit quolls in an area. Wild dogs are destroying the native environment and tearing at the fabric of communities in regional Australia, where farmers are being left virtually on their own to battle without significant support from the federal government. I acknowledge that aerial baiting is not the panacea; it is not going to solve this problem. But it will help. The Victorian government should have every tool at its disposal to help it reduce the impact of this menace, and the families in my community are rightfully demanding more assistance. In closing, I would like to quote from a letter which was sent to me by the daughter of a farmer who had invited the environment minister to actually visit their property, near Omeo. It is a formal invitation. The lady writes: 'I would like you to join my father every day for a week as he goes out every morning to pick up dead and dying sheep that have been mauled, some eaten alive, some still running around with their innards half hanging out. Help him put these sheep down. You can then partake in the task of picking up the bodies and piling them up to burn. Come and join him in this task and see how it affects him. Come back with him to his house and sit down with him to poke your food around on your plate because you cannot eat as you feel so overwhelmed by the feeling of helplessness.' The letter goes on: 'After this fun-filled week-when you may be able to experience some of the desolation and heartache felt by this man-sit down and explain to him why he has to wait while more studies are carried out before anything more proactive will be done. Explain to him why he has to watch his beloved animals that he has tended for most of his life be murdered. Explain to him why his income has been cut so drastically. Explain to him that all the meetings he has attended over the years, all the letters he has written and all the people that he has lobbied have all been a waste of time. Explain to him why the animals he used to marvel at as he rode through the bush are no longer there. Explain to him why he has to keep going. Explain to him why he does not get stress leave. Explain to us-his family-why we have to watch him slowly shrink from a vibrant, energetic man to a beaten, heartbroken shell.' I accepted that offer and attended in Omeo last week. I urge the minister to take up the same offer. Walk a mile in the boots of these people, who have to attend to this tragedy every day of the week. I challenge the minister to stop hiding behind his department staff and actually do his job. On behalf of farmers in regional Victoria, I urge the minister to simply intervene in this matter. His department is off on a green-tape frolic of its own that is unsupported by the research and is harming the economy, the environment and the social fabric of regional Victoria. Every day that we stop this aerial baiting in Victoria is another day that wild dogs feast on native wildlife and kill livestock. I seek leave to table the letter from Sonia Lawlor, from Omeo, to the minster for the environment. I also seek leave to table the fact sheet on wild dogs from the New South Wales government. Leave granted. Whitehorse Primary School Whitehorse Primary School-a new school in my electorate at Deakin, formed by the merger of the former Springview and Nunawading Primary Schools. With funding from both the federal government, through the BER Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, and from the Victorian government, through the schools regeneration and VST programs, this was a much bigger project than the previous 34 BER openings that I have attended in the electorate of Deakin. It was great to see the results and to be able to recognise some of the people who helped ensure that the project got off the ground. The Victorian Minister for Education, Martin Dixon, and both the former state member for Mitcham, Tony Robinson, and the current member for Mitcham, Dee Ryall, were there for the opening. I especially thank Tony Robinson for his hard work in 2009 and 2010 as the state member for Mitcham. I would also like to thank the school captains, Jessica Arandall and Duncan McLeod, who assisted with the formalities on the day. As good as Whitehorse Primary looks today, I think everyone who has been involved in a project such as this soon finds out that it does not just happen overnight and it can take a lot of time to get things right. The merging of two schools into one is difficult for the parents, teachers and students, and also the wider community. However, if it is done properly, the transformation can be a real plus for the whole community-both inside the school gate and outside. By combining P21 funding of $3.2 million from the federal government and $4.78 million from the Victorian government-a total of $7.986 million-the results are there for all to see. The $4.78 million of state funding was committed to the project",167,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
211,Mr Symon (Deakin) (11:28,"On 12 October, I attended the official opening ofby the previous state Labor government and the project was completed by the current state Liberal government. It was back on 3 February 2009 that the federal Labor government announced the schools building program known as the Building the Education Revolution program. The Primary Schools for the 21st Century component of this program applied to all primary schools and the National School Pride funding applied to every single school Australia-wide. One month later, on 3 March 2009, I visited Anne Kettle, Principal of Springview Primary School, to talk about the opportunities for the school under the federal government's Building the Education Revolution and National School Pride programs. I had a similar conversation with Kerry Wood, the principal of Nunawading Primary School, a couple of weeks later, on 23 March 2009. Both schools really did need the money. In Springview's case, the buildings and grounds were slowly falling apart, and in Nunawading's case the buildings were also in poor condition to the extent that they had cracks in the walls so big I could put my hand in them. The original Tunstall Primary School building, which was the former name of the suburb of Nunawading, renamed in 1945, is a historic building but it was also well in need of a makeover. Putting the Primary Schools for the 21st Century funding to the best use was a challenge that eventually became a part of the solution to the joining of the schools. The merging of both schools could not have happened without the assistance of the principals, Kerry Wood from Nunawading-and now, of course, Whitehorse-and Anne Kettle from Springview, and the teaching staff, the school councils, the parents associations and the school communities. The difficulties in deciding the best way forward were resolved over many long months of negotiations between the school councils, the principals and the department, resulting in the decision to merge both schools and rebuild a brand new school at the Springview Primary site on Junction Road. People such as Tony Clark, the Whitehorse School Council President and formerly from Nunawading, spent countless long hours building support amongst the school communities to gain support for the merger. Geoff Allan and Rod Williamson from the Victorian DEECD, whose expertise helped facilitate the department's involvement through extended consultations, negotiations and planning, also need to be congratulated. I should also like to thank the builders, Daniel and Matthew Boje from WP Contracting, who used a modified Maroondah template design for the school's new hall to get the best value for money in the building of this great new educational facility. For two years, Whitehorse Primary School was based at the Nunawading Primary School site on Springvale Road, whilst the old Springview Primary buildings were demolished and the new Whitehorse Primary School was built. Whitehorse Primary School is now the newest primary school in the federal electorate of Deakin, which contains 50 different school communities. The facilities that have been provided are the envy of many other local schools and show the benefits of combining state and federal government funding for the benefit of our community. In additional to the National School Pride funding of $200,000, $3.2 million from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program was invested in the construction of the school's new indoor gym that is also used by the local community after hours for basketball. It is also used by referral services and there are many paraprofessionals who come and visit the school for various programs-a great improvement for what was a very rundown and under-used facility. I commend the opening of Whitehorse Primary School as an excellent example of how the federal Labor government's BER program has provided a great new education infrastructure for our local community. Jewish Community Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (11:33): I bring the attention of the House to the inestimably worthy, selfless works of the Jewish community leadership in my electorate and across the nation. RecentlyI held a security breakfast forum with leaders from the Jewish community in the civil and business spheres. On that morning, in my office in Willetton, there were leaders from the Jewish Women's Council, the Jewish Community Council, the Zionist Council in Australia and the Israel Chamber of Commerce, amongst others. I take this opportunity to reassert my unwavering support for the Jewish community, for Israel and for those who live and love democracy and freedom across the world. I say this not because Israeli Ambassador Rotem is a friend, though he is, but because it is right and fitting and required of all free people. Let there be no doubt that our country can do more, and should do more-it is in our own self-interest. This self-interest in Middle Eastern geopolitics stems from security and economic facts. Israel is the only true democracy in the region; and there are innumerable opportunities for Australian capital in Israeli high-tech start-up companies. It is time that our national polity stopped the navel gazing, got a backbone and stood shoulder to shoulder with every other liberal democracy. There is nothing inevitable about democracy, nor is there anything to say that once free always free. The price of freedom is vigilance. Principles need to underpin politics. Liberal democratic principles are offended by the reality of two out of five Israeli children living in poverty. Without absolute principles and red lines, there is only an aggressive atrophic relativism. Where are the red lines on Iran? As I said to Ambassador Rotem, why are there not principles we are unwilling to bend on? We must stand with Israel with forces of the free-principles before politics, as people before profit, as substance before spin. The magnanimity of the Jewish people today is a beacon to all. Fortunes have been won and taken, lives broken and rebuilt and rebuilt and rebuilt. This rebuilding was a phoenix from a fiery belief in education. That belief too is a principle, one that is entrenched in the heart of the Jewish community and Liberal democracies around the world. This is not opinion but a fact spoken to me by Rabbi David Freilich, a past president of the Organisation of Rabbis of Australasia. When I read that only 7.5 per cent of schools in South Africa had any books at all, my principles were offended. I was offended. I know, as the Jewish leaders at the breakfast forum knew, that the only way out of poverty and the only way to embed democratic principles is through education. Improving education at home and abroad is one of my core principles, because it facilitates our being free. It is incumbent on free people everywhere to have values and principles in their politicsto mean what they say and do what they say. Democracy is a good and noble path. No person or party can change that. Anything other than democracy is alien and a bastard of the natural rights of mankind. So, I say to our community leaders: know that I am a conviction politician, a person of principles. That is why I will never cut a single cent from an education sector that is delivering results. That is why I am touring my electorate of Tangney with a timely presentation on cyberbullying. That is why I am reading to school kids as part of the National School Literacy Week initiative. My principles have me out listening to businesses like Costa Farms in Willetton, under pressure due to a no-think carbon tax policy resulting from Labor group think. That is why I was not surprised when Mr Akef Sahi from Syria came to my office requesting advice on how he could secure more teachers for that country. Amidst all the preventable evil, education is still valued and recognised as the only real escape. That is what having principles is about. You know what they are; you stand by them. I stand by the Jewish community, I stand by Israel; I stand forever for education and Liberal democracy. Environment Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (11:38): Recently the Hawke review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act tabled its final report. Comments relating to the review were generally very supportive of the EPBC Act. The review looked at the way the act could be reformed to make it operate better. It talked about many of the positive features of the act that should be retained, including clear specification of matters of national environmental significance, the environment minister's role as decision maker, public participation provisions, explicit consideration of social and economic issues, statutory advisory mechanisms and a strong compliance and enforcement regime. I am a little bit concerned that the legislation that may be introduced may weaken the way the EPBC Act operates. I have been contacted by a number of environmental organisations. Particularly in my role as a member of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, I have become concerned that there may be a watering down of the EPBC Act, and that could impact on the Commonwealth's role. In particular, the aspect I am really concerned about is handing over approval to the states. As a former local government representative and a former state member, I know the types of issues and the factors that influence local governments and state governments when they are considering planning and development proposals. I think the fact that we have a strong role for the Commonwealth set out in the EPBC Act is a safeguard. I would hate to see that safeguard watered down in any way. In my own area, I know there have been particular issues that have been referred to the environment minister. He looked at the issues he could and that he had responsibility for and made a decision based on that. You could feel comfortable that it had been examined and looked at in that light. It is really important that the authority that is seeking approval is not going to be the authority that grants the approval. With the states having the ability to make approvals-without the Commonwealth having the role currently prescribed by the EPBC Act-that could happen in some cases. I am very, very supportive of cutting red tape. To allow the smooth functioning of our economy, I think we should keep red tape to a minimum. But-and this is the important factor-if the cutting of the red tape creates problems then that red tape, those regulations or laws, should stay in place. I will just give a couple of examples of where the EPBC Act stepped in. One occasion was in 2007. The federal government refused an application to release water from Lake Crescent in Tasmania for irrigation purposes. The release would have impacted on the Ramsar site and the globally endangered golden galaxias fish. The Tasmanian government was supportive of that. Great Keppel Island as well as Jervis Bay are areas where the EPBC Act has been used in the past. I implore the parliament not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is a role for the Commonwealth, and we need to have that role for monitoring requirements as part of the EPBC Act. Fishing Industry Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (11:43): TodayI would like to speak about the Australian fishing industry. Gladstone was described as a fishing village long before a wide range of industries made their homes in the Port Curtis region. In fact, this applies right up and down the Central Queensland coast, including to towns like Bundaberg and Agnes Water. Fishing fleets, charter boats, local anglers and processing plants have long been a part of the scene on the Central Queensland coast, and in this respect it is similar to many other regions around Australia's vast coastline. We are an island nation-we cannot forget that. More than 100 regional communities and many more businesses rely on the fishing industry for their livelihoods. The Australian fishing zone is the third largest in the world. Despite this, wild catch production in Australia represents just 0.002 per cent of wild catch production. Fisheries are the sixth largest food-producing primary industry in Australia. Seafood is the fifth most valuable source of protein. We export $1.5 billion and import $2.5 billion worth of product, which makes Australia a net importer of fish products. Australian seafood only makes up 30 per cent of domestic supply. Our fishers operate to world's best practice. Imports from three countries make up the bulk of the 70 per cent of imported product: Thailand 26 per cent, China 14 per cent and Vietnam 12 per cent. In 2009 an estimation of adherence to the UN code of conduct put Australia fourth out of 53 countries, with Vietnam ranked 45th, Thailand ranked 42nd and China ranked 22nd. This is a major concern for the future. How will we feed our growing population both in Australia and worldwide? Australia is and will continue to be an important player in this regard. Queensland already has a massive area of its waters under protection, which in itself is not a bad thing. However, there are no species of fish under threat in these waters, so it stands to reason that any increase in these protections must be based on scientific evidence. Current proposals are to lock up or extend our current 'no go zones'. Before these proposals are implemented, we must research the whole matter fully and any decision must be backed by solid scientific evidence. The other major concern is: how do we police the extended protected areas? We do not have the resources to protect our current marine parks, so how will we patrol and police another 1.3 million square kilometres of protected waters in the Coral Sea? NORFORCE in Northern Australia is already overstretched in protecting Australia's fishing grounds. With cutbacks to our Defence budget, the situation has to be of growing concern for our defence forces in Northern Australia. Our Army Reserve is feeling the cuts, and our ability to increase surveillance of our marine parks is being severely undermined. The proposed marine reserves would take the overall size of the Commonwealth marine reserves network to 3.1 million square kilometres. That is an area bigger than Western Australia and Victoria combined and would mean by far the largest representative network of marine protected areas in the world. We have to be smarter about issues such as this. Importing 70 per cent of our seafood makes no sense if we are serious about food security. We cannot forget that Australians are good at fishing sustainably and responsibly. We have to look after this industry. Anything we do must be clearly thought out. Common sense appears to be a rare commodity in the government these days. I urge the government to think very carefully about decimating our fishing industry. Public Service become commonplace among some politicians and media commentators. Public servants are considered easy targets and expendable by those who seem to have little appreciation of the role public servants play within our society. Those same people offer their one-sided opinions in the full knowledge that the public servants whom they are attacking cannot retaliate. Ironically, those that are often the first to criticise the Public Service are also the first to criticise poor service when government departments are inadequately staffed because of funding cuts. The reality is that we live in a society where governments deliver many of the mainstream and essential services that we rely on-for example, health, education, policing, environmental protection, housing, national security, social welfare, unemployment services and so on; the list is endless. They are services we rely on daily. Those services, however, are delivered by people whom we refer to as public servants. Again, there seems a strange contradiction in that on one hand the demand for government services continues to grow, while simultaneously we hear calls to cut public service numbers. Of course there are always opportunities for improvement, to provide services more efficiently or to scale down services. However, to make sweeping, ill-informed statements portraying all of those people working within the public service in a demeaning way is totally unwarranted and irresponsible. The attacks are even more irresponsible when they come from governments and political parties, who are not only seen as community leaders but are expected to have a better understanding of the role of public servants. Yet that is what we are seeing from the conservative side of politics throughout Australia today. The federal opposition leader believes there are 20,000 jobs too many in the Public Service. In Queensland, the Newman government has announced major cuts to government health programs and other government services, with about 14,000 jobs in the firing line. In New South Wales, the O'Farrell government has ripped $1.7 billion out of the state's education budget and, in Victoria, TAFE funding has been cut by $300 million. In South Australia, opposition leader Isobel Redmond has said that, if elected as Premier, she will cut 25,000 jobs from the South Australian public service. There is no consideration of the stress or the effects on morale such a statement causes to South Australia's state public servants and no consideration of the impact on service delivery that those cuts will have. For South Australia, 25,000 jobs is three per cent of the state's workforce so, presumably, unemployment would go up by three per cent. Under pressure, Ms Redmond has subsequently retracted the statement. Her retraction, however, was hardly reassuring, because Ms Redmond simply handballed the proposed cuts to an audit committee. Given what the conservative governments are doing in the eastern states, it is clear that they all have a similar agenda. Of course, there are potential ways of making cuts without making any real savings. The most commonly used trick is to outsource public service jobs so",169,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
212,Mr Zappia (Makin) (11:49,"In recent times Public Service bashing seems to havethat government employee numbers are reduced. However, what inevitably happens is that the cost to governments remain about the same, and sometimes actually increase, or service levels deteriorate. To add to the woes, we end up with services delivered by organisations that sometimes do not have the expertise or experience available through the public service. There is another reason the public service is so often the target of attack from the conservative side of politics. Smart business operators see a business opportunity in services being transferred from government to the private sector, either through subcontracting out services or through direct sale of government instrumentalities, and they run campaigns about how governments are not well placed to deliver those services. When there is a fee for service provided, it may even be a further incentive for governments, because by not being responsible for the service governments can distance themselves from any price increases that may be coming. It is clever politics. Public service cuts do hurt. They hurt the community, they hurt public servants and they hurt their families. Public servants around the country are understandably concerned about the cuts that they are seeing or that are proposed. I understand that governments have to work within their budgets and that, at times, difficult decisions have to be made. But to treat public servants as easy pickings when budgets need to be balanced shows a total lack of regard and respect for them by politicians who have probably never met them and probably never will. Our public servants deserve to be treated better than that, and their work needs to be valued. SwanCare Group accommodation for older Western Australians in my electorate of Swan. BeforeI go on to update you on some of the events happening in my electorate, I would like to welcome to the Federation Chamber Mrs Rebekah Faith, who is here on a Lachlan Macquarie internship and being hosted by the member for Macquarie. I hope you have enjoyed your week so far, Rebekah, and I welcome you to the Federation Chamber. On Saturday my wife and I attended the Bentley Park art and craft fair. Bentley Park is operated by SwanCare, the largest aged-care provider in the electorate. The fair was organised by a committee of seniors, led capably by Beryl, who has organised it for seven years. She announced on Saturday during the awards that she is retiring and handing over the mantle of the committee leadership to a younger member of the aged-care group. Beryl has done a fantastic job, and it was a delight to attend the art and craft fair. As we arrived, they had the usual sausage sizzle and were handing out food out to people who were arriving. I did not partake; I am trying to make sure that I do get to an aged-care facility, so I keep away from fatty sausages and similar foods. We were also accosted and sold some raffle tickets. I do not think that you can go to any aged-care fair in the country without having to buy some raffle tickets! My wife and I were given a voucher for a Devonshire tea, and we shared the scones and coffee with a couple of ladies from the SwanCare facility. They were an absolute delight to spend some time with. We enjoyed their company, and they explained how much they enjoyed living in the SwanCare facility at Bentley Park. The fair included the categories of pottery, painting and floral arrangements. One of the floral arrangements was named 'Sunrise' and it had a little sticker on it that said 'Kiss me Ketut?' I guess that most of us know of the 'Kiss me Ketut?' advertising around Australia; the lady in the advertisement came from Western Australia. We had to donate the raffle tickets.",174,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
213,Mr Irons (Swan) (11:53,"Madam Deputy Speaker, SwanCare Group is a provider ofThey were not drawing the raffle until the next day, so we gave the raffle tickets to a couple of people there. Within Beverley Park, residents have access to cafes, an op shop, a medical centre, a hair and beauty salon, outdoor and indoor bowling greens, an auditorium, computer facilities, a library, a supermarket and a number of transfer services which stop at Bentley Park every 10 minutes and which help the residents keep in touch with the broader community. Also visiting on the day was Trevor Vaughan, who is the mayor of the town of Victoria Park, and helping with the presentation of the record number of entries on account of the record number of categories this year was Graham Francis, the CEO of the SwanCare Bentley Park facility. I congratulate all the winners of the trophies and prizes on the day, and I am sure that next year, headed by a new committee chair, they will go on and improve and continue the great SwanCare fete. This weekend in my electorate is the 2012 show of the Canning Agricultural, Horticultural & Recreational Society. It runs from Friday at 5 pm to Saturday at 10 pm. I am encouraging everyone in my electorate to go down and visit. Last year there were over 11,000 visitors to the show, even though there is no longer much agriculture, horticulture and recreation going on within the Canning area. I acknowledge that the member for Banks is getting everyone ready for a division, but I will quickly quote a couple of words from the welcome written by the President of the Canning Agricultural, Horticultural & Recreational Society. He said: On behalf of the Canning Agricultural Horticultural and Recreational Society, welcome to the 2012 Canning show. This year we are celebrating the Magic of the Show. We will be conjuring in the kitchen, charming the vegetables, fruit and flowers and enchanting the young and the young at heart. The Society has secured top class entertainment for the 2012 programme, the centre stage will be filled with music, dance and of course-magic. Once again our exhibition halls are a showpiece, receiving entries from regular participants and first timers. Canning may no longer have agricultural lands, but we continue the connection with rural life in a lot of ways. This show continues to do so. (Time expired) Media Ownership speak during the adjournment last night and it got cancelled, so I am not sure how far I will get. Australia's media operates under the very solid principle of free speech, and that principle should never be compromised. But clearly free speech is only truly free if there is diversity in media ownership. Having more than two-thirds of the country's media outlets owned by one person, family or conglomerate is certainly not an example of diversity. In the past we have too hastily allowed diversity to practically disappear. Both sides of politics have allowed this to happen. In the UK recently, where this has also been allowed to happen, we have seen some of the worse examples of media behaviour. In Australia we had the Finkelstein recommendations, and the government has to respond to them in the coming weeks. There are some recommendations in particular that I think the government should be adopting. I support the recommendation of the establishment of a news",175,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
214,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (11:58,"I think this speech is jinxed! I was meant tomedia council. The council as proposed in the report would set journalistic standards for the news media-not only the traditional print, radio and television media but also the online media. The establishment of such a council-a statutory body whose links with government would be the strictly limited to the council's secure funding from the government-would not be about imposing a form of sanction but would be about making the news media more accountable. In an age of rapid technological change and less time to digest the detail of news media, it is even more important to get the facts right, because more often than not the public have only read the headlines and/or the first few lines of a story. The fast turnover of news cycles understandably puts increasing pressure on accuracy, but the importance of accuracy in reporting is therefore, in my view, even more fundamental. With accuracy comes balance. I have had a fair bit of experience in this area in recent times. Another of Mr Finkelstein's recommendations says that an important change to the status quo would be that, in appropriate cases, the news media council had: … power to require a news media outlet to publish an apology, correction or retraction, or afford a person a right to reply. Mr Finkelstein goes on to say: This is in line with the ideals contained in existing ethical codes but in practice often difficult to obtain. In this country the only regulation, other than voluntary regulation, of media outlets occurs through the use of defamation. In my experience, a real news story is something new to report. On the issues I have been involved in, there have probably been only five or six occasions when there has been new news to report; but, if you were to do a search of the news stories on the issues that I have been involved in, you would find thousands and thousands of stories. Often these stories are regurgitated, recycled news which occupy vast archives; they are not real, new news stories. We often hear, from journalists in particular, the phrase 'the court of public opinion'. If the court of public opinion is dictated to by unbalanced news reporting which not only sets the agenda but also-using the analogy of a court-prosecutes and finds people guilty, then we are in a very sorry state. We need to ensure that the recommendations in the Finkelstein report go through so that the court of public opinion at least has the opportunity to hear balanced reporting from both sides of a given story. I am disturbed, not just for myself in the matter that I am involved but also for a whole range of other people, by trends in the media of late on the presumption of innocence. I read recently in a News Limited article a position being put by very senior journalist that, while this country has the presumption of innocence, it really does not matter for politicians. I found it quite astounding and disturbing that such an idea would be put into writing by a senior journalist in this country. I also find disturbing reports on a matter to do with the HSU according to which a person claimed to have no fear about legal proceedings on defamation because they had been promised by a media outlet that it would pay their legal costs. The Finkelstein report is important, and we should adopt it. (Time expired) Superannuation Funds superannuation funds. In the early 1990s, when the existing superannuation system was set up",176,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
215,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (12:03,"I rise to address the matter of the governance ofby the Keating government, the government took care to ensure that its friends in the union movement were entrenched at the very centre of the governance system of industry superannuation funds. Indeed, if you look at the boards of industry super funds, you see that union bosses such as AWU boss Paul Howes, Queensland ALP heavyweight and AWU strongman Bill Ludwig, TWU secretary Tony Sheldon and-until recently-Health Services Union officials Kathy Jackson and Michael Williamson are or have been on the boards of industry or public sector superannuation funds. These arrangements give the union movement a degree of control over superannuation which goes far beyond what the small and shrinking share of the workforce who are union members would seem to entitle them. Today, around 18 per cent of the public sector workforce are union members, and around 12 per cent of the private sector workforce are union members. Debate interrupted. Question agreed to. Federation Chamber adjourned at 12:05 Australian Conservation Foundation (Question No. 1173) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in writing, on 21 August 2012: For (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, (c) 2009-10, (d) 2010-11, and (e) 2011-12, what grants were provided to the Australian Conservation Foundation, including the amount, purpose, and program each was delivered under. Mr Burke: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under my portfolio of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, there have been two grants awarded to the Australian Conservation Foundation since 2007-08; details as follows: 2010-2011 $20,000 (GST exclusive) under the Caring for our Country (Natural Heritage Trust) program for support to the Tasmanian Forests Statement of Principles Signatories. 2011-2012 $20,000 (GST exclusive) as a one-off (non-program) grant to support ongoing involvement in the Tasmanian Forests negotiations under the Tasmanian Forests Intergovernmental Agreement. Commonwealth Grants (Question No. 1238) Mr Briggs asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 18 September 2012: (1) For (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, and (d) 2011-12, how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Ministers department, and at what total cost. (2) For 2012-13 (to date), how many Commonwealth grants were approved by the Ministers department and at what total cost, and of these, how many have (a) signed funding agreements, and at what total cost, and (b) been paid to the approved recipients, and at what total cost. Ms Gillard: I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In accordance with Finance Circular No. 2009/04 and the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, information on all grants for the 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years and the current 2012-13 financial year to date is published on the Department's website, including details of the recipients, intended use and locations. The full listing can be found at http://www.dpmc.gov.au/accountability/grants/index.cfm National Broadband Network (Question No. 1285) Mrs Markus asked the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 11 October 2012: (1) Is the National Broadband Network (NBN) on schedule to be rollout out by 2015. (2) Is the Blue Mountains region (including the townships of Springwood, Katoomba and Mount Victoria) being considered for the NBN rollout; if so, when will the rollout in this region commence; if not, why not. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. NBN Co Limited's (NBN Co) Corporate Plan of 2012 – 2015 (the Plan) indicates the rollout to communities announced in the three year rollout plan on 29 March 2012 are on track (page 36 refers). The Plan also states the entire fixed wireless and satellite networks are expected to be completed nationwide in 2015 (page 39 refers). (2) Yes. The NBN will be rolled out to 100 per cent of Australian premises, including those in the Blue Mountains region. I am aware that the Blue Mountains region has not yet been included in NBN Co's first three year rollout plan. The three year rollout plan will be updated in March each year with new locations and rollout information. On 20 December 2010, I announced a list of regional towns across Australia that will be receiving the high-speed fibre network. Four towns in the Blue Mountains local government area, Mount Victoria, Blackheath, Yellow Rock and Medlow Bath, were included on this list. Less densely populated areas are likely to be served by next-generation fixed wireless or satellite technologies, which will be completed in 2015. The precise optic fibre footprints will only be known when NBN Co completes detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region network designs.",177,Hacsu Support Worker Of The Year Finalists Were Soheil Yagenah Of Optia Incorporated
