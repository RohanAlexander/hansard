Those reviews, for which need very serious attention in the Senexample, go to a general review of the legisate committee, in the Senate itself, in induslation, a review of the HDTV quota artry debate or in here.

SoI think one can give serious considvider. When the government was giving coneration as to whether a review in advance of sideration to its legislation, for one dreadful the expiration of the moratorium period moment many of us thought the government would not be a sensible thing to do. That would seek to impose the same content based does run the risk that it opens it up to the restriction as it does on datacasters for the argument that the moratorium period ought web site itself. The legislation envisages that to be extended. This is not something I had a one-click entry by a datacaster customer to in mind-just to calm the excitable listeners a web site will enable access to the web site. who may be taking note in this area. Fortunately, there is no great attempt at that The government has also suggested by same content distinction, if only on the basis way of a second reading speech given by the that even the government by now would minister in this place that there be a review have learnt from its own online content legby the ABA of the question as to whether islation experience that that would be an imable as an unrestricted broadcasting service possible task. licence.

That issue needs to be accessible via a datacaster. There is also be the subject of serious consideration. A the question of interoperability and standatacasting transmission licence holder, undards, and the Senate committee hearings der this legislation, can only be effectively have seized on the question of whether the guaranteed 10 plus five years of transmitting Dolby audio standard ought to be preferred restricted datacasting content, however. So to the MPEG standard. This is really one for this legislation ultimately restricts that. The the aficionados, but the question in public parliament should reserve to itself the public policy terms here is whether one adopts what policy questions of competition, regulation is described as a proprietary standard or and revenue to the Commonwealth if there is whether one adopts a platform which one to be an uplift to essentially a broadcasting might regard as being open and accessible. services content transmission licence. So attention needs to be given to that point. A separate issue, which I have referred to, A separate issue which has popped out of the is whether streaming audio and video is a legislation and has not previously been rebroadcasting service. There is also a question ferred to in any great detail is the question of for the national broadcasters-the ABC and EPGs, electronic program guides.

182,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 11.00The following answers to questions were circulated: Family Court of Australia: Unrepresented Litigants (Question No. 1121) Ms O’Byrne asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 December 1999: (1) What process is the Government planning to implement to address the increasing number of litigants appearing in court unrepresented. (2) How is the Government addressing the rise in litigants in person, appearing unrepresented in the Family Court of Australia. (3) How many legal aid duty solicitors are employed in each State, and of them, how many are employed to cover out of hours magistrates hearings in each State. (4) How many legal aid duty solicitors are employed to cover out of hours magistrates hearings in the electoral division of Bass. (1) The Commonwealth has responded to the issue of unrepresented litigants as part of its reforms to increase access to justice. First, on 14 December 1999, Cabinet approved a funding boost for Legal Aid Commissions of $63 million over 4 years. This initiative will enable Legal Aid Commissions to make more grants of legal aid. The Government has also made considerable efforts to improve accessibility for unrepresented litigants by establishing the Federal Magistrates Service. The federal magistrates will provide a lower cost alternative for the determination of less complex federal disputes, including many family law disputes. The Federal Magistrates Service is expected to commence operations in the middle of this year. Some federal magistrates will be appointed to regional centres and all will be expected to undertake extensive circuit work. The Federal Magistrates Service will also make use of technology to assist those in rural and remote areas to take full advantage of its services. The procedures of the Federal Magistrates Service will be as streamlined and informal as practicable and will therefore be accessible to litigants who appear in court unrepresented. The Government considers there is a lack of empirical evidence to make conclusive judgments about trends in the number of unrepresented litigants appearing in court. There are a number of reasons why people may not be represented in court. People may choose to represent themselves, or they may fail to meet legal aid commission means and merit tests. The data available from legal aid commissions does not provide any conclusive information regarding levels of self-representation. However, two reports have recently been published which offer comments on the issue. The first of these reports titled -Litigants in person in the Family Court of Australia highlights the fact that the Family Court has taken up a number of initiatives to assist people who, for one reason or another, are unrepresented in court proceedings. The Court’s intiatives include a number of reforms to procedure and practice, as well as the publication of ‘The Family Court Book’ which is a plain English guide to the law and the Court, together with the creation of a website. Although the report provides some useful information, it relies on a small data sample and is unable to conclusively identify connections between the number of unrepresented litigants and the availability of legal aid. The report also states that the legal aid ‘cap’ does not appear to have been a significant factor in determining levels of self-representation. In the report Review of the Federal Justice System the ALRC provided figures that showed the number of cases involving unrepresented litigants represents about 18% of Federal Court cases, 41% of Family Court cases and 33% of AAT cases. The courts and tribunals are able to provide figures on the number of unrepresented litigants but due to privacy considerations they are unable to provide information about the reasons why a person is unrepresented in individual cases. This lack of information makes it difficult to establish any relationship between legal aid and the number of unrepresented litigants. The ALRC also notes that the environment in which legal assistance is provided is changing, and that this has brought about the development of new approaches to providing assistance such as the",124,Datacasting Charge Casting Services On Pay Tv Systems Under
183,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:expansion of public access to legal information resources through electronic media as well as through the traditional journals and newsletters and seminars. Research is being conducted by the Justice Research Centre on Legal Aid and Family Law, which is expected later in the year. In addition the Family Law Council is undertaking a project on litigants in person and has formed a committee for that purpose. The Government believes that merely looking at the number of people who are unrepresented in the Family Court tells us little about the community’s fair access to the legal system. Legal aid has never been, and will never be, available to everyone. It is a means of providing legal representation for the most needy members of the community, not of generally funding people’s private disputes. The Commonwealth is committed to helping people who do not meet the criteria for legal aid representation. We have made considerable efforts to ensure that all Australians have cheaper and faster alternatives to the courts for resolving or avoiding disputes. This is the best way to deal with the demand for traditional forms of legal assistance in the future. (2) In terms of the number of unrepresented litigants appearing before the Family Court, the Government is undertaking a number of initiatives. These are described in the answer to question (1). The Commonwealth is attempting to assist families in dispute by providing alternatives to litigation in the Family Court where possible by: placing greater emphasis on funding early intervention, advice and primary dispute resolution services which help people to resolve disputes early before they reach the stage where they need to go to court; the establishment of a national telecommunication advice and information line in the areas of family law and child support matters; establishing the Federal Magistrates Service. The Federal Magistrates Service will provide a cheaper, faster, more informal method of dealing with less complex family law matters. It will provide a more accessible option for litigants appearing unrepresented in family law matters; and funding both generalist and specialist community legal services to provide community legal education, advice and minor assistance. (3) This information is not available from the national legal aid statistics collection. As Legal Aid Commissions are state or territory statutory authorities it would be necessary to ask that question of the Legal Aid Commissions in each State or Territory. (4) This information is not available from the national legal aid statistics collection. As the Legal Aid Commission in Tasmania is a Tasmanian Government statutory authority it would be necessary to ask that question of the Tasmanian Legal Aid Commission. Minister for Defence: Meetings with United States Defence Force Personnel (Question No. 1127) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 February 2000: (1) Further to his question No. 957 (Hansard, 8 December 1999, page 9801), (a) at which plenary session at the Pentagon in Washington did he meet with General Shelton on 5 May, (b) was it at a plenary session of a conference; if so, (i) what was the name of the conference and (ii) how many persons attended and (c) did he at any time raise the issue of Australian concerns about Indonesian military activities in East Timor with General Shelton. (2) Did he meet with the US Secretary of Defense, William Cohen at a private meeting or at the same plenary session at the Pentagon; if it was a private meeting, what other officials from the US and Australia were present.

184,Mr Moore,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(ii) The Australian delegation consisted of 6 personnel and the United States delegation, 8 personnel. (c) East Timor and Indonesia were discussed at the plenary session. (2) I met privately with Secretary Cohen immediately prior to the plenary session. During this meeting I was accompanied by the Australian Ambassador to the United States. (3) Issues relating to Indonesia and East Timor were discussed during this meeting. The content of these discussions is classified and will, therefore, not be disclosed. Voting: Electronic Democracy Article (Question No. 1195) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 17 February 2000: (1) Did the Minister write an article in the Australian Financial Review on 14 January 2000 in which he referred to electronic democracy. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is studying new overseas voting technology, with the aim of providing Australians with the option of using such technology to vote in Federal and other elections run by the AEC. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether the AEC plans to trial the use of the Internet to allow people to vote in smaller fora, including votes by federal employees for agency agreements. (4) Does the Minister support the AEC work to develop electronic democracy. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether voters in Alaskan primaries had the option to vote for US Presidential candidates via the Internet. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether voters in the May 2000 British council elections will have the option of voting through their home computers, as well as through mobile phones offering Internet access, and if such electronic democracy is successful, it will be used in the next general election. (7) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the report by the California Internet Voting Task Force, A Report on the Feasibility of Internet Voting, January 2000, which was established by the Californian Secretary of State to study the feasibility of using the Internet to conduct elections in California. (8) What support is the Minister giving to the development of electronic democracy in Australia, particularly through the Government’s policy on datacasting. honourable member’s question: (1) I have been advised that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts did write the article referred to. (2) The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has advised me that it closely monitors the development of new technologies that may allow for the introduction of internet voting, electronic voting or automated voting into Australian federal elections, and other elections run by the AEC. However, the use of compulsory full preferential voting in Australian federal elections, which enjoys wide public support, places additional obstacles to the introduction of electronic voting for federal elections. In addition, the high level of public confidence Australians have in their elections and election results must not be jeopardised, and therefore no new technology will be introduced unless the Government believes that the highest standards of security and secrecy can be met. (3) The AEC has advised me that it has considered the use of internet voting in smaller elections and ballots, such as certified agreement ballots, but has no immediate plans for such an undertaking. (4) As the Minister responsible for electoral matters I fully support the AEC in its research and development programme. (5) In January 2000 the Alaska Republican Party allowed registered Republicans to vote by internet in a non-binding ‘straw poll’. Despite the remoteness that made such an option appear attractive, only 35 out of 4000 votes were cast via the internet. Alaska uses caucuses to select delegates to the national party conventions. (6) The Representation of the People Act 2000 (UK) allows local authorities to trial alternative methods for the casting and counting of ballots, as well as the use or extension of postal and prepoll voting facilities, following ministerial approval. Current information is that 35 local authorities will trial",130,Questions On Notice
185,Mr Fahey,"The Special Minister of State has supplied the following answers to thea variety of innovations at the 4 May 2000 local elections. Three councils have been identified as offering a form of electronic voting. The Representation of the People Act 2000 (UK) requires that such local authorities must report back to the Minister on the efficacy of the trial, particularly commenting on any increase in voter turnout, ease of use as reported by voters, any increase in electoral offences, including personation, and any additional costs or savings. The Minister is then to consider the implementation or prohibition of such alternatives for other United Kingdom elections. (7) The January 2000 report of the California Internet Voting Task Force, which examined the feasibility of using the internet to conduct elections in California, has been examined by staff of the Australian Electoral Commission. This report, which is available at www.ss.ca.gov, concluded that an incremental approach to the introduction of internet voting was appropriate. Whilst it was agreed that it was technically possible to launch a secure internet voting service now, the report canvassed legal, practical and financial considerations that mitigated against entirely replacing the current paper ballot. It should, however, be noted that the US Federal Election Commission recently described internet voting as “a novelty” that was “too expensive, insecure and corruptible”. (8) I fully support the AEC in its examination of new and improved methods for Australians to vote easily and conveniently, whilst maintaining appropriate access to polling facilities for all Australians. While internet access in Australia is not yet universal, the possible use of datacasting to deliver voting services will be studied at the time the Government considers any proposal to introduce internet voting at Federal elections. Veterans: Gold Card Eligibility (Question No. 1274) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 2000: Will veterans over the age of 70 years from conflicts other than World War II be eligible for a Gold Card; if so, (a) what will be the eligibility criteria and (b) when will they become eligible. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Any extension of the current eligibility for the Gold Card would need to be considered in a budget context, noting that any further expansion in the numbers of veterans receiving this Card would have substantial financial implications. However, it should be noted that, in a range of circumstances, Australian veterans from conflicts other than WW11 are already eligible for a Gold Card. For example, veterans with high levels of war-caused Disability pensions (100% & over); ex prisoners of war; veterans who receive a Service pension and satisfy the treatment benefits eligibility income and assets tests; veterans who receive both a part-rate Service pension and a Disability pension at a lower rate (50% 90%), are all eligible for a Gold Card. Federation Funds: Murray River Bridges (Question No. 1299) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 April 2000: Further to the answer to question No. 1147 concerning bridges that cross the Murray river between NSW and Victoria, with respect to the $44 million of Federation funds allocated for the replacement of the bridges at Echuca/Moama, Robinvale/Euston and Corowa/Wahgunyah, (a) what sum has been allocated to each bridge, (b) what is the estimated cost of replacing each bridge, (c) what criteria were used to select the three bridges for replacement instead of other bridges along the river and (d) were the NSW and Victorian Governments consulted on the priority in allocating Federation funds for the replacement of the three bridges instead of other bridges crossing the river. (a) Corowa $12 million; Echuca $15 million; Robinvale $17 million",131,Questions On Notice
186,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) Current strategic cost estimate for Corowa Bridge is $14 million. Cost estimates for Echuca and Robinvale bridges are unknown at this stage. However, original broad concept estimates were $18 million for Echuca and $21 million for Robinvale (c) Victoria submitted a series of proposals for funding under the Federation Fund. Victoria’s submission included a priority list of 5 bridges, including Corowa, Echuca and Robinvale. (d) The bridges were selected on the basis of Victoria’s submission for funding under the Federation Fund. Jenkins, Mr Mervyn: Suicide Investigation (Question No. 1303) Mr Price asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 April 2000: (1) Has the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security commenced investigating the suicide in Washington of Defence Intelligence Organisation officer Mr Mervyn Jenkins; if so, (a) when did he commence his investigations and (b) when is he expected to report. (2) Will the report be made public; if not, why not. (1) Mr Tony Blunn, former Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department, has, on behalf of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, commenced an inquiry into the propriety and proper conduct of the security investigation into Mr Jenkins which was being undertaken at the time of his death. (a) He commenced his investigations on 3 April 2000. (b) He is expected to report in June 2000. (2) As I said in my press release of 18 February 2000, although the Inspector-General’s report will be classified, it is intended to provide Mrs Jenkins with as much access as possible to the inquiry’s findings. Voyage Permits (Question No. 1304) Ms O’Byrne asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 April 2000: (1) In (a) 1995-96, (b) 1996-97, (c) 1997-98 and (d) 1998-99 how many applications for (i) single or (ii) voyage permits were (A) granted and (B) rejected. (2) On what grounds were permits rejected. The table provided below indicates the number of single and continuing voyage permit applications granted and rejected for each of the years 1995-96 to 1998-99. 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 Single Voyage Permits Issued 421 572 779 704 Rejected2 0 1 0 Continuing Voyage Permits Issued0 0 0 41 Rejected0 0 0 0 The low number of rejections is reflective of the fact that when an applicant is advised of the availability of a suitable licensed vessel, the application would, in the normal course of events, be withdrawn. A permit would only need to be formally rejected where the applicant wished to pursue the issue of a permit notwithstanding the availability of a suitable licensed ship. Permit applications were rejected because the Department ascertained to the satisfaction of the Minister’s delegate that a suitable licensed vessel was available to carry the intended cargo on or about the proposed sailing date.",132,Questions On Notice

Australian Defence Force: Smoking Policy (Question No. 1367) Ms Macklin asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 April 2000: (1) What are the current practices about the provision of free or subsidised cigarettes to Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel in Australia, at sea or on overseas postings. (2) Does the ADF have a policy on smoking. (3) What sum is spent on providing cigarettes to ADF personnel. (4) Are cigarettes sold at ADF establishment canteens and other facilities run by Frontline Defence Services.. (5) Does the ADF have a policy in relation to its workplaces being or becoming, smoke free. (6) Does the ADF provide assistance to personnel to participate in Quit programs and other cessation activities. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Cigarettes are sold to ADF personnel in Australia through messes and canteens. Cigarettes are purchased on normal commercial terms and sold with a sufficient markup to ensure that the relevant entity trades profitably. The Commonwealth does not provide any explicit subsidy. Cigarettes are sold in East Timor and Bougainville through Frontline Defence Services canteens and unit canteens. Again no explicit subsidy is provided by the ADF. Such sales are of course free of Australian excise tax. Cigarettes are sold to Navy personnel ashore through messes, clubs and canteens. Cigarettes are purchased at commercial cost prices and sold to members at a price that returns revenue to the outlet. At sea, cigarettes are generally only sold through the ship’s canteen. Cigarettes are purchased excise free thus cheaper than ashore. Ships on deployment to a foreign port are entitled to duty free prices in the same way as the general public. No explicit subsidy is provided by the ADF. (2) Defence, through Defence Safety Management Agency (DSMA)) does have a policy on smokefree Workplaces’ [Defence Occupational Health and Safety Manual (DOHSMAN) Ch7 Annex C]. It cross-references the Surgeon General’s ‘Health Policy Directive 225 Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy’ which actively discourages smoking and gives financial support to ADF members undertaking 'Quit' programs. Navy policy is limited to specifying designated smoking areas and to the quantity that may be purchased for landing ashore. A copy of both these documents have been forwarded separately to your office. (3) Commonwealth funds are not specifically spent providing cigarettes to ADF personnel. In commonwealth all canteen stores, in-direct subsidies are provided through the provision of facilities on a rent free basis. In East Timor and Bougainville, free labour has also been provided for the operation of the canteen. All canteen supplies are shipped free of charge on a space available basis. No commonwealth funds are spent on providing cigarettes to Navy personnel. (4) Yes. (5) Defence has a comprehensive policy on smoke-free workplaces. [DOHSMAN Ch7 annex C] – Smoke-free workplaces in Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence. (i) Smoking in all Defence establishments has been banned for several years. The current policy extends this ban and provides guidance to Commanders/Managers on how to implement the policy. The smoking restrictions also apply to contractors and visitors. (ii) Commanders/Managers are to discourage smoking and actively promote the aim of achieving a smoke-free environment. This includes assistance and encouragement to employees in their efforts to cease smoking. (iii) Frontline canteens and ADF messes implement the Government policy on smoke free workplaces. (6) The ADF does provide assistance to personnel to participate in smoking cessation activities. Health Policy Directive No. 225 – Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy details the use of nicotine replacement therapy in the management of cessation of smoking. Paragraph of the directive states that the success of nicotine replacement therapy is greatly enhanced when combined with advice and support from specialist cessation clinics or the treating physician.

A government appointed body is no longer required to perform these tasks. Employers assess the suitability of seafarers for employment in the shipping industry, as is the case in other industries in Australia.

My Department believed that it would be in the best interests of those disadvantaged jobseekers undertaking a program of Intensive Assistance within organisations who were not successful in winning Intensive Assistance contracts in the second tender, to move as quickly as possible to providers with responsibility for ongoing caseloads of such clients. Its preference was, therefore, that all organisations not successful in gaining Intensive Assistance business in the second contract period, release existing Intensive Assistance clients. The Department of Finance and Administration was advised in these terms. Ultimately the decision to accept or decline the contract variation which allowed organisations to hand back clients, was for each organisation to make. Employment National chose to accept.",138,Questions On Notice
