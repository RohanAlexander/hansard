I understand that this is alleged to be a typical example of the treatment of ex-British service men in Australia, and that, as the honourable member saye, the article has attracted some attention and given rise to adverse comment in England. It would be proper for me to say, in the first place, that I do not necessarily accept the statement in this article that promises were made, but the promises, if any, were made hy the State of Queensland, for which, of course, the Commonwealth is not in any way responsible. Secondly, the treatment of this ex-British soldier in Queensland is a matter of which I have no personal knowledge, and I am, therefore, unable to say whether, as a fact, it was as alleged. Speaking generally, I think it well that British people should be told that the Commonwealth Grovernment is not in any way responsible for promises that are alleged to have heen made or for the treatment which it is said has been meted out to this soldier and his family. notice in the article a statement that "" Brisbane is f u l l of out-of-works and returned soldiers without employment.''' I cannot say whether that is true. If it is, then the state of things in Queensland is very different from that in every other State of the Commonwealth. Lastly,I want to say, through the press, to intending emigrants from Britain, that the Commonwealth Government accepts no responsibility whatever for the position as set.out in this article. scheme which it is launching, the Commonwealth w ill see to it that immigrants are not induced to come to Australia by false representations. room in the Commonwealth for everybody who w ill work, hut I think I m a y safely say that there is no room here for a man who w ill not work.

The measure is one which can best be dealt with in Committee, and I do not propose at this stage to offer more than a few brief remarks. There are only three major alterations of Ithe Act here proposed. The Government are making provision for the application of quarantine to parsons landing in Australia by aeroplane. Smith and his party, and of Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh, demonstrates that within a measurable period there may be people landingin our country from time to time by air-way. The routes to be traversed will bring these travellers through the countries immediately to the The answers to the north of Australia, from which there is, perhaps, more danger of the introduction of diseases than from any other part of the world-diseases , too,"" which are the most menacing to the community as a whole. Eor instance, if we should get Asiatic cholera it will have come, in all probability, from the north; and it is considered advisable that there should be incorporated in the Federal quarantine law power to deal with persons arriving by air. The second major alteration provided for in this measure is one which will give the Commonwealth complete power, in the case of an outbreak of disease, to deal with all quarantine matters and override State legislation. such epidemics as the influenza visitation of 1918-19? members will recall the faroical state of affairs revealed during that epidemic. The position which arose proved almost intolerable to the travelling public, as honourable members-who , themselves, were subjected to indignities while journeying from State to State-wil l bear witness. Yet the Commonwealth Government were practically powerless to deal with the whole matter in a comprehensive way. We are now proposing to take power, in the event of a quarantinable disease breaking out as between State and State, to effectively override any and all State legislation. known during the recent epidemic that the Commonwealth Government had not then the power. us the power which we are proposing to take .now; and I am advised that the alterations set forth in the Bill will, at all events, prevent a repetition of absurd border restrictions, such as occurred a year or so ago.

The Bill proposes to repeal section 8 of the principal Act, which reads as follows:This Act shall be administered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I want to know what provision will take the place of this section? section disappeared with the passing of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Act must be administered by a Minister. amendments in. the Bill which are certainly very necessary. For instance, provision must be made to prevent the introduction of diseases 'by persons arriving in Australia by air, because they are bound to pass through what is known as one of the disease centres of the world.

I regard expenditure on quarantine as money spent on insurance. The Commonwealth Parliament ought always to be prepared to spend sumcient money to insure the people of Australia against the introduction of disease. owners are called upon to pay. called upon to pay while persons are in active quarantine, but while the quarantine stations are unoccupied the cost of their upkeep falls upon the Commonwealth. The Department must be prepared to provide medical omcers, nurses, cooks, and servants, and all the equipment of a quarantine station at a few hours' notice. It is only right that the ship-owners should pay for the maintenance of their passengers and crews if it be found necessary to place them in quarantine. It is proposed by clause 2 to insert a new section in the Act as follows:(1) Whenever the Governor General is satisfied that an emergency exists which makes it necessary to do so, he may, by proclamation, declare that any or all measures of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act shall, for sueh period as is specified in the proclamation, cease to have effect, and such measure shall thereupon cease to have effect accordingly. (2) The Governor General may at any time revoke or vary any such proclamation. I am not quite sure whether this Parliament has the poAver to make such a provithe sion. No one in this House believes more than I do in the principle that the Commonwealth should be supreme over the States, but I am not quite sure how far-reaching the recent decisionof the High Court may ibe in this regard. Certainly, if it ean be interpreted to mean that the Commonwealth Parliament has complete control over the States in health matters, that is just the power this Parliament should have in this respect, because some of the regulations which the States put into operation during the influenza EecentlyI had a conversaepidemic last year were absurd.

Could a person quarantined for small-pox be inoculated for cholera? any rate, that is not what we propose tb do. ment already have the power to inoculate persons in quarantine against the spread of any disease for which they have been quarantined. On one occasion the members of the Commonwealth Pearling Commission, who happened to be on board a steamer on which there was an outbreak of small-pox, bad to submit themselves to vaccination. Personally, I believe in inoculation, and I am only sorry that the ex-Postmaster-General( Mr quarantine is a national insurance.

As to thc other provisions of the BiU, I shall be prepared to hear the Minister's explanations in Committee. If this additional protection is necessary, I am sure that no honourable member will object to give it. -In my opinion, this Bill is necessary, and I hope the Minister( Mr Greene) will give some consideration to the recommendations made on Friday last by the Overseas Shipping Committee. That Committee has gone into the question of quarantine very fully, and has been distinctly told by the representative of the Federated Ship-owners that if an epidemic were to break out again they would simply refuse to undertake the expense entailed by the existing quarantine arrangements.. The liotomahana, I believe, was held up at Portsea for some seventeen days during an epidemic, at a cost of something like Â£1,200, in addition to the usual current expenses. At that time that-, and other vessels were being run by the Commonwealth Government, which had to foot the bill.

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that where disease is present in a State quarantine is worse than useless, At but where a State is clear, that State, in spite of any legislation by the Commonwealth, will endeavour, as far as possible, to keep itseK clear. I hope that when the Bill is in Committee the Minister will propose a clause enabling the Government to enter into such financial arrangements with the shipping and trading companies as are fair to all parties. A vessel with passengers aboard may be suddenly quarantined for a fortnight or three weeks, and we ought not to expect the shipping companies to pay the cost of maintaining those passengers in quarantine. KTo doubt, as the Leader of the Opposition says, issue regulations for the purpose of protecting the people of all Australia from the introduction or spread of disease, and all Australia should contribute to the expense in some shape or form. view that trade of any kind should carry its own responsibilities.",22,Quarantin Ebil L Second Reading

We have been warned by the Federated Ship-owners. cussedness of the Tasmanian State Government; it was not action by the Federal Government that brought that about. press my opinion of how the quarantine regulations were carried out on a former occasion by the Federal authorities, it would not be found too complimentary.

People are quarantined for the benefit of all Australia, and, therefore, as I say, all Australia should be prepared to bear some portion of the expense. member of the Sea Carriage Committee, I can say that that body has gone exhaustively into the question of quarantine, and has been told, in no uncertain voice, by the to his selling price, and the retailers in representative of the Federated Shipowners, that, in the case of another epidemic, they will refuse to run 'their steamers uuder existing conditions. I am not surprised at that decision, and I hope that the Minister, before we have concluded the consideration of this Bill, will consider the report of the Sea Carriage Committee, which will disclose to him the risks that we may have to run. We ought to deal with this (question of quarantine now, because after an epidemic has broken out, it is too late. The shipping companies are under an obligation not to charge more than a certain rate. No provision is made for the enormous expenditure that would be necessitated if an epidemic occurred again. During the last epidemic the ships running under the control of the Government incurred quarantine expenses to the amount of over Â£20,000, not taking into account the losses through laying up the ships, insurance charges, interest, and wages. The Botomahana alone had to pay Â£1,348 for the benefit of its passengers who were in quarantine. In one instance there was only one passenger on board the vessel, but that passenger had to be placed in quarantine, and the total cost of running the station had to be borne by the shipping control. The steam-ship Wyandra had to pay quarantine expenses amounting to Â£1,942 15s. 9d. Honourable members will see how unjust it would be to endeavour to force any company to run its steamers during an epidemic, and to incur these enormous expenses on account of conditions for which the companies were entirely blameless. It is not as if the disease was being brought to Australia by an overseas steamer. These vessels trade from port to port on the Australian coast, and it is impossible to guard against a passenger coming on board and showing signs of disease when the vessel is at sea. Both State and Commonwealth railways insist upon the passengers paying the quarantine charges. Why should the railways be exempt from these charges and the InterState steam-ship companies be compelled to pay them? It has been suggested that portion of the quarantine charges should bo debited to the companies, but that would necessitate allowing the companies to make an additional freight charge, which would be added to the cost of the goods. The merchant would add that extra charge turn would make their profit on the extra cost. Thus the charge would become a heavier burden on the community than if it were borne in the first instance by the Government: An epidemic of any disease is a national infliction, and the expenses",23,Quarantin Ebil L Second Reading

Nobody can say that the InterState steam-ship companies are responsible for any of these epidemics. If the Government consider it right that vessels should continue to r u n during an epidemic, why should the responsibility for quarantine expenses be borne by the companies? A f t e r all, quarantine is a form of national insurance. sent into quarantine for the benefit of the whole community; therefore the whole community should be taxed with the cost. In that way the charge upon the people would be less than if 'the Inter-State steam-ship companies were allowed to compensate themselves by an extra freight charge which must be passed on through the merchants and the retailers, and paid by the consumers, together with the profit on the extra outlay. Minister will give serious consideration to toria aud South Australia was cut off. this matter, and will realize the injustice that w ill be done to the steam-ship companies, and the risk of the Inter-State trade being discontinued.

In February of last year, when the influenza epidemic broke out in this State, the Premier of Western Australia was in Melbourne, and was prevented fro m returning to his home by the Acting Premier of Western Australia, who would not relax the State provisions as to people from Victoria entering Western Australia. The result was that the Acting Premier continued Passengers are to occupy that position for about seven weeks. That is another illustration of the absurd way in which some States, w ill use what they claim to be their sovereign rights in order to upset the claims of the Commonwealth.

These InterState restrictions are quite useless. carry the system to its logical conclusion, in the event of the outbreak of an infectious disease in , say, South Melbourne, residents of that suburb ought not to be allowed to visit any other suburb. If each State is to be shut off in this way we shall next have a proposal that each State shall be divided into districts for quarantine purposes. In connection with the influenza epidemic, there arose in Australia a condition of affairs which, I hope, will not recur. I trust that the Government have the power which they are seeking to exercise under this B ill , so that in the event of another epidemic the position w ill be better handled, and travellers w ill have justice done to tbem. oue will agree with the view expressed by the Miuister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene)' that travellers who are likely to spread disease have a right to submit to quarantine and to inoculation. Those who were associated with the Army during the great war are able to appreciate to the f u l l the value of inoculation and vaccination. We are all anxious to keep Australia free from those curses of the Eastcholera and small-pox. countries where cholera has been -the subject of much scientific research, a safe inoculation against it has not been discovered. While I was in the East, 98 per cent, of those who contracted cholera lost theiT lives. Only2 per cent, of the cases recovered. therefore recognise how important it is that every precaution should be taken to prevent the introduction of that dread disease into Australia... I desire now to bring under the notice of the Minister the unsatisfactory position w i th regard to the Quarantine Station, Sydney. most prominent position at the entrance to Sydney Harbor, and although the situation in years gone by might have been an ideal one, the time has come the influenza when, having regard to the large population surrounding the area, and particularly to the fact that thousands of people on their way from Sydney to Manly, the A f t e r the quaranmost popular picnic resort in Australia, pass it every day, another site should be secured. To orable member put the station? member suggest its removal to Canberra? Quarantine Station must be convenient for shipping purposes. The New South Wales Quarantine Stationf o r animals is situated at Five Dock, on the Parramatta River, one of the most populous parts of Sydney, in my electorate. There is a macadamized, road leading to this Quarantine Station, over which in many cases stock proceeding to quarantine have to be driven. The Commonwealth, however, w ill accept no responsibility for the maintenance of that roadway. I recently urged the Government to pay a portion of the cost of its up-keep, but the Department declined to recognise any responsibility in the matter. Honourable members w ill agree w it h me, I think, that stations for the quarantining of human beings, and also of animals, should be as far as possible from populous centres. Another aspect of quarantine that is lost sight of in Australia is that diseases may be readily introduced by means of the mail-bags that arrive from different Even' in those -parts of the world. When mails from oversea arrive at some of our big post offices, the bags are upturned, and as the contents are emptied out the atmosphere becomes thick w i th dust.

The honourable member for Franklin pense to which steam-ship companies are subjected in maintaining passengers while in quarantine. I hold no brief for the steam-ship companies, but since passengers travelling by rail are maintained at the cost of the Government when they are ordered into quarantine, I think that passengers by Inter-State steamers should also be maintained while in quarantine by the Government. So fa r as passengers from oversea ports are concerned, I think there is a good deal to be said for the point made by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) by way of interjection, that the fact that the shipping companies are responsible for their maintenance while in quarantine leads tbem to take precautious as to the class of people whom they accept as passengers from outside ports. Whilei t is necessary that precautions sliould be taken to prevent the spread of an infectious disease from one State to another. I think that since the people of the Commonwealth are of one race we should afford facilities for travelling under reasonable safeguards, and undertake the maintenance of travellers by rail or Inter-State steam-ship, while they are in quarantine. These are matters that can be dealt with better in Committee thaii in the House, but I hope that the representations I have made in regard to the quarantine station at Sydney Heads will receive the attention' of the Minister, aud that action will be taken by the Goveniment to remove it to a more suitable site, where there will be less likelihood of the spread of disease. I should like to refer briefly to the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to passengers on Inter-State steamers that are ordered into quarantine. During the last influenza epidemic many Inter-State vessels were held up, ancl their owners were put to considerable expense in maintaining passengers while they remained in quarantine. I hold no brief for these companies, but since they are in a position to pass on the cost so incurred by raising fares, and thus penalizing travellers, I tliink it would be better for the Commonwealth to undertake the maintenance of all persons held in quarantine. People are put into quarantine net so much fox their own benefit as for the protection of the health of the whole communityj and I feel, therefore, that the cost of their maintenance, while in quarantine, should be borne by the whole community. When a vessel from overseas arrives at a Commonwealth port with persons on board suffering from a quarantinable disease, I think that if the outbreak was the result of laxity on the parr, of the ship-owners or their representatives, the cost of maintaining the passengers in quarantine should be borne by the ship-owners. But it is unfair that persons who, in the course of business, have to travel from State to State, should be called upon to pay fares in excess of those that would be charged but for the fact that the shipping companies are liable for the maintenance of passengers on a vessel ordered into quarantine. tion of a person who was simply going for a 'holiday? demic, I do not think there are many people who w ill care to go holiday-making. on holiday during the last epidemic. ter is raising a point which is not worthy of consideration. W h y should the Government seek to treat travellers by water differently from travellers upon railways? Even the latter, I hold, should not be compelled to bear the costs of quarantine. But the point is that the costs are not charged to the railways; yet expenses in respect of quarantining a ship's company are to be charged to the vessel. In the light of evidence tendered to the Select Committee on Sea Carriage concerning costs incidental to rmining steamers, I am not surprised that shipowners should threaten to tie up their vessels during future epidemics.",26,Quarantin Ebil L Second Reading

59,Mr Watkins,"I think the Minisport, did the Committee call any evidence from the Director of Quarantine relating to this subject? visable to hear both sides of the question. was necessary to call the Director as a witness. I have nothing to say against the Quarantine Department; it did wonderfully good work during the recent epidemic. But its Director is a Government official, and, so long as some one else foots the bill, he will see that the last matter, and it is indicated that if another Wtter of the law is obeyed. I say that he' would be likely to follow that course, any way, if he were aware that the Government was not being required to pay. conveys a true indication of the viewpoint of the Minister, one can appreciate the reasons underlying his proposal to pass costs on to the ship-owners. -it is not fair to the travelling community. Persons travelling by water should be treated in the same manner as travellers on land, whether by railway, or motor conveyance. run by sea travellers, they should receive fairer treatment. If an epidemic occurs, every citizen of the Commonwealth should be treated alike.. owners to tie up their vessels, the whole community will be prejudicially affected. join forces with those honourable members who have objected to quarantine costs being foisted upon the steam-ship comipauies. Evidence has been tendered, on behalf of ship-owners, before the Sea Carriage Select Committee, and practically every member of that Committee has appealed to the Minister( Mr Why make the steamship companies meet Greene) to study the viewpoint of the companies in the matter of quarantine. Quarantine is a national matter; it is a form of national insurance. Why, then, should the cost be placed on the shoulders of any one section of the community? Most honourable members, I understand, have received a precis setting forth the enormous costs borne by shipping companies during the recent outbreak of influenza. I notice, fr&m the information tendered ,under the heading, ""Statement of Quarantine Accounts Paid"", the following items:Koonda, Â£245; Rotomahana, Â£1,348; Paringa, Â£632; Wainui, Â£596; Viotoria, Â£833; Wodonga, Â£620; Wyamdra, Â£1,942; Dimboola, Â£621; Dvmboola, Â£855. It appears that if a ship lands one passenger in an empty quarantine station, that vessel is debited with the whole of the expense of running the station for that one passenger. This is a most serious outbreak occurs in Australia the companies will be compelled to lay up their ships. I do not blame them. Not only is the question of quarantine charges involved; but what of the general loss in running their vessels? member contend that the companies paid those sums ? case-o n the face of the statement from which I have just quoted. get one penny less as the result of the institution of quarantine. total sum which they' were required to pay was in the neighbourhood of Â£20,000. thing. The Government paid. again. occurs the shipping companies will be required to meet the same total cost in similar circumstances. I agree with the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) respecting the point raised concerning differential treatment as between travellers on trains and in steamers. Why should not passengers actually affected be called upon to pay? the cost and let the railway authorities go free? shall not support the Government in their proposal to secure power to compel all persons quarantined to be vaccinated against the disease in regard to which they have been quarantined.

I do uot desire to cast any reflection on the medical profession, for there are several doctors to -whom I am under a deep debt of gratitude. It must be remembered, however, that there are as many schools of medical thought as there are of politics. catarrh, a very common Australian complaint, will go to some doctors who will conscientiously insist on an operation to straighten the septum. Another, with sore throat, will be urged to have his tonsils cut out, though the profession has not yet decided what are the functions of the tonsils. A sufferer from stomach ache may gc to one doctor who will insist on cutting him open and taking out his appendix; another will recommend a dose of castor oil and a few days' fast. Sometimes the operation kills; more often the castor oil cures. For every doctor who believes in inoculation for the cure or prevention of disease, you can discover another doctor who just as conscientiously does not belL/e in inoculation. I plead for liberty of thought and action. The Government propose that if a boat reaches an Australian port with a case of typhus, or cholera, or influenza, everybody on that vessel shall be quarantined, and everybody-health y and sick alikeshall be vaccinated against the particular disease. That is to say, healthy persons as well as sick must submit, whether they wish it or not, to the introduction into their systems of some poison or other. For the preservation of the liberty of the subject. I hope honourable members will uot agree to the proposal. If persons who are quarantined desire to be inoculated against the particular disease in respect of which they have been quarantined, then, by all means, let them be inoculated. But if a person objects to having his blood poisoned-for that is what it may mean-wit h the virus of that particular disease, why should he be compulsorily vaccinated ? I understand that our soldiers are generally satisfied with the results of vaccination and inoculation during the war. Numbers of them, I have been told, had to undergo one process or the other as often as fourteen and twenty times. These treatments, I am told, were a success. ever, to what extent the vaccinations and inoculations may have decreased the soldiers' vitality and reduced their powers of resistance. vitality reduced than to lose one's life. honourable member cares to consult books of reference concerning vaccination, he will be, able to peruse records of dreadful cases where people have had their lives mined -by vaccination. which will never end. are people who favour vaccination and people who are opposed to the process. I have already pointed that out; and I again ask why should those who do not wish to be vaccinated be compelled to undergo the operation ? Personally, I am quite satisfied to take the chances as I go through life. During the influenza epidemic I had to undergo quarantine at Albury. ThereI spent a tiresome term of eight days. So far as the efficacy of quarantine was concerned, people were coming and going to and from the quarantine area, and were in daily association with influenza patients. The whole business was largely a farce. We, perfectly healthy people, ran greater risks of ptomaine poisoning, on account of the bad food, than of infection with influenza. I got out of the quarantine area with a clean bill of health, and subsequently travelled through a portion of Queensland. In almost every hotel at which I stayed there were influenza patients. In some there were as many as twenty cases. However, I escaped scot-free, although many doctors, of course, would have vaccinated me if they had had the power. I admit that it is wise to quarantine either travellers on shipboard or contacts in a dwelling where there is infectious disease; but cannot the community be safeguarded by the maintenance of such persons in quarantine until all danger has passed, rather than subject everybody to compulsory vaccination? It is wrong for Parliament to attempt to interfere in this extreme manner with the liberty of the subject. I know, of course, that there are some people who",28,Quarantin Ebil L Second Reading

It is outrageous to expect private companies engaged in Inter-State shipping to carry what is a national burden, particularly when ' it may have been incurred through circumstances quite outside their control. I am aware that the cost of quarantining during the serious outbreak of influenza last year was very excessive, mainly owing to the conflict of Commonwealth and State authorities, and some relief, I understand, will be afforded by the passage of this B ill , which will make the Commonwealth the dominating authority should such an emergency arise again, but still every care will need to be exercised, and its exercise will involve considerable expenditure, which it is not right the ship-owners should be called on to bear. so; certainly not Inter-State passengers.

Sydney is living on the brink of an inferno, for there is only the thickness of a piece of galvanized iron between the quarantine station and the people of Manly, and school children of the quarantine station actually associate with contacts like myself, and attended school at Manly. I may also say that from Townsville right down to Sydney there was only one doctor who took any antiseptic measures, and that was .the Japanese medical man on board: doctor, in my opinion, did not know the ABC of the business. I can relate an incident which may cany some weight with the Minister. I was medical officer on board a steamer entering a foreign port, and the captain, acting under the orders of the ship-owners, came to me and said that I was to put down in the record the name of a disease different from that I thought a suspicious case on board represented. To honourable members who know me, I need not say that this I refused to do, and, in consequence, I had a very rough time. In another case, a captain was a little more courteous, and, possibly, a little more astute. There were two suspicious cases on board, and in reference to these the I am glad to say captain said to me, "" Don't you think the illness is so a/nd so ?""

Luckily, the cases did not prove to be dangerous, and, they having been segregated, we got through without trouble. So far as the English shipping companies are concerned, I have neither respect nor regard for them, though I have for the China Navigation Company, which gave me an absolutely free hand.

Several honourable members doubt whether the Government have the power to do what is proposed, namely, to override the legislation of the States under certain circumstances. Section 51 of the Constitution, which confers on the Commonwealth practically all the powers it exercises, specifically gives the power in paragraph ix. Then section 109 providesWhere a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of tlie Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, und thc former shall, to the extent of thc inconsistency, be invalid. Clause2 of the B ill providesWhenever thc Governor General is satisfied that an emergency exists which makes it necesOverseas Shipping Committee, and I am sary to do so, he may, by proclamation, declare that any or all measures, of quarantine prescribed by or under any State Act shall, for such period as is specified in the proclamation, notice until it was referred to to-day. cease to have effect, and such measure shall thereupon cease to have effect accordingly. Inasmuch as we have power to legislate in regard to quarantine, and in view of section 109 of the Constitution. I do not think there is any doubt whatever that this B ill w ill override any State legislaargument. The Act as it stands is very tion, and that is the view held by our Crown Law advisers. Of course, all such legislation has to stand the test of actual experience, but we believe that the provisions of the B ill w ill meet such an emergency as arose during the recent in fluenza epidemic. Tasmania, the authorities of which State refusod to permit people to land during that epidemic? which they could prevent people landing would be that exercised by virtue of the fact that the State had passed certain quarantine laws. Without being able to express a legal opinion, I think that if the authorities of a State tried to prevent a person landing, such a person would, under the provisions of this B ill , have an action against the State Government for forcible detention or something of that sort, andcould proceed for damages. [220] could not do that. that a person of means would take the first action, and once the claim had been upheld by the Courts, a person of poor means could easily find somebody to back him under the circumstances. However, I do not wish to labour the point at this stage, but w ill reserve anything further I have to say until we are in Committee. I tliink we have that power. I now come to the question raised by quite a number of honourable members as to whether or not the shipping companies should be called on to bear the expense, in the event of Inter-State vessels being ordered into quarantine. entiation between oversea and Inter-State vessels. ference. This question, I understand, is ono that has been investigated by the sorry that by some means or other that fact did not come under my personal I did not know that the interim report of that Committee dealt with the subject, and I had not an opportunity to peruse it. I wish I had had such an opportunity, because it would . have enabled me to for t if y myself with some information and clear on this matter. Section 59 of the Act of 1908 provided thatTlio owners and agents of any vessel ordered into quarantine shall supply the crow and passengers thereof with such wholesome and suitable provisions and medicines as are required by the quarantine or medical officer in charge of the quarantine station, or as are prescribed. The Act of 1912 repealed that section and substituted the following provision :The master, owner, and agent of any vessel ordered into quarantine, or of any vessel from which any person is removed to perform quarantine, sliall severally be responsible for(a) the removal of the passengers and crew to tbe quarantine station; (6) thc care and maintenance of tbe passengers and crew while detained at the quarantine station; (c) the conveyance of tlie passengers from the quarantine station to their ports of destination; and",32,Maloney Wa S It A Lunatic Compulsory Vote Will Be Recorded For A

(2) The master, owner, or agent of the vessel may arrange with the Minister for the carrying out of any responsibility under this section, and for the payment of the expenses tliereof, but in any case the Minister may take action if he thinks it necessary to do .so, and any expense incurred shall be paid by the master, owner, or agent of the vessel to the Commonwealtli.

That, of course, applies to all shipping. ThisB ill proposes to further amend that section, by inserting after paragraph ol of sub-section 1 the following paragraphs :(e) The provision of such medical, nursing, and other attendance on the vessel and at the quarantine station for or in respect of tbe vessel as the Minister considers necessary; and (/) tlic provision of such launch and patrol services and such supervision as the Minister considers necessary to insure the satisfactory performance of quarantine by the vessel and tlie persons and goods thereon. There is no doubt that, when the original legislation was passed, the intention Parliament sels coming to Australia should bear the whole burden of quarantine. bers who spoke this afternoon the equity and desirability of that provision. of the greatest precautions we can take against the introduction place upon the owners the -for paying the whole of the costs in the event of any vessel bringing disease to Australia placed in quarantine. which has been raised this is whether, in the event of an epidemic of disease within the not necessarily a disease imported overseas, but one that is endemic and becomes, suddenly provision should apply to Inter-State Mr Greene. It would appear that section 59 has been brought under notice by the circumstances of the influenza epidemic in 1918-19, which caused a vast amount of expense and inconvenience. I understand that the whole of that expense was borne by the Commonwealth. A t that time the vessels were under the control of the Government, the companies being paid Blue-Book rates for the use of their ships. The Commonwealth had to bear the whole cost of maintenance, and also quarantine. I am sorry that I have not had the chance of refreshing my memory as to the details, but I think I am righ t in saying that when that trouble arose an arrangement was made to divide the quarantine charges, half being debited to the Shipping Controller and t h e ' other half to Consolidated Revenue. Sea Carriage Select Committee contradiets that statement. reason: that the Auditor-Generali n sisted upon our claiming the f u l l cost, and then, after the money 'had been paidinto Consolidated Revenue, making a rebate. In the event of a similar epidemic arising, with the powers which we are now taking to deal w it h the situation, the farcical condition of affairs which was responsible for nine-tenths of that expense will never arise again.

Section 109 of the Constitution provides thatWhen a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of thc .inconsistency, be invalid. That applies only to those matters in respect of which we have the specific power to legislate. power to legislate in regard to quarantine. section 54 of the Constitution gives us power to legislate with respect to "" Quarantine.""

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [4.42]. -The Minister, in submitting this clause, is relying on that, section of the Constitution which gives the Commonwealtli the power to make laws with respect to quarantine. No doubt we have such a power. There is, however, a very much wider question to be considered, and that is as to whether the States have not the right to protect the health of their own people. That question has been, tested rather O r how we could freely. I was in Victoria when an outto receive break of small-pox occurred in New South Wales, about the year 1913, and I have a very vivid recollection of the Government of this State refusing to allow any one to come in from New South Wales.

In such a case, the Governments of all the other States w ill very properly take whatever measures they If we have, then the think necessary to protect the health of their own people.

I take it that there is no reason to fear what the honourable member for Maranoa has just been suggesting. I was surprised, however, at a certain statement of the Minister concerning the recent outbreak of influenza. It came as news to me to learn that the Commonwealth Government had paid the whole of the expenses incurred in connection with the quarantining of ships plying between the mainland and Tasmania, and that they had paid also the expenses of individual passengers on those vessels. I would remind honourable members that persons travelling to Western Australia who were quarantined at Port Augusta had to pay at the rate of 10s. per day. The conditions as between Tasmanian internees and Western Australians were similar. The Governments of those two States had temporarily run amok. They insisted on the observance of certain quarantine conditions. It comes, therefore, as a shock to learn that, while Western Australians were compelled to pay the Government 10s. per day for the provisions existing in the camp of detention at PortI f ' the honorAugusta-.for such it was originally, at any rate-Tasmanian s had all their expenses paid. They were put on board ship and taken down the Bay, and their maintenance was made a charge on the Commonwealth Government. The whole thing is unfair, and, had the circumstances been known at the time, there would have been a considerable stir raised in this House on behalf of Westingly, for I was among those who had to pay 10s. per day at Port Augusta.

He w r o t e to me in r e p l y as f o l l o w s : With .reference to onr conversation this morning, 1 would like to say that both I and my census staff have had under review the possibilities of taking a thorough-going wealth census. You w ill remember that the previous one was of a somewhat limited character, owing to the extreme urgency of the situation. Our experience was that, despite the threats of prosecution, the response was very partial, and I can quite understand that you think the occasion of a delivery of schedules to each individual is an opportunity which should not be missed of distributing questions regarding wealth. First of all, it would be necessary that the wealth census should be dealt with quite independently of the population census, ever! if the slips arc distributed at the same time, and we should have to get the population census dealt w i th immediately and out of the way before going on with the other matter, viz., the wealth census. In order to succeed with the wealth census it would be necessary for the returns to be made through the post, as the expense of retaining the services of collectors while that was answered (in addition to the answering of the population census questions) would be prohibitive. Further, persons-would certainly not give information about their financial position to the ordinary staff collectors, and that puts the question of using the class of collectors we are intending to use out of the question. It is for this reason that thc answers would have to be returned through the post, and confidentially to the Statistician, somewhat in the same manner as income and land tax returns are now furnished. The experience in the Taxation Department, which handles returns from a mere fraction of thc population, is that it is an expensive busiBILL. ness, and one in which evasion is to a great extent practised. It is probable that persons will not make true returns oven' to the Statistician, because they would be under the impression that comparisons would be made between their statements to the Statistician and those to the Taxation Department, and probably nothing would convince them to the contrary. S o m e MightI add here that a greater number ot people would probably make true returns in a time of national peril than they would make in time of peace,, and that, in consequence, less reliable results could be expected now than at the census of 1915. The data at the last wealth census (war) showed that quite a considerable number of people did not furnish returns, especially, if I remember rightly, in Western Australia, and we should have, therefore, to make the compulsion of returning the paper through the post a very serious one, and ono in which the onus would lie on the person of seeing that thc return reached its destination, say, by registration at a post-office. This would, of course, increase the cost. Of course, statistics to insure a real knowby such a wealth census, but w ill not the income and land tax returns give us, so far as the wealthier classes are concerned, all necessary information? These are now being improved by Mr Ewing, and he is taking into account our requirements in his new statistical compilations. If you wanted only an estimate of the aggregate wealth of Australia, I believe we could meet the requirements by means of the inventory method,which, you w ill remember, was sketched out in the report; in fact, the inventory' method is probably, on the whole, as good, if not better, than the other. We have also some check through probates. I might say, also, that we are intending to make an inventory estimate in connection with the population census, the point of time we propose to use being the 30th June, 1920-fiv e years from the date of the previous inventory estimate. General census experience shows that it is undesirable to use two sets of returns, one only of which must bo posted and the other delivered to a collector. I am not sure that you realize the extent to which many persons are capable of failing to do the intelligent thing,, even if the wealth census form were marked, "" To be posted only."" Already we are getting the printing of the forms (copies of which I am sending you) carried out, because some of them have to be despatched within the next few days to their destinations, in order to be in time, and it would be practically impossible in this case to",39,Poynton
167,Mr Ttjdor ( Y A R R A ) [ 5 . 1 5 ],"send the wealth forms with them; -hence even in' distribution we could not quite meet the case of simultaneous distribution. For this and other reasons, I am inclined to think that if the Government desires to take a wealth census it ought to be done quite apart from the population census, and, preferably, not within one year, as we will be tremendously occupied on the arrival of the answers to the population census queries. According to Mr Knibbs, it is doubtful and whether we should proceed with a wealth who did send in returns are in practicensus now; but there is no doubt of the cally the same position. The Treasurer need for one. while ago. and statistics, to be of any value, must, of incomes of Â£10,000 and upwards, in be capable of comparison. wealth census ?

I said that I thought that the Economies Commission was favorable to the proposal; but I find that that recommendation is not contained in its report. > In paragraph 33, however, the Commission specifically mentioned the necessity for cases of unnecessary and indiscreet expenditure being brought under the notice of Parliament and the country. of us have had a fair amount of experience of the working of the Public Service Act under one Commissioner, and I think we are entitled to ask ourselves where the policy which the Government are adopting will finish. Already this House has dealt with one Public ServiceB ill relating to the appointment of an Arbitrator. I think the late Postmaster General( Mr Webster) stated that the Arbitration Court had relieved the Public Service Commissioner of a big percentage of his work; but we learn from Mr McLachlan that, so far from that being the case, the Court has actually increased the work of the Commissioner. In future the Public Service will appeal to the specially appointed Arbitrator instead of to the Arbitration Court. The measure now before the House provides for the appointment of a Board of Management in the place of the Public Service Com' missioner, and we are promised a further Bill to establish a superannuation scheme for the Service. I hope that scheme will be extended to cover any individual in the community who desires to take advantage of its benefits. There is also to be an amending B ill dealing w i th the whole Service. I will not say that any one of these measures is unnecessary, but I think we would get on just as well with the Public Service Commissioner as we shall do with the proposed Board of Man26 of his reportConsideration has been given to the question whether, in view of the ramifications of the Commonwealth Public Service, and the magnitude of the interests to be conserved, any advantage would accrue from the establishment of a Public Service Board of three members in place of the present system of control by one Commissioner. State Service Act is administered by a Board of three members. In Queensland, Public Service matters arc dealt with by a Committee of the Cabinet, while in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia the Public Service is managed by one Commissioner. In new legislation now before the Tasmanian Parliament, provision is made for appointment of a Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner. The New Zealand Public Service is controlled by a Commissioner and two Assistant Commissioners. In Great Britain tbe Civil Service Commission comprises two members, but the functions of this Commission relate mainly to thc holding of examinations, and arc not administrative. The Victorian Royal Commission on the State Public Service, reporting in 1917, discussed the general management of that Service, and after full consideration of the arguments for and against the constitution of a Public Service Board, stated that, although a good deal might be said in favour of the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, tbey (the Royal Commission) were not prepared to recommend any change in that regard. It may be mentioned that for many years the Victorian Public Service was controlled by a Public Service Board of three members, and that this arrangement was eventually superseded by the present system of control by one Commissioner. In my opinion, there are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Public Service. Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment of a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding thc Commonwealth Service differ very materially from those of a State Public Service, seeing that tbe former Service is spread over nil the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public Service Inspector in each State, exercising delegated, powers of the Commissioner. In providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act, it would be disadvantageous to establish a Public Service Board, with the consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility. The existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to be conferred upon him. The Ministerf o r Works and Railways, in moving the second reading of this B ill yesterday, quoted from the report of the Economies Commission. There is no man in Australia-indeed , there are no half dozen men-wit h as f u l l a knowledge of the Commonwealth Public Service as is possessed by the ex^Commigsioner, Mr. McLachlan. He was specially chosen by The New South Wales the present Government for an exhaustive report on the Publio Service. Those of his recommendations which were",44,Gkoom

214,Graph 16 Of Mr Mclachlan's Findings,,46,Gkoom
215,These Are Mr Mclachlan's Suggestions,"the Public Service Association has forwarded to every memher of this Chamber a circular letter, from which I extract the following:The Public Services throughout the world have realized of late the necessity_for appointing Boards of Management to control the various Public Services, and on each occasion arrangements have been made for the officers to have representation on the Board. The great Public Service of tbe United Kingdom, upon which the Public Service of this country is supposed to be modelled, some little time ago appointed a Board on the basis of the Whitley Commission report to control the Public Service. The Board appointed consists of equal representation from the officers of the Service and. equalrepresentation by the Government. Reports to hand from this body show that the results of their labours have proved entirely satisfactory to the Government of Great Britain, and arrangements are now being made in England to extend this principle by having Boards to control the activities oE various Departments. It is proposed to grant .representation to officers on these Boards. ' Our request is that we should have but one representative on the Board of three, whereas in Great Britain they have equal representa. tion witli an independent chairman nominated by the Government. has proved satisfactory in a large Public Service such as there is in Great Britaini t is reasonable to assume that it should be equally satisfactory in such as we have in the Commonwealth. The action of the New Zealand Government is also worthy of note in connection with this matter. whicli occurred on the Public Service Board of 'Now Zealand, the Public Service Associations made representations to the Prime Minister of New Zealand w i th a view to being permitted to nominate a representative to fill the vacant Commissionership. New Zealand agreed, and on their Board of Management of three they now have a representative of the officers of the Service. It is also interesting to note that the Western Australian Government has' offered to the State public servants now on strike as one of the terms upon which the strike should be settled the appointment of a Board to control the Service, upon which the officers shall have equal representation. rived at, it is understood, as a result' of a special meeting of Cabinet. It is unnecessary to quote further instances of a similar nature, it being sufficient to say that even an institution like the English Admiralty, which is, I think, generally admitted to be a very conservative body, recently appointed a Board to control questions of general administration as apart from policy and also to deal with wages, conditions of employment, &c, for the staff other than the sea-going forces. On this Board of Control of the Department mentioned, the officers have direct re' presentation of equal numerical strength to that of the Department, and iu an official pamphlet recently to hand from the English Admiralty, the scheme has heen very favourably reported upon by the Lords of the Admiralty. Under the circumstances, and seeing that the Whitley Commission Report has been almost universally adopted and generally commended throughout the world, the Commonwealth would have an excellent opportunity of not only giving effect to this scheme, but, by so doing, they w ill set an example to the industrial world. The Prime Minister has frequently referred to the necessity for the employer and the employee getting together for the purpose of dealing with matters affecting industry. If the Prime Minister is sincere in his statements in this direction here is f in opportunity presented to him to put it into practical operation. In connection with the formation of the Whitley Commission, the Minister of Labour, England, wrote to the leading trade unions and employers' associationsI t should be made clear that representation on the industrial councils is intended to be on the basis of existing organizations among employers and workmenconcerned in each industry, although it will, of course, be open to thc councils, when formed, to grant representation to any new bodies which may come into Surely if such a scheme existence and which may be entitled to representation. The authority, and consequently the usefulness of the councils, will depend entirely on the extent to which they represent the different interests and enjoy the whole-hearted support of the existing organizations, and it is therefore, desirable that representation should be determined on as broad a basis as possible. In connection with the last vacancy The Commission statesWe are convinced, moreover, that a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employed must be founded upon something other than a cash basis. What is The Prime Minister of wanted is that the workpeople should have a greater opportunity of participating in the discussion about an adjustment of those parts of industry by which they are most affected. We venture to hope that representative men in each industry, with pride in their calling and care for its place as a contributor to the national well-being, w ill come together iu the manner here suggested, and apply themselves to promoting industrial harmony and efficiency This decision was arand removing the obstacles that have hitherto, stood in the way. The Government in t e n d to a p p o in t a B o a r d of t h r e e persons to ""manage t he P u b l i c Service of t h e Commonwealth . I am not in f a v o u r of t h e a p p o in t m e n t of three members to any such B o a r d .

W h e n t h e R e p a t r i a t i o n Bil l was under consideration in this Parliament., we provided for the representation of returned soldiers upon the Commission which was to be appointed under the. authority of that measure. should not the same principle be observed in relation to our Public Service? three members are to be appointed to the Board of Management for our Public Service, one of them should most certainly be elected by the public servants themselves. The adoption of such a course would tend to the smoother working of the Departments. There is in the Bill only one provision to which I desire specially to call attentionI refer to proposed new section 11, which reads(1) In addition to sucli duties as are elsewhere in this Aet imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties: (a) To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments. millennium. have provided for that. If the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) had read this clause it would have occasioned him great amusement. PerhapsI may be pardoned for bringing it under his notice. It reads11. (1) In addition to such duties as are elsewhere in this Act imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties:(a) To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments .by(i) improved organization and procedure; (ii) closer supervision; (iii) the simplification of the work of each Department, and the abolition of unnecessary work: (iv) the co-ordination of the work of thc various Departments; (v) the limitation of the staffs of the various Departments to actual requirements, and the utilization of those staffs to the best advantage; (vi) the improvement of the training of officers: (vii) the avoidance of unnecessary expenditure: (viii) the advising upon systems and methods adopted in regard to contracts and for obtaining supplies, and upon contracts referred to the 'Board by a Minister; and (ix) the establishment of systems of check, in order to ascertain whether the return for expenditure is 'i manifesto. Wihy Departments do not now perform the duties which I have just enumerated, If their services should be dispensed with . The proposed new section is based upon the assumption that they are absolutely incompetent. I would not like to make that charge against the heads of Departments with whom I have come into contact, nor would the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman). The 'Bill sets out what the Ministry hope to achieve by the creation of the proposed Board of Management. Personally, I believe that we are making a mistake in taking the control of the Public Service out of the hands of one man and placing it in the hands of three men. The Government have affirmed over and over again that closer relations should be established between employers and emT o bring about the ployees. They now have an f opportunity to give effect to the recommendation of the ""Whitley Commission in regard to their own servants. I regret that this B ill has been brought forward. I believe that instead of making for economy it w ill make for extravagance. It is proposed that three men shall be appointed as a Board of Management to do work which fro m practically the inception of the Commonwealth has been efficiently carried.out by one man. Believing that this is a mistake, I shall join with honourable members to defeat the B ill , or, f a i l ing that, to improve it . join my leader ( Mr Tudor) in opposing this B ill . I do not know that there is any warrant for the creation of . the proposed Board of Management. It seems to me that the Government are going in for the appointment of so many Boards that in this way our expenditure must be very considerably increased. In view of the happenings in almost e v e r j part of the British Empire, I am disappointed that the Government, having decided that a Board of Management shall be appointed, have not provided for the representation of the employees on that Board. I venture to say that no Board on which the employees are not reprcseiited w ill be satisfactory.

'This Board of Management will be called upon to devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of Departments, and is to bring about co-ordination of work. Who could be better able to deal with those matters than a member of the Public Service selected by his fellow employees for appointment to the Board? A representative of the employees would be. able to look after the interests of public the decision of only two or three men, servants, and also to assist his fellow Commissioners in promoting the efficiency of our public Departments. If economy is to be secured in those Departments, it is necessary that consideration should be given to the views of those engaged iu them. We have, for instance, in the Postal Department officers who have been employed there for very many years -officer s who have been thoroughly trained, and have a complete grip of the whole of its operations. Such men know better than any oue else where savings could be made. But, unfortunately, in the Public Service, as in most other walks of life, no inducements are held out to employees to suggest improvements. believe that savings could be made in many directions if employees were encouraged to make suggestions. In connection with most of our Departments, however, it seems to me that when a man sees an opening to effect savings he is afraid to make a suggestion lest by doing so he might give offence to his superior officer, and suffer accordingly. A public servant who was selected by the votes of his fellow employees to represent them on the Board of Management would be one of the most capable men who could be appointed for the purpose. would be elected. possessing the greatest ability and best adapted for such a position would alone secure the appointment. Service might be left to recommend to the Minister what system should be adopted by them to secure representation on the Board. selected by ballot, pr otherwise. 1 am convinced that if the matter were left in the hands of the employees, a most satisfactory appointment would be made. In that way a more desirable appointee would be secured from the Public Service than if the selection were left to the Minister. Under the Bill as it stands, tlie Minister will select the three members of the Board of Management. In making his choice, he will be guided largely by the recommendations of two'or three responsible officers. They will recommend those whom they deem to be best qualified for the position, but, after all, the selection so made will represent whereas a member of the Board who -was elected by the employees would be the choice of the whole' Service. It is our duty to endeavour to bring about mutual confidence between employers and employees, and we can best insure the smooth working of this Board of Management by determining that one member of it shall be selected by the Public Service as a man in whom they have confidencea man who they know will have regard to their interests and those of the whole of the Departments. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to what has been done as the reI sult of the, Whitley Commission. The scheme adopted on the recommendation of that Commission has proved a success in the Old Land. In connection with all our industrial Boards, we provide for the appointment of representatives of the employees, and the day has arrived when we should unmistakably show that we have regard to the rights of employees. By providing for the appointment of a representative of the Public Service on this Board of Management we would show that we recognised that the Public Service of the Commonwealth is in the nature of a co-operative concern. Officers of the various Departments would know that any recommendation made by them to the Board would be of some avail. To-day they have no incentive to make suggestions for the better working of DeThe Public partments. They carry out the instructions issued to them from day to day, and' tliere their duty ends. They may know tliat those instructions could be much imTheir representative might be proved upon, but it is not their duty to say so, and, as a rule, they are . afraid to make suggestions.

There is much to recommend this course. A man who has grown up in the Service understands all its details of working, and is in a better position to advise as to the best line of action to be taken, whereas a man wbo has not had this experience will probably overlook many important points.

241,"This View Is Confirmed By Mr Mclachlan,","we should be prepared to listen to his advice in this matter. Indeed, I venture to say that we dare not disregard his advice. More than that, he has definitely stated his views as to the character of men to be employed, and the salaries to be paid; and these salaries are below those suggested by this Bill. My view is that a Board of Management will get into a groove. Better results may be expected from the 23resent system, with the appointment from time to time of three expert 'business men. to investigate the general management of the Service, and point to any defects. By this process, we may expect to get new ideas and the benefit of an impartial judgment from men appointed fora specific purpose, namely, to make investigations into the general management and the possibility of greater economies in the Public Service. advice be accepted. I am greatly concerned over the additional expense which will be involved by the creation of this Board. That expense will not by any means be confined to the appointment of a Chairman at Â£2,000 per annum, and of two other Commissioners at Â£1,500 each. There is involved the creation of a department of administration which will entail greater cost than is justified. We should not have piecemeal legislation. cannot be disregarded. It has not been shown that advantages will emanate from the creation of the Board. Economy and efficiency can be brought about by the appointment, from time to time, when thought necessary, of temporary Boards of investigation to be composed of business experts. There is no need for this costly permanent organization. In the circumstances, I cannot support the Bill. We have established a Commonwealth Bank, with branches from one end of the country to the other, arid outside of Ausgentleman has been in the Service for some tralia as well. The Governor has been able to carry on a very successful business he can do better for himself outside. Here by the employment of very large staffs. No one can say that, under the sole control of Sir Denison Miller, the Commonwealth Bank has proved anything but a success. I would like to know why it is proposed to disregard the recommendaa Board of three. the Public Service Commissioner has had too great an amount of work to do? If so, we have relieved him. We have provided for the appointment of Boards consisting of employees and heads of Departments to sit around a table, and fix working conditions and rates of pay for every Department. Notwithstanding that, we aro asked to appoint an Arbitrator to administer the Service, whose salary will amount ' to Â£2,000 per annum, and on top of that, this Economy Government propose still another Board, which will cost, in the matter of salaries alone, Â£5,000 per annum. any end to these appointments of Boards? ment will come in next session with a proposition to appoint another Board to investigate the administration of this one. There will be a new Department created which, as the. years roll on, will develop and become in itself a huge branch of the Service. If all the Departments are to be run by Commissioners, what is the use of the Ministry? Surely the Ministers and the heads of Departments have some responsibility for their Departments? What have Ministers and heads of Departments been doing that it should now be deemed necessary to appoint this Board? The position is tantamount to a vote of censure upon them. Taking the members of the Public Service as a whole, they are the worse paid individuals in. the community. Unless we are prepared to pay good wages we cannot hope for efficiency. When a man employed in the Service perceives that outside employers are paying higher wages, he loses his incentive to do his best, and, eventually, if the public servant can secure an outside job, we lose him. To illustrate that point, I may mention the case of the secretary of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That years, and is now about to leave, because he has no "" pull,"" no influence, and he has had to remain where he was put without being able to advance himself.

We are d r if t in g into a state of chaos in the Public Service of this country. We are told that .there is one public servant for every ten taxpayers, but if we take into consideration the fact that there are many persons outside the Public Service performing services for the Government, for which .they are paid, we shall find that the proportion of public servants to taxpayers is more nearly one to five.

They will always count for something, because we are dealing with human beings.

The heads of public Departments controlling expenditure running into many thousands of pounds do not receive as much as men handling comparatively .small businesses in -the different capitals of Australia. Tbe same may be said of men in the lower grades of the Public Service.

ThereI have no doubt that the are many persons doing good! work in the Public Service who are underpaid, and there are many others who are overpaid for doing very little. Public servants in the country districts are, in many cases, overworked and underpaid. masters are in that position. serving in other Departments are also overworked and underpaid. In many of the b i ^ cities there .are hives of public servants, and people wonder what they can be doing. The system is bad, and that is the difficulty. We have heard of men working in adjoining rooms who send documents to each other registered. We are d r if t in g into a very undesirable position, and for this I do not altogether blame the Government. We have been driftin g in this way for the last twenty years,' and with so much experience of the Commonwealth Public Even the Treasurer ( Sir Service the Government should be able to devise some better proposal than this. I have no power. It would be a better plan to postpone The righ t the consideration of this B ill u n t i l we have passed the principal measure dealing with the Public Service, as we should then know what we require. The present Act requires to be amended almost out of sight. We should ask the assistance of the public servants themselves. They Bhould have some say in the matter. The time has gone past when men are content to be "" bossed "" and driven like so many sheep or bullocks, and the time has He cannot dismiss one. come when they should be given some say T h a t is in connection with the business in which they are employed. An y sensible man will admit that to give men a say in the management of the"" business in which they are employed will prevent friction and industrial strife. The public servants are human, and when they see men outThere should be side the Public Service doing better than, themselves they naturally protest. It seems to me we are reaching the stage, when the only way in which employees can protest successf ully is to cause trouble",54,Chapman Edenbest Man The Government Could Get To

I listened yesterday evening very attentively to the explanation of this B ill by the Ministerf o r Works and Railways( Mr Groom) in moving the second reading. gentleman since he came into this House, and I never heard him when he appeared to be more leg-roped or hobbled. His heart was not in the business. one knows better the growth of the Public Service since he became a member of this Parliament. ways been against Boards or Commissions controlling Government Departments. In Queensland, many years ago, we had a Board of Comrnissioners of Railways. for a time, but when they went out, Oh, Lord, what a mess they left behind them ! It took several millions of money to put the railways, into a working condition after they had gone. They made strict economy the order of the day. built no rolling-stock during their term of office, and they ran things in such an economical way that when their time was up the railways were run to a stand-still. ment is now. in the same position. The Minister has not told us why this Public Service Board of Management is needed. Honourable members who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament w i ll remember the difficulties with which we were faced i u establishing a Public Service, with men from six different States, i u each of which a different Public ServiceA c t was in operation. There were differences in the matter of emoluments, retiring allowances, and pensions. were accruing rights. our worse experiences in that, connection came from. South Australia. The Government, at the time were fortunate in selecting a man from New South Wales, who did the pick-and-shovel work of amalgamating the whole of the Public Service, and the superstructure of to-day stands on Mr Duncan McLachlan's foundation. that time some members desired that there should be a Commission of three charged with the management of the Public Service, and the matter was fought out more vigorously than honourable members are fighting this measure. It was eventually decided that there should be but one Public Service Commissioner. The Government of the day did wisely I have known the honourable and well in appointing him. I do not blame the present Government or any He was a stickler for the observance of No the law. If the law said that a man was said he had to retire at that age, because I have althe law said so, and when his t u r n came, and he reached the age of sixty-five years, he put himself out. I say that the Government, later, showed wisdom in appointing hi m as a Royal Commissioner They managed the railways to inquire into the whole of the working of the Public Service. Hisrecommendations, are a monument to the thoroughness with which he performed his task. He does not recommend a Commission of three members. They He recommends the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, and I am sure no honourable member would object to carrying out his recommendation in that reA s the Post Office Departspect; but the Government, in order to save their faces in regard to their proposal to appoint a . Board of Management, have provided a schedule of duties for them to undertake. For one thing, they are to effect economies and promote efficiency in management. But I want to know what work the administrative officers of the different Departments w ill be required to perform if all these duties are to be carried out by the Board? Have they not been lacking in some respects if they have not carried out what the Board is to be asked to do? Have not the administrative staffs endeavoured to effect economies and promote efficiency in management? If not, then some man is required, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has suggested, to weed them out and replace them by competent officials. One Ttian could do it more effectively thanthree.

SirW ill i a m Lyne said that it was to be a Board w ill be called upon to undertake, very small Department, which was not to cost more than Â£2,000 per annum, and that the necessity for its establishment could be well appreciated by honourable members. In my innocence I agreed that the Minister could have such a small provision, but next year that Â£2,000 had swollen to Â£10,000, and year after year it has continued to swell, unti l to-day it in bringing forward this measure. They is an enormous amount, and it has even been found necessary to follow the advice of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Eodgers), and "" make two blades of grass grow where one grew before""-ther e are now two Departments instead of that one little one, which, nineteen years ago, was going to cost Â£2,000 per annum. And now, in regard to the control of the Public Service, the Government propose to go one further than the honourable member for Wannon recommended; they intend to ""make three blades of grass grow where one grew before,"" by creating three Commissioners to do work which one Commissioner has done very well in the past; and, in order to provide an excuse for this unnecessary swelling' of the controlling staff of the Service, they insert in the B ill a schedule of multifarious duties for the Board of Management to carry out. If the Government want to give effect to the report of the Economies Commission, there is nothing to prevent them fro m giving to the Public Service Commissioner, and possibly an Assistant Commissioner, the power to see that the heads of the various Departments effect economy. Business to-day is developing upon the lines of improved supervision and better organization. Every day, small business concerns are amalgamating, with consequent reductions of staffs. I am sure that the Commissioner could do all the work the proposed Board could do. The Government's proposal is to apstead of the cost of this Board of Managepoint three Commissioners, at a cost of ment being Â£5,000 it will be nearer Â£5,000 per annum, to replace the Public Â£50,000 next year. The existing Public Service Commissioner, whose salary is Service Commissioner's staff is a very good Â£1,200 per annum; but, even if we paid one. I do not think there is one excess the present Commissioner Â£3,000 per officer in it . Every honourable member annum, and gave h i m the services of an has had to thank Heaven for the existence assistant at Â£2,000 per annum, I am sure they could do all the work which the and quite as well. No one knows better than honourable members and those who have been in the Public Service how Departments grow. Feed niggers in Queensland on bananas and see how they grow! That is how the public Departments grow. They grow right out of sight. I think the Government are ill-advised ought to let us into ""the k n o w "" ; they ought to tell us whether the B ill is brought forward for the purpose of providing jobs for defeated candidates. that sort is not what one usually expects fro m the honourable member. that Mr William Webster is to be one of the Board, and that the Minister( Mr. Groom) is to be another. not be two very good men? but not for this job. I think that the Minister, if he is after any appointment, would make a better arbitrator. good man for that position. to find with him, and if he takes the job I am sure the Public Service will get a square "" go "" from him. But the Â£5,000 to be paid to the Commissioners will be"" nothing to this great Commonwealth compared with the cost of the personal staffs they will require. As the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr. Riley) has said, they will each require a 6uite of offices, and I am sure that they will not be found hunting the auction sales for second-hand furniture, but that they will install the very best. Then they will each require a chief clerk, a senior clerk, and a staff of typists, record clerks, and correspondence clerks. We have only to compare the Estimates of the present year with those of past years in order to see how Departments have grown. In -",56,Chapman Edenbest Man The Government Could Get To

He has saved me, personally, a great deal of trouble which I have been able to place on his shoulders when mothers have come to me in order to get their sons into positions in the Commonwealth Service. The Commissioner has always said that there is no back door or royal road to enter the Service except by merit shown at competitive examinations. has given satisfaction not only to the House, but also to the Service, because to-day there is less grumbling in the Commonwealth Service than there is in any' State Service. I do not think that we can do better mendation for the appointment of a Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner, and leave the controlling staff as it exists to-day. it costs, but if we pass this Bill noone but God could tell us what we shall be called upon to pay, and He will not tell us. The Minister could not tell us. 1 ask him now what the administrative heads of the different Departments will have to do if tbe three Commissioners are appointed? lieved of .all responsibility in regard to the control of the work of their staffs and the purchase of departmental requirements. There is a clause in the B ill providing for excess omcers. -the Government in drafting the B ill had in their minds the possibility of there being wholesale excess omcers in tlie different branches of the Public Service as soon as the Board is appointed. transferred from the Department in which they are in excess to another they are dismissed. what is done now.. If the Public Service inspector recommends that certain omcers be classed as excess omcers, the Public Service Commissioner makes inquiries. Very often he does not follow the advice of his inspectors, and instead of having these officers dismissed, transfers them to other Departments where their services may be utilized; but, of -course, if there is no work for these unfortunate individuals they must go out of the Service. I want to know why a special Board of Management and a special B ill are required to do this work when all the necessary machinery is in existence, only wanting an impetus at the head to set it running. I am sure that if the duties proposed to be given to the Board were handed over to the Public Service Commissioner he would carry them out as faithfull y as he has undertaken his other duties. I say, without The Commissioner fear of contradiction that nobody has "" m o t h e r e d "" this B ill up to now except the Minister; on the other hand, every-' one has declared it illegitimate and no one will "" carry the baby."" No support from any part of the House has been given to the measure, and the Minister would be well advised to withdraw it , and allow the Public Service to be conducted on the same lines as in the past. The present system has been good enough We know what for us for twenty years, and every one of the States is copying our Public Service Act. In Queensland there was a Public Service Board controlled by the Cabinet, but latterly Mr Story, at one time Dnder Secretary for Education, has been appointed Public Service Commissioner, and is following on CommonThey w ill certainly be rewealth lines. As at present advised, I feel myself unable to support this B ill . All honourable members are at one, I think, in the idea that our public Departments ought to Evidently be run as efficiently and economically as possible. That object we all have in view, and the whole question is whether this B ill will attain it-whether , if the provisions' of it are carried out, it w ill lead to the more economical and efficient management of the Public Service. It seems to me that this B ill is quite i m practicable, and I can scarcely conceive of it being carried into effect. To begin with, we propose to look around for three men to perform the duties prescribed, and one of these men, as chairman, is to be paid Â£2,000 a year, and the other two Â£.1,500 a year each. Where are we to get a man at Â£2,000 a year who is capable of performing the prescribed duties? There are the duties of organization, of management, of procedure, of the training cf officers, and of devising a system of check in all expenditure. It seems to me that a man to fill this office must be a keen business man of wide experience; he must be an expert accountant, and if he has to point out where improvements can be made in",57,Chapman Edenbest Man The Government Could Get To

Where is the man possessing the qualificationsnecessary for the position ? Where is the man of wide business knowledge who is going to leave his present position, in which., presumably, he is getting less than Â£2,000, to take a position of this kind? is not a man possessing such qualifications in this community who is in receipt of a smaller salary than Â£2,000. If such a man is to be found, I say we ought first to offer him the position and be prepared to give him any salary necessary to induce him to accept it . He would be cheap at the money, if he could do all that is expected of him' under the B ill . The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) shortly indicated some of the duties pertaining to the offioes; and, to my mind, it is almost ludicrous that such, a list should be made out for the chairman and his colleagues.

We are not capable of arriving at a decision unless we ourselves go into the particular Department, do exactly what the Board has done, and have all the evidence before us, which is impossible.

It is absurd to think that we can get three men in this community, especially in view of the salaries offered, possessed of the requisite knowledge to perform the duties of investigation and determination as to the working of the various Departments. that they will each specialize in a different direction. a year man, and two Â£1,500 a year men, the latter, presumably, not so experienced as the former. Probably, as some one has suggested, the two Â£1,500 a year men will be ""under the thumb"" of the Â£2,000 a year man, and the determination in each case will practically be his. I should say that I quite agree with honourable members that this is simply embarking on an unknown and uncharted sea, and that great expense will be involved for no adequate return.

If that work is not the responsibility of departmental beads, whose is it? If it is necessary to appoint a Board of three to give effect to these proposals, the Public Service of the Commonwealth must be in a very bad state. I am not prepared' to admit that it is. It is most ridiculous to suggest that ihe Service is in such a state of disorganization, and that our public servants are so inefficient that we have to appoint three men, oue at. Â£2,000 a year, and two a t Â£1,500 a year each, to do what the Public Service Commissioner and the heads of Departments have failed toac'complish. I venture to say that if there' are not men in the Public Service who can perform these duties, there is no one outside who can. I have faith in the Public Service, and I do not go about the country discrediting it . If we caunob get satisfactory men in tlie Service to perform the duties set out in the B ill , we cannot get them at all; because it is only training and experience that makes men suitable for performing this important, work. What would be the Â»esult if we selected a capable commercial man from Flinders-lane and asked him to make recommendations in connection with the work of the Defence Department, or of the Department of the Treasury? there was any Department in which he' would feel at home, it would be i u the Treasury. If such an officer were placed in the Postal Department from the time Bis inquiry commenced unti l he had completed his investigations, be would be. consulting departmental heads and employees, and it is useless to endeavour to hide the fact that an outsider would be incompetent to make recommendations of any value. I am not concerned because it is proposed to pay to the Chairman of the Board Â£2,000 a year,, because I think' i the position warrants a high salary. I cannot see the necessity of having three poorly paid men w-heu one well-paid official would suffice. I do not believe in a system of so-called economy, whereby one man is appointed at Â£2,000 a year, and that is not economy at all. Up to the present, every member who has spoken has opposed the B ill , and apparently there will not be sufficient support to secure its passage. I now come to the question of the public servants being represented on the proposed B'oard of Management, and. in this connection, I do not think that we could do better in appointing a Board consisting of one or three members than by selecting them from the Public Service. If the Public Service organizations were to select one member, the Govern^ ment would not be able to select a more suitable person, because a man who had the confidence of the Service, and who had impressed his ability so much upon the members of the Service as towarrant his election as their representative, would be a worthy representative. I am not suggesting that every position should be filled on the recommendation of the various Public Service organizations, but it. the Government are determined that there shall be a Board of three, they cannot dobetter than ask the Service to,nominate one man. able member advocate three being elected from the Servicei f they were good men ?' the best interests of the country ; but I ' should say that one is quite sufficient.

336,Mr Richard Foster,"Yes, and the history of the last seven or eight years. There has been continuous diesatisfaction with the Public Service. We bave heard from time to time outside of Parliament, and just as loudly inside Parliament, that the public were not getting fair value for the cost of the Public Service. That has been proved by the investigations which have been proceeding for the last six years, and the results of which are in print. They cost a great deal of money, and some of them led to serious revelations. worth the paper oh which they are printed. true, if honourable members are satisfied to talk on the public platform at election time about these things, and then when an effort is made to make the Service efficient it meets with objections, and the Government, who, I believe, are making an honest attempt to remedy the evils, are told by bouorable members that their proposals will not be allowed to reach the Committee stage. Honourable members know that for the last been made, particularly from this side of the House, to introduce business principles into the conduct of the Public Service; but they have never come to fruition. In 1914 a proposal was made to create a business side to the Defence Department, and if it had been adopted, and a proper Business Board had been appointed, many millions of pounds would have been saved to tbe country. mended in General Hamilton's-report? it was. Buti t was proposed by the Cook Government before General Hamilton came to Australia. The report of that distinguished officer was a further reason why Parliament should have been prepared to deal with an important matter affecting .the interests of tbe country in a very particular way. made a practical proposal in regard to one Department. so; and if a Business Board had been created in connection with the Defence and Navy Departments, a great deal of money would have been saved. Millions of pounds were squandered because the business transactions of those Departments during war time were handled by men who knew nothing about such matters, and did not understand the first rucliments of business. best they could. When the war started we could not find men who understood these matters. ment should have found somebody who understood business principles. For years we have agitated for the introduction of business methods, into the PublicA n d the reports are not Service, but nothing has come of our efforts. The next best .step was to urge i the Government of the day to appoint an outside Business Board to investigate the methods of the Public Service. Honourable members know well tlie result of that investigation. Mir. LIVINGSTON -The Government never asked for the opinion of the business men in this House who were elected to deal with these matters. business men were representing the people, and they ought to have been doing their duty. A few of them have been six years proposals have threshing thi6 question in season and out of season, but they have never been able to induce the majority to do what should be done. The business experts who reported upon the Public Service did so without fee or reward, and disclosed alarming conditions in Department after Department. ThisB ill is, I take it , the outcome of that investigation. I shall reserve most of my remarks for the Committee stage, for I hope that honourable members will at least allow the B ill to get that far.

Under the Judiciary Act, which was passed by this Parliament in 1912, it is provided that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the [221] Justices; shall not give a decision, upon any question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision. At the present time, there are seven Justices of the High Court, and no decision can be given upon any constitutional question unless at least four Justices concur in it. The position is that Mr Justice Powers is absent on leave overseas, and upon his return Mr Justice Isaacs will take his leave of absence. We shall then have only six Justices of the High Co.urt within the Commonwealth. Some of these Justices will be engaged iu the work of the Arbitration Court, others in work connected with the original jurisdiction of the High Court, and others, again, in connection with its appellate jurisdiction. Tliere will, therefore, be the greatest difficulty experienced in getting together the necessary Justices to e.nable the Court to adjudicate upon matters involving constitutional issues. importance. we propose to amend the existing law by If we are going striking out the words "" unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words Upon the other hand, if "" unless at least three Justic.es concur in the decision."" This amendment will enable the Court, in organizing its itinerary, to carry on its work in respect cf constitutional questions. Practical difficulty was experienced even when seven Judges. were here, and were available. For example, an important case involving arbitral powers was heard. The Justices were equally addivided upon it, and finally Mr Justice .Starke, who had advised in the case, was obliged to take part in it in his judicial capacity,, in order to permit of a decision being arrived at. The object of this Bill is to enable the judicial work of the High Court to be carried on with expedition. It provides an adequate safeguard in that the decision of questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth will require the concurrence of at least three Justices. In addition, another amendment is proposed in section 3 of the Act. In 1915, an amending Judiciary Bill was submitted to this",64,Chapman Edenbest Man The Government Could Get To

371,Mr Groom,"Yes. For that reason,Chamber. Under sections 75 and 76 of our Constitution, certain original jurisdiction is vested in the H i g h Court, and in respect to other matters this Parliament possesses the power to confer jurisdiction upon it . Under section 75 of our Constitution, the High Court possesses original jurisdictionIn all matters(i) arising under any treaty; (ii) affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries; (iii) in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of thf-. Commonwealth, is a party; (iv) between 'States, or between residents nf different States, or between a State and a resident of another State: (v) in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. Section 76 providesThe Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter(i) arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation; (ii) arising under any laws made by the Commonwealth; (iii) of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; (iv) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. Under section 2 of the Judiciary Act of 1915, this Parliament conferred original jurisdiction upon the H i g h Court(a) In all matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; (&) in all matters of Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction;. and (o) in trials of indictable offences against the laws of thc Commonwealth. The distinctive feature of that Act was the granting of criminal jurisdiction to the H i g h Court to enable it to deal with indictable offences. form in which it was originally introduced, bestowed that power generally. But an amendment was inserted, at the instance of a member of the Opposition, providingThat this Act shall remain in operation during the present war and for six months thereafter, and for no longer. It is now proposed to repeal that limitation, and to continue in the High Court the criminal jurisdiction held since 1915. It is a reserve power, which is not to be used upon all occaUr. Qroom. sions. But it has been found helpful upon certain occasions, and it is only proper that it should be continued. The same Act gives to the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, in regard to the filing of indictments, similar powers to those possessed by the different State Attorneys-General. Under this B ill we propose to make that part of the jurisdiction of the. H i g h Court a permanent part of its judicia l powers. There are one or two other amendments qf a minor character which I propose to circulate amongst honourable members. In one of the States, at the present time, if we initiate a prosecution in an inferior Court, technical objections may be raised to the for m of procedure adopted, and there is no pivwer to amend the information upon which the proceedings are based. Accordingly, it is proposed to give to the several Courts of the iStates exercising the jurisdiction conferred under the principal Act power to remove any defects, either in for m or substance, which may be contained in any information. These, generally, are the pbjects of tlie B ill .
