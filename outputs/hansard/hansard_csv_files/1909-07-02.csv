0,Sqouse Of T,"iepresniiati'bcs. Friday, 2 July, loop. A.m., and read prayers^ ' wish to make a personal explanation in regard to the statements made last night by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. His statements are such that, on ordinary occasions, I should not take notice of them; but, as he last night charged'me with an action of an unworthy character, I conceive it to be due to the House and to myself to Set forth all the circumstances. . Let me begin by saying for the information of honourable members that Kellalac is a'township 4Iose to Warracknabeal,'and the'only one-iii the neighbourhood of that town which does not enjoy direct mail communication with it. At present it is connected with Murtoa, a place some 30 miles south. Five or six years ago ' the residents of Kellalac petitioned for a weekly mail service from Warracknabeal. The petition was forwarded to the postal authorities, and the request refused.. That was before I entered this Parliament. After becoming a member I asked the Department to again get a report upon the advisability of establishing the service. A report was obtained, and the request again refused. Subsequently, I suggested the establishment of a trial service for a period of three months. The Department informed me, in writing, that it was estimated that such a service would result in a loss of Â£ 4 3s. 4d., but that if that sum were made up by the residents the request would be granted. The sum was accord.ingly forwarded to the Department before the service was inaugurated. A mail connection was then given between Kellalac and Warracknabeal for a period of three months, and an extra week's grace allowed to permit of some other arrangement being made, at the end of which time it was discontinued. The charge which the honourable member for Hindmarsh. has seen fit to make is the creation of one of my political enemies, and of a newspaper which .supports a Labour policy, and is therefore opposed to the policy upon which I was elected. I regret that theses gentlemen have so descended to damage the character of a public man, and have found so ready an in : strument for the publication in this House of a trumped-up charge that had no foundation. The people of Kellalac are not connected by mail .with Warracknabeal,-which is the centre with which they .""do their -business, and, as I know on the personal testimony of many, are desirous' of the renewal of the service which was discontinued on the ground that a three months' trial showed it to be unprofitable to the Department. No later than the 28th JuneI received the following lettes from a reputable resident of the district who, I am satisfied, expresses the opinion of the majority of those who live there. He writes I have received your letter of x8th instant enclosing the communication from the Department re the Kellalac mail service. I saw MrD . McLennan in Warracknabeal yesterday, and he says that the payment allowed for the Ailsa service is 'altogether too small. We decided that (provided the Ailsa contract allows, of a change being made), we would call a meeting in",14,Setup

The honourable member went further. He described the old-age pensions scheme as madness. He' said the States should pay pensions. Does he intend to try to destroy the Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme, or was he simply fooling the people at the last election ? He said he would enter Parliament as an independent member, but the Age characteristically summed him dp, no later than the 18th May of this year, in these ' wordsMr Irvine stands for everything the capitalist holds dear and the toiler detests. everything to prevent a fusion of men like the member for Flinders with any party which has just views towards fhe worker and wage-earner. . What hope have the workers and wage earners from a fusion, with an honourable member who actually took away the rights of citizenship of a large section of the people of Victoria, and would have no hesitation in doing the same again ? Is the honourable member for Flinders ""seeking the same things by the same'means "" as those honourable members opposite, who have been . practically elected through the influence of the Age, and who have voiced the views of the Age year after year, especially in regard to Protection? What do tbey think of the honourable member for Flinders, who is against the new Protection, and was against the payment of a subsidy to the Imperial Government, and, in fact, against everything that he now professes with his colleagues to be in favour of doing ? Is it not high time that his constituents were given an opportunity to say whether they approve of his divergency from the principles which he professed before them only a short while ago? The honourable member for Bourke is now associated with a man who was said by the Age to ""stand for everything that the capitalist holds dear and the toiler detests."" There is everything to prevent the fusion of the honourable member for Bourke with men like that. I hope the honourable member is proud of his connection. Has he accepted the views of the honourable member for Flinders, or has the honourable member for Flinders accepted his? Which policy is to be carried out ? It is not shown in the Ministerial statement. We have heard so far nothing from the Government with * Mt. Hutchison. regard to the most important question of finance. We have a right to know the policy of the Government on that question. Not only should it have been placed before us in the Ministerial statement, but the Prime Minister should have given us the fullest information as to what is proposed to be done. Instead of carrying out the policy of his own party, or the scheme drawn up by the honourable member for Merndaa scheme that could probably be improved upon, but which was at any rate the foundation of the true method of dealing with the State debts-the Government make no proposal to take over the debts. Does that meet with the approval of the honourable member fer Mernda? Does he not know that it is a huge blunder to go on mixing up the finances of the States .and There is the Commonwealth for a further period of live years? The only effect will be to increase the anti-Federal feeling that is .unfortunately too strong at present. The Government policy is to do everything to placate the States, and to prevent the carrying out of those great works in which the Prime Minister professes so strongly to believe. Where is he to get the money to build the Western Australian railway, or to people the Northern Territory, or to carry out any of those other great schemes that have been .simmering in the minds of honourable members for years? These are further away to-day than ever, on account of millions of pounds having been handed over to the States that ought to have been used for our Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments. It is high time we had a Treasurer who knows something about the duties he is called upon to perform, and who is able to tell the House, "" There are the things we propose to do; here is the way to find the money."" The Â£2,000,000 that the Prime Minister has so generously offered to present to a country that does not want it, because the Imperial Government say that the strengthening of the Empire can best be brought about by the creation of fresh centres of strength in the Empire, would have placed the Post and Telegraph Department upon an efficient footing, and made it one of the finest services in the world. The Fisher Government wanted to create a fresh centre of Strength within the Empire by establishing our own navy, and honourable members opposite are going to prevent that. We know, although it is not definitely announced in the Ministerial statement, that the Government intend to adopt the good old policy of borrow, with the same result as has followed in every country where borrowing has been carried to any great extent. The three great curses of a country are land monopoly, borrowing, and absenteeism. There is not a word in the Government programme about dealing with absentees. Absenteeism has been the curse, not only of Ireland and Scotlland , but of every country. Tne Govern: ment make no proposal to deal with those men who contribute so little to the revenue -of the country, and draw so much of its resources to other lands. Why should they 'not be called' upon to contribute all that is necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth if they pay so little in other directions ? Surely they can afford to pay a good deal towards the defence of property that they ought never to -have been allowed to monopolise? Before dealing with the question of the caucus, as I promised last night, I propose to deal with some of the platforms of honourable members opposite. They cannot hoodwink the House that they represent only one platform. The right honourable member for East Sydneyfind the honourable member for Parkes have not taken the trouble to put a foot inside this Chamber to support the Government since the fusion was brought about. Does the honourable member for Bourke or the honourable member for Batman, or the honourable member for Corio, believe that the honourable member for Parkes will help them to get the new Protection ? Is he going to burn all the books and pamphlets that he has published about freedom of contract? I saw one of them on sale in a bookseller's shop in Adelaide the other day for the reduced price of is.' I doubt if it got a buyer, but the honourable member's feelings and views are precisely the, same to-day as they were years ago. He is a consistent individualist, and to thatextent I admire him. So strong is his individualism that he has laid it down in, I think, fifteen planks, some of which I will quote to show the class of men . with whom, honourable members opposite-have now associated themselves. If honourable members will look at the Brisbane Daily Mail of 8th July, 1908, they will find that the first plank in the platform of the honourable member for Tn.rkes is1. Free British and European immigration. Ts that the policy of the present Government ? reply to questions of that kind. Has the ""honourable member for Parkes said that he is now against free immigration? There is still no reply; but the country will reply when it gets the opportunity it ought to have at once. Is it surprising that there is no confidence in the' Government on this side, when we find one Minister and sup ; porter after another uttering diametrically opposed views ? . Then the honourable member for Parkes* saysThe early removal from the Federal statute , 1 book of all provisions which prevent the free access to Australia of white British and European citizens and their families, whether with or without capital, provided they are healthy in body and mind, and apparently capable of earning their livelihood. What Socialistic legislation have we to-day that any honourable member opposite is prepared to amend? ' Perhaps the honourable member for Echuca can tell me. Will that honourable member swallow what the honourable member for Parkes advocates? The House and the country have a right to an answer, but the honourable member dare not open his moiith, though he and those with him talk of the caucus methods of the Labour -party. On the contrary, I can speak my mind, as I have always done. Perhaps the honourable member for Moreton will give. us. the information. with the greatest interest. The honourable member for Parkes goes on to sayThe gradual and judicious amendment or removal from the Federal statute-book of those injurious Socialistic hindrances to the progress and expansion of Australian commerce and industry by which the' investment of capital, the employment of the people, and the development' of Australian resources, have been retarded or restricted. This means away with such Socialism as we now have. With such a platform it will be. impossible to establish an agricultural, bureau; and it would mean the destruction of our meteorological, statistical, postal, and Customs departments. I should certainly like the honourable member for Moreton to explain whether he agrees, and is in league, with the. honourable member for Parkes. self, not the honourable member for Parkes. the honourable member for Parkes continuesThe maintenance of popular freedom, the upholding of, the ' time-honoured and sacred prin1 The honourable member dare not ciples of individual, freedom and private enterprise wherever practicable and Compatible. with the welfare of the whole community. . . .

That is the programme of a supporter of the Government. The honourable member for Parkes is going to insist on a borrowing policy; or has he done, what I do not, believe he could be induced to do, namely, forsworn the views he has expressed ? The honourable member goes on to declare that .he is opposed toduplicating compulsory arbitration machinery, in order to secure a choice of alternative awards in regard to wages and conditions of labour, whilst the awards of the State Arbitration Courts that had not proved satisfactory to trades union standards were being ignored and treated with contempt. Has the Prime Minister obtained the permission of the honourable member for Parkes to say that the latter will support a union label, or, what is more likely, to declare that we shall hear no more of that proposal ? Perhaps the object has been achieved; and, after the workers have been led to believe they will get a union label,. the whole project is to be dropped. there be any clearer evidence of insincerity pn the part of the Prime Minister and his colleagues? When we on this side happen to be strong enough, not only to form a Government, but to carry our measures,' ,we may make blunders, though, as a fact, we cannot have made many up to the present, or we should have heard more about them. But if we find that we have carried a measure that does not do what it professes to do, two or three weeks will not elapse before it will be altered and made effective. policy of the present Government? taken time and experience to show the country that the Government are not in favour of such legislation as that mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes, and that when they had the opportunity' to pass it, they put it in such a form as to utterly destroy its effectiveness. sent I have dealt only with the platform of the honourable member for Parkes; but there are others. We have a National DeMt. Hutchison. fence League in South Australia, which formerly was popularly known as the "" National Ass.""-so well known as the latter that it was necessary to alter the name-and that body has issued a Federal programme. Honourable members in another placethough I am happy to say not many-and the Attorney-General in this Chamber, received the support of that Association; and To maintain and protect the constitutional rights of the States, and to defend the interests of the States against improper encroachments. I have never known the Commonwealth Parliament attempt to make any improper encroachments on State rights-indeed , it is utterly impossible to do so in face of the High Court. The programme of the National Defence League proceedsTo support the continuance of the Braddon clause of the Constitution, allocating not more than one-fourth of the net revenue of Customs and Excise duties to Commonwealth expenditure, and conserving the balance to the States, or, in its place, to support some equitable arrangement, securing to the States an equivalent under such clause. This is the programme that the Attorney-' General and some members of another place from South Australia will be asked to support at the next election. They will be asked to make the Braddon blot permanent, and thus cripple the finances of the Commonwealth. I am sorry that the Attorney' General is not in his place; but the only sense of shame on the part of honourable Could members opposite is shown in the fact that they dare not remain to hear the truth. said for them, anyhow. for which the country ought to be thankful. The platform goes onTo amend the Arbitration Act by providing for conciliation before compulsion, both the Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration to be presided over by the same Judge. Truly, I never saw such a confusion of platHow different is that from the forms in my l if e ! I have not with me a It has copy of the Orange platform, nor do I know quite how many platforms there are; but I have here the Liberal platform which was issued, with a great flourish, a few days before the fusion.

31,Mr Hutchison,"It is somethingAt the bottom the Age says-and , mark you, the platform is in black type, which might be taken as propheticThis platform may be taken as the irreducible minimum of the party's demands on the country and Parliament. And yet, only a day or two afterwards the programme was cut down by one half ! I have no desire to detain the House at any length, but I made a promise last night that I would lay bare the methods of the Labour caucus ; and, at the-same time, I shall show the misrepresentation of honourable members opposite in this connection. Adelaide Register of 6th March this year, the honourable member for North Sydney is reported as sayingDemocracy meant that the rule of the majority should have force in the Legislature, but, with a caucus, there was an extraordinary rule. I ask honourable members to listen, because I propose to enable them to know as much about the caucus as I do m y s e l f There might be a measure brought forward of which forty-nine members were in favour and twenty-five against. The caucus, met, and by fourteen to thirteen decided against it , and the twenty-seven members of the caucus, therefore, would have to vote against it, and the measure would consequently be defeated by fifty-two to twenty-two. Was not that an insidious design to undermine the constitutional system? That is a most unwarrantable misstatement of facts, because such a thing is impossible in the Labour caucus. We are elected on a platform, which constitutes our pledges to the people; and, if we were to go back on one plank, we should put ourselves in the same dishonourable position as that occupied W ill the honourable member apologize to the by some honourable members opposite. We people for this misrepresentation of the stand by our platform, because we have caucus, when I tell him that every mempromised to do soa promise put in writber of our party was free to vote as he ing, so that the world may understand-and pleased with regard to the fate of that Gono member of the Labour party dare go vernment? outside one of the pledges. transpire in caucus? beyond those in the Labour platform come before Parliament; and the honourable memtioned, notwithstanding that several members ber for North Sydney, like the Prime Minwere known to be adverse to the proposition, yet ister and the honourable member for Bourke, every one of them eventually recorded his vote have led the people to believe that, when any measure is submitted, it is taken When I tell the honourable member that the. into caucus, -and, after discussion and arquestion of Home Rule was never menriving at a decision, Labour members come tioned in the caucus, will he apologize to into the House and vote solidly. rived at? a decision arrived at in caucus yet on any press his views as long as the present fusion measure outside the platform. , No such lasts.. It would appear that what is. a vice measure was ever discussed or voted on. able member mean to say that I am a liar ? When I speak here I tell the truth. member is very funny ! able member isI shall not say what; but I regard him as a long way beneath contempt. I know that the honourable 'member for Flinders and other honourable mem-Ijers will accept my word. It will be supported by every member of In the the party. In no instance do we take a vote in the caucus on any question outside our platform. Indeed, a proposal to do so would be resented by us. If , however,a measure affecting a plank in our platform is brought before Parliament, we discuss in caucus the best method of giving effect to that plank. We often have different views as to the extent to which a measure may affect our platform, and we take a vote to determine the best method of giving effect to our pledges. Yet we find the honourable member f o i Bourke, to whom the methods of the caucus should be no secret,' wilfully misrepresenting us. He said recently :'. The caucus system of the Labour paTty interfered with personal liberty and political freedom; and the instance I gave related to the overthrow of the Deakin Government, when, as is well-known, a substantial minority of the. Labour party was against any change; but, a majority in caucus having determined to put the Government out, all members were compelled to vote the one way.

The Prime Minister declared that the Parliament should have been called together much earlier than it was, but as soon as the Fisher Government was assassinated he desired an adjournment of three weeks to enable him to bring forward something of the programme of which he had been talking since 1903. The real reason why he asked for the a'djournment was, however, to enable him to bring together his colleagues and as many as possible behind him, in order that he might explain that he was going to attempt to do something, but would really do nothing. If the Labour party were again 10 come into power, they would be able within a few hours to put their policy before the House, ['he Prime Minister wasted three weeksnotwithstanding that he professed to be anxious that Parliament should meet much earlier than it did in order to bring down a programme, which, he says, dates back to 1903. if he is still alive, for little of it will be on the statute-book if he has to rely on the support of those now behind him'. The Prime Minister has also been guilty of misrepresenting the Labour caucus. Well do I remember the speech which he delivered in regard to it at Ballarat some years ago. Later on, when Parliament met, I dealt with clause after clause of ihat speech, and concluded by telling the honourable gentleman that he had been guilty of misrepresentation that would shame a Turk.

The handwriting is cn the wall. It is only two and a half years since this Parliament was elected, and during that time there have been general elections for each of the Parliaments of the States, and one Federal election, by which the Labour party has gained no fewer than thirty-five seats, its gains being-in the New South Wales Parliament seven members, in that of Victoria six, in that of Queensland six, in that of Western Australia five, in that of South Australia five, in that of Tasmania five, and in this Parliament one. Could there be clearer evidence that the country is in sympathy with the Labour party? I am not afraid of what may happen at the next elections.

While supporting that Government, our party were twitted from time io time with keeping a very small group onThe Treasury bench. this side after the Tariff was passed was, """" Why do you stand by them? Are there not other men in the House that you could support?"" We were always .constrained to reply, "" We support these gentlemen, because of the alternative."" What would it mean to support the honourable member for Parkes, the right honourable member for Swan, or the honourable member for Flinders? astonished, how must the Democrats of Australia feel outraged, when they see those very gentlemen .now sitting cheek-byjowl with those who were then in the Opposition comer, and in direct opposition-? For weeks, in Sydney, a most startling religious mission has been conducted by Chapman and Alexander. Men who have not seen the inside of a church for years have been crowding to the Town Hall to hear something of the great Christian faith. Converts by the hundred and by the thousand are reputed to have been made. Probably the same feeling has reached the arena of politics. If the Prime Minister can assure the country that he has actually converted to democratic views the honourable member for Flinders, the right honourable member for Swan, and other honourable members whom he now shelters under his wing, he has really accomplished more than the Chapman-Alexander mission has clone. But is Australia deceived by the sort of clap-trap that has been uttered on that subject? Let us analyze the situation. I am one of those who have devoted their political lives to the Labour movement. -Onlookers usually see more of the game than the players do, and in closely watching the election campaigns I have always noted the fact that the two great factors are the -wire-pullers and the people. members opposite have behind them certain wire-pullers who have worked ever since the birth of the Labour party to scotch our operations and to prevent our ever obtaining a majority which would enable us to 1 put into effect our democratic ideals. They have pulled every string imaginable to get certain gentlemen into the House. the last election they pulled the wires in three directions. They placed men here as Although the duties imposed Free Traders to block the Labour party ; they placed so-called Liberals on.the other side to block the Labour party; and they put Conservatives into the Opposition corner. The people*, fooled by the wire-pullers, elected those men. But today the wire-pullers have gone further. The question hurled"" at us from They have absolutely triumphed in the House and flouted the people to such an extent that, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, they must see the writing on the wall. I can conceive of nothing that will save those honourable members opposite. It is useless for them to lay before the House a kind of shop window show card to catch the electors. Only a few days ago the Prime Minister accused How, then, must the people be our party of putting forward an election placard, and yet he deliberately puts up a show card containing sufficient proposals to occupy the time of this Chamber for much longer than the few months at its disposal. While I admired the Prime Minister from afar, when outside, for what I thought were his great Australian sentiments, I was not long in the House before I began to doubt him. I began to feel that the sentiments which' he had aroused from afar by his speeches in this House and at the Imperial Conference in the Old Land had no solid foundation. I found I had been somewhat betrayed, and I became suspicious. To-day I want to thank the honourable gentleman for unmasking himself before it was too late. We see him now in his true form. For a long time. I admired what I thought was his sincerity with regard to a land tax. We heard it filtered through our party time after time that he was favorable to a progressive land tax, but that as it had not come before the electors at the last election he did not feel inclined to propose it in the House during the life of this Parliament, and that if he was only left alone it was quite possible that he would launch a progressive"" land tax before the electors next time, and come back properly wedded to this party. That was when he was courting our party for a coalition. I thank God that we dodged Honourable that coalition, and I am delighted to see the Prime Minister properly unmasked, and in his proper place in this House as the leader of Conservatives and reactionaries. When I admired the Prime Minister for his Australian sentiments I never expected that he would deliberately betray the Australian position as he has done by taking up At his present State Rights attitude. When he refuses to introduce a progressive land tax, and mercilessly and heartlessly hands the administration of our lands over to the tender mercies of the Upper Houses of the States, he is committing the greatest act of betrayal that any professing Liberal could be guilty of. Surely he can no longer claim to be a true Liberal. every State the absolute obstruction of the people's rights with regard to land administration year in and year out. If the true' history of the land administration of New South Wales were written it would be a horror and a blot on our progress that would never be eradicated from the people's minds. We have a pretended closer settlement policy in New South Wales, but let me give an instance of what happens. In my own electorate one of the biggest estates has been recently attacked by the State Premier. quarter of a million acres of land granted to a company. party, the State Government were forced to* make some show of closer settlement, and tS:ey began with a valuation scheme to ascertain the true value of the land. owners, of course, want more than the Government are prepared to offer, and that valuation actually cost the State That sum is quietly passed on to the unfortunate selectors who have to take up the land in small holdings, although in another way they may be called fortunate in obtaining land when it is so scarce. is the sort of closer settlement with which the Prime Minister, who calls himself a Liberal, is pleased. Even then the'State Government has resumed only 100,000 acres, well knowing that the settlement of that area will increase perhaps by a hundredfold the value of the remaining land, thus allowing a wealthy company to reap an enormous harvest at the people's expense. is very doubtful if that company has ever fulfilled the conditions on which the land was granted to it. thing that the Prime Minister is content to leave in the hands of the States. stood him to state recently that the State Governments intended to introduce gressive land taxation proposals and fix the matter up, but .while I speak in this House this 'morning a debate is going on in the New South Wales Parliament, on a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, censuring the Government for not introducing a progressive land tax. cimen of the way the Prime Minister is 'flouting the Australian Democracy. He then Mr Fostet. pleads that the imposition of a Federal land tax would cause unequal taxation in the States, because the States already have land taxes.

I do not want to see the States injured in any way, but in That any-contest between the States and Australia as a whole it is the duty of those who have been elected to this House to stand by the Commonwealth and not to fool with the State Rights business. By State RightsI mean the claims of State authorities that prevent us from carrying out the true ideas of an Australian Commonwealth. The Prime Minister It aptually intends, according to the showcard that he has laid before the House, to make an arrangement with the That is the sort of States to continue some financial proposal similar to the Braddon blot. I underI thought for a time that the Prime Minister was a man who believed proin an honourable peace between the States and the Commonwealth; but there seems to be a determined attempt to precipitate war for at least another five years.

The Labour party have over and over again been accused of a desire, for unification, alA man who has been a Democrat and bethough we have never placed unification in our programme.

There is a railway to Brisbane, and, instead of providing branch lines to the coast, and thus saving a carriage of 300 or 400 miles to Sydney, the Government propose to build another parallel line along the coast. Under such circumstances, it is time we struck some blow at centralization in Sydney, and advocated smaller States, so as to give a chance for the development of the country. balance of ,Â£1,000.000 in New South Wales, surely there is no room for a crv of "" State Rights""? that State, during the last year or two, has been whining because he could not get enough money to carry on his Government. Receiving money that ought to have been spent on defence, and the reform of the post office, the New South Wales Government have abolished the income tax for the reason that they had too much money. The Prime Minister has evidently taken up the "" State Rights"" cry in dead earnest, and is certainly acting against the best interests of the Commonwealth in advocating the extension"" of the Braddon section for five years. on our national policy. Let us know before the Braddon section expires where we are financially, and tn'us have peace with the States. Surely, it is a betra.yal of ""one people, one destiny,"" when we find, seven or eight year's after Federation, that we have not yet evolved that most important step in a nationhood a proper financial policv. If I required, more evidences of the Prime Minister's perfidy to Liberalism and Democracy, I have only to point to his attitude in regard to new Protection. We have a deliberate attempt to block the wage-earners in all our industries from obtaining what is their just due. ported factory legislation in Victoria. him, for sitting cheek by jowl with those who are opposed to the unfortunate workers. comes a renegade, has a. bigger fight to fight than he who has never been a Democrat. For instance, against the Chairman of the Employers' Federation, who sits in this House, I have not a word to say; but for a man who has pretended Democratic views, and called for support as a Liberal, and who has become a renegade, there can be nothing but denunciation. For my part, I hope that the Prime Minister will get the whole qf the Conservative vote at the next election ; indeed, I am sure he will. But I also hope -that he will not receive the Democratic vote which has previously supported him-. When he goes to the electors; he will find that the thousands of votes which went to him from the Labour party will be bestowed elsewhere, and he will also find out how much his association with Conservatism is worth The proposition for an Inter-State Commission has been ably dealt with by previous speakers, and I take it to mean one thing only, namely, the prevention of the workers of the country from enjoying the full benefit of Protection. It has been hurled at the Labour party that they have no fiscal policy, and that amongst their numbers are Free Traders. That may be, but I can say that every member of the Labour party has pledged himself to new Protection, which, of course, necessitates the old Protection; they have come over bodily to Protection, on the one condition that the promise in regard to the new Protection should be fulfilled. However, I suppose I cannot growl much at the Prime Minister in this connection, because he Let us stand franklv admits his blunder and his position.

The Prime Minister must ever have had a lurking desire at heart to be Conservative, or he could never have abandoned his professed principles in the way he has. example has affected others, and even the honourable member for Perth has seen fit to take a step towards the ranks of Conservatism. If the honourable member for Terth feels that way, I suppose he is quite justified in doing what he has done, but he will have to face his electors shortly, and I can imagine what will happen. The Dreadnought scare was exploded on the people almost like a bombshell; and it naturally raised the question of Australian defences. The one absurdity which was pointed out when the public press started the agitation, was that the Australian people should be talking of giving Â£2,000,000 for a Dreadnought when we could not provide sufficient uniforms for our little cadets, or sufficient rifles for our volunteer forces. I scarcely like to describe the position of our defences; but, as a matter of fact, it is a disgrace to those who have held the reins of power since the inauguration of Federation. And who is the man mainly responsible ? Who is the man who has had most power and been most to the front? He is the honourable, member for Ballarat, the present Prime Minister; and at his door must be laid the responsibility for bringing the Defence Department into its present position. nought fanaticism reached its highest, we had, as leader of the Government, a man who could sit calmly by, uninfluenced by the press, or the new-born enthusiasm of anti-Australian men. Minister may feel proud, seeing that his name will go down to history as the one cool, calm man, able to strike out a straight line of duty-amids t all the roar, thunder, and tumult-in the direction of an Australian defence scheme on a solid basis. The present Prime Minister, at a moment when we are financially weaker than I hope we shall ever be in the future, proposes that two millions should be spent on a Dreadnought. for England, when the money could be infinitely better employed in defending and developing Australia. From the mere thought of a war between Great Britain and Germany the mind shrinks with horror. Carlyle, I think it was. said that war was the sum of all human villanies. men, wise obedience."" Mr Foster. obedience to the best cause of their nation. Just think of a war between England and Germany, which country we cannot regard Of course, his as we might Russia, or even Japan. Here is a nation which has gone on developing by leaps and bounds during the past few years. It is progressing in education, arts, mechanics, and Democracy, with a population increasing to an enormous extent. It is a nation willing to spring to arms as one man for its nationhood, and, further, it is a nation trained to arms, every able bodied male being called to its defence. Every representative, whether in a British Parliament, or the German Parliament, should strive for peace; and I am quite sure that the British Government are not anxious to precipitate war. Of course, a commercial war does exist between the nations on the high seas, but that may be described as peaceful compared with the bloodshed which accompanies war in its foulest sense. As to our citizen soldiery, I feel that neither the proposal of previous Prime Ministers, nor that of the present Prime Minister, goes far enough. Personally, I should like to see the training of men of over twenty years of age; though, of course, if we started by limiting the age to thirty, we might gradually reduce it. Considering our danger, the age limit of twenty seems to provide rather inadequate means of defence, including, as it does, Thank God. when the Dreadonly youths of sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen years of age. Can the Prime Minister, who proposes to present Â£2,000,000 to Great Britain-a ' present which is not wanted-sa y that there is enough money The late Prime to provide training for men from twenty-five to thirty years of age? I do not advocate . the training of citizen soldierywith a view of going to war. I abominate the very name of war, but feel that with well trained and properly disciplined citizens we should have a better and a greater Commonwealth. My brief experience of teaching has convinced me that the one thing necessary to straightenup the young Australian and make a thorough man of him is a course of military training. Some States are already taking action to have a medical inspection of school children to test their stamina and enable advice to be given to their parents as to the best way in which to develop them. That in itself will be beneficial; but the military training of our bovs #s they get nearer manhood has a value that none can discount. Eveni f we",26,Confidence

79,Mr Foster,"A very good i d e ahave to expend millions in this direction it will be money well spent, since it will tend to make us a better people and a better nation. There are several serious obligations at the basis of a proper system of defence. I ' contend, for instance, that no party is sincere in its advocacy of defence that is not prepared to support the nationalization of the steel and iron industry, since that industry is at the very bedrock of defence. A Prime Minister to be loyal to the best method of defence must be prepared to advocate the national ownership of the steel and iron industry, as well as of arms and ammunition .factories. I hope in the years to come to find the Commonwealth building its own ironclads, if they be required, and manufacturing everything else that is necessary for a poof spirited citizen. land and naval defence. When we touch the question of defence we invariably find ourselves face to face with that of finance. and JapanI f money is needed to provide for the nationalization of the iron and steel industries, and to train men over twenty years of age, let the wealthy contribute to a fund for that purpose. Let those who have most to gain, who are making the most out of Australia, contribute the most. Let us imitate the British Government and not hesitate to say that if necessary they shall pay a heavy tax upon incomes. If the Prime Minister were sincere in his advocacv of an adequate defence policy, and found that the Government were short of money, he might even be expected to propose a Federal income tax. By doing so, however, he would hit his friends and the wire-pullers on whom he has to depend for support. member advocate both a Federal land tax and a Federal income tax? cies of the situation demanded it, advocate both to provide for Australian defence. I would remind honourable members that the progressive land tax advocated by the Labour Pirty is not solely designed to proment of a national bank which will control vide funds for the defence of Australia. Its operation must, in the ordinary course of events, tend to increase our population, and increased population means a better defence. quired an income tax offers a splendid means of raising it. Every one admits the justice of a land tax, but whereas an income tax is paid only by those who have an income, -a land tax has to be paid by a land-owner to whom it applies, regardless of whether or not he obtains any income from his land. That being so, an income tax is the more equitable. The man who holds the land, however, should be prepared to pay his fair proportion to the cost of government. I should not hesitate to ask those who are making the most out of Australia 10 contribute the most towards its defence. Defence is very much in the nature of insurance. The military training of every citizen, the nationalization of the iron and steel and ship-building industries means simply a system of national insurance. It will safeguard those who are making money out of the Commonwealth, and the man who would refuse to contribute to the cost of such a system by way of an income tax would be very small compared with that of Germany seem to have realized the necessity for insurance against the possibility of invasion. We have heard a great deal in this Chamber as-to the desirableness of immigration, and the honourable gentleman now at the head of the Conservative party has been pleased to include in his programme some illusive references to it. Can it be said that a man is sincere in his advocacy of immigration if he will not support a land tax? Have we any hope of being able to <place a large number of men on the land unless we can break up the large estates? Can we hope successfully to settle people on the land unless we can also provide them with cheap money? We are not even doing enough in this direction to encourage the rearing of large families. Those who advocate immigration, but object to a land tax, as well as to a national banking scheme by which cheaper money will be found for the people, and their monetary transactions safeguarded, are not sincere. One of the greatest objects for which every Democrat must fight is the establishthe finances of Australia. We know what has happened to the United States of America for want of such a system. That great country is subjected periodically to Buti f money is urgently regreat financial crises, which plunge thousands of people into insolvency.

Yet when we propose the establishment of a national bank and a paper currency based on the solid bedrock of national security, we are told by some honourable members, who speak with their tongues in their cheeks, that they will support no system that is noti based on a substantial gold reserve. We are engaged in building up the Commonwealth, and it is our duty to see that our banking system is such that every man who invests money 'In Australia, or who banks his savings, will be secure from the dangers of panic resulting from bad finance.

A national bank would be able to grant a man offering good security a loan at 4 per cent, or 4! per cent., with the option of paying off the principal at the rate of iÂ£ per cent, per annum. That would mean more than ho years' terms. The establishment of such an institution is one of the greatest -supports to a young nation that could be devised. We have no occasion to go to Great Britain or France for an objectlesson in this respect. We have only to turn to that . young and great country-the United States of America-which , within a comparatively few years, has achieved a leading position among the nations of the world, and which, we know has suffered endless troubles and difficulty because.the framers of its Constitution did not take the precaution to provide for the nation controlling its own finances by means of a national bank. As far as the making of wealth is concerned, I am quitewilling that the other fellow should go on the land, or. go in for manufacturing j give me the control of finance, and I will make more than either of them. A few months ago the gold-bugs of Wall-street, acting with others in Germany and Great Britain, by making gold scarce, were able not only to make millions, but even to hit the people of Australia, since the result of their operations was a depreciation in the price of our wool and minerals. The effect of their operations miners there had been obtaining a reasonable price for their output, but as the result of the corner in gold there was a fall. The price of tin was reduced by one-third, whilst there was a very material drop in the price of. wool. The echoes of the high finance schemes' in America have man on the been heard in Australia. It, therefore, behoves us to see that the nation shall have complete control of it'sfinances,-and of its currency. I am delighted that the Fisher Government thought fit to submit a proposal for double currency. With, a double currency in force, the gold monopolists would not have been able to cause a fall in prices such as occurred on the occasion to which I have alluded. As it is, liabilities exceeding Â£ 2 c a j i be discharged only by a payment in gold, but if we had a national bank and a. double currency it would be impossible to make that currency scarce. When the late Prime Minister spoke of establishing a Commonwealth note issue, he must have contemplated the establishment of a national bank as well. I should object to the Treasury, as a Treasury, wholly -controlling finance. A national bank would have to 'act in co-operation With theTreasury, but the latter should not be the national bank. If the Treasury took up the business of banking, it would do so only to meet its own requirements; it would not enter into the commercial world. A national bank should be prepared to do all the legitimate business which the other banks transact, and to compete with them.'

I have noted the proposals of the Government with regard to the unemployed, whom we must consider in connection with schemes for assisting immigration. ployed and the unemployable have created a difficult problem in ail the countries of the world. With the man who will not work, and prays to God that he may never find occupation, I have no sympathy; but one of the cruellest positions in which a human being can be placed is to have to tramp about, day in and day out, looking for employment that he cannot find, although, perhaps,' he has a wife and little ones depending upon him. list against him. human, and unchristian, to tolerate in the Commonwealth a condition of affairs which puts men in that position. We might be disposed to despise Denmark because of the smallness of that country compared with the Commonwealth; but it has solved the problem, by instituting a voluntary and a compulsory system of finding employment for the unemployed. Denmark who cannot obtain work through the ordinary channels may apply to the police for permission to work on a cooperative settlement, where he will be provided with a home, food, and clothes, until he can get employment outside. makes it unnecessary for unemployed to walk the streets, and gets rid of beggars. When any one applies for alms a't the door of an Australian house, the householder, if he has a fellow feeling, gives him a coin, or food, or clothing. There is no guarantee that he will not spend the money upon beer at the nearest public house, and often needy unfortunates are turned away, because so many impostors are living on the game. There is no begging in Denmark. If a man is found to be without means of support, and has not voluntarily applied to be sent to the co-operative settlement, he is arrested, and, instead of being sent to gaol as a vagrant, and a stigma placed on his name, which is^what would happen in Australia, he is brought before a magistrate, and. after inquiry, sentenced to three vears' work, not as a criminal, but for the recovery of his manhood. The position of these unfortunates is due, probably, not to their own fault, but to that of society; and in nine cases out of ten, it is discovered that they have really lost their manhood. Through drink, through poverty, and through misery, they have sunk into a state in which they are scarcely responsible for their actions. What is the result of the Danish system ? There are in Denmark no The unembeggars asking for alms, and no unemployed. When men leave the settlement after three years' training, they get a certificate of character, and have become competent workmen. Why does not the Prime Minister propose the establishment of a similar system here? I do not intend to oppose all the proposals of the Government. I shall support any Ministry in a programme which I think will benefit the country, because it is no part of the duty of an Opposition to "" stone-wall "" everv Government proposal. A Government must of necessity occasionally propose legislation favoured by the Opposition. It would be . a pleasure for me to stand by the Government programme if Ministers would ""go the whole hog,"" and, taking the unemployed question in both hands, try to solve it. God knows that in Australia it needs solving. . The British market absorbs tens of thousands of pounds wort'h of butter produced on one of the Danish settleAny one in ments. So marked is the success of the Danish system, that Switzerland has imitated it, and so has France. Surely as Christian men we should do something to help those in the gutter. It is all very well to put. forward plans for enabling the This wealthy to become still more opulent, and the moderately wealthy to increase their possessions, but we owe also a duty to the dregs of society, to those for whom our social conditions have created want and despair. CanI regard the Government as sincere on the unemployed question, seeing that it is dropping new Protection ?

Today New Zealand has as much population as, under present conditions, she can find employment for, and, as work is becoming scarce, many of her people are emigrating to Canada and the Commonwealth. This, the newspapers say, shows that the country is ruined. That is not so. New Zealand still enjoys the benefit of the good legislation passed by Mr Seddon, but it lacks the national banking system, and a system for the proper control of distribution. Tariff, the Minister of Defence, -time and again, twitted the Protectionists with having no thought for the consumer. How much thought is shown for the consumer in the , present Ministerial policy ? Every member of the Labour party is determined to give each individual in the community what he legitimately earns. We are solid in regard to co-operation. The only way in which the producer can obtain decent prices and the customer. be properly treated is by the adoption of a co-operative system ot dealing. That is the method which we shall pursue. It is because Messrs. Joshua and Companyfear it, that they rise in all their might to .bluff us, and call upon the Tory press of the Commonwealth, which they practically dominate because of their large advertisements, to block at all costs those who believe in co-operation, and in eliminating the parasites of society-the middlemen. This partu stands for co-operation wherever it can be made to supersede private enterprise for the benefit of the whole people. If the Mr Foster. Prime Minister had been a true Democrat,' he must have gone in that direction, but he has never done so. I am pleased that the division is so clear and decisive, on that issue. It must appeal to every Democrat as a duty to see that, where wages have cessful by loans of money and all that sort of thing, the people shall get their full share of tlie benefits. No man can call himself a Democrat who will allow the Progressive land taxation has middlemen to rob the wage earner of every rise in wages that he gets by putting up the price of goods. This party has a great battle to fight in that direction, and the do not people would do well to consider the question of co-operation versus private enterprise. Another proposal of the Prime Minister is to take over the Northern Territory. That is at least one non-party measure before the House. I cannot conceive of any member, even -if he represents all the reactionary forces in the Commonwealth, objecting to the Federation taking control of the Northern Territory at a very early stage. The Prime Minister would have shown more loyalty to Australia if he had proposed to spend two million pounds on the Territory, instead of offering to Great Britain a Dreadnought. That country is like a new State, which holds out to adventurous men, such as were our fathers, the Australian pioneers, sn opening for enterprise and speculation, When we were dealing with the especially in its mineral resources. I feel amused when honourable members opposite accuse us of wanting to put all industrv under State control, and to make every man a wage earner. I speak for myself, as a member of this party, and have absolute freedom to do so, for I am bound only by my pledge to vote for the fighting platform of the party. I am pledged to stand by its eight or nine clauses, but on all other matters I am absolutely free, no matter what the caucus does. The caucus would never attempt to bind me on anything else. I cannot see how I could ever give a vote for the nationalization of gold mining or mining for precious stones, or, in fact, any speculative mining of that character. I can vote for the nationalization of coal and iron mines at once, and no man is solid on defence who will not strike out for the nationalization of the great steel and iron business, which must necessitate also the nationalization of the coal mines. there is a good deal of speculation about coal mining in New South Wales.",30,Confidence

But when they go out of their way to pillory us as "" whole hog "" Socialists, they are playing the game very unfairly. that we wish to break the marriage tie, and a few other things. have dropped the marriage-tie business, which is now in the limbo of the past. I was beginning, to believe that they had clrppped the caucus business also, seeing that they had adopted the caucus itself, and that one of their great methods of bringing about the present fusion was the use of the caucus. , But apparently they still intend to use, as a whip to scourge us with, not the caucus which we really hold, but the caucus .which exists in.their imagination or which they want to put into the imagination of the public. If they told the truth as to what we do as a caucus I should have no objection. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p-m. for lunch I was dealing with the important question of the Northern Territory. If I could thoroughly trust the administration of the present Government, I should have nothing but praise to offer them for a proposi' f adventure which brought our fathers tion of this kind j but, when I look at the composition of the Government, and -at their supporters, I am constrained to remember the maladministration of the lands and mining, not only in my own State, but throughout Australia. The two great interests that will have to be administered in the Northern Territory, outside defence, will be mining and land settlement. I do not ftnow that I need have too much suspicion of the 'administration, because during my examination of records I found a statement made by the Minister of Defef.ce, at one period of his history, which might lead us to suppose that he would be more Radical in his. administration than, perhaps, 1 should. The words of the Minister are as follows:I do not believe in paying for land at all. I believe in taxing it, and if we tax it to its f u l l unimproved value we shall have no need to sell it-indeed , no one will buy it. When a man wants a bit of land in this Colony he has to go hundreds of miles back into the bush, behind his strong neighbour, who has picked out the eyes of the country. We ought to tax the strong neighbour for every ounce of privilege which he possesses over the man who proposes to go into the bush. If we could trust the consistency of the Minister of Defence, we might rejoice at his presence in the Government in the face of such a calamity as the return of the present Government to power after the next election. We then might suppose that he wculd safeguard the interests of posterity; but I am not disposed to trust him too much, seeing that he has recanted in so many things, including, according to a Melbourne journal this morning, even the matter of Free Trade. Of course, as honourable members will understand, the more honourable members come over to the Protectionist side, the better I shall like them. There is no doubt that the development of ihe Northern Territory is linked with the question of immigration. In the United States of America the cry of ""Go West"" gave rise to population; and a similar movement has caused great settlement in Australia. We have now a great State in the Northern Territory, practically unexploited; and, if we make proper use of our opportunity, we shall be able to invite our brothers and cousins in the old land to. settle there. We must construct roads and railways, possibly at the expense of millions, and then we shall be able to call upon people to make their homes and a living there. If people who come are dissatisfied with the quiet, humdrum life of the ordinary settler-if they have within them the spirit to the gold-fields-the y can be invited to go North, where there is a great mineral area to be opened up, and where there are land values conceived of only by very few here. In my electorate there is a man who holds an enormous area in the Northern Territory; and he informs me that the main trouble is not too litt'.e grass, 'but too much grass-to o much exuberance of nature-wit h not' enough stock and people.

I ask the people of Australia whether they will rely on the present Government, with monopolists and others behind them who would exploit Australia for the wealthy only, to lay down a land policy or a mining policy for this great new State? W ill they not rather place the power with a party who would develop the Territory in the interests of the whole of the people? I went to Western Australia in the early days of gold-mining. orable member did not stay there ! of the,bad mining laws passed by the honourable gentleman's Government.. The mining laws, when Bailey's Reward was discovered, .were a disgrace to' an Australian State'. They .resulted in the locking up of ten miles square at Coolgardie f i o m , bond fide prospectors, in the interests of wildcat companies; and we do not desire to see the same in the Northern Territory. Can we trust the Treasurer, and those with him, to administer the Northern Territory, with the result, it may be, of its being locked up. in the interests of wild-cat corporations, who gamble in. mining stocks and shares ? Sir member is romancing ! mance to gentlemen who fall on their feet and make tens of thousands of pounds. Any -man who, by means of locking up leases by the score, has been able to exclude the legitimate miner, and thus create a big banking account for himself, may well regard the whole business as a romance; in fact, it is like a chapter out of Deadwood Dick. The mining history of Victoria., New South Wales, or Western Australia shows that this trouble has always cropped up-exploitatio n has gone on in the. interests of the few who desire to gamble. According to reports, there is in the Northern Territorv abundance of room for exploitation by bond fide miners. In Western Australia it was net until the first part of the boom was over that any ad'vance was made-it was not until there had been battles for months and months that there was any genuine developmentand we have no desire for a repetition of this history in the Northern Territory. \ appeal to the House and the people not ro give the Treasurer and his political associates an opportunity to administer the new State. We are told of the great difficulties that will have to be met in transmitting by railway and so forth the pro-, ducts of the Northern Territory; but to men in a big way., who finance large companies with millions of money, this cost will be only a small item. Probably the produce will be taken down to the coast^ and there shipped; and, though this may prove expensive, those concerned will be able to afford the cost. If the heart of the Government were beating behind every individual miner, we should soon find smelt-' ing works established on the spot. The) same kind of exploitation of which I am I did not-stay because complaining now goes, on in connection with the mining of tin, bismuth, wolfram, copper, and so forth, and the Government ought to see that the miners are not cheated by the middleman buyer. A companv in Sydney, for instance, may send a wire to its buyer on the fields, saying that their price for tin to-day is ,Â£70 per ton, while, as a matter of fact, it is worth to that company ,Â£120 per ton. Thus the miner can be quietly and legally robbed, although he is acting as a pioneer in the development of the country. 'Under present circumstances tlje miner is compelled to sell to this-private buyer; and this sort of thing has been going on for years and years in the Northern Territory the miner is foU lowed with crushing machinery and smelting works on a. national scale; in fact, the development of the country would justify such works at a very early stage, because there is nothing more helpful than treatment machinery'close at hand. Let us make the newest State of the Commonwealth an ideal one for the real developer, and keep off the hands of the wild-cat man. ' I do not wish it to be understood for a moment that I have any objection to the' legitimate mining company working a concession in a proper way. I hope that millions of pounds will be invested by speculators in the Northern Territory; all I am objecting to is the monopolising of big areas such as we have seen elsewhere. We must not forget also that the first miners who go to the Northern Territory will be the pioneers, and that! when the easy mining is over, these men with their families will become settlers.

I am not one of those who say that a man should not be allowed to hold a million acres of land if it is available and he wants it. .If a man has capital, and is prepared to take up and develop a million acres it is far better that he should be perLabour policy. mitted to do so-that he should use it for raising sheep and cattle-tha n that it should remain idle. Buti f we allow men to take up large areas under lease in the Northern Territory we must take care to provide safeguards for the man who is to come later on when closer settlement is possible. We have a noble opportunity in this direction, but are we to trust honourable members opposite with the development of the Territory? Are we to entrust to a Prime Minister who is opposed to a progressive land tax and to closer settlement here, the task of clearing the way for closer settlement in the Northern Territory? The position is so obvious that I cannot conceive of the people at the next general election returning to this Parliament any man who is not pledged to a progressive lan*d tax. bers opposite have promised to support a land tax but will not do so. by the honourable member is a pertinent one. We are now in the final session of a dying Parliament, and may* consequently expect a great deal of pretence. Indeed, many pretences of a regard for Liberalism and Democracy are to be found in the Ministerial programme. But let the people of Australia beware. What can they expect from a party of honourable members who have thrown overboard Free Trade, Protection and Liberalism, and who can fuse and confuse on all the pledges they have given to their constituents? Their sole object is to gain time and play the game of bluff. They play it well. The Employers' Federation and all the Conservative reactionaries of the Commonwealth know that, as surely as night follows day, so surely ,will the Labour party come into power, not only in Federal, but in State politics. Realizing this, they believe that their only chance is to gain time by a game of bluff. If they had a proper conception of the objects of our party there would be no occasion for them to do so. A We are willing to assist and encourage every legitimate enterprise. No business man in the Commonwealth has cause to fear our legislation.

He is certainly one of the most kindly men of his class whom I have ever met. But I can conceive, however, of some honourable members having been taught the doctrine of "" self, self, self,"" from the cradle to manhood. They undoubtedly mumble every day the Lord's Prayer. They pray, "" Give us this day our daily bread,"" .but it has never been pointed out to them that they should practise what they preach; that a religion that cannot be practised is no good, and that the Christian who attends a Christian church is expected to endeavour to make Christianity a law of the land. Some honourable members opposite do not appear to realize what is expected of them in this regard. How can we hope to make them realize it? A boy needs to be trained from the first in the right path, and when he readies manhood he will have implanted in him the spirit of Democracy, and will be prepared to fight his own battles. It is in this respect that the Labour party stand in striking contrast to those who would retard progress and Democracy. They fear that we would injure them. That fear is groundless. We have -no desire to injure any one, but we shall certainly endeavour to block those who would exploit their fellow men or seek special privileges.

It is said that there is plenty of' room in this country for immigrants without means, but let any honourable member hump his bluey round Australia, and see if he can get work. It is the unskilled labourer for whom the Governments of the States are angling. He is a useful man when a strike is threatening, and can be used to block rises in wages. I do not blame the Ministerialists for supporting die introduction of such labour; that is consistent with their policy; better, because we have the necessary but I shall fight tooth and nail against every attempt to bring here men without means until there is work for them to do.

When we get an Australian sentiment, we shall have the birth of a bright, new, young nation, proud of its nationality. Hitherto the States have pursued a lamentable policy, which has landed the country in a public debt amounting to tens of millions of pounds. I am proud of the Commonwealth Parliament, because it has pronounced against public borrowing. I have told the people that they need never be afraid that this Parliament will increase the public debt by borrowing from the German Jews of London', pawning the country's inheritance.

For what reason do we require six State Governors? lo the personnel of those gentlemen, but I do object to the expense of their upkeep.

The matter may be looked at from different points of view, but it is the same chap that pays the taxes all the while. No step has yet been taken towards effecting that economy, and our party are pilloried as unificationists and wreckers of the States that it has been possible to dig up old Acts when they propose that a, start should be made in that direction. It is high time that the people were appealed to for a direct mandate on the question. I challenge honourable members opposite to put it to the people by means of a referendum. If they did, they would soon discover what the people think about the existence of six State Governors and twelve State Houses. put that question to the people. honourable member to take a brain bath before he enters into a discussion of these intricate problems.

The Postmaster-General won my admiration by the speeches that he made on that occasion, and one honourable senator put in the first work that led to his ultimate election to this Parliament, but the one fact that was borne in upon me, and that remains with me to-day as fresh as ever, was that in all Constitutions the greatest necessity is that the people should be able to alter them when they choose, to fit the necessities of the time. Why should we be bound by dead men's laws? The curse of legislation in this young Australia is of George the Fourth, or other enactments that were passed when men were only semisavages as compared with what they are to-day. Any Constitution should be somewhat difficult of alteration, and I for one do not want to see amendments made too frequently, but the Constitution must be subservient to the people, or how are we to have a true Democracy ? The true spirit of Democracy, as we gradually learn and develop, is to drive out of our path everything that prevents effect being given to the people's will. When honourable members interject in the way the honourable member for Corangamite did just now, they are simply expressing the Tory sentiments which are in them, and must come out.

It is sheer hypocrisy for any man to pretend that the policy submitted by the Prime Minister is for this session only. It is simply an electioneering .poster, and it is well that the public should know it. They should be shown the true tendency of affairs, because, after all, true history is a history of tendencies, not of events. In concluding, I should like to apply to the present situation the great discovery of the ton, of New Zealand. That law is an astronomical one. There are supposed to be in the firmament dead suns, or dead bodies, rushing through space. When they collide there is a sudden livening up, and, instead of solid bodies, we get a gaseous formation. We.Jhave had in this Chamber an impact of three such bodies. When that sort of thing happens, lesser bodies and satellites, like meteorites and our own I heard some time ago a moon, shoot off. They are attracted by the main body of the fusion, or go off in an orbit of their own. There has been a similar throwing off of smaller bodies in this House, of which the separation of the only four true Liberals in the so-called Liberal party is an instance. A lot of other sparks have been thrown off in other directions, but so contrary are the elemental sentiments within the. bodies which have impacted the Free Trade body, the so-called Liberal-Protectionist body, and the Conservative bodyso different are they, that we can have no hope of good results from their collision.

With elective Ministries we should not have continual fault-finding. Leader of the Opposition, and none more strongly, finding fault with whatever proposal was enunciated by the Prime Minister, until one evening I told him that, even if God were to send an angel down to produce a Bill for the Ministry, he would object to the measure. Contrast the demeanour of the Minister of Defence now with that he exhibited night after night during the life of the late Government, of which the honourable member for Ballarat was at the head. Now he is oismiling countenance, and softly spoken words: and we are led to ask whether there is such a mighty difference between the position on the left of the Speaker and the position on the right. opinion this change of demeanour is not justified by the transfer from the leadership of the Opposition to the membership of the Government. If we had elective Ministries any honourable member who had a grievance could assail, not the whole Cabinet, but only the Minister to blame. Under present circumstances, if one Minister be found at fault the whole 'Cabinet must resign; and we have to go through nil the tomfoolery of votes of want of confidence, and so forth. The people of Australia have the widest franchise in the world; and, had they possessed the power they ought, they would have said, ""A plague on both your parties; we people will be dominant, and, by the power of the referendum, control Ministers."" Had the citizens of Australia had the power now possessed by the people of Switzerland, they would, by means of a referendum, have demanded a general election. There were nearly 20,000 adults at the meeting in the Melbourne Exhibition; and I am confident that had a petition been there, asking for a dissolution, 15,000 signatures would have been obtained. Dr. Moloney. member give an elective Ministry power to dissolve Parliament? of the House-no . Why should the created have more power than the creator? Parliament is the dominant power to say "" Y e a "" or "" Nay"" ; but if the MinistryThe thought themselves to be right, they could, if there were the referendum, appeal to the people against the whole combined forces of the House. The honourable member for Bendigo, with his keen, analytical, intellect, will see that what I state is We found the late correct. Switzerland is a country of diverse nationalities, with four distinct languages in the twenty-two cantons-Ger man, French, Italian, and Swiss. No one will deny that diversity of language and of custom is apt to cause differences of opinion; but these four communities are combined, and stand facing the world when their territory is threatened.. Every economist who has written during the last twenty years has paid his meed of praise to Switzerland, which, by a, great American, has been called the schoolhouse of Europe. As an Australian, I claim that we here should have this power of the referendum and of initiative. No one will deny that people without power sink into In. my the depths of degradation-that where the voice of the people is unknown, there is tyranny and injustice. I have no desire to allude to that blot on the civilization of Europe, as represented by Turkey and Russia. Thank God, Turkey is being remodelled; but the late Sultan and the present Czar were well coupled together, and it is not strange that the Daily News and other Liberal newspapers of England are objecting to the reception of the latter in England. However, the Czar is merely a puppet in the hands of the aristocracy, and fhe people are permitted no voice, if the Government will introduce a measure for the referendum and initiative, their names will be handed down to posterity as benefactors to the country. I do not care to hurl epithets or indulge in slanpwanging and blackguarding; but I think the saying that politics makes strange bed fellows, was never better exemplified than it is on the Government side of the House to-day.

In that country the majority of the leading articles are signed, and many of the writers become famous. papers are started in France, and particularly in Paris, simply because writers become so well known and valued that' they can always find people ready to find the capital in order to make them managers and editors. If we had the referendum we should be able to decide all those debatable subjects which now take up the time of Parliament. In one operation we could take a referendum on ten questions, and thus do away with all the absurdities, delay, and waste of the bicameral system as carried on, not only in Great Britain, but in every Australian Colony. It might be said that these frequent appeals to the referendum would cause great expense; but I once took the opportunity of inquiring how much it would involve to take the referendum by post in Victoria. My figures were checked in printing, and has a seat in the State Parliament ; and, according to him, the cost would be only from Â£ 5 5 0 to ,Â£650. Let us see how many referenda have been held in Switzerland? In [3Â°]2 Switzerland less than one question per annum has been submitted to a referendum since the introduction of the system, and each vote has removed a debatable subject from the realms of politics. In Oregon, two have been submitted to a referendum in five years; in San Francisco, two in six years, and in South Dakota there has never been a State referendum, although there have been several on municipal questions. It is explained that the knowledge that the system can be used at any time is really responsible for its not having been called into requisition there on State questions, and that if it were, it would prove expenhonorsive. I do not think that it would. The referendum was used by some of the old German tribes almost from time immemorial. The people met under a tree, and voted by holding up their right hand for what they thought would best conduce to their well-being. That method has been carried down to the present day, and I hope I shall live to see my fellow Australians enjoying the right which the Switzer has to determine by way of referendum, If the writers did whether or not a certain principle shall be placed on the statute-book of the country. I hope to see the day when, if the signatures of one per cent, of the electors of Australia and that now would be 40,000 people-ca n be obtained to a request for a referendum, that referendum must take In fact, many newsplace, and the people themselves empowered, regardless of what may be the view of a Cabinet or of the Governor General who rules us, to say that a certain course shall be adopted. stitution is the result of a referendum. but it is not complete.

165,Dr. Maloney,"If a referendum wereknown him during twenty years of political life, and have quarrelled with him severely. I have, however, always appreciated him as one human being can appreciate another who possesses more than the average lovable qualities. I regret that there is not a little more "" devil,"" or determination, in him. Had he stood by his own party, I am satisfied that at the next general elections only two parties would have been returned to this House-the Liberal and the Labour parties-and that it would have been hard to say which would be on top. A witty and sarcastic writer has said that although God may forgive, a human being rarely does. Here, in the seat of power, parties cannot proselytize unless one can grant the other security of tenure. The Conservatives can give no guarantee to the Liberals that, by joining forces with them, they will secure immunity from opposition. Neither can we. I should like the Government to adopt the principle of the referendum, and also to propose an amendment of our electoral laws, to insure that a man who is returned to this House will represent a majority of those who went to the poll. That can be attained either by means of the second ballot, or the preferential system of voting, and I trust that an effort will be made to bring it about"". We should then be able to defermine which of the two parties in Parliament dominated the constituencies. I shall not go so far as to sayin the Victorian Parliament by the honorthat in such circumstances an honourable alliance could not be made during the life of the Parliament. the constant quibbling that takes place that gives rise to so much dissatisfaction. When the present Minister of Defence, as Leader of the Opposition, used to bellow, as he was so fond of doing, in this House, I was led to think of the advice given by Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, that if you get up early in the morning, determined to find fault with everything, it is astonishing how many quarrels you will have, but that if you set out in the morning with the full determination to see good in everything, and will minimize every evil you see, it is astonrepressive that Mr Gladstone himself many ishing how much happiness you will have. honourable member profit by that advice? except when the honourable member is sarcastic at my expense. I repeat that the electoral law should be so amended, that by means either of the second ballot or the preUnder the English Act, three months' imferential system of voting, every member returned to this House would represent a majority of those who voted in his constituency. As it is, some honourable members represent only a minority. I do not know of one honourable member of the Labour party so situated, but I do know that more than six honourable members' opposite represent only .a minority; and I dare say that at the next general election, they will find themselves in an even worse position. The honourable member for Bourke, and the honourable member for Batman, who are present, will bear out what I have to say as to a certain Act that was carried by the honourable member for Flinders when Premier cf Victoria. The honourable member had then behind him the greatest majority. that a Victorian Premier ever had. In a House of ninety-five members he had a majority of thirty-five, and with their aid sought to carry two measures that have done more to disgrace and to dishonour Victoria than any two that were ever passed. One of these-and it became law-wa s the Strike Suppression Bill. I am satisfied that if the honourable member for Bourke, and the honourable member for Batman, had been in the State Parliament when that measure was introduced, they would have voted against it, as I did. Never in the history of Coercion Acts-neve r during Mr Gladstone's long political career-wa s so infamous, so vile, so wicked a Coercion Act passed as that which was introduced able member for Flinders. measures to which I have referred was repealed ; the other was so infamous that even the majority behind the honourable member for Flinders would not agree to it. The last Coercion Act introduced in the House of Commons by Mr Gladstone was brought in on the very day on which the poor dead clay of Lord Cavendish and Mr Burke-wh o were killed by assassinswas buried. Is it any wonder that in such circumstances many honourable members voted readily for a measure so strong and times regretted having brought it forward? That Act, however, was mild in comparison with the Bill introduced in the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the honourable member for Flinders. I made it my duty to compare the two, section by section, and shall give three illustrations of'their nature. prisonment-wher e imprisonment was the penalty provided-wa s the maximum;",42,Johnforrest T H E Honourable New South Wales We Ought To See Thati N

169,"Unfortunately, It Is Dr. Maloney","On e of the twounder the Victorian Act, the punishment was twelve months' imprisonment. Under the English Act bail was allowed; under the Victorian Act, no bail was allowed. Then, again, under the English Act, ,Â£25 was the highest money penalty imposed, whereas, under the Victorian Act the highest pecuniary penalty was ,Â£100. The Victorian Act further provided that any one who dared to help the women and children of the strikers should be liable to imprisonment. Referring to that provision, I said in the State House, "" Law or no law, I shall break it . "" AndI did. Some of the strikers desired that a Justice of the Supreme Court should be appointed to arbitrate between them, and the Railway Commissioners. Will any'one say that the Judges of the Supreme Court are taken from a class that is at all representative of the workers ? I think not. The men, however, had such faith in the justice of their claim that they were quite prepared to submit their case to such an arbitrator. The honourable member for Flinders, as Premier of Victoria, however, refused to agree to that proposal, and with the help of his great majority sought to pass the infamous measure to which I have alluded. The honourable member introduced and passed another Bill, interfering very seriously with the liberty of the subject. Under it, public servants were deemed unfit to vote for the election of representatives of the districts in which they lived, and provision was made for their separate representation in tbe Legislative Assembly by two members. Public servants in the most remote parts of the Corio electorate had to vote with men in Melbourne The man in Warrnambool would also have to vote for the Melbourne representative. The thing was so infamous that the separate representatives thus elected pledged themselves to.wipe it out at the first opportunity. chise, instead of there being fifty-one LaFor the duration of one Parliament that infamous Act remained on the statute-book of Victoria, and then another Premier, Sir Thomas Bent, to his eternal credit, removed this blemish, this stain, this slur. When he first suggested it, a huge cry was, raised by the newspapers, and the ex-Premier-no w the honourable member for Flinders-made , from his point of view, a magnificent speech against the course which it was proposed to take. But he was edged out of State politics, and took the suggestion to leave altogether. Then took place an occurrence which is unique in the history of the bi-cameral Parliaments of the world. On the 19th July, the Legislative Assembly of Victoria voted for the repeal of the Act; not one of the majority of thirty-five. being left to stand by it. On the 7th August, the Council, the most Conservative second Chamber in the Britishspeaking world, also voted for the repeal; so that within the compass of four weeks the Act disappeared. Would the honourable members for Batman, Corio, and Bourke have voted for that Act? Their lives show that they would not. Yet they are now associated with the ""man who, when he had the power, became one of the greatest tyrants that Victorian politics has known. Of course, in his personal life he is all that one would wish a man and a citizen to be; but I am sure that his regret is deep that he stained his political record by the introduction, of so infamous an Act. A short time, ago T saidI wish to ask the Prime Minister before the division is taken whether during the recess he will take into consideration the necessity of taking a referendum whereby the people of Australia will be dominant over Cabinet Ministers, Parliament, and Governor General. I do not desire it to be thought that I have anything to say against the Governor General. He is one of the brainiest and best men whom we have had in that position, and, by putting the Minister of Defence and others in their places in connection with the speeches at the Agricultural Show, proved that he is not going to be a catspaw. I do not desire to attack the Prime Minister, but I am sorry for the position in which he is placed. In process of natural evolution Labour must succeed Liberalism, just as in the old world Tories and Whigs have given place to Conservatives and Liberals, and, as the latter are ceasing to prove themselves sufficiently advanced for the times, they are being replaced by Radicals. If_ Great Britain had our splendid franbour members and Socialists in the House of Commons, there would be '300. But there no one is allowed to vote except by virtue of property, owned or rented. On the 10th November, 1908, when a motion of want of confidence was moved, the Deakin Government, with the support of the Labour party, was represented by forty-three votes, and the Opposition by twenty-one; a little later, the Deakin party numbered only thirteen, and its opponents forty-nine. I mention these facts to show the Liberals that the time has come when the Liberals' must push on faster or Labour will capture their constituencies. That is the natural course of evolution. The day will come when Labour will dominate this Parliament; and even then there will be a party still more anxious to advance, and progress will be more rapid than it is today. Unless the Labour party then changes with the times, it will be situated as the Liberal party is situated now. With the permission of the House, Mr Speaker, I should like to continue my remarks next Tuesday. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
