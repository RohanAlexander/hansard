243,Mr Mcgauran To Present A Bill For An Act,"Wednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23061 Wednesday, 29 November 2000 ----Borneo: Orang-outangs raised by some very young constituents of mine at Caulfield North Primary School. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I am accused of nepotism in making this speech, it is a charge that I will be happy to answer. My daughter, Laura Danby, together with two of her friends, Cody and Matilda, in class LA11 at Caulfield North Primary School, together with their teacher, Emily Halliday, and the class, are most concerned about the situation of orang-outangs-in particular, baby orang-outangs in Borneo, northern Indonesia. This follows a program on Today Tonight about the orang-outangs-things that Australians are doing to help them and, in particular, the black market in baby orang-outangs in Jakarta and the murder of the mothers of these baby orang-outangs. At a sanctuary in Jakarta, baby orang-outangs that have been seized by Indonesian officials from smugglers, some of whom are selling these baby orang-outangs for $2,000, are kept with the dedicated assistance of some people from Australia, including Allison Ritchie and her family, who are appealing for Australians to give assistance with things as varied as food, nappies, et cetera, for these baby orang-outangs. What concerns the grade 4 and 5 class at Caulfield North Primary School is that people in these parts of North Borneo and Sarawak are killing the mother orang-outangs so that the baby orang-outangs may be sold as pets. The children in my electorate are most concerned about this, as is the Ritchie family, who are making an appeal around Australia for Australians to assist the sanctuary in Jakarta so that these young orang-outangs who, as could be seen on the television program are most lovable creatures, can be saved from these smugglers, kept in the sanctuary in the Jakarta zoo and then released into the wild. The fact that this issue has been raised by my daughter, class LA11, Cody, Matilda, Emily Halliday, Allison Ritchie and all of the people who are concerned about the plight of these adorable animals, is most understandable. I commend their activities, particularly those of the Ritchie family, in trying to preserve this very important species on our planet. Diesel Fuel: Excise Reduction Workplace Relations and Small Business) (9.43 a.m.)-I had the dubious pleasure of having the opposition’s fuel inquiry visit my electorate the other day. And what an ill-informed bunch of dumbos they turned out to be. please. paying less tax per litre of fuel since 30 June-less tax, less excise and GST combined-and yet asked why I was not out there opposing the Prime Minister and why I was causing local motorists to pay 2c a litre more tax. So the first point is that they were misinformed. We saw a press release put out by the member for Holt and the member for Batman. It was one of these generic press releases in which you just swap the names of the electorate and the member. It referred to how I had been defaming the Prime Minister-wrong-and that motorists were paying more tax-wrong again.

This was grabbed on to by the Labor Party as yet another case of saying, ‘Look what’s going to happen-the world’s going to end.’ Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. These are the same people who, while visiting my electorate-they have also visited Eden-Monaro this week-said at one stage that the reduction in diesel excise was going to kill people, but now wanted it to be reduced even further. CanI just remind those opposite that if, on 30 June, we had not had tax reform, today every truck on the road would be paying $1 or more per litre, there would still be up to 45 per cent wholesale sales tax, there would be no tax cuts and, on the basis of that, we would have higher production costs, higher inflation and unemployment would be being driven up. What would that have resulted in? It would have resulted in the Labor Party doing what it does best: we would have seen more tax increases, we would have seen more unemployment and, at the end of the day, we would have seen Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, who no doubt would have been the Treasurer, saying to the Australian population, ‘We cannot do anything else but drive you into recession.’ We have only just heard again from the former Prime Minister, who still lives in la-la land, telling people that the only reason we now have economic shine is that he managed to put us into recession. They are the sorts of dumbfounded expressions that you get from the opposition. We would get the same from the member for Hotham if he ever got onto the treasury bench. I remind all of those opposite: when you come to the electorate of Longman, remind the public that they are paying less tax on their fuel and that they would be paying more if they were under Labor. (Time expired) Oxley Electorate: Community Groups attention of the House the tireless and selfless work of volunteers and community workers in the community groups and associations in the electorate of Oxley. These are people who work extremely hard. They have been acknowledged in the past, but I want to acknowledge them for the extra work that they are doing now. They are inundated with calls for support and help, and they really are at breaking point. They are at breaking point because of the harshness of the GST and the pain and suffering that so many people in our community are going through. These groups and volunteers help a range of people in our community-families, young people, homeless individuals. They supply things such as counselling, emergency services, emergency housing and food. They help people with all sorts of things. They even help people with bills. I want to quickly mention some of those groups. There is the Ben Lao Cultural and Welfare Association, which looks after the Vietnamese community; the HUB Neighbourhood Centre in Inala; and the Challenge Employment and Training group, which this year actually gave tax help that was organised from my office. St Stephens Welfare looks after disadvantaged people. The Peace Centre at Goodna works with migrants and young people. The Veterans Support and Advocacy Service is part of a wide range of services in my electorate for our veterans. The Ipswich RSL, the Railways Branch of the RSL, the Goodna RSL and Forest Lake Sub-Branch all do a wonderful job for our veterans. I have had some involvement with Drug Arm. I have actually been around in the Drug Arm van and experienced first hand some of the difficulties they face in the work they do for people with drug addictions. I would also like to thank Envirocare. They do great work in bringing to light some of the environmental issues. They help out on Clean Up Australia Day and in a whole range of other activities.

The Goodna Rotary, of which I am a member, does a fantastic job. The Queensland Rail Social Club is actually involved in community work. The Redbank Plains Rugby League Club does great things for young people in the area. The Vietnamese Community of Australia, Queensland Chapter, supports so many people in its own community and also gets involved in broader community issues. It informs people about things that are happening locally. Little Athletics Queensland does a great job in the electorate of Oxley. Parents Without Partners, again, does a fantastic job in helping people. I have great admiration for the Purga Friends and Elders Association. (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: HMAS Gladstone going back to even before the formation of the state of Queensland. That history has been progressively built upon until today. Gladstone is now the fastest growing port in Australia-a port which plays an important role in Australia’s exporting efforts. Gladstone is also the focus of the Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race, and a number of Gladstone residents are currently serving, or have served, with distinction in the Royal Australian Navy. The Gladstone Maritime History Society is operated in the city, with Councillor Stephen Mills as its president. This society is developing a maritime museum in Gladstone and has canvassed a proposal to relocate the HMAS Gladstone, a Fremantle class patrol boat, to the museum when it completes its current round of service with the Royal Australian Navy. Ships carrying the name ‘Gladstone’ have always had a close relationship with the city, and I was impressed by the community empathy displayed when the HMAS Gladstone made its last visit to the city recently. The city council and the local residents are keen to have the ship in the Gladstone Maritime Museum and they have an ideal location for it. The society plans to lift it from the water and level it on blocks, similar to a model boat display, where it will be visual from a great distance. It is obvious that the HMAS Gladstone could play an important part as a living museum, pulling together the importance of its naval history, the marine environment of Gladstone and its potential focus as a tourist attraction. I would like to lend my support to this very worthwhile project and urge the government and relevant departments to give it careful consideration. I have already discussed the matter with the minister and he is looking into it. Of course, it hinges on when the HMAS Gladstone becomes surplus to requirements. I hope in the new white paper we might see some new patrol boats, and this might give us the opportunity to pick up the old HMAS Gladstone. Mr Sawford interjectingnumber of issues still to be clarified, such as determining when the HMAS Gladstone is decommissioned, I think the city would receive a huge boost if the HMAS Gladstone were to be relocated in its retirement in the city which bears its name.

While there are a23064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 Sub-Saharan Africa currently has 23.3 million adults and children living with HIV-AIDS, out of a total of 33.6 million people in the world who have HIV-AIDS. We are all aware of the epidemic which has taken place in Africa, but we are not as aware of the fact that currently in India, a country of one billion people, there are an estimated 3.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. While I am pleased that Australia provides aid for HIV-AIDS prevention and care, I must acknowledge that much more is needed. Australian total aid to India is a modest $19 million for 2000-01, which is less than one per cent of the total aid received by India. Of this, there is $0.9 million set aside for the India-Australia HIV-AIDS prevention and care project. The project will cost $18.5 million over five years and seeks to reduce the risk and impact of HIV-AIDS, to assist Indians with the epidemic, and to undertake prevention and care activities. I, together with my colleague the member for Oxley, recently visited a HIV-AIDS hospital in Chennai which has received funding from Australia. The hospital began by providing voluntary and counselling services in 1993. At the moment they provide comprehensive services for over 2,500 people living with HIV-AIDS, as well as their families. They have a 24 in-patient care facility at the campus in Chennai, and persons living with HIV-AIDS receive high quality care from a team of dedicated professionals. The facility provides day care services, nutritional counselling, family support services and a subsidised pharmacy program. The hospital was staffed with a fantastic team of nurses and doctors, but it was quite obvious that many more resources were required. At this hospital, the sufferers of HIV-AIDS can access basic care and treatment; however the drugs to treat patients’ immune deficiency are far too expensive for these people. These drugs are currently only available for pregnant women who have HIV-AIDS and may pass it on to their babies. While Australia will provide $200 million over six years to help countries in our region to counter the advance of AIDS, much more is needed to prevent the epidemic from devastating their health and stalling their social and economic development. (Time expired) Forde Electorate: Ironbark Recyclers and innovative business in my electorate that is a shining example of eco-commerce at its best. Ironbark Recyclers is not only a booming timber recyling business but also another progressive venture that encapsulates the can-do approach of the Boonah Shire on which I have spoken in this House many times. This commendable enterprise which has been in operation for only five short years is a great example of the tenacity and spirit of many rural businesses in both Boonah and other rural areas of my electorate of Forde. In fact, Ironbark Recyclers’s success in producing custom-made timber products and the milling of recycled hardwood timbers has earned them a reputation as Australia’s leading recycled timber and furniture specialist, and this is no small feat for a very small business. It is evident that Ironbark Recyclers’s practical response to important environmental concerns within Australia has gained approval in not only Australia but also the Asia-Pacific market where Ironbark Recyclers export much of its products. One of the remarkable and enormous business ventures Ironbark Recyclers has been involved in is providing 100 per cent recycled timber for over 1,000 park benches for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, and for a small business in a very small town that was a very good achievement. I was pleased that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, accepted my invitation to visit this business when he came to my region two weeks ago. I know he was incredibly impressed with this venture. I would like to take the opportunity to commend Mr Greg Taylor, the Manager of Ironbark Recyclers in Boonah, on both the unique product he produces and his contribution to both the Shire of Boonah and the Australian environment. This practical contribution includes employment opportunities for the people of Boonah.

I am sure that Boonah will continue to enjoy the benefits of Ironbark Recyclers’s success. I am proud of the many achievements Ironbark have enjoyed since opening the mill over five years ago. I encourage Australian firms to look at Ironbark’s success as a shining example of what can be achieved by tapping into a speciality niche market. I look forward to watching Ironbark’s success continue and go from strength to strength while also supporting this job creating local business in my area in any way that I possibly can. the time for members’ statements has concluded. The committee will now consider government business. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 October, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the bill be now read a second time. passage of the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 through the parliament. In some respects it is a unique occasion because it represents the Howard government doing the right thing in the international arena. With a deteriorating reputation with respect to Australia’s involvement in the United Nations committee system on all things on human rights and the rights of women, issues in which Australia has been able to hold its head high in years gone by, it is a welcome change to finally see the Howard government doing the right thing. This issue relates to the International Monetary Fund. The bill is important because it seeks to give Australian legislative backing to amendments before the International Monetary Fund to alter its articles of agreement. With its passage through the Australian parliament, it moves the International Monetary Fund one step closer to gaining the required consent from the majority of the fund’s members to ratify the amendments. At its meetings in September and October of 1997, the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund made a decision to amend the IMF’s articles of agreement to allow for a special one-off allocation of IMF special drawing rights, generally referred to as SDRs. The amendments are known as the fourth amendment. Australia voted for this change at the IMF and must now amend Australia’s International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 which mirrors the IMF’s articles of agreement. The changes will come into effect when the amendments are formally accepted by the majority of the fund’s membership, when 85 per cent of the fund’s total voting power are in agreement-and I think we are up to around 58 per cent at present. The amendment to the IMF’s articles of agreement proposes an allocation of SDRs in the light of new countries having become members of the fund-for example, a number of East European countries have recently joined the fund. While member countries each subscribe to the IMF via a quota contribution reviewed approximately every five years, there have in fact been no allocations of SDRs since 1981. It is in order to address this inequity concerning a significant number of countries not having received the SDR allocations that the fourth amendment has been proposed. Following the changes, all member countries of the fund will have received an SDR allocation and with the ratio of cumulative allocated SDRs to quota for every country set at 29.32 per cent. In total, these changes will mean that the overall level of SDRs will rise from SDR21.4 billion to SDR42.87 billion. Once approved, the allocations will mean that Australia",138,Representatives Main Committee

As with general financing transactions to do with the IMF, this additional allocation will, however, have no impact on the Commonwealth’s fiscal balance. This bill helps the IMF to restore equity in the fund through the allocation of SDRs to all member countries. That is why the Labor Party supports the bill. Indeed, it is a welcome change to support the Howard government on a positive international matter. I will resist the temptation to go on to other areas of international conduct and relations, let alone to get into things like free trade versus fair trade. There are things going on in the other chamber which require me there, so I will conclude on that note. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (10.02 a.m.)-The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 seeks to amend schedule 1 of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to reflect changes that have occurred to the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund. In September 1997 the board of governors of the IMF approved these amended articles of agreement, known as the fourth amendment, in order to facilitate a special one-time allocation of special drawing rights to the value of SDR21.43 billion. These special drawing rights are interest-bearing reserve deposits that supplement the existing reserve assets of the IMF’s members and function as a unit of transaction for the organisation-the accounting unit, if you like, an SDR. The value of SDRs is determined by the daily calculation of a basket of currencies from those members with the largest exports of goods and services-namely, currencies such as the US dollar, euro, yen and pound sterling. Currently SDR1 equals about $US1.3. In introducing the fourth amendment, the board of governors was finalising a process that began in 1993 when the IMF executive board expressed concerns that the actual allocation of cumulative SDRs did not properly reflect the quotas of members of the IMF. Of particular concern was the position of the more recent members, particularly those who joined after the last general SDR allocation in 1981. In fact, some Eastern European members had no SDRs as no allocation had taken place since their entry into the fund. The Australian government supported the proposed amendments in 1997. The fourth amendment ensures greater equity between members in terms of cumulative SDR allocation relative to quotas or capital subscriptions to the fund at a benchmark level of 29.32 per cent. In the case of Australia, the fourth amendment is expected to receive SDR213.5 million or approximately $A500 million in additional reserves. The provisions of this bill before the chamber will take force when the fourth amendment is formally accepted by a three-fifth majority of IMF members and 85 per cent of total voting power within the fund. When the new allocation of SDRs is completed, the Treasurer will direct the Reserve Bank of Australia to buy Australia’s SDR allocation from the Commonwealth in exchange for Australian dollars. So the bill addresses what is essentially a technical matter associated with changes to the internal administration of the IMF and it will not adversely affect the Commonwealth fiscal budget balance. The fourth amendment has drawn the support of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended to the federal government that binding treaty action be taken. Nonetheless, in supporting this bill on the basis of its clear improvement to the present working arrangements of the IMF, this debate does afford an opportunity to comment more generally on the IMF, its activities and Australia’s involvement. I expect that the thrust of that preceding statement would have been appreciated by the member for Wills or even some other members opposite. It is of concern that since September we have already been witness to the spectacle of some ALP and minor party members and senators acting as apologists for the riots and violence at the World Economic Forum in Melbourne that month. To some it seems that international economic institutionsWednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23067 Curtin that this bill is a fairly tight one and she should endeavour to keep her remarks on the bill. Ms JULIE BISHOP-Tight in what sense? Ms JULIE BISHOP-Indeed. Ms JULIE BISHOP-I think it is an interesting issue in terms of Australia’s support for the IMF, which is where I am taking it. This is directly relevant to the bill before the chamber. Ms JULIE BISHOP-Thank you. In fact, it is perhaps no surprise that the IMF itself was the target of leftist protest at its Washington DC meeting last April. The US Congress itself grapples with its stand on free trade and international bureaucracies, including the IMF and its position on foreign aid. It has been elucidated by Daniel Griswold of the Cato Institute, and it is an interesting elucidation. In his recent depiction of a matrix in the US Congress, the two dividing points on the matrix are, on the one hand, support for the fast-tracking of global free trade and, on the other, support for an additional allocation by the US Congress to the IMF. Griswold suggests that President Clinton and his Washington followers clearly fall into the internationalist camp-that is, generally supporting free trade yet supporting additional powers and funding for the IMF-while a nationalist like Pat Buchanan falls into the opposite corner, opposing both free trade and the IMF. While the internationalist position is definitely more justifiable, the nationalist position has, I guess, a degree of consistency to it-a view that I do not share. The least defensible position on the matrix is that held by those personsand Griswold’s specific example is the democratic House minority leader Dick Gephart-who oppose free trade in the name of the campaign slogan of fair trade, but support the IMF as part of the furniture of a regulated international economic system. I suggest that is the worse of all possible worlds, denying the obvious benefits of free trade while requiring US taxpayers to support, to the tune of $18 billion, the sometimes inept regulation of the international economy by an organisation that tends to override the voluntary judgments of private international investors. Those of us who are wholeheartedly supporting global free trade-who are committed to free markets, limited government and individual liberty; the ‘free marketeers’ as they are called-also appreciate that free trade and free markets are the best hope for raising living standards in all countries, developed and less developed. It would seem that a Bush administration will be free market internationalist, on the matrix to which I refer. The rather tired invective of the Left, as demonstrated in Seattle, Washington and Melbourne, simply obscures the genuinely constructive and informed criticism, from many analysts and international financiers, of the IMF’s operations and guiding principles in its provision of loans. There is a respectable line of questioning as to the capacity of the IMF to better police international economic relations than market forces. It is an institution whose resources are in fact dwarfed by current private global capital flows, for the IMF is, at heart, an institution of the past. Its total quota is about SDR210 billion, about $US300 billion-as at April this year, it had credit and loans outstanding to 92 countries for about SDR50.4 billion. That is about $US66.5 billion. Its creation was part of the institutional foundation established by the Bretton Woods agreement signed in 1945, an institutional foundation that collapsed when it no longer met the needs of the global economy.",139,Representatives Main Committee

258,Mr Deputy Speaker,"I am delighted it is relevant to the bill. Please continue.23068 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 The IMF, I believe it can be argued fairly, is not part of the architecture of a new global economy, but an institution that was established in the old world economy of capital controls and fixed exchange rates. Originally it had two functions: exchange stability and balance of payments support. But, today, the question ‘Is there a legitimate role for the IMF in the post Bretton-Woods era?’ exercises the minds of many noted monetary economists and there is a range of views. One view is a call for an end to the IMF, by Allan Meltzer of CarnegieMellon University, for example. Steve Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, has called the IMF ‘an empty shell’ because the US dollar is no longer convertible into gold and the system of fixed exchange rates, which existed under the Bretton-Woods agreement, has long since been replaced by a system of pegged exchange rates. Others points to the Mexican bailout to argue that the IMF has become too politicised to have credibility as an independent arbiter. Yet others still argue that the world needs greater economic surveillance and that the IMF could, given greater funding, fulfil that role. I think this is somewhat a moot point, given that the IMF was charged with that mission and yet failed to alert anyone to the problems in Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia in the recent Asian financial crisis. The IMF plea for $US18 billion in funding to enable it to strengthen its role as an economic watchdog to provide an early warning system in case of potential financial troubles has been met with more than a degree of scepticism. The US Congress earlier this year sponsored a report, most certainly embraced by senior Republicans, which argues that the IMF and, indeed, the World Bank should be radically scaled back. The report is known as the Meltzer report, after Allan Meltzer, who headed the commission, and is signed off by Jeffrey Sachs, the well-known development economist at Harvard. It argues that the IMF should not have detailed loan arrangements with economic strings attached. More importantly, it argues, it should concentrate on one big market failure-financial panics in which solvent companies cannot borrow. In essence, to be eligible for IMF support, the report argues, countries should pass a number of preconditions, including adequately capitalised banks, some form of fiscal prudence, and money lent short term and at penal rates. Only in systemic crises should noneligible countries receive IMF bailouts; nor should the IMF lend at subsidised rates to the poorest countries. I can see the difficulties in translating some of these principles into practice to ensure that the basically sound but cash-strapped countries get IMF funding. But there are some very sensible ideas to redirect funding at lower interest rates to countries with better banking systems and more prudent economic policies than to those that do not, and consistently do not, and to provide incentives for countries to aspire to better financial standards. Nonetheless, the IMF continues to portray itself as an important player in international economic relations, a force for global capitalism, tying loans to strict economic reform conditions and thereby acting as a reformist force for nations previously characterised by corruption, inefficiency, largesse and tyranny. These are most certainly worthy goals, but there is cause for concern as to the gap between rhetoric and reality. In its role as an aid agency and crisis manager, the IMF should be promoting selfsustaining growth and market reforms. But take the examples of Argentina and South Korea, where reform came not from IMF imposition but from internal reform generated by the economic realities of private credit provision. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Russia, which continued to receive IMF aid funding for years despite continually failing to demonstrate that it had complied with the so-called tough conditions for reform set by the IMF. In fact, the former Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Boris Federov, commented in 1999, in a warning against further and future Russian borrowing from the IMF: I strongly believe that IMF money injections in 1994-98 were detrimental to the Russian economy and interests of the Russian people. Instead of speeding up reforms, they slowed them. Wednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23069 When the IMF finally did turn off the cash supply, Russia was forced to confront the reality of reforming a moribund economy, the implication being that the IMF is most effective at promoting liberalisation when it ceases to lend, and that is obviously an uncommon occurrence. The problem with nations borrowing from the IMF is wider than simply Russia. Seventy countries have depended on IMF credit for two or more decades. It is a case of loan addiction at this point. Fifty-four countries have depended on IMF credit in every year after temporary finance was first offered. By acting as a large-scale lender, outside of the restraints of commercial transactions, the IMF is effectively crowding out private lending to countries and for liquidity purposes at times of crisis. International capital markets are ready, willing and able to provide liquidity. Examples of private lending that have occurred have been promising-liquidity measures were adopted by Argentina in December 1996, and a $2.1 billion private credit line was established by Mexico with international banks. We must not forget that the IMF is an international bureaucracy. It employs approximately 2,700 people from 123 countries and is funded by the taxpayers of its member nations. Public choice theory revealed that public enterprises are subject to pressures other than simply those related to their stated goals. In the case of the IMF, the pressure is to lend and to provide credit to justify its size and operations and, like all bureaucracies, the IMF needs to justify its existence. While the Main Committee supports this bill-for it will be a positive benefit to the IMF and its members; Australia, in particular, will benefit indirectly in that poorer countries will be allowed to meet part of their reserve needs at a lower cost than otherwise, which will in turn lead to an easing of the burden on industrialised nations for financial aid-it is nevertheless incumbent upon nations like Australia to re-examine the IMF, either as to a restructuring or a merger with the World Bank or, indeed, the necessity for the very existence of the IMF in the context of an increasingly globalised economy. Private capital is now more readily available and transferable and may just be the more effective and efficient regulator of the international economy rather than a centralised, state-directed lender. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Dr MARTIN (Cunningham) (10.17 a.m.)-I have to say that the contribution of the honourable member for Curtin was quite refreshing and went beyond the strict guidelines contained in the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 to a consideration of the role in the future of the IMF and, indeed, the World Bank. She made some very interesting comments about that, and I would like to respond to a couple of those in a moment. This bill, as indicated by my colleague the shadow assistant treasurer, is supported by the opposition. The proposed amendment to the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 will reflect changes to the principal international agreements, which will consolidate the arrangements for a new allocation of special drawing rights among member nations of the International Monetary Fund. I think a publication produced by the Parliamentary Library on this particular legislation goes into some amount of detail and background on the IMF’s development, the role played by the World Bank and the various amendments which this legislation is seeking to implement. The main provisions, as outlined here, are contained in that document, where it proposes to amend schedule 1 of the act to reflect the fourth amendment of the articles of agreement. It goes on to talk about two items that are part of that, and the opposition has no difficulties with that. The honourable member for Curtin did raise some very interesting issues about the International Monetary Fund and its role in the future. Very close to home, some examples of the way the IMF has operated in recent times highlight the present philosophical debate, which is an appropriate debate and one we need to have. There must always be a consideration of whether there is a role for an organisation-which the member for Curtin 23070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 considers is perhaps a little bureaucratic in the way in which it deals with issues-to look after the interests of poorer nations. If there is no such structure in place, then the haves of this world may themselves become too consumed by their own capitalist intentions and the way in which they can make a quick return on an investment through a whole range of strategies that they might embrace under the mantra of a free market. However, that said, if we look closely at many of those nations in our immediate region that were affected by the Asian economic crisis, I think it is fair to say that without an organisation which was recognised and to some extent was, to use the old economy jargon, more regulated in the way it approached its task, we might not have seen some of the reform processes start in some of these economies. I have to admit that I do not think those reform processes have gone far enough or are proceeding as fast as I would like to see, or have gone as deep as some would suggest, particularly if it is taken into consideration that the foundation of any economy has to be its financial system. It has to be the financial sector, and if that sector is not operating appropriately you are going to find yourself in all sorts of problems. Regrettably, for many of the economies in our immediate region the Asian economic crisis became endemic, systemic and long enduring, for the simple reason that the financial sector of those neighbours was not being managed in a way which enabled a quick response to the contagion that came from the meltdown of foreign exchange and so on. To some extent, when we talk about the way in which these countries approach prudential supervision, cash reserves and, perhaps, regulation versus deregulation in the financial services sector, we should be arguing from a position that the best outcome has to be one which delivers economic benefits to the country concerned. That in turn means that people have access to jobs and security arrangements in the transition from schooling systems into jobs and so on. In that way we are going to generate reasonable, self-sustaining economies. To take some of our neighbours: I have had the opportunity in the last 12 to 18 months to visit quite a number of the Asian economies, talking mainly on defence issues. Ms Julie Bishop-Indonesia? number of times. It seems that every second building in Indonesia is a bank, and a bank that is operated in a way which calls into question whether opportunities might arise-as we saw in the case of the Bali bank saga-for difficulties to be caused within the economy. To be quite frank about it: there was corruption and as a consequence many people lost a lot of money, and the economy has suffered. We need to try to ensure that economies like Indonesia, which are the last to emerge from the Asian economic downturn, are given appropriate resources to enable them to make the reforms that are required. But often-and this is the difficulty-unless there is a body that can in some respects say, ‘We are prepared to give you those resources but it is on the understanding that certain preconditions are met,’ there are problems. My friend the member for Curtin would say that they do not ensure that those conditions are adhered to. That is a genuine problem, but I do not think the free market is going to deal with that. Dr Mahathir, for example, might have a different view of the way in which the capital market works in Asia and whether free trade and the free exchange of monetary resources around the globe give economic benefit to his country. He has had some pretty scathing things to say about investors and the way in which the capital markets work, the free trade arrangements exist and so on. I disagree with that, as does Labor. We have said that free market concepts are important. The comments of the honourable member for Curtin about particular positions that were adopted in relation to the world economic forums in Melbourne, Seattle and so on were a reflection, I think, of a number of issues. Yes, there were the professional agitators; there is no doubt that that is the case. But there were also people genuinely concerned about the effects of",141,Representatives Main Committee
259,Dr Martin,"I was just going to say that Indonesia is a case in point. I have been there aWednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23071 globalisation on security-that broad definition of security as to how people might have a secure future for themselves. That means a job, which means a secure income that can sustain them, which means in turn an economy that is going to continue to tick over and to grow, to be part of an internationalised world. I think everyone accepts, in their heart of hearts, that that is the way the world is today. The IMF and the World Bank, therefore, may have to look at the roles that they play at the moment and perhaps readjust their own thinking and their own charters to reflect more of this globalisation, because there can be a tendency for bureaucracies, that are established with all the best intentions in the world, not to deliver an appropriate outcome. There is a problem, though, when one uses the United States as an example. I noted that the member for Curtin quoted a lot of comments made by Republicans, which did not surprise me. We will wait and see whether Mr Bush becomes the next president. Nevertheless, the view of the US, whether it be of the World Bank, the IMF or whatever, must be a little discounted because of what I call the UN syndrome. The United States, whether it is in regard to defence relationships or whatever, in a lot of ways pay lip service to the United Nations when it suits their purposes, but often they are quite happy to do their own thing in respect of certain arrangements that they put in place. I think the United Nations is owed a considerable amount of money by the United States. I think the United States, in terms of their other obligations regarding organisations like the IMF, the World Bank and so on, clearly want to see reforms there. There is no doubt that that is the case. They are supposedly one of the leading advocates of free markets and free tradealthough, of course, when you look at the amount of subsidies they pay their farmers, one always questions whether or not that is a genuine concern. They will say that there is this opportunity for globalisation, the free movement of capital as part of that, and private capital, to take the place of controlled access to finance through bodies like the IMF. I would like to think that that might be the case. I would like to think that the Merrill Lynches of the world are going to become the new IMFs. I would like to think that the new investment houses of Wall Street, Sydney and Melbourne, equally, are going to look at those opportunities. Unfortunately, at this stage the jury is still out. I think there are still a lot of people who would want a quick return. There is the old carpetbagger syndrome: get into Indonesia, get into Malaysia, get into the Philippines, with the idea of getting a quick return, but at the same time export that capital out as quickly as possible. During the Asian economic crisis we saw that take place a lot. We saw the flight of capital out of many of those Asian economies but we have not seen, with the return of at least some stability, the return of that capital. I think all the statistics show that. Look at the Far Eastern Economic Review and at some of the other journals in which this matter is being written about. The question has to be asked again about the poorer countries of the world-and I am using Asia as an example because it is our nearest neighbour, but the same argument could be applied to poor African or European countries. If you are simply saying about the IMF that it is time for a change, what is its role, et cetera, and that we should redefine all of that and let private capital take its place, I am not sure whether those conditions have been formulated as part of globalisation to enable that to happen. The honourable member for Curtin also talked about Korea and Russia and used a converse argument as to how the IMF worked in both of those cases. Some might say, about the Korean example at present, that, with respect to the way in which those major corporations developed-and it is reflective of this idea of global capital being available-the downside is now being seen. Korea is seemingly going through a major reform process again, with major companies like Daewoo and a number of others starting to fall by the wayside. There are questions about how IMF or World Bank assistance, which might have been required previously, might be required again. 23072 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 The danger, of course, is that, if you have got a fall-back position, if you have got an IMF and a World Bank in the background that you know are always going to bail somebody out, it takes away that incentive. I remember having an argument about this a few years ago. Actually it is almost the 10th anniversary since the famous Martin inquiry report on financial services in Australia was handed down. Ms Julie Bishop-It is the new economy. friend will tell you. It was not a bad article; I saw that. unless you have an organisation like the World Bank or the IMF that provides that succour, comfort and assistance on particular defined termsMs Julie Bishop-The lender of last resort. domestic banking circumstances or whatever. Fortunately, in Australia it has never had to be tested, but if you are talking about the world scene, you would find that, on many occasions, there would be opportunities for that to happen. The danger is, if you eliminate that, whether you will be able to guarantee that the international flow of capital is going to be directed to those areas of greatest need. How do you do that? How do you say to the Merrill Lynches and others of the world, ‘You need to invest in plant and equipment on the Ivory Coast’? How do you say to them, ‘You need to go to some of the smaller islands of Indonesia and assist in the economic development there’? Unless they can see that there is a benefit for their shareholders, unless they can see that there is a good return on capital for doing that, it will simply not happen in the short term. I think people’s time horizons in this regard must also be considered. The honourable member for Curtin raised a number of very interesting issues associated with this matter. In Australia, it probably is time for us to have a long and meaningful debate about the relationship that we have with these organisations and the direction in which we see organisations like the IMF and the World Bank heading. We should consider whether those conditions that they lay down for assistance are adhered to; and, if they are not, why not. Is it always sufficient to say there is a fall-back position so that we should have them in place? Is it always sufficient to say that they are the ones that bring the political clout to some economies to try to get them to go through a difficult reform process? We need to have a debate on all of those issues. This bill, regrettably, is fairly tight and does not allow us to consider all of those matters, but they are matters which, in Australia, those on both sides of politics need to take very seriously. We do make substantial contributions. In the case of Indonesia, it may be well and good for certain people in the streets to try to beat up our ambassador, but they should remember that the first people who honoured their commitment to the contributions from both the IMF and the World Bank was Australia, in order to assist with the package of funding for Indonesia. People should be reminded of that point. As I said, the opposition certainly does not oppose this legislation. I welcome the opportunity to talk with my friend on the other side of this smaller chamber about such an important piece of legislation. Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000.

266,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.33 A.m.),"I, too, rise to support the International MonetaryWednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23073 to the September-October 1997 decision-a decision that Australia supported on the board of governors-to allow for a special one-off allocation of IMF special drawing rights. It amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to reflect the International Monetary Fund’s proposed new fourth amendment to its articles of agreement. The special drawing rights are an international reserve asset-effectively, the IMF’s international currency-and are allocated to member countries by a country’s GDP, current account transactions and official reserves. No special drawing rights allocations have been made since 1981 and it is estimated that Australia’s share of an SDR allocation would be approximately $500 million. A number of important issues have been canvassed today, particularly by the member for Curtin and the member for Cunningham, which come to mind when discussing the IMF and its role, including the impact of the market economy and globalisation on people’s lives, the environment-which is terribly important-the financial requirements for agriculture, fair worldwide competitive trading, and political stability. As it is a very influential force in terms of the environment, everyone is concerned about the current greenhouse gas emissions and the role of the IMF to influence countries in regard to that. We have just had a spate of events around the world in line with the effects of global warming which had been predicted by the climate scientists; and the growing number of these extraordinary weather events, together with the measurable increases in global temperatures and a strong correlation with the increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, is a warning that we simply cannot afford to ignore. The IMF have a very important role here in terms of their influence. I remember, as a child growing up in a small country town called Dunedoo in New South Wales, the famous 1956 floods. I am sure the member for Fisher would remember that time also. I have a very deep impression of looking out the window of my home in Dunedoo at the impact of the floods there. The local railway tracks were standing up in the shape of the Sydney Harbour Bridge: it was quite extraordinary. Floods like those in 1956 and at other times have become part of our folklore, and I am sure that many Australians with a rural background would have had similar experiences. The fact that our already variable climate can produce such floods has, I believe, tended to blind us to the increasing frequency and intensity of these events. Even so, the latest floods in New South Wales have been described as unprecedented and have caused extraordinary damage to crops, private property and local infrastructure. In a similar manner, the spate of floods and other weather related disasters around the world have also exceeded all previous records in intensity and destructiveness. The IMF has its role here to influence those countries which are contributing to global warming. The recent heavy rains that have caused losses of something over $600 million in the New South Wales wheat industry have been linked to higher than usual temperatures in the Indian Ocean. This is the third year in succession that higher than average rainfall has ruined the crop, and it is in line with the predictions by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research of increasing and heavier rainfall in New South Wales. The chance that appeals for financial assistance after these sorts of disasters will grow is high, especially since predictions of further greenhouse emissions induced climate disturbances are becoming more reliable and are increasingly supported by evidence of climate change. The government continues to argue that the measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions would be too expensive to contemplate, yet the costs of the damage to agriculture and infrastructure do not seem to have been included in their calculations. But that is not to say that the rural areas will experience the worse that global warming could deliver. After all, the hailstorm that wrecked Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs last year produced the largest insurance claim ever seen in this country-it was very costly. 23074 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 We need to realise that the changes in the weather systems that we are seeing are the probable consequence of an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration from a preindustrial level of 275 parts per million to the current 350 parts per million. That is an increase of about 21 per cent. If we continue to pump out the carbon dioxide at the present rate, we could double the pre-industrial level by around 2035. The consequences of an increase to this level could be major changes in the world’s weather systems. Just as we seem to be reaping the climatic consequences of the industrial revolution, we are, by pumping out even more carbon dioxide, preparing a near-term future that will very likely see increasing havoc and disruption. The only difference will be that previous generations were not aware of the risks. We are aware and we have to act accordingly. This damage from the present climatic disruptions pales into insignificance if we contemplate some of the other possibilities: the chance, for instance, of the icecaps melting is slight, but glaciologists warn that there is still a possibility that global warmingA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.38 a.m. to 10.51 a.m. concern about the impact of global warming and also the role of the IMF because the bill is about Australia’s financial contribution to the IMF and the SDRs we receive back from the IMF in return. This goes to the heart of our involvement with the IMF. When we are considering the nature of our relationship with the IMF, it is surely not irrelevant to raise some of those very important aspects which have been raised. My concern is about our planet at the moment. On that scene, I think I was saying before the break for the division that the chance of the icecaps melting is slight but the glaciologists warn that there is still a possibility that global warming could cause a huge west Antarctic ice sheet to collapse and produce a sudden rise in sea levels by as much as four to six metres-or 13 to 20 feet. It appears to have done that in the distant past. An event like that would be a catastrophe for the rest of the world. SoI think the IMF in their role should be bearing those sorts of things in mind when they make their various decisions. We know that the IMF was modelled on Keynesian economics. In 1944 the IMF was established with a view to stabilising the world’s currency and allowing countries to solve temporary balance of payment deficits. The IMF became the closest thing to a worldwide central bank, acting as a creditor and regulator of many of the world’s Third World economies. The IMF was created to facilitate the expansion and growth of international trade and to assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of payments. The IMF was also given responsibility for maintaining orderly currency prices in international trade in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank. It was given the task of creating long-term investments to improve the world economy. When it was established, any member of the IMF could borrow foreign currency from the IMF in exchange for its own currency if it had a balance of payments deficit-that is, if imports exceeded exports. The borrowing country then had to repurchase the currency within three to five years and, in that way, the borrower could take care of a balance of payments problem without having to depress its own economy, increase tariffs or devalue its own currency. When temporary loans were made, the IMF also negotiated with the borrowing country so that changes in its economic policy would solve the underlying balance of payments deficit. Despite all this, it was never intended that the IMF was to be a major lending institution or an agency for economic development as, in the early years, it was somewhat overshadowed",146,Representatives Main Committee

269,Mr Murphy,"I do not know if I was praising the government. I was expressing myWednesday, 29 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23075 by the World Bank. In the early 1970s, the IMF’s influence further declined when the major members of the OECD began to abandon fixed exchange rates and allow their currencies to float. The IMF stood to lose its power over exchange rates. It was during the oil crisis in the 1970s that the IMF distributed SDRs to countries whose balance of payments were affected by OPEC price hikes. The IMF stepped in to provide more funds and coordinate debt negotiations between countries and private lenders. One of the IMF’s real powers came from the fact that private lenders refused to extend new loans or renegotiate old ones until the country had reached an agreement with the IMF. So the IMF had the power to order countries to improve trade balances and free up the market to encourage them to increase exports and cut imports to earn the foreign currency they needed. This could be seen as part of the problem with our Australian dollar, the value of which continues to decline. For some years this strategy was successful. In the early to mid-1980s, at least 10 of the largest debtor nations improved their trade balances. This occurred largely through austerity measures such as cutting price support for food, reducing government services, slashing wages and floating their currencies internationally. These measures have resulted in reducing living standards for those who have only their labour to sell and is ongoing even today. The prospect that IMF austerity will provoke political unrest in the so-called Third World economies has led to negotiation by the world’s rich economies to either forgive or place a moratorium on debt to allow economies to grow and generate the goods and services they need to pay for their debts. Many Third World critics have argued that the IMF is controlled by wealthy Western powers who are able to promote their interests more effectively than the poorer, less developed countries. It is true that the IMF is governed by more than 150 member countries and that the power of the fund’s policy is based on money, meaning that larger economies effectively control the fund’s policies. The question of more privatisation of publicly owned assets, controlled either by the states or the Commonwealth, is diverting value from those who have only their labour to sell. I support the bill, as it is non-controversial. However, I do have some concerns, particularly about the value of the Australian dollar and how it is affected by international monetary policies and the government’s own economic policies. Mention is made on page 7 of the Bills Digest of Serbia/Montenegro and ‘an exception under which allocations to members who have overdue obligations are held in escrow’. It says that the fourth amendment ‘will come into effect when accepted by three-fifths of the members, carrying 85 per cent of the voting power’. It goes on to say: Some of the ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in terms of the change in allocations/quotas ratios are listed in the following table. The key words in this table are ‘winners’ and ‘losers’. According to the table, the winners are Singapore, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Korea, China and Japan; the losers are Afghanistan, Haiti, Laos, Liberia, Congo, Sudan and Somalia. We cannot obtain information as to how Australia’s decision to back the new agreements, known as the fourth amendment to the articles of agreement, will affect the liquidity position vis-a-vis grants or loans allocations to countries like East Timor, Papua New Guinea and other nations within the India-Pacific region. In conclusion, I support the comments made by the members for Curtin and Cunningham in their early contributions to this debate. I just hope that the IMF uses its undoubted influence with regard to our concerns about global warming, particularly on those countries which are promoting the expansion of greenhouse emissions to the detriment of this planet because they are driven by economic imperatives. I trust that the IMF, which is a very powerful body, will do something other than just be guided by the economic imperatives. I 23076 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 2000 think all of us on both sides of this House are very concerned about global warming, and I think the IMF could use its very significant powers of influence to arrest the expansion of greenhouse emissions throughout the world. Administration) (10.59 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank the honourable members for Wills, Cunningham, Curtin and Lowe for the thoughtful contributions that each one has made. The debate has not been largely about the substance of the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, but there has been a very interesting and wideranging debate over the future of the International Monetary Fund and general matters which no doubt have been canvassed more widely. I would like to sum up by restating the objectives and benefits of the bill. Its purpose is to enable schedule 1 of the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to be amended to reflect a change in the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund. Amendments made to the articles of agreement of the IMF, such as the fourth amendment, make it necessary to change the International Monetary Agreements Act. Since schedule 1 of the act reproduces the articles of agreement of the IMF, the bill will enter into force when the fourth amendment to the IMF’s articles of agreement is formally accepted by the required majority of the fund’s membership. This bill will enable the Treasurer to direct the Reserve Bank of Australia, under section 5A of the IMA Act, to buy Australia’s allocation of special drawing rights from the Commonwealth in exchange for Australian dollars once the fourth amendment enters into force. The benefits of the fourth amendment are twofold. First, the amendment is being proposed as a means of ensuring greater equity between IMF members in terms of their cumulative SDR allocations relative to their quotas-or capital subscriptions-in the IMF, at a benchmark level of 29.32 per cent. Australia would receive SDR213.5 million, or about $A520 million, of additional reserves. This greater equity could result in some members becoming more committed to the objectives and functions of the IMF, which could assist it in its operations. Secondly, a special allocation would add to the foreign reserves of all IMF member countries, which would allow poorer countries to meet part of their reserve needs at a lower cost. The honourable member for Lowe spoke about what he saw as the desirability that the IMF influence environmental issues. I restate for the benefit of the honourable member and the Main Committee that the role of the IMF is to address macro-economic imbalances, helping countries to address balance of payments problems and restore stability to allow resumption of sustainable growth. The member would be disappointed to know that its mandate does not call for it to address environmental issues. The honourable members for Cunningham and Curtin participated by commenting in a very wide-ranging way on the role of the International Monetary Fund in the world economy. You may be interested to know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that IMF programs are focused on helping countries achieve stable economic growth, the surest guarantee that people will see their economic well-being improved over time. The bulk of evidence suggests that IMF policies have been generally successful in assisting member countries address their macroeconomic imbalances and resume economic growth. A recent example can be seen in countries hit by the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98. From Korea to Thailand to Brazil, economies adversely affected by that crisis which have initiated policy reform with IMF assistance have now recovered solidly. This is not say that the IMF cannot do better, and Australia has urged it to undertake further reforms to improve the effectiveness of its operations in the wake of the crisis. The IMF itself has initiated a comprehensive review of its policy framework to make sure that it remains relevant in a globalised environment. Efforts by the IMF include strengthened",148,Representatives Main Committee

Therefore, the IMF is addressing the need for reform of international architecture. It has recently concluded a review of its financing facilities, aimed at addressing overdependence by members. It is also reviewing conditionality attached to their programs, emphasising the need for ownership of the reform program by members and also to limit conditions to those strictly needed to ensure the underlying balance of payment problems are addressed. The International Monetary Fund has done a very good job but it continues to look at how this matter could be even more improved. It is obvious that the issue of reform of the IMF and World Bank will remain an important part of discussions for reform of the international financial system in the period ahead. The Howard government will continue to participate actively and vigorously in these discussions. With respect to the bill before the House, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties supported the proposed fourth amendment to the articles of agreement of the IMF and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken.

Analysis of inspection results over a number of years to June 1998 showed that, while numerous enroute inspections were performed, they were ineffective in displaying systemic deficiencies while tying up resources for a long time. For example, only two inspections of 350, carried out on one operator over a number of years to June 1998, discovered a significant discrepancy. To increase the effectiveness of inspections, CASA has developed a safety systems assessment audit approach, which has been gradually implemented through the inspection periods from 1998. While the numbers of inflight inspections has decreased, the information gained from the inspections has increased in value. In combination with additional audits conducted by CASA targeting Airworthiness and Flying Operations activities, the safety systems assessment is a safety guided approach to achieving compliant operators. CASA’s new safety systems assessment approach focuses on an indepth analysis of the systems used by airlines in the production of a product, whether that product is a proficient flight crew, a correctly loaded aircraft, or controlled and accurate documentation. As part of any safety systems assessment, product sampling is essential. The figures for the period 1999-2000 represent an appropriate and safety guided sample of the system used by the airlines to ensure a proficient crew. As part of CASA’s new assessment approach, en-route cockpit assessments will continue.",150,Representatives Main Committee

Australian Taxation Office: Australian Business Numbers (Question No. 1810) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 August 2000: What arrangements does the Australian Taxation Office have in place to ensure that the same problems do not arise in relation to Australian Business Numbers as have occurred with Tax File Numbers, in light of the Auditor-General’s report that tax administration led to there being 3.6 million more tax file numbers than tax-payers. honourable member’s question: A very significant data cleanse of records was conducted prior to the start date of issuing ABN application forms in November 1999 and, once applications began to be received, a range of strategies was put in place to ensure that only those with a genuine entitlement to an ABN have one. Very significant penalties are also included in the ABN law for misuse of an ABN. The ATO’s Business Registration Service provides for real-time monitoring and improvements to ABN data quality and maintenance of the Register. Because of an entity’s regular contact with the ATO for the processing of Business Activity Statements and other forms which use the ABN as an identifier, there will be an increased degree of interaction with the ATO and a range of checks are built into the system, both in terms of risk profiling and physical checks of refunds to detect possibly fraudulent transactions. Added to this, the GST field force will be applying targeted activities to the client population. On an ongoing basis, details from the Business Activity Statement and other statements will provide updated information as to whether an enterprise is being carried on. Other sources of register information will be used including information from the Australian Securities and Investments",157,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10

United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Question No. 1862) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 August 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the submission made to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by the Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action, supported by Aboriginal leaders; if so, what is the Government’s response to the claims that it has failed to address problems in Aboriginal health on a nationwide scale. (2) Will the Government also reject any criticism from this Committee in light of the Government’s response to criticism from other UN Committees in 2000. (3) Is the Government aware of the criticisms which are being levelled at Australia by a range of governments around the world because of its dismissive attitude to any criticism on indigenous issues. (1) Yes. The Government’s submission to the Committee responds to claims regarding Aboriginal health like those made by the Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action. To reiterate, improved outcomes are being achieved. Clinical studies of indigenous communities indicate: the death rate from infections and parasitic infections is falling; the incidence and severity of diarrhoeal disease is reducing due to improvements in environmental living conditions and socioeconomic circumstance; and mortality from acute respiratory illness has declined markedly in indigenous children although attack rates are still high in rural and remote communities. The Government recognises that there is still a long way to go and has allocated record levels of funding to address this issue. Since 1995-96, funding through the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health has increased to $189.7 million, an increase of more than 50 per cent in real terms. By 2003-04, the Government will have increased specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health funding to more than $220 million per year, an increase of 65% in real terms over this period. The Government firmly believes that its current focus on provision of comprehensive primary health care services along with action in areas such as environmental health infrastructure, housing and education, provides the best opportunity to improve the health status of indigenous people in Australia. (2) The Committee released its concluding observations on Australia on Friday1 September 2000. This Committee had a number of positive things to say about Australia, including in relation to indigenous issues. Indeed, three of nine positive factors raised by the Committee related to indigenous issues. The Committee’s concerns about the fact that many of Australia’s indigenous people continue to suffer disadvantage, especially in the areas of employment, housing, health and education, vindicate our decision to give priority to these key areas. (3) The Government is not aware of criticisms from a range of governments around the world regarding indigenous issues, as suggested by the Honourable member. Imports: Fiji (Question No. 1911) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, port the finished goods to Australia. (2) Will he make clear that Australia will discontin on 4 September 2000: (1) Is he aware of plans by companies in Fiji to import textiles from China and ex ue its export credit scheme under which clothing imports to Australia from Fiji attract a 50 per cent reduction in duty.",158,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10
278,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What measures are in place to alert Australian importers and Fijian exporters that attempts to import finished clothing to Australia would be a violation of the sanctions on Fiji while Fiji is ruled by an undemocratic, unelected regime. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No, I am not aware of any such plans by Fiji companies. However, there is nothing to prevent companies in Fiji or any other country from exporting goods into Australia using materials sourced from another country. Under existing trade and tariff arrangements, such goods may not qualify for concessional access to the Australian market. (2) Australia does not have an export credit scheme. However, an Import Credit Scheme (ICS) was introduced in 1992, and was closed, with the exception of goods being exported to Forum Island Countries (FIC) on 30 June 2000. The scheme was closed for exports to FICs on 30 September 2000. In closing ICS, the Government has made generous provision for the TCF sector through its TCF Post 2000 Assistance Package. The ICS allowed for Australian companies to obtain credits from their exports and use those credits to offset duty on imports. ICS did not provide a 50 per cent reduction in duty. Mr Danby may be referring to arrangements under SPARTECA (South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement) which provide for duty free entry into Australia for goods whose local content is greater than 50 per cent. (3) There are no measures in place as there are no trade sanctions against Fiji. The usual procedures employed by the Australian Customs Service are applied against goods entering Australia. United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Question No. 1926) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 September 2000: (1) Is Australia the only significant developed nation to refuse to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; if so, why. (2) What explanation will he give the UN Millennium Conference with regard to Australia’s position. (1) I am advised by my department that Australia is not the only nation which has not ratified or signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Sixty-two states had signed the Optional Protocol as of 29 September 2000, and eleven of these states had also ratified the Optional Protocol. A number of like-minded states, including Canada, Great Britain and the United States, had not signed or ratified the Optional Protocol. (2) In my address to the United Nations Millennium Summit on 6 September 2000, I made the following statement: “We also believe that aspects of the UN treaty committee system need reform. Australia’s recent experience has been that some of these committees give too little weight to the views of democratically-elected governments and that they go beyond their mandates. Australia will intensify its work with other states on reform of the treaty committee system. We have recently announced a series of measures aimed at improving the operation of the UN treaty committee system. Australia’s strategic engagement with these committees will be dependent on the extent to which effective reform occurs.” The Government has stated elsewhere that it would not be appropriate to sign or ratify the Optional Protocol while its concerns with the treaty committee system remain.",159,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10

280,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Question No. 1927) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 September 2000: (1) What action will the Government take to ensure that its decision to refuse the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women will not have a negative impact on overcoming discrimination against Australian women. (2) Will the Government make a commitment to ensure the determinations of the Sexual Discrimination Commissioner are implemented in legislation. (1) The Government does not consider that its decision not to sign or ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women while its concerns with the United Nations treaty committee system remain will have a negative impact on overcoming discrimination against Australian women. Australia already has a world class system of legislation and institutional mechanisms which are designed to protect Australian women against discrimination. (2) I am advised by my department that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner does not have the power to make determinations. Hoxton Park Airport: Flight Patterns (Question No. 1968) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Have flight patterns for Hoxton Park Airport changed recently; if so why. (2) Have there been 4 serious incidents at Hoxton Park Airport in the last 2 years; if so; why are flights now directed over residential areas. (1) Airservices Australia has advised there have been no changes to flight arrangements for operations at and around Hoxton Park in the last 5 years except that during the Olympic Games period an aerodrome control service was provided for the anticipated increase in activity. Approved hours for circuit training were changed in June 1995 and revised procedures affecting communications responsibilities were introduced in 1999. (2) Australian Transport Safety Bureau records indicate that in the two years to 3 October 2000, eight accidents occurred at Hoxton Park aerodrome and one accident occurred four kilometres north of the aerodrome. All these accidents involved substantial damage to the aircraft involved. There were two injuries and one fatality recorded as a result of these accidents. As stated above, there have been no changes to arrangements for operations at and around Hoxton Park in the last 5 years except that during the Olympic Games period an aerodrome control service was provided for the anticipated increase in activity. Human Rights: Sri Lanka (Question No. 1973) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) In the context of Australian comments concerning Sri Lanka at the 56’l’ Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, 20 March to 28 April 2000, what has been the level of sales of Australian. military and dual use equipment to Sri Lanka in (a) 1997-98, (b) 1998-99 and 1999-2000. (2) When did the Inter Departmental Committee chaired by his Department, for the granting of export licences, last assess Sri Lanka’s human rights picture, and what was the outcome of the review. (3) Have Sri Lankan defence personnel been trained in Australia; if so, what was the nature of the training.",160,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10
281,Mr Howard,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,161,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10
282,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Department of Defence records indicate that Australian military goods to the value of $176,164 were approved for export to Sri Lanka in FY 1997-98. There were no dual-use goods approved for export to Sri Lanka in that year. In FY 1998-1999 Australian military goods totalling $328,654 were approved for export to Sri Lanka. Dual-use equipment to the value of $20,905 was approved for export to Sri Lanka in that year. In FY 1999-2000 Australian military goods to the value of $3,000 were approved for export to Sri Lanka. Dual-use goods totalling $7,241 were approved for export to Sri. Lanka in that year. The total figure for military goods approvals for exportto Sri Lanka over the three year period in question is $507,818, and the dual-use equipment exportapprovals for that period totalled $28,146. (2) The Standing Interdepartmental Committee for Defence Exports (SIDCDE) is chaired by the Department of Defence. However, country assessments are the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). All countries are assessed by DFAT on an on-going basis. I understand that DFAT continues to review human rights concerns in relation to Sri Lanka and, as a member of the SIDCDE, I expect that any concerns that DFAT may have in relation to a given exportwould be raised in that forum. (3) Overseas training records held by the Department of Defence indicate that the only member of the Sri Lankan Defence Force that has been trained in Australia was a Lieutenant Commander from the Sri Lankan Navy who attended the Joint Services Staff College (JSSC) Course in Canberra in 1982. Telstra: Valuation (Question No. 1985) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) What were the key findings of the valuation of Telstra in the Commonwealth’s balance sheet referred to in Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee Budget hearings (Committee Hansard, 23 May 2000, pages 157-8). (2) Were forward estimates of the sale cost, net income and underlying budget impact of the sale of the Commonwealth’s remaining two thirds share of Telstra provided at page 2-39 of Budget Paper No.1 in 1998-99; if so, why cannot this same information be provided with respect to the sale of the Commonwealth’s remaining interest in Telstra on the basis that it is commercially confidential. (1) The Government has decided not to change the valuation of its investment in Telstra under AAS31: )LUVWO\ YDOXLQJ 7HOVWUD DW KLVWRULFDO FRVW DV WKH *RYHUQPHQW KDV DOZD\V GRQH FRPSOLHV ZLWK WKH Australian Accounting Standards. This has been confirmed by the Auditor General. Secondly, valuation at historical cost in the General Government Sector Financial Statements is consistent with the treatment in the Whole of Government statements. This is because the Australian Accounting Standards do not permit Telstra to be valued to market value within the Whole of Government Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS). Thirdly, reporting investments at historical cost is the common commercial practice of large private sector organisations, which must also report under Australian Accounting Standards. (2) Yes. It was deemed appropriate to include this information in the Budget papers for 1998-99 on a one-off basis. The Government decided that it would not be appropriate to provide this information in the papers for 1999-00 or 2000-01, as was the case for the Budget papers for the period up to 1997-98.

Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Web Site (Question No. 1991) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) now using its web site as the primary means of communicating with the aviation industry. (2) Are there any documents, draft regulations or discussion papers on that site that are made available only via the web site. (3) What steps has CASA taken to ensure that aviation operators, especially those in rural and regional Australia who do not have effective access to internet facilities,(a) stay informed and involved in proposed changes to regulations that affect their industry and(b)access other information on the web site that they require to operate in the aviation industry. (4) How many hits has the CASA web site received each month since September 1999. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised the following: (1) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) does not use the CASA web site as the primary method of communication with the aviation industry. The CASA web site is used in conjunction with various other methods of communication, to ensure that all publicly available CASA documents are accessible. For the purposes of the Regulatory Reform Plan (RRP) and standards development, CASA uses the following methods of communication with the aviation industry in addition to the CASA Web site The ‘Newsbriefs’ section of the “Flight Safety Australia” Magazine advertises changes in legislation, availability of consultative products (for example Discussion Papers (DPs), Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) and Summary of Responses (SoRs)), explanations of proposed legislative change and the effects or impacts that such proposals may have. The “Flight Safety Australia” magazine is distributed bi-monthly to over 86,000 people involved in Australian aviation. The Aviation Safety Forum The Aviation Safety Forum is a special consultative body helping the aviation community and CASA work effectively together to improve aviation safety in Australia. The ASF is made up of a group of 15 experienced aviation people who advise CASA on important strategic issues and who have been involved in diverse areas within aviation including passenger transport, engineering, aerial agriculture and general aviation. The ASF provides strategic advice directly to the CASA Board after each meeting and meets at least four times a year.",162,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10

286,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Standards Consultative Committee & Sub-Committees The SCC brings together CASA staff and representatives from a diverse range of aviation industry organisations to work jointly during the development phase of regulatory material. The SCC examines proposed regulatory changes to determine if they are worth pursuing and assists CASA in the allocation of priorities to those projects. Aviation industry experts then work together with CASA staff in subordinate groups (SCC Sub-Committees and Project Teams) on the detailed development of regulatory material (both new regulations and amendments). RFP Update Newsletter this newsletter is published bi-monthly by CASA’s Aviation Safety Standards Division to report to the Australian public, the aviation industry and CASA staff on progress and results from the Regulatory Reform Plan in developing new Civil Aviation Safety Regulations. The Newsletter is mailed direct to aviation community individuals and organisations who have expressed an interest in the reform plan. The Newsletter is also posted on the Web site and made freely available at all CASA offices. In addition, CASA may use the following channels to communicate with industry Flight Safety Forums Organised as necessary in various locations throughout Australia to provide safety information to the aviation community. The forums are provided to the public freeof-charge. Direct mail / broadcast fax Urgent safety information and important safety news is often communicated to Certificate of Registration holders, Air Operator Certificate holders and Aircraft Engineers via a letter or broadcast fax service. Hotlines CASA provides a nationwide 131757 (local call cost) telephone number. The Aviation Safety Standards Division has additional 1800 (free call) telephone & fax numbers available for regulatory reform activities. Videos, brochures, CD Roms The Aviation Safety Promotion Division produces a number of posters, brochures, flyers, instruction videos and CD Roms related to aviation safety. Most of these products are available free of charge and their availability is announced in the “Flight Safety Australia” magazine. Media releases, Safety Reports& Other Documents Media releases are issued as necessary to herald important aviation safety activities and news. Reports such as the Skehill Report, the Annual Report and Corporate Plan are released to provide important safety, strategic direction, financial and other operating information. Airshows CASA provides safety information at a number of airshows, but primarily at the Aviex& Airshows Downunder. Special packages from time to time special educational material is produced to coincide with major regulatory changes eg. ClassG Airspace Demonstration Instructor Packs. (2) With respect to standards development and the Regulatory Reform Plan, working draft (proposed) regulations, and CASA’s consultative products (ie DPs, NPRMs and SoRs) are made available to the general public and aviation community via the following means: the CASA Web site; hardcopy mail out to aviation community individuals; and organisations; hard copy for mail out on request from a central distribution point in central office; and CASA district offices. Aviation community and industry representatives on SCC sub-committees and Project Teams are kept informed of progress through both electronic (email/fax) and postal (hard copy) means. No draft regulatory material is exclusively made available on the CASA Web site. As part of the 1 October 2000 changes introduced to the Aircraft Registration process, CASA will no longer produce a hard-copy edition of the Aircraft Register. The Aircraft Register is made available to view on the CASA web site. For organisations and individuals that do not have internet access, arrangements can be made to view the Aircraft Register by appointment at a CASA office, or to request a hard-copy which a CASA staff member would download, print and forward on request. (3) For the purposes of standards development and the Regulatory Reform Plan (a) CASA has a number of methods of communication to keep all interested people (including people in rural and remote areas) apprised of regulatory changes. These methods include: To publicise the availability/release of CASA’s consultative documents (DPs, NPRMs and SoRs) a national advertisement is placed in ‘The Australian’ newspaper (Friday’s Aviation Supplement) and in the ‘Weekend Australian’. This advertisement announces the means by which people can obtain a copy of the document, making use of a free-of-charge telephone number, fax number and reply paid postal address. Printed copies of the DPs, NPRMs& SoRs are made available at all CASA district offices and made freely available to the aviation industry and general public. The DPs& NPRMs encourage all people to respond to the regulatory change proposals and provide procedures on how to submit formal responses to CASA. CASA must consider all responses received to its consultation products. The publication of the SoR document (which contains CASA’s disposition to the comment and its proposed action) and the revised final rule, concludes the public consultation process. The Aviation Safety Standards Division publishes a bi-monthly newsletter entitled RFP Update, which specifically reports on the progress of regulatory reform and standards development activities. Interested members of the community that have approached CASA to be kept informed of changes in the regulations are mailed this newsletter (currently a distribution of 1500 copies each issue). Copies of the Newsletters are also made available at CASA offices for interested industry/public consumption. The Aviation Safety Promotion Division publishes a bi-monthly magazine called ‘Flight Safety Australia’ which has a distribution of 86,000 copies. Important regulatory reform news, articles and advertisements for DPs, NPRMs& SoRs are published in the magazine. The implementation period for each new regulation may be as long as twelve months (or more, depending on complexity of regulation), from the time the regulation is made to the date it becomes effective. This allows CASA and the aviation industry a period of time to become familiar with the new regulation, for example preparing and finalising new procedures, conducting training and education programs, issuing delegations and authorisations and enable changes to Information Technology systems etc. As part of the implementation process, CASA has frequently organised regional meetings around Australia to enable educational and information opportunities. For example, the proposed new maintenance related Civil Aviation Safety Regulation Parts 43, 145, 66, 183, 147 have all been subject to several ‘roadshow’ education campaigns. Important regulatory changes are more often than not accompanied by a direct mail / fax letter from the CASA Director or Assistant Director, Aviation Safety Standards. For example, to announce the recent changes to the aircraft registration system which commenced on the 1 October 2000, Richard Yates (AD ASSD) wrote to all Certificate of Registration holders and Air Operator Certificate holders giving them details of the new rules. (b) All documents published on the CASA Web site are available in hard-copy to those members of the public without Internet access. No regulatory information is exclusively available on the CASA Web site. (4) The following information is representative of all external ‘hits’ on the CASA web site. January 2000 1,122,000 February 2000 1,007,000 March 2000 917,000 April 2000 809,000 June 2000 921,000 August 2000 1,218,000 September 2000 1,059,000 Due to changes in server hardware that resulted in loss of the relevant log files, CASA does not have data for September to December 1999, May 2000 and July 2000. Australian Maritime Safety Authority: Cost of Rescue (Question No. 1993) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 510, (Hansard, 12 May 1999, page 5318), concerning the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, what was the final cost to the Government, including the Department of Defence, of using civil search and rescue services and the defence force in the rescue operations. (2) Is he able to say whether the Bureau of Meteorology issued race officials with a gale warning for part of the race area about 4 hours before the race start, which was upgraded to the first of a series of storm warnings, the most severe warning issued by the Bureau outside tropical latitudes about an hour after the start of the race; if so, was any of the cost to the Government of using civil search and rescue services and the defence force in the rescue recoverable; if not, has the Government considered changing its policy to make such costs recoverable. (1) Refer to my answer to question No.1818. Questions concerning the cost of resources provided by the Department of Defence for search and rescue operations associated with the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race should be addressed to the Minister for Defence. (2) The Bureau of Meteorology falls within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and questions concerning its role in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race should be addressed to him. Hospitals: Funding (Question No. 2023) 2000: (1) Is he aware of any incidents in which public hospitals have attempted to shift costs from State or Territory responsibility to the responsibility of the Federal Government; in particular, is he aware of any instances where attempts have been made to inappropriately classify patients as out patients in circumstances where they have been admitted to hospital. (2) What are the potential liabilities for (a) a medical practitioner and (b) a hospital administrator, that engages in that practice. (3) What are the consequences for (a) a medical practitioner and (b) a hospital administrator that encourages, induces, aids or abets such a practice. (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The potential liabilities and consequences depend upon the method used to shift costs. Telstra: Rural and Regional Australia (Question No. 2024) Ms Hoare asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 October 2000: Has he committed the Government to preserving Government services in rural and regional Australia; if so, (a) does the commitment extend to services provided by Telstra and (b) would the outsourcing of Telstra maintenance services in rural and regional Australia be in keeping with the Government’s commitment.",163,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10

289,Dr Wooldridge,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,166,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10
290,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) During my visit to rural and regional Australia in January and February 2000, 1 made the commitment on 31 January 2000 that “in any future government decisions... in effect a red light flashes if that government decision involves a reduction in the delivery of an existing Commonwealth service”. I also stated on 3 1 January 2000 that this “doesn’t mean to say you can’t find different ways of delivering the same service level”. I then wrote to all portfolio Ministers on 10 February 2000 stressing that a fundamental responsibility of the Government is to ensure the maintenance of key individual services and the overall level of Commonwealth services provided to regional and rural Australia. My letter outlined new arrangements that were to be implemented immediately. These arrangements mean that there is now an active monitoring of issues related to service delivery in regional and rural Australia. (a) I refer the honourable member to an answer I gave in Question Time on 13 March 2000, where I said that the commitment on Government services applies to the provision of services by Telstra to rural and regional Australia. (b) As long as the service levels are maintained or improved, the outsourcing of Telstra maintenance services in rural and regional Australia would be in keeping with the commitment on Government services. This is clearly the case because, as I noted when I first made the commitment on 31 January 2000, the commitment “doesn’t mean to say you can’t find different ways of delivering the same service level”. Swan Electorate: Medicare Agents (Question No. 2033) Mr Wilkie asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 9 October 2000: (1) Can he provide a list of pharmacies that have been granted permission to act as Medicare agents within the electorate of Swan. (2) Can he detail the requirements that must be met by pharmacies prior to being granted permission to act as a Medicare agent. (1) Pharmacies are able to act as “Medicare agents” through the installation of a Medicare easyclaim fax device. Within the electorate of Swan, the following pharmacies were granted permission to have Medicare easyclaim fax devices installed: Friendly Society Chemist of Victoria Park, 553 Albany Hwy, East Victoria Park 6101 Park Centre Pharmacy, Shop 19 The Park Centre, 789 Albany Hwy, East Victoria Park 6101 Barry’s Pharmacy, 844 Albany Hwy, East Victoria Park 6101 East Victoria Park Soul Pattinson Chemist, 779 Albany Hwy, East Victoria Park 6101 (2) To fulfil the eligibility requirements for installation of a Medicare easyclaim fax device, a pharmacy must be located: (a) within a postcode area that contains a former Medicare Office which has been closed since 1997 (not including relocation); (b) at least five kilometres away from the nearest open Medicare Office (measured along a route equivalent to that used by public transport); and (c) within one kilometre of the closed Medicare Office site. Ministerial Document Service (Question No. 2049) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) What guidance, if any, has been given to Ministers about the need to ensure that their media releases are included in AusInfo’s Ministerial Document Service.",166,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10
291,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s equstion is as follows:(2) How many year 2000 media releases by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation have been published in the Ministerial Document Service to date. (1) No recent guidance has been provided to Ministers about this service. Currently the Ministerial Document Service is under review. (2) There have been two media releases by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation included in the Ministerial Document Service from 1 January 2000 to 11 October 2000. Child Support: Austudy and Abstudy Payments (Question No. 2051) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family for Community Services, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) How many recipients of AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY payments are liable to pay the minimum child support of $5 per week ($260 per year). (2) Are the necessary administrative systems in place to ensure that the minimum child support liability of AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY recipients is paid to custodial parents. (3) Have any administrative difficulties been encountered in the payment of the minimum child support liability of AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY recipients to custodial parents, particularly those that receive Centrelink payments; if so, what action is being taken to overcome these difficulties. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) This information is not collected by either the Child Support Agency (CSA), Centrelink or (2) The CSA and Centrelink have administrative procedures in place to collect child support from AUSTUDY, the same as any other income benefit. For ABSTUDY, the CSA is able under Section 72A of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to collect outstanding child support payments from third parties (in this case DETYA) who hold funds on behalf of a child support payer. (3) No. Medical Specialists: National Competition Council Report (Question No. 2063) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Is he aware of the findings of the National Competition Council paper, Reforming the Health Care Professionals, regarding the role of the specialist colleges in limiting the number of medical specialists in Australia and inflating specialists’ incomes. (2) What progress has been made in opening up the control and administration of the specialist colleges. (3) Are these colleges operating in a manner consistent with the principles of National Competition Policy. (1) Yes. (2) The Commonwealth recognises that specialist colleges have considerable influence over entry points to the medical workforce – training numbers and the recognition of overseas trained doctors. The Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee (AMWAC) makes recommendations on medical workforce numbers, and the Commonwealth will continue to encourage specialist medical colleges and State/Territory Health authorities to increase training places in line with AMWAC recommendations.",167,Arcas T As Air Facilities 10 5 10

293,Mr Anthony,The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the,168,Detya
294,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the Commonwealth is monitoring this issue closely. Medical colleges are the recognised training bodies and the arbiters of clinical and professional standards, and there is widespread agreement that the standards of education and professional practice in Australia are very high by international standards. The Commonwealth will also continue to support and encourage action by the profession to review medical college processes for the recognition of overseas trained doctors. The Commonwealth considers that the desire to remove anti-competitive behaviours must be balanced with the need to maintain public safety. The Commonwealth will continue to promote selection and assessment processes by medical colleges which are timely, equitable and transparent. (3) The issue of whether a specialist medical college is operating in a manner consistent with the principles of National Competition Policy is not a matter dealt with by the Department of Health and Aged Care. Industry: Assistance (Question No. 2068) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) How much does the Federal Government spend each year on industry welfare. (2) What corporate responsibility requirements are associated with the programs and outlays in (1) above. (3) Does the minister support the recommendation of the McClure Report that mutual obligation requirements be extended to corporate Australia: if so, what will this involve. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Federal Government provides a range of assistance measures to industry to foster economic advances and scientific achievements that continue to strengthen Australia’s international competitiveness. This assistance includes tax incentives to encourage research and development and assistance to attract investment to Australia. Given that this expenditure is designed to foster economic advances that continue to strengthen Australia as a whole, and given that the programs have a strong public interest underpinning, the Government does not accept that they constitute ‘industry welfare’. (2) Most industry assistance programs include, to varying degrees, elements of enhanced corporate responsibility. These include, in some circumstances, demonstration programs for educating other businesses, the sharing of some intellectual property, as well as commitments to investment, job creation and/or the involvement of local firms in projects. In developing industry assistance programs significant consideration is given to maximising the national interest, which can include a range of measures to maximise the externalities associated with a given expenditure. In addition, as highlighted by my colleague, the Minister for Community Services, the Hon Larry Anthony NIP, in responding to the similar Parliamentary Question on this subject asked by the Honourable Member (Question No: 1905), the Government has established the Prime Minister’s Community Business Partnership which explicitly promotes a culture of community/business collaboration in Australia. This program builds upon the already extensive community work undertaken by many businesses in Australia. (3) While the Government has given in principle support to the McClure Report on Participation Support for a ‘More Equitable Society’ it has not, as yet, responded to specific recommendations such as that highlighted. The Government’s response to individual recommendations in the report will be made available before the end of the year.",168,Detya
295,Mr Moore,"The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the followingMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Newspaper Articles (Question No. 2081) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Are remarks by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Reconciliation to international newspapers about Indigenous people and their civilisation an accurate representation of the views of the Government on issues of reconciliation; if so what is the Government’s response to condemnation of those views by the community and the Indigenous community. (2) Why has the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Reconciliation completely failed to apologise to the Indigenous community and the Australian people and Parliament for his remarks about Aboriginal culture and civilisation, since the Minister’s return to Australia. (3) If it is not the intention of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Reconciliation to apologise and explain the Minister’s comments, in light of the condemnation by the community how can he have confidence that the Minister will be able to do anything constructive in his role as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Reconciliation. (1) I have read in full the remarks that were recorded in Le Monde and The Washington Post and believe the Minister’s remarks were taken out of context. (2) I am advised by my department that after media reports in Australia, the Minister, while still in Switzerland, phoned Dr Evelyn Scott, the Chainnan of the Council for Reconciliation, and the Deputy Chairman, Sir Gustav Nossal, to clarify the content of his remarks and express regret for the interpretation that some people had placed on his remarks. (3) I have full confidence in the Minister. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Newspaper Articles (Question No. 2082) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Does he recognise that his remarks to international newspapers about Indigenous people and their civilisation are in conflict with the views of the majority of the Australian people on reconciliation. (2) Is he aware of the outrage created by his comments in the Indigenous community, and amongst Australians generally. (3) Why has he (a) not apologised to the Indigenous community for his comments about Aboriginal culture and civilisation since his return from overseas and (b) not made a statement to Parliament about this matter. (4) How can he continue to serve in his role as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Reconciliation, when the role requires him to deal with the Indigenous people and a range of community organisations that have expressed outrage at his comments. (1) My comments were taken out of context. (2) I am aware and regret that my remarks have caused hurt and concern. The remarks were never intended to be divisive. (3)(a) While still in Switzerland I phoned Dr Evelyn Scott, the Chairman of the Council for Reconciliation, and the Deputy Chairman, Sir Gustav Nossal, to clarify the content of my remarks and express regret for the interpretation that some people had placed on my remarks, and (b) I do not consider a statement to Parliament necessary.

(2) What funds will the Government commit to assisting in the restoration of the Snowy River. answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Government welcomes the announcement by the NSW and Victorian Governments of a proposed environmental flow for the Snowy River and other rivers affected by the Snowy Mountains Scheme. It is another step towards the corporatisation of the Snowy Scheme, after which environmental flows for the Snowy River can be introduced. The Commonwealth has recently completed an Environmental Impact Statement, which focuses on potential changes in water flows in the Snowy River and the Murray-Darling Basin as part of the corporatisation process. Now that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, has provided his recommendations on the Environmental Impact Statement, I will be able to formally discuss the proposed environmental flow outcome with my colleagues. (2) The issue of Commonwealth funding to restore environmental flows to the Snowy River is a matter 1 will progress in the context of these discussions. Education: Schools Funding (Question No. 2098) Dr Martin asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 1 November 2000: What sum has been allocated to (a) public and (b) private schools in the electoral divisions of Throsby and Cunningham by the Commonwealth Government in (i) 1995-96, (ii) 1996-97, (iii) 199798, (iv) 1998-99, (v) 1999-2000 and (vi) 2000-2001.
