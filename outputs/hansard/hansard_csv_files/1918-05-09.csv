It is necessary for me to give to the Minister some explanation of the question. member wish to make a long statement? Mr J. H . CATTS -No. It appears that, in 1915, Germany sought to have arrangements made for the clothing of 5,000,000 of her. soldiers, and that this was being done. through an American company, of whose 36,000 shares 29,095 were said to he held by citizens of the United States of America.

It has transpired in the course of the trial that the agents of the company in various countries were these member is making rather a lengthy statement it will be necessary for him to obtain the leave of the House. being given, but I suggest' a more proper course. If the honourable member will furnish me with the necessary particulars, I shall undertake to have the matter examined at once.. Later: Mr J. H . CATTSI understand that the Acting Prime Minister has no objection to my continuing the statement, and that his suggestion was made under the impression that I would have an opportunity of dealing with the matter later. member may continue only with the leave of the House. The motion to go into Committee of Supply will give the honourable member the opportunity to say what he wishes Hon. W. Elliot to say. Mr J. H .

Without referring to our ordinary correspondence, I should like to tell you t»-<lny that I had several visits from Herr Trade Councillor Stcehr, who has been here for more than two «i:cks. As appears .'roin the several conversations with hun, lie seems to have learned of the wool transactions which you have effected both for Forstmann and Huffman, and for the friends of these gentlemen in Cape and Australian wools, and he did everything he could to induce me to take part for the bank in wool for his own account, to the extent of about ten to twenty million marks, or to participate in a syndicate to be formed for this purpose. Naturally I listened to his proposals witli the greatest attention, but I told him at once that we would not like to give up the impartial position which we had hitherto taken with reference to the rest of our customers, this position being evidenced by the fact that we limit ourselves to tlie financing of such transactions. Meanwhile, he Beems to have succeeded as a result of influence exerted by him in tbe proper quarters in getting orders, or, at least, prospective orders, of considerable size for governmental authorities, and with this in view he has arranged that his son Hans, who is at the time at the Front, shall be granted leave to be able to go to America for the proper execution of these transactions intrusted to ,, him. This young Mr Stoehr was here a few days ago in oompany with his father. . . . Young Mr Stoehr is now to try to purchase suitable quantities of Cape and also, Australian wool over there in order to ship' them here later at' a suitable time, as American domestic wool, with the manufacture and preparation necessary for the purpose. Apparently there has been a conspiracy to ship wool to Germany. The statement was made in the United States Law Courts that a German army officer, obtaining leave from the German army, visited the United States, and it is suggested .that lie also visited Australia, and bought wool here, and that now 1,800 bales is stored in Australia on account of a German firm which was endeavouring to' arrange for the clothing of 5,000,000 German soldiers. wool to Germany now. Ho was hoping . to send it there via America. Mr J. H . CATTS -But if there are 1,800 bales of wool stored-in the Commonwealth on account of a German firm it ought to be released at once to enable Australian women to get wool for the purpose of knitting socks for soldiers. wool. Mr J. H . CATTS -Then we should endeavour to have it treated in such a way that it can be used. I have no doubt that the matter having been brought under his notice, the Acting PrimeM in ister will take steps to have it thoroughly sifted in order to discover if there is any wool stored in Australia on behalf of a German firm. lay.

But in tbe 'Small Arms Factory to-day a system of economic conscription is in operation. If that were not so, why should married men, with five or six children dependent upon them, be thrown out of employment for ten weeks, and have to walk the streets in fruitless search of work. If that is not economic conscription, I do not know what is. I have here a letter from the Secretary of the Amalgamated 'Society of Engineers at Lithgow, dealing with various phases had been, in the employ of the Departof this question.

The men are not going to lie down in the streets and die from * starvation. Tlie Minister fo©Defence knows perfectly well how dimcult it is for any man to get employment at the present time, aud how difficult it is for men who have been out of work for ten weeks, and have families dependent on them, to travel through the country in search of employment. for putting these men off ? ceased work because thejr, wanted better conditions and higher pay, and it necessarily followed that a certain section of the men employed in the Factory automatically went off, because there was no work for them. It was said at first that six barrel-setters were required to keep the work of the Factory going. W it h three of those men not working, it meant that half of the hands could not be employed. Later on, however, it >was discovered that three barrel-setterscould do all the work required. These three men are earning approximately £25 each per week. The manager told the men that when the complement of barrel-setters returned to work the whole of the men would be re-employed, but when the men went back to the Factory seeking re-employment they were told that they were no longer required. That is why a large number of these men are not working. day the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) askedHas the Minister issued any order requesting thousand men are now paying the penhis officials in the various Departments under his control to draw up lists of men who are of eligible military age? The reply wasYes. This was done at the request of the State Recruiting Committee. . If the State Recruiting Committee is to be permitted to go into the various industrial establishments of the Commonwealth and I undercompel the management of any particular establishment to draw up a list of eligibles and give notice to every man whose name is on that list, we shall have economic conscription in force. That is what is* happening in the iSrnall Arms Factory. The Ministerf o r Defence states quite openly that he w ill not employ a single man of military age. Furthermore, he is preventing men who are not of military age, who have reject certificates, and have familiesdependent upon them, from securing employment. the pledges given by the Government at the Governor General's Recruiting Conference ? at that Conference was something similar to the pledge given to the people after the first conscription, referendum, and is being treated in exactly the same way. It is easy for the Government to say that they w ill not introduce conscription, when the very next day they ask employers to do it for them.' That is exactly what is happening at the Small Arms Factory. stated how the men left their work, and how, after the unions had held meetings on the Saturday morning and on the Sunday, they were instructed to return to work.

Minister) [3.15] -This trouble has been going ori before I entered the Department, and I was not personally acquainted with all the details. After the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls) gave me notice, about 12 o'clock to-day, that be intended to move the adjournment of the House, I obtained the following statement from the Department-jThere has been a considerable amount of trouble at Lithgowi n connection wit h the barrel-setters, whose business is to straighten barrels after they have been, machined. This is an operation which requires some expertness of eye, and so far no machine has been devised which, can effectively do the work. It takes some little time to learn, and has always been regarded as more or less of a trade secret. Previous difficulties wit h these men have been in regard to wages. Exorbitant rates have been demanded, and were resisted for a time, but ultimately the Department had to give way, so that the output of rifles would not be disturbed. To overcome the difficulty, arrangements wore made with the High Com* missioner whereby eight (8) unfit members 'of the Australian Imperial Force were sent to Enfield for training in barrel-setting. Four of these men have since arrived in Australia. .Contrary to expectations, these returned soldiers, instead of supporting the Department in its difficulties, immediately took sides with the malcontents at Lithgow, and even demanded higher wages than the .original men thought of. A t one time their demand was for wages of £12 12s. per week. Of the four(4) returned soldiers, one has since been discharged for insubordination and neglect of duty. He was tolerated as long as possible, .but, as stated, was at last dismissed. One, after his return to Australia, asked permission to return to his private business. This was granted, as, at that time, the factory was f u l ly staffed with barrel-setters,, and, in fact, there were one or two surplus to requirements. This man gave an undertaking that he would be available if his services were required in case of emergency. He has since been sent for, but has not yet reported whether he w ill f u l f i l his undertaking. Of the two men remaining, one has remained loyal, and is at present working at the factory, and the other is on strike. The other four men of those originally trained were allowed to remain in England at the express wish of the Ministry of Munitions, the idea being that, as the men's demands had been conceded here, these men would not be required for the moment; and they would probably become all the more efficient when the time came for them to return to Australia. As a precautionary measure, steps have been taken for twenty more to be trained in this barrelsetting, but their services w ill not be available for some time yet.

It is the principle in all military manufactures that work should be inspected and passed by independent inspectors.

A further satisfactory feature is that Mr Bors, who specially studied this matter of barrel-setting during ""his visit to England, is en route to Australia. When he arrives, there is no doubt his services wilF be available. that these men had left work, he stated that he proposed to discharge them and make an effort to overcome the difficulty. He stated that it would be necessary to lay off a considerable number of men for the time being, the reason being that, as the factory is balanced in every part, any disruption' of one process, especially such a one as this, the only one in the factory which depends on skill of individuals, involves the remainder. Some of the men could be continued in work, but sooner or later they would have to be laid off to await the time when the barrels would catch up. It is better, tlierefore, to stop the whole of the manufacturing section unti l the difficulty can be overcome. This is what is being done. majority of the employees, and as soon as barrels are forthcoming, they will be taken on again. will be taken now to abolish the night shift and give effect tb the Prime Minister's announcement that preference of employment would be given to returned soldiers in the Government establishments. siderable number of eligibles employed at the Small Arms Factory, and while it has been difficult to obtain returned soldiers to take their places, it is considered that by the abolition of the double shift a considerable number of them can be disposed of. The reason for the abolition of the double shift is that only 260 men are employed at night now, and Mr Wise. whether or not they ,are engaged does not have much effect on the output of rifles. Over 1,000 men are employed on the day shift, and these, together with the new machinery which has now been installed, w ill , it is anticipated been attained within recent months, namely, 900 rifles per week. This second shift at present is more or less an expense to the factory, and as' the supplies of rifles in AusThese men, for ' some reason or tralia are ample, there does not seem to be any good purpose served by its maintenance. The supply 'of rifles at present is nearly as great as it was when war broke out. The Apparently they claimed the manager has been asked for a report as to the position at the moment.

74,Mr Charlton,"The barrel-settersask the House what view will be taken of the action of the Government by the industrial workers throughout the Commonwealth, once they understand that recognised employees, of the Commonwealth who are not on strike, but are idle through the actions of certain individuals, are denied employment. Minister for Defence has said that this has been found an opportune time to dispense with the second shift, which is not required, because the factory can produce sufficient rifles in one shift with the additional machinery which is being installed. that the time is suitable to give effect to Hie policy of the Department to employ returned soldiers in this work. I , too, desire to see returned soldiers employed, but I do not think that the policy of dispensing with the services of married men with families, in order to give preference to returned men, will find favour with them or with the public at large. number ,pf men who were not at Lithgow prior to this trouble have recently been engaged at the factory, whilst hundreds of former employees have been out of work for ten weeks. Everybody can Understand what must be the indigent circumstances of working men who have been unemployed for ten weeks, especially when they have to pay rent. But1 although the other factory employees condemned the barrel-setters who were responsible for the stoppage of work, they are told that, because certain returned soldiers are available they cannot < be reinstated in their old positions. This policy can have only one effect. certain classes of work in connection with % When the unionists throughout Australia machinery, and when they are thrown out realize that returned soldiers are replacof employment, they cannot go anywhere ing married men who have families to and get a job. The consequence is that support, they will say that there is no in they feel the present position very keenly, centive to them to encourage enlistment. and the Government's action must create We do not wish that view to be held. We a good deal of ill-feeling. I hope the desire to get as many recruits as possible; Government will give the matter further yet, while we are endeavouring' in every consideration, and I am sure that the way to clear the political and industrial Assistant Minister will use his influence atmosphere, we find the Government into change the policy of the Government if troducing in their own factories methods he finds that step necessary. From my which will' prove detrimental to recruitpoint of view, the policy is dangerous, and ing. ment took this course of action they did the war. In those circumstances, let the not view the matter in the light in which Government retrace their steps and give I have put it. But that is the true inemployment to the men who are required terpretation of their attitude. Is it in for producing small-arms, and when any the interests of the country that, at this vacancies occur, give the work to returned time of crisis, we should create bad feeling which will do more to prevent recruiting than anything else that has happened ? In the interests of recruiting, Conferences are being held between State Ministers and industrial organizations for the purpose of removing all obstacles; but, The while these negotiations are in progress, the Commonwealth Government are introducing a system which must appear to the outsider to be economic conscription. That is the only construction that can be placed on the action of the Government in depriving' men of the right to work, The Minister has said, also, although .those men have committed no fault. Nobody will resent, this policy more than the soldiers themselves. Men who have had sufficientspirit to go to the Front will not come back to resort to the cowardly action of displacing their fellow men. We ought to endeavour to find avenues of employment for the returned soldiers, and we must maintain them A until work for them is found; but let us not put them in the position of taking the bread and butter from married men with families. Though the Minister argued that there was nothing in the nature of economic conscription in the Government's policy, I ask honourable members to put themselves in the position of the workmen, and consider what would be their opinion if they found that returned soldiers were being utilized to displace them from their employment and leave their families without means of support. It must be remembered that the factory employees are skilled workers. They can do only j I am sure that when the Governwill not be helpful in the prosecution of soldiers. Do not let us, for the purpose of getting rid of the burden of maintaining returned men until they find employment, displace other men who for years have given loyal service to the Government. J. have never sat silent when any question of unemployment has been brought forward. I have been connected with every unemployment grievance for the last quarter of a century, and to-day I .appeal to the Government, through the Minister, to be just to the men who are out of work. At the present time, we are. simply existing on credit, and if that credit be disturbed, we shall have more trouble in Australia than we'have ever had before. The disturbance of credit^following the -land boom and the big maritime strike caused a financial debacle and misery and wretchedness throughout Victoria. What happens when there is unemployment? The first person to suffer is the small landin the Department, since he has lord, who cannot get his rent. Then the small tradesmen feel the pinch. Later comes the disturbance of credit, and the tradesmen have to appeal to the banks. I warn the Government that in creating unemployment they are taking the first step towards causing a disturbance of credit, and once that happens there will be an end to the present form of government, and we shall have a lot of trouble. In connection with the land boom, I had a list of 200 names of schoolmates and boy-mates who lost their homes, for which they had partially paid. The building societies collapsed, and later came the bank smash. In a time of war the Commonwealth Government are actually putting men out of work, and stopping the making of rifles because three expert men, who were drawing £25 a week, declined to do their work. Rifles can still be made, and put aside to be remedied later on by the barrel-setters. I understand that barrel-setting is a work that cannot easily be learnt, and that some men have a special faculty for it. I ask the Minister not to be too thinskinned about his Department, for if ever there was a Department which lived in a miasma of mystery, it is the Defence Department. there was, a phantom regiment, and that thousands of pounds were drawn to pay men who never existed? Will anybody deny that the Minister for Defence swore that the fence surrounding the Base Hospital, in St. Kilda-road, was over 6 feet high, when i u reality, as was shown by a photograph, the fence only' reaches my shoulders. DoI not know that medical men lied in the witness-box when they said, after the unfortunate Gunner Perry was sent to the observation ward of the lunatic asylum, that he was able to earn his living? honourable member that the question before the Chair has nothing to do with that case. pursue the subject further. The Defence Department has been branded by a leading advocate in Sydney as "" the Department of Muddledom."" I cannot blame my honourable friend ( Mr Wise), for the muddle that exists been in office for only a few weeks, but I hope that under his fostering care a great improvement will be made. The Government are playing with fire in dismissing men in this way. At a recent recruiting meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall Lieutenant McKenzie, a returned soldier, made'the most eloquent speech, in which he declared: "" I have been a trade unionist all my life,"" and I am sure that he would cut his throat rather than find\ work for himself by displacing another man. These men at Lithgow are, perhaps, to be treated just as returned soldiers employed at the woollen works in Queen-street .are .being dealt with. If they have a pension of 15s. per week, they are not allowed to earn more than 27s. per week, as their total weekly income must not exceed £2 2s. The returned soldiers engaged in the same industry in Sydney are working under the Red Cross, and axe treated differently from their brothers in Melbourne, who object to this system as a dragging down of trade unionism. No one knows better than I do the misery suffered by the masses as the result of unemployment, and I unhesitatingly say that if this system is continued by the Government a most dangerous situation will be created. Will anybody deny that The Government should extend the work of the Small Arms Factory.

77,Dr. Maloney,"Then I shall nota second class cruiser. I warned the Government as far back as 1905 of the neces"" sity for the establishment of an arsenal in Australia, and it seems to me' that we shall come to a bad end if we stop at the mere making of rifles. We should manufacture in Australia everything required for the prosecution of accursed war. Asi t is, we find the Government reducing employment in the only factory we have for the making of munitions. I wish the^ people had an opportunity of controlling the created thing called Parliament. If they had, there would soon be a change. Let the Government extend its munition works. Let us have, if you like, two arsenals-on e at Lithgow, and the other at Canberra-and let the men returning from the Front be employed at the Canberra works. Returned soldiers have not been treated well in Melbourne, and I think that both the Commonwealth and the State Government should be ashamed of their shortcomings in that respect. I am confident that not one out of every fifty returned soldiers would accept a job if , by doing so, he would deprive another man of his bread and butter. week the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls) was busily engaged in his own electorate in connection, no doubt, with this very matter, and in his absence I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a question concerning the men out of work at the Lithgow! Small Arms Factory. gentleman was at first unable to answer my question, but on Friday last he in formed me in the House that he had received a report stating that it had been found possible to re-engage a number of these men, although a considerable number were still out of work. I understand that prior to this trouble 1,500 men were employed in the Small Arms Factory, and that to-day there are only 800 in the works.' in the day shift. ment, it means that 500 men are still out economic conscription was the only one of work. A point which I wish to emto which the Prime Minister, speaking on phasize is that two or three months ago behalf of the Commonwealth and State the Government sent the present' ActGovernments, and also on behalf of the ing Prime Minister( Mr Watt) on a special vsit to Lithgow to inquire into the housing of the men employed at the Factory. The honourable gentleman reported to Cabinet, with the result that nomic conscription. Shortly afterwards, the Government decided to build 200 houses for the use of the men. The Government realized, apparently, at that time that the housing accommodation for the employees was insufficient, and they did hot contemplate any reduction in the number of hands. H a d they thought at that time of making a 33 per cent, reduction in the number of employees at the Factory the probability is that the proposal to build 200 houses for the workmen would not have been made. I do not know whether the Government in tend to proceed with it , but if , at the time of the Acting Prime Minister's visit to Lithgow, additional housing accommodation was .thought to be necessary, there must have heen evidence before the Government that there was not likely to be any reduction in the number of hands employed. But what is the position to-day? We are told that at least 500 men have been thrown out of work, and the majority of these, according to the honorable member for Macquarie, are married. In view of the circular which has been distributed -throughout the Commonwealth Departments it is felt that pressure is being brought to bear upon the officers to compel them, although married, to enlist. An y such pressure is quite at variance w i th the decision arrived at by the Recruiting Conference, which recently The honourable took place at the instance of the Governor General. One of the propositions which I , on behalf of representatives of Labour, submitted to the Recruiting Conference, was that there should be no economic conscription in either private or public employment.

133,Mr Mahony (Dalley) [ 4 . 1 7 ],"Iauthority who might know the circumstances, his private residence is raided. Amongst some of the documents taken from 'the house were some nrivate letters that had been received by his daughters, and also' some picture post-cards of D r . Mannix. It may be regarded as a most heinous crime in this country to have picture post-cards of the kind in one's possession; but, if so, the. fact ought to be made known to the public, so that breaches of the particular regulation may be avoided. It is desired that the letters should be returned, for they possess, if not an intrinsic, at any rate a sentimental, value to the daughters of the household. Honourable members understand that young ladies do receive letters from members of the opposite sex concerning matters which should not be made public, and such documents axe not likely to be of any military value to the enemy. Of course, it is quite possible, in these latter days, that the militarv authorities may think the seizure of these letters w ill , in some w a y , / h e l p l o beat the Germans back, and win the war. The whole affair seems to be utterly ridiculous and 1 childish; and I bring it under the notice of the House, and of the Government, with the suggestion ""that when such information is laid against any person, inquiries should be set afoot by the authorities in order toinsure that personal spite plays no part in the proceedings. The inquiries made in such cases ought, of course, to be conducted privately, and would doubtless assist the authorities in deciding as to the merits of the charges made. I sincerely trust that the letters I have spoken of w ill be returned, and. not detained with any idea that they may help the Government to win the war. There is another serious matter connected with the military authorities which I desire to bring under the notice of the House. eager to do his duty to his K in g and country, enlisted, and was sent Home. When he arrived in Englandi t was discovered that he was not quit© medically fit for Hie firing-line; and, as he was actuated by the highest of patriotic motives, the refusal of the authorities to allow him to go to Erance was a great disappointment. Indeed, he felt that an in justice was being done to bim, and he did what many other men might do under the circumstances. He discovered that a d r a f t Mr Mahony. from his own battalion was being sent to Erance, so he smuggled himself amongst them, got into the firing line, and started to do his b it to beat back the Huns. When this was discovered, he was charged, first, with being absent without, leave; and then, above all things, with the great offence of "" unlawfully firing at the King's enemies."" Could anything be more absurd ? However, the worse part of the business is that, because of this man's determination to fight, his wife and children are made to suffer in Australia to-day, inasmuch as their separation allowance has been stopped now for months. member submitted his case to the Minister for Defence? it before the House, because I find the military authorities are going along in the old humdrum way, accepting something that somebody tells them, and leaving this woman and her .children to starve.

Dear Sir, I am writing to ask yon if you could help me in my trouble with regard to my dear husband, No. 6776 Private George S. Mathers, 13th Infantry Battalion. I am enclosing you a military form ; it is not the first one I received, this one was given to mc by one of the military officials to use if I went to the Lord Mayor's Fund for assistance, the other one I gave to a doctor who was going to t r y and do what he could for me; then I was advised to write to you, and I would bo sure to have the matter cleared up. I have received no military pay at all since the pay before the date on enclosed form, and. I can gain no satisfaction with regard to my husband. I gave a good husband and father when I let him go, and now it is not only a broken home, but a broken heart as well. I have had to take my son away from his school and let him go to work, and I have had to take a positon myself. I am in service, and have seven children to look after. I wish honourable members to note t h a t particular pointI. am ill myself, and am afraid I can't keep up much longer. It is cruel to be treated in this way. Isi t just to take our men, and then treat them and their wives and children as though we were nothing? Can you find out for mc why my money has been stopped ? All they say is that my dear husband is marked ""' A.W.L."" I asked them at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, why my boy and I should suffer for my husband not being able to .attend dril l (I'know he is, or was, very ill by his letters), and they politely told mc' that if a man was sick and unable to go to work, his boss would not pay himTs this the callous way in w h i c h the dependants of our soldiers are to be treated ?

By my husband's letters he has not heen drawing any money at a l l for a very long time before my pay was stopped. Poor fellow, he feels it very keenly. My only hope is that my boy's and my own prayer is answered, and that God w ill protect him, and they w ill send him home to me. I was paying off for a block of land, and had to sell it to get a little ready cash, and I have two small accounts I am unable to pay. They worry and upset ine. If they were settled; I could manage on my boy's money and what 1 am earning myself, but paying a little off them each week leaves my small amount of cash very short. I only write and explain all this, dear sir, to let you know how I am placed, and I do not want my affairs to be made public. M x .

They showed me the papers with the amount on them, £12 10s. 10d., I think it was. In God's name, I ask you to t r y and find out something for me, and let me hear from you at your early convenience. Believe me, Yours faithfully , ( Mrs.) E. J . MATHKBS. P.S I am also enclosing an answer to a letter I wrote to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney. When I say I don't want my affairs made public, I mean by telling people; as a rule, people are so .cruel, and make the most of one in trouble. I was told by one returned man that the military people dare not stop my pay unless my husband stopped it himself for some reason, and as I know my dear husband has no cause to do that, I don't want anybody's ideas, only those who help for kindness, and as one Christian to another.

136,Mr Mahony,"B e for e I sit down, Ic/o Mrs. A. Prestage, 35-37 Wellington-street, Rozelle, regarding the stoppage of payment of allotment of her hubsand, No. 6776 Private G. S. Mathers, I have iiow to inform you that a cable has been received from the Chief Paymaster, London, to the effect that this allotthat she can get no assistance. ment cannot be reinstated as the soldier in question is still an absentee. I sent on the letter to the lady in question, so that she might know exactly what the Defence Department had to say on the subject, and I received from her another letter, complaining of her harsh treatment, and pointing out that she had received letters from her husband addressed from a camp in England. Although the paymaster in London cabled out to the effect that the soldier in question is presumably an absentee, letters have come from him addressed from the 13th Training Battalion, Codfoi'd, the date of the last of these being 28th February last. The Defence Department, in a letter of the 29th A p r i l, say that a cable has been received from the Chief Paymaster, London, to the effect that the allotment cannot be reinstated, as the man is still an absentee. cable given? it was sent about the same time as the letters. This woman has suffered financial loss arid a terrible mental strain, so that her health is completely shattered. Having no means to pay for medical assistance, she is forced, as she says in one of her letters, to go into a public hospital. Her words are, "" Nobody cares; I am only a soldier's w if e .

As I have pointed out, the authorities at Home said that he was physically unfit to go to the Front, but his spirit was so strong that he determined to do so.

The outstanding fact is that the woman and her children have not received assistance. ^ . fact is that the honourable member has not himself appealed to the Minister for Defence. approached Senator Pearce on behalf of a woman, in order to ascertain the whereabouts of one of her two sons, who were at the Pront. The Department had in formed her that it had no record of his whereabouts. The mother knew that he had gone to the Front, for she had said honourable farewell to h i m at the boat. But when I approached Senator Pearce he said that he had much more important matters to No , but without a attend to.

There is in Victoria a State War Council, which is now associated, to some extent, with the Department of Repatriation. considerable sums of money, including a recent amount of £120,000, which is specially applied to the relief of cases such as the honourable member has mentioned. Sof a r as my experience goes, amelioration has not been refused in one deserving case. labour and trouble incurred by members of the Councili n ascertaining the facts of every application is most commendable. with me spends day after day in investigating the circumstances of various cases which are brought under his notice.

I hope the honourable member will not allow the case to drop, but will seek relief from the sources I have suggested, and will urge a complete investigation by the Defence That is a matter for subseDepartment. I realize, with him, that In the meantime there these complaints are unduly and unfairly stressed in opposition to recruiting, and that makes it all the more necessary that I speak from some little experian investigation should take place, especially as the"" Government have made extra appointments for that purpose. I believe that if this case were brought under the notice of the Assistant M in ister for Defence( Mr Wise), whom the honourable member may interview in the That Council has raised House, he will see that a proper inquiry is made, and that temporary relief is given at once. The case should be dealt with on its merits, and if the merits are such as he suggested, the unfortunate woman is entitled to the most generous consideration. A few days ago I thought it necessary to complain about the actions of the military authorities in raiding the offices A gentleman who is associated and private residences of certain reputable citizens. I made particular reference to the raid of the private residence and offices of the secretary of the Irish National Association in Brisbane., Sinoe then, correspondence' has reached me which shows that that raid was by no means isolated. I am informed that in a number of instances in New South Wales, presbyteries, and even convents, have been raided by the military within the last few months. I shall read to the House a copy of a letter which was sent to the M i nI n addition to ister for DefenceThe Presbytery, Canowindra, N.S.W., 2nd March, 1918. The case I beg to make application to you, personally, for information regarding the charge made against mc by the military authorities in Sydney. The Hon. Mr Millen promised me some five weeks back to make someinquiries for me, In the meantime I am hopeful that but iip to the present I have not received any information, although I sent him, at his request, the particulars of my transactions. Of course . it is most It appears that, towards the end of December, the military authorities in Sydney caused inquiries to be made of me as to what certain cases received by me contained.

166,"On The Contrary, The Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [4.581","school, and sec for themselvca the articles referred to. When in Sydney, I called upon Colonel Lloyd with reference to his action, and asked for some particulars as to the charges and the informant. Tho only, information I was. able to elicit from him was that' some person, who did not know me and did not know the circumstances, reported that he had been told that I had received some large cases. From another source, I learnt that some one had said that he had heard that a case addressed to me was br.oken in transit, and that, though it was supposed to contain "" images,"" it actually contained "" rifles."" As the military authorities, as represented , by Colonel Lloyd, are satisfied that I am innocent of this serious charge, I asked for the information to be passed along to the police, so that they might, in the interests of justice and fair play, deal with the ruffian who concocted the story. I was told by Colonel Lloyd that, under no circumstances,' could a name be revealed, no matter how grave the groundless charge .might be. Seeing that similar inquiries have been made about some of our teaching sisters who bought pianos, and who, at least in ono case, were credited with getting four piano-cases of rifles instead, I have very grave doubts as to the' bona fides of the charges. Wo should be protected from these either bogirs complaints or wicked.charges by some evil persons; and, as a means to protect myself, I ask that the name of the informant be given, with a view to action by the police. Another officer informed a friend that there merits of his case other than to say that was a written complaint. With these contradictory statements, it is not easy to arrive at the truth. _ I _ have refrained from having tliese humiliating annoyances vetitilated in the House until I communicated with the responsible head of the Defence Department. I am a native of the country, fifty-eight years of age, and have been in my present district for a period of, twenty-seven years. I have made public addresses advocating all patriotic movements, and given money and land towards these objects, so that 1 am not unknown as a reputable citizen. I claim even to have given more, proportionately, than any contributor in my own district. Even in the church, I have strongly urged the claims of War Loans. I mention these matters to show that I have reason to claim exemption from this cruel and uncalled-for action of the military authorities. My parishioners deeply resent this action, and would, if permitted, take some palpable means of expressing their opinions. As a free citizen, I hope I am not asking too much when I request your assistance to help me in this matter. Yours faithfully, P. J . DOEAN. To which the reverend gentleman received the following reply from the Defence Department: With reference to your letter of 2nd March, addressed to the Minister for Defence, 1 have to inform you that Senator Millen was written to on 6th February, 1918, in reply to the representations made by him on your behalf, and as the representations were made through him, the roply was also sent to him. In regard to the matter complained of by you, I desire to say that it is the duty of the Commandant of each district to inquire into all matters submitted to him. . In the present case, the action taken disclosed nothing of a suspicious nature, and the Intelligence Officer at Sydney informed you to that effect. It is not considered by this Department advisable, for obvious reasons, to disclose the ground on which any specific action is taken. "" It is regretted that you should have been put to inconvenience in regard to this matter. I ask honourable members if they think it fair that reputable citizens, no matter what may be their political or religious faith , should be subjected to such treatment on mere hearsay evidence or casual observation. Somebody heard that somebody else had said something, and on such statements men occupying responsible and honourable positions in the community have been subject to harsh treatment. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) recently brought before the House the case of the Rev. Father Jerger, .who has been in terned. I do not desire to discuss the so far as I have been able to gather from what was said in the House, and from correspondence which,has been submitted to me, in his. case also, there is an utter absence of any tangible charge or evidence. This was another case of hearsay. Certain remarks are made that in somebody's opinion a gentleman has been saying or doing something that seems suspicious, amd on flimsy evidence of that character, the Defence Department, in its peculiar anxiety to interfere as much as possible in the affairs of Australia, rushes in and causes a l l this trouble and inconvenience. I do not mention these matters because of any"" sympathy with people who are likely to be ill-disposed towards Australia or the Empire, or who might be reasonably suspected of sympathy with the enemy. The lives of gentlemen like Father Jerger and Father Doran, of Canowindra, are very much like those of public men. Their actions are not-private, but public. Their whole reputation is eminently popular, in the sense that their lives -are lived in the sight of the whole of the people. Because some one said that a case addressed to one of these gentlemen was broken open, and that rifles were seen in it , he was subjected to this disgraceful and humiliating experience. Then, again, the sisters in the convent obtained a piano from Paling and Com-' pany, of Sydney, and it was immediately reported that they had received four piano cases f u l l of rifles. A man of ordinary intelligence would wonder where these rifles could come from. So far as we know, there is only one source of supply in Australia, and it is entirely under the control of the Government. could not, therefore, be derived from any local, source. It is much more unlikely that they could be derived from any foreign source. The control of importations by the Commonwealth Government renders such a thing almost impossible. In any event, it is absolutely absurd to associate such a reputable firm as Paling and Company with a consignment of rifle* under the guise of a case containing a piano. One wonders what is the motive behind these allegations. There is nothing to justify the. raiding of either private residences, convents, presbyteries, or the offices of associations. The other day the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) referred to the raiding of the homes of Italians by the military police, and spoke of the ruthless methods adopted in connection with those raids. The Postmaster-General, who is representing the Government in the House this afternoon, must recognise that these incidents have a very disturbing and irritatin g effect. We are inevitably driftin g towards a condition of things which, instead of helping us to weld the people of Australia into one homogeneous whole-instea d of helping to develop a satisfactory Australian spirit-wil l drive the people of Australia into sections. It would seem that, as the result of these secret service and espionage tactics, we are bringing about a system of secret societies, to which we have hitherto fortunately been strangers in Australia. one wishes to see their introduction the Commonwealth. tion for secret societies is the existence of a Government autocratic that people with grievances to remedy, and rights to protect, are driven by force of circumstances into them. always breeds like. sow, and, undoubtedly, ing the tares of hatred and disturbance Mr Finlayson. and ill-feeling, is bound to reap a very unsatisfactory harvest. These actions surely have proved their inutility . Surely after three or four years of effort in connection with these matters the Government must have arrived at the conclusion that, so far from having a helpful, they are having a hindering effect. Instead of being beneficial to the win-the-war policy of the Government, these incidents are creating They the most serious obstacles in the way of that policy. Repression and obstruction of this character were, no doubt, the regular methods of Governments in such autocratic countries as Russia years ago, and also in Great Britain centuries ago. We hope that the world had moved since then, but . it would seem that the relapse into barbarism, from which the world is suffering to-day, has thrown the Government of Australia off its balance, and that it has resorted to the bad methods adopted under the vile system of government obtaining in the days gone by. I s tbere any hope of improvement, or are we simply to go on protesting here as best we can and finding no redress? Are we to see our country torn, by factions and divided in every unnecessary way in order to carry out a policy that can help no one,, but which must really be detrimental to the best interests of the community? I am not questioning the loyalty of the Government. I do not suggest that they are less well disposed to the future of Australia now than„the y were before, but I do think that in some particular way their vision has been clouded and . their minds so disturbed by events in Europe that they are unable to exercise that judgment and sanity of conduct which is essential to good government. I propose now to pass to another matter very closely associated with that which I have just been discussing. I No refer to the prohibition of the introducinto tion into Australia of certain publicaThe only justificationswell accepted, well known, and well read, and popularly quoted throughout so unreasonable and other countries. In the Commonwealth Gazette of a recent issue there appeared a list of something over 100 different Like papers, books, pamphlets,. & c , which, are We reap what we in free circulation in other countries but Australia, in sowthe admission of which into Australia is denied. A recent prohibition applies to all pamphlets that are being issued by the Union of Democratic Control in Great Britain. Those pamphlets are in free circulation in England, and are the product of some of the keenest minds in the Old Country. They are based on historical facts. No person who has read them can fail to be impressed by their grasp of the facts associated with the present war and their possible effect on the countries of the world. They are written with the pure desire that, as a result of this war, the best shall be done. The honourable member for Barrier has just given me a copy of the Government Gazette containing the list of prohibited publications. There are dozens of pamphlets and books in that list, and, although they are incirculation all the world over, their introduction into Australia is prohibited by the Government because, of some peculiar tender consideration for the feelings of Australians. It makes us wonder whether we are responsible-thinking creatures or merely spoon-fed children, who cari only be allowed to read the works which our mentors-the Win-the-War Government will allow us to see. Democracy in the world. tical publications show that we are the most intelligent, the most highly educated^ community in the world. They show that the proportion of illiterates is lower> and London, W.C. . This is an official pubthe system of education higher, in Australia than in almost auy other country. Why, then, should there be this limitation of books and pamphlets? Why, for instance, should such pamphlets as The Fiddlers, Defeat, and Pursuit-publica tions with a world-wide reputation-be prohibited? Quite lately, another peculiar addition has been made to the list of prohibited publications. In that list, for inman who talks peace just now is a traitor stance, we find The Ploughshare, a Quaker organ of social reconstruction, published at Graham House, London* E.C, and conducted by an advisory council of eighteen Friends, in addition to the two editors. These are all prominent members of the Society of Friends, two of them having been at different periods Clerk of the London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends-on e of its most important offices in Great Britain. There is also The Last Weapon, by Theodora Wilson. This is a novel by a Friend, representing "" Fearless Love"" as the most powerful weapon in the divine armoury for the conversion of enemies into friends. I have not seen the book, but Theodora Wilson's works are well known. ' If her .argument in this particular book as to fearless love being a powerful weapon for the conversion of enemies into friends is considered undesirable, why do not the Government prohibit Professor Henry Drummond's book, in which he shows that love is the greatest thing in the world. Why do they not prohibit the New Testament, which declares, above all else, that love is the most powerful influence, and that our only hope of overcoming force is not by force, but by love? Yet the one is prohibited and the others are not. speaks with much authority on these' questions. rity to speak on them, I am speaking only from the standpoint of a common-&ense man. I hope that the sanity of my statements will convince the honourable gentleman, and lead to his removing the cause of t^e complaint that I am, unfortunately, compelled to make. Yet another book which has been prohibited is Whence Gome Wars, published by Headley Bros., Kingsway House, Kingsway, lication, being the first report of the Committee on War and the Social Order, appointed by the London yearly meeting of the Society of Friends. Goodwill: a Journal of International Friendship, and Official Documents Looking Towards Peace, both published in the United States, have also been prohibited. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) said, in another place, that the to his country. From that view I entirely and absolutely dissent. It is right, in my judgment, to talk of peace at any time and in all circumstances. A resolution in regard to peace should always be in order in any Parliament, and more particularly in order when a war is raging. No matter what may be the conditions responsible for the war, or the reasons for carrying it on, we all look forward with a longing hope to the end of the conflict, and to the day when .peace",43,Hindo O Coolies Fiji Against Him That He Has Disloyal Tenden Conduct Of Cies And Without Any Inquiry Being Made

They are more like cattlestalls in which privacy and decency are impossible. vice and immorality. Four women to ten men is about the proportion allowed by recruiting regulations. becomes the occasion of outbursts, and murders arising fro m sexual jealousy are frequent. A Hindoo husband, arriving in F i j i with his wife and family, is quickly given to understand that his wife must become common property, and she does. The man is helpless, the conditions being such as to make resistance futile. The C.S.R. has been asked to help minimize this shocking state of affairs and provide some little safeguards in providing decent accommodation for at least the married couples and tlieir families. But the appeal has been in vain. II -TH E PLANTATIONS. In the sugar plantations, gangs of twenty to t h i r t y women are employed. These are overseered often by lads of twenty years of age, engaged and sent out from Sydney. youths have charge of the operations in the cane-fields, where the cane often grows to 9 feet high. A few steps into the cane, and there is perfect seclusion. Indian women are prostitutes, made such by the very conditions under which they have been recruited. Let the mothers in the pure homes of New South Wales, whence these boy-managers have been sent, realize the awful temptation into which their lads are thus thrown; let them conceive the worse possible, because the worse is done. Here, again, the C.S.E. has been approached and asked to stop this practice of placing mere immature youths in such positions of moral peril, and replacing them by older and more experienced men. Again the appeal has been refused, and for the following reasons:(1) The women coolies are more manageable than the men; hence younger men suffice. (2) The younger managers can pick up the coolie language quicker at the lips of the women than at the lips of the men. Thus, for purely economic considerations, Australian lads are placed in moral jeopardy. But this is not all. It would be well for the blood guiltiness of the Christian holders of C.S.R. scrip if it were. But worse remains to he said. III -WOMEN' S HOSPITALS. The C.S.B. is compelled by law to erect hospitals for the coolies. These contain erections for the women, into which they flock in their maternity troubles, whilst female diseases are of necessity rampant. Now, common decency, to say nothing of common humanity, would suggest that these women's wards be under the supervision of matrons. These women's wards are in the charge of. men (not doctors) who have the merest smattering of medical knowledge-me n picked up anywhere and anyhow. Hindoo woman to be mauled about by a man -and he a foreigner-onl y tliose who know the [167] Hindoo character can f u l l y realize. We have staying with us, as we write this, the Rev. C. F. Andrews, M.A., who, commissioned by the These lines have become sinks of Women's Council of India, has spent some months in F i j i , and at great pains, and even peril, has been investigating this woman side This immense sexual disparity of the coolie situation; and he says it is impossible for any European to gauge the outraged sense of degradation that is felt by Indian women at these abominable sexual conditions. The C.S.R. was explicitly asked by Mr. Andrews, in the name of the women of India, to at least place matrons in charge of these women's wards, and give them trained nurses. But, notwithstanding the fact that there are ladies in Australia who, through Mr Andrews, willingly volunteered to take up this work, the C.S.R. curtly turned down his request, and declined any further communication w it h him. In a M e l b o u r n e paper, q u it e recently,t h e f o l l o w in g appearedI t is interesting to read a statement by the Rev. J. Burton to the effect that male Indian These coolies who worked on the F i j i a n sugar plantations, were paid ls . per day "" if they did work enough to satisfy the overseers,"" while the women received Gd. per day. The rabbit Many of these warrens into which the coolies' families were crowded, Mr Burton also said, measure 8 feet by 10 feet, the partitions between them leaving "" much to be desired."" A t the same meeting, Mrs. James Booth is reported to have stated that the C.S.R. Co. was making such profits that it was at some pains to hide them. It acknowledged 40 per cent., and was credited with 50 per cent., while it had made £100,000 extra in war profits. Further, the same speaker pointed out, only for t y coolie women were allowed to land in F i j i to every 100 men, because women were not such good economic assets, and the moral degradation resulting fro m such a state of affairs she described aa appalling. The dreadful conditions maintaining among these workers showed in the suicide statistics, the rateamong these unfortunates being stated to be 1,000 times greater in' F i j i than in their own homeland'; the increase in murders, on the same basis 'of comparison, was eightyfold.

174,Mr Finlayson,"Certainly not;business in tbe Nortbern Territory was prohibition. I am not suggesting that the Government is disposed to favourably consider such a policy. lighted to know that the Government is even inclined in that direction. As I stated, I asked, on the 12th A p r i l , whether the Government would allow the people in the Territory an opportunity to decide the question, and I have had a motion on the notice-paper ever since this Parliament opened, to the effect that such opportunity should be given, and that prohibition should there be the law in regard to liquor. One wonders, really, in view of the world-wide events at the present time, and the tremendous Agitation that is convulsing all nations in regard to the liquor traffic, why the Government hesitate to allow the people of the Northern Territory, if not, indeed, the people of the whole of Australia, to determine this matter for themselves. If the Government are afraid-if they lack the necessary courage to do the big thing, or to risk even a mistake in attempting to do the big thing-ar e they prepared to allow the people of the Northern Territory to determine the matter? Surely they might be expected to know best, if -not what is best for them, at any rate what they would prefer. A f t e r all, de* mocratic government is based on the fact that the people, who bear the burden of the cost, ought to have a direct say and control in the conduct of public affairs. Unfortunately, the people of the Territory are not represented in this Chamber, and have no voice, not only in legislation, but in' the control of their own affairs. The Government appoints the Administrator and all the officials; in short, it manages everything. If other branches of Northern Territory are as open to strong censure as is this particular Department, it is no wonder that the condition of affairs as disclosed in governmental reports, and particularly in the financial statements, calls for th criticism so severe. I ask the Postmaster-General to bring ibis matter under the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories. When the Estimates are before us, I intend to return to my criticism of the administration pf the Northern'Territory. Some months ago, I referred to events which have recently taken place there, and made certain statements regarding the administration which were not, and cannot be, successf u l l y contradicted. In this case, au immediate remedy can be found, public I think it is. dissatisfaction can be set at rest, and the I should be deGovernment can show that it desires to do its best for a section of the people who, by reason of their situation, have to suffer many disabilities. I hope that relief may be afforded at an early date. -Recently the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) , in his peculiar speech, referred to the attitude of the Labour party of Australia towards the war as ""bandy-legged'' and ""cockeyed,"" and he said that no other Labour party elsewhere had taken up a similar attitude. H is . confusion concerning the ideals of Labouri n British-speaking countries, recall the anecdote of the scholar who, at an examination, wrote of Oliver Cromwell-confusin g h i m with Cardinal Wolsey-that on his death-bed his complaint was, "" WouldI had served my God as I have served m y K in g . "" The attitude of the British Labour party towards the present world-wide cataclysm is set out pretty clearly in the following letter, written by the president of the Birmingham Trades Council, whicb has a membership of 100,000 workers. It was addressed to the. Lord Mayor of Birmingham, and was published in the Labour Leader on the 20th December last. It reads as follows:3rd December, 1917. My Lord Mayor, I desire to thank you very sincerely for the kind invitation to be present at the Asquith dinner on the 11th inst., as president of the Birmingham Trades Council, but regret that it is quite impossible for me to accept the same. In common with the workers generally, I administration in the find we have been entirely misled as to the objects of the war, and that, while the invasion of Belgium provided a ""good cry"" for the Government, quite apart from that, this country was committed to fight with France as far back as-1911 (if not earlier) if she. were unhappily involved in war, through Russia or otherwise. The Morocco business of 1911 proves that. Further, the publication of certain secret treaties reveal that the Allies were after more territory, notwithstanding the oft-repeated fable that ""we went into this war with clean hands."" Hence tbe necessity for us to come out of it with empty hands.

177,Mr Ooksidine (Barrier } [5.52].,"save Lord Lansdowne in Ms fine letter, recently, wherein he shows what they should be. But he is repudiated by the War Cabinet and the Government {Northcliff) press. One would have thought the Government would have been intelligent enough to have appreciated Kerensky's position in Eussia, and the necessity of clearly defining her war aims if Eussia was to be retained as her Ally. When asked to co-operate with the Local War Aims Committee, the Labour parly instructed its secretary to write the Central War Aims Committee to enlighten the party as to the objects of the war, and, failing to obtain an intelligent reply, decided it could not cooperate. Since then, we have hoped aiid waited in vain for a clear and unmistakable statement. For that we still wait, and, more important still, for perfect liberty to discuss same when published. We have' heard that one of the aims of the war was "" to make the world safe for Democracy,"" but here at Home Democracy is. muzzled; and, what with conscription (industrial and military), D'Ora the extension of the censorship to pamphlets, &c, the unequal distribution of food, and the food profiteer, we begin to wonder if one of the unavowed war aims of this country's ruling class is to break the power and organization of the workers here at home. Millions of lives have been sacrificed, and the sacrifice is to continue, apparently-and for what? My Lord Mayor, I extremely regret having to write you thus. To do otherwise would be insincere on my part. I have the greatest respect for you as a gentleman and a citizen who has worthily discharged the duties of a high office in a time of great difficulty with conspicuous ability and success. I am, my Lord Mayor, yours sincerely, F. W. RUDLAND. Then, in the February issue of Current in no small degree to the continuance of unHistory, a magazine that strongly suprest and the growth of militarism in Europe; ports the Allies, the following statements and profoundly sympathizing with the unforare made in an article on "" The ""War tunate Aims of Labour Parties ""-> Since the Bolsheviki at Brest-Litovsk forced French Socialists, that they shall be allowed, the German leaders to come out into the open nhder the protection of the supernational as avowed annexationists the temper of the authority, or league of nations, freely to decommon people throughout the Central Emcide what shall be their future political posipires has undergone a change. The working tion. of this new and potent influence called M.

The message of the French Socialists to the ary, 1918, in a message to the Eussian people Bolsheviki, printed in the pages that follow, and an appeal to the peoples of Central Europe. is another phase of the same movement. The The message was prepared by the Labour party war aims of the British Labour unions and in conjunction with the Parliamentary Comthose of the Socialists of the continental coun. mittee of the Trade Union Congress. The text tries, while differing widely on the point of readsa German peace, are so nearly alike in other essentials as to give an impression of general solidarity. Upon this solidarity their leaders have based the recent assertion that if the statesmen do not soon make a peace the workers will get together at Stockholm or elsewhere and do it themselves. Under the heading, "" British. Labour's War Aims,"" it is stated thatOne of the steps leading up to the Nottingham resolution was a memorandum on ""Labour's War Aims,"" issued 17th December, 1917, by the Labour party through its secretary, Mr Henderson. The memorandum was passed by the parliamentary committee of the Trade Union Congress and the executive of the Labour party. It declares "" that whatever may have heen the cause of the outbreak of the war, it is clear that the peoples of Europe, who are necessarily the chief sufferers from its horrors, had themselves no hand in it . "" And that ""whatever may have been the objects for which the war was begun, the fundamental purpose of the British Labour movement, in supporting the continuance of the struggle, is that the world may henceforth be made safe for Democracy. . . . The British Labour movement emphatically insists that a foremost condition of peace must be the reparation by the German Government, under the direction of an International Commission, of the wrong admittedly done to Belgium; payment by that Government for all the damage that has resulted from this wrong; and the restoration of Belgium to complete and untrammelled independent sovereignty, leaving to the decision'of the Belgian people the determination of their own future policy in all respects. That sounds like the manifestoes of the State Conferences of the Labour party in AustraliaThe British Labour movement re-affirms its reprobation of the crime against the people of the world by which Alsace and Lorraine were forcedly torn from France in 1871; a political blunder, the effects of which have contributed inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine who have been subjected to so much repression, asks, in accordance with the declaration of the Again the British Labour party placed itself on record regarding war issues on 15th Janut We have reached a crisis in the war. The negotiations at Brest Litovsk have been interrupted because the Germans have refused to admit the principle of self-determination of peoples and the doctrine of no annexations. In thus acting, the Central Powers are speaking clearly in the name of a militarist State. In this crisis the British people must speak, because the Russians can only succeed in their great and perilous task if supported by the people everywhere. The British people must proclaim to Russia and the Central Powers that its aim is identical with Russia's; that we, too, see no solution for the evils of militarism except self-determination and no indemnities. In applying the Russian principle to onr own case, we are conscious of the problems raised, but we do not shrink therefrom. The British people accept the principle of no annexation for the British Empire. This applies in our case to the Middle East, We wish to remind the Russian people that Great Britain, taught by the loss of the American colonies in the 18th century, was the first modern State to grant complete self-determination to any group of its inhabitants, for example, the Dominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. We accept the principle also for India and other Dependencies of the British Empire, though we .believe that the record of the British Government here gives little occasion for reproach. We intend to meet this by more rapid development of self-government. We respect the sovereign independence of the Turkish people in their national home, but we believe that the domination of their Government over other people is a hindrance to their own national development. OUT Government is pledged to some of these people-Arabs, Palestinians, Armeniansthat the Ottoman rule shall not again be imposed on them. This responsibility shall be undertaken by the Peace Conference, and a permanent international organization, that we hope will be there constituted. In tropical Africa we repeat our renunciation of annexation. Nobody contends that the black races can govern themselves. They can only make it known that the particular Government under which they have been living is bad in some or all respects, and indicate the specific evils from -which they desire liberation. We believe that the Peace Conference, would be well advised to place all tropical Africa under uniform international control. We adjure the peoples of Central Europe to declare themselves to make their Governments speak for them in answer to Russia and ourselves. We call on them to renounce annexations in Europe with the same good faith in which we are renouncing them in Asia. We call ori them to give the same self-determination to the French, Alsacian, Italian, Polish, and Danish members of their States as Russia has given to Finland, Courland, Lithuania, and Russian Poland. . . .

Tom Mooney was published iu the Sydney Worker, but when the editor of the Socialist, published in Melbourne, proposed to reprint it in his newspaper, the censor in Victoria refused to allow him to do so.

He says that no action was taken by the authorities to secure the actual perpetrator of the offpnce. known who threw the bomb. General( Mr Webster) is simply displaying his prejudice and vindictiveness. am glad that Mooney's life and liberty do not depend upon the honourable gentleman. No one can justify the action of the censor in Victoriai n refusing to allow the publication of this letter in the Socialist, seeing that it had already appeared in the Sydney Worker. President Wilson himself has intervened on behalf of this man in response to the representations of the workers of other countries. The Government should not lend themselves to the sort of censorship that is going on here. It is about time that the censorship was confined strictly . to the specific purpose for which the Government said it was brought into operation. There is no justification for making flesh of one and fish of another in this matter. in New South Wales blundered in permitting the publication of this letter in the Sydney Worker, is there any reason why blunder? The two censors speak with different voices. It would, seem that a man can be dealt with, not for a breach of the Mooney simply points censorship regulations, but for a breach of thc interpretation placed upon the regulations by a particular censor. If the censorship is designed to prevent the publication of anything detrimental to the cause of the Allies, I contend that it should operate equitably all over Australia. Tbis is not the only incident of There is not a word about the kind. I had occasion to visit the censor in Victoria, quite recently. One of our people at Broken Hill wrote a book on the industrial history of the Barrier, and had it printed in this State. In that book he referred to the formation of the Labour Volunteer Army, and printed the pledge that the members of that army take. That pledge had already been published in all the daily newspapers in Australia. The'military authorities allowed it to be published while the conscription referendum was in progress, but the censor here refused to allow it to appear in this book. The writer made a reference, also, to a disturbance that occurred at BrokenH ill , and remarked that some of those who took part in it had never smelt powder in the trenches. That reference also was cut out of the book by the censor, despite the fact that statements of I the kind had appeared in the Age, the Argils, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald, and other newspapers which are opposed to the Labour party.

He admitted that he had control of the metropolitan area, and when I asked him why Melbourne newspapers had been allowed to publish the same kind of matter, his reply was, "" That has nothing to do with the question. These statements are detrimental to recruiting, and cannot be allowed to appear in the book."" That kind of administration is absolutely futile, and is calculated only to stir up trouble and dissension in the country. The people may fairly ask why the censor refuses to allow the Labour and Socialist me. newspapers to publish matter that is permitted to appear in the daily newspapers that support our political opponents. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. the differential treatment by the censors of Labour and Socialist journals as compared with their treatment of Liberal and Nationalist da(ily and weekly publications in Australia. If the editor of a Labour or Socialist journal wishes to republish a statement which has already appeared in. a Liberal or Nationalist organ, he is not permitted to do so, and if he does so in defiance of the censor he must put up with the pains and penalties of the law. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Einlayson) has referred to the publications the introduction of which into Australia is prohibited. Even the elected representatives of the people of Australia responsible for the carrying on of the government of the country are not permitted to know what is being published in Labour journals in England, unless they can secure their introduction surreptitiously.

The people of Australia are in the matter of the censorship and the prohibition of literature being treated like children. In the home circle a moral censorship is often established, and the children are not permitted to read certain newspapers or periodicals. The present Government are treating the people of Australia in precisely the same manner. They arrogate to themselves the right to say what the people shall be permitted to read, and what views may be placed before them. They further say that members of this Parliament shall not be allowed to form any opinion as to what is taking place elsewhere, except through literature that passes the censorship of the Win-the-war Government, That is the kind of Government that went on under the Czar. a Lahour Government that appointed the censor. Even members of this whether a Labour or any other Government is responsible for legislation placed on the statute-book, if I consider it inimical to the interests of the people I will be brought to heel like the rest of them day is the evil thereof.

There are on the list Arthur Mee's pamphlets Defeat and The Fiddlers. They have been prohibited, though I suppose honourable members have read them, as they all received copies of them.

How would the people of Melbourne like to have a large camp of enemy subjects, all of them able-bodied men, and nearly all of them trained, within 25 miles of the city ? What could be done if they broke out at midnight? They could do a great deal of damage. I have recently visited Cockatoo Island, where tliere is a large number of men engaged in shipbuilding.

A man who has been in a certain employment, for twenty years, and has built up a little home for his wife and family is not likely to r u n the risk of baving everything swept away in one act. Of course, he is not victimized in a straight-out fashion, but he becomes a marked mau. If the Honorary Ministeri n charge of the Navy Department will look into this question at Cockatoo Island, he w ill find that there is great room for reform, and that he can save a great deal of money. A t any rate, he could have the work carried out much more expeditiously. There are men there who have been in our employment for fifteen to twenty years, who have almost sufficient practical knowledge to take charge of the dockyard. Many of them are foremen who could practically turn out a ship. Y e t these men are being superseded, by new chums, who do not know much about their work, and, in fact, have to go for guidance to the men they are bossing.

That is the worse of the day-labour system. It does away w it h competition. We should have more contract work and more private enterprise under proper supervision. that the honourable member does not agree with me. He believes in the go-slow policy, but the time has come when we cannot afford to continue the day-labour "" go-slow "" system. Last night the whole cry from honourable members opposite was on behalf of unfortunate men who would not know when they had income tax to pay. I tell honourable, members that the very men on whose Behalf they were speaking are more intelligent than are some of those who were making speeches on their behalf. It is a notorious fact that the main trouble the Commissioner of'Taxation has is chasing after men who will not furnish returns. The honourable member for Macquarie has told us that some of 'these unfortunate men are earning £ 2 5 each per week. I hope that the Honorary Minister will look into the trouble which is occurring at Cockatoo Island, and I trust that the Ministerf o r Defence w ill consult w it h his omcers and see whether the internment camp should uot be moved fro m Holdsworthy to a olace a littl e further away from the city,' where it would'not be such a menace. I desire to say a few words in reference to the Defence Department. I presume that honourable members upon both sides of the chamber have experienced the same difficulty in dealing with that Department as I have. Some months ago I brought the complaint which I am about to voice under the notice of the Minister for Defence, who promised that if I wrote him, giving f u l l particulars of the case, he would attend to it . . He has attended to it , but apparently the regulations governing the settlement of such matters are entirely unsatisfactory. Take, for instance, the case of an allotment left by a soldier to his mother. If he is a good son, and leaves her a decent The sum, she is penalized to the extent that she does not receive an additional allowance from the Government. On the other hand, if he is not a good son, and leaves her less than he would have paid her if he had remained in Australia, the Government make her an extra allowance of 6d. per day for each dependant under sixteen years of age. I say that that principle is altogether wrong. I do not see why we should discriminate in that way. If a soldier, who is a good son, chooses to leave his mother an allotment I know of 30s. per week, I fail to see why she should be penalized in any way whatever. If he chose to leave her only 15s. per week, the Government would supplement that sum with an allowance of 6d. per day for each dependant under sixteen years of age. I think that the Department might very well alter the existing practice in this respect. I have written to the Department in connection with it , and have pointed out glaring anomalies in connection with our Defence administration. So far, however, I have received no satisfaction. In my opinion, the M i nister should shake up the departmental officers, especially the staff in the Pay Office, New South Wales. I have now had before me for nine months the case of a man who enlisted under an. assumed name, and embarked for service overseas, leaving his wife and two children in Aus-' tralia without any support whatever. A f t e r getting, numerous affidavits sworn, procuring correspondence from this soldier, and comparing it with the signature on his attestation papers, I ultimately succeeded in convincing the Department that' he was in fact the husband of this woman. A cable was then sent to the Old Country, and the man was finally compelled to admit that he was her husband. The Department thereupon compelled him to allot the woman the sum of 3's-. per day. She is in receipt of that sum now, and she has also received the separation allowance from the time the allotment was made payable. But it can easily be understood that a woman who had been left for nine months, with two children, without any support, was in pretty straitened circumstances, and had incurred a considerable debt. The arrears due to her on account of separation allowance would materially assist her to liquidate her liabilities. The Pay Officer of No. 2 Militar y",60,Judicial Fight Over

Still another matter which I desire to mention has reference to the repatriation scheme. I have in my possession a letter dated 1st May l as t that is, since the Repatriation Department was reconstructed-relatin g to the case of a man who applied to it for an advance of £ 1 0 0 to enaVble him to pur-, chase a steam laundry. The owner of the laundry had promised to allow him fourteen days in which to complete the purchase. Accordingly, the soldier waited upon the officer administering the re-' 'patriation scheme in Sydney, and applied for an. advance of £ 1 0 0 . A f t e r having waited ten or eleven days without receiving any reply, he again interviewed the officer, who informed h i m that the Board would be meeting in a couple of days, and that his application would then', be placed before it . On the day on which the Board was supposed to meet, the returned soldier once more visited the office, where he was told that the matter had been overlooked, but as the Board was then sitting it would be gone into right away. By this time the owner of the steam laundry had grown impatient, and consequently, he informed the soldier that he could uot Wait any longer. On the very day that the transaction should have been finalized the soldier told him that he had received no intimation: from the Board regarding the purchase, and, therefore, was obliged to abandon all hope of transacting the business. Three days later he received a letter from the Repatriation Committee intimating that his application had been refused, as they did not consider the proposition a good one. But the anomaly to which I desire to direct attention is that that letter was written two days before it was posted. Eveni f the communication had been a favorable one, the returned soldier would not have received it in time to have enabled him to purchase the business. This is how he describes the position himselfI f the honourable member I am forwarding to you the letter I received from them. You will notice the letter was written on the 24th April, and the Post OfficeI shall be very glad stamp shows that it was not posted t i ll the 27th April, which clearly shows that the letter was lying in the office three days before they thought to p'ost it. They talk about their repatriation for returned soldiers, but if the general public only knew the state of things, I do not think it would help recruiting. If a I am.

273,Mr Wallace,"I wish to refer to-wrote, informing them that the Commonwealth desired to take it over for the purpose of erecting wool stores thereon. The trustees held a meeting, and agreed, to the Government taking over the park at a rental of £250 per annum. I think that is a scandal upon the administration of the Commonwealth. The Government have no right to take over that park and to mutilate it in the way they are doing. It comprises about 60 acres of land, and is situated between the two most congested areas in Sydney, namely, Pyrinont and the Glebe. Half of the park had already been acquired by a cricket club and a football club, which hold meetings there on Saturday afternoon. The Wool Committee has fenced in another 10 acres of the park, and fig and acorn trees, which are ten and twenty years old-fine trees such as cannot be seen in any other part of Sydney-are being remorselessly cut down. park is Wattle-street, the John Bridges' wool store, and the Co-operative wool stores, whilst on the other side there isi a vacant allotment containing about 5 acres, upon which wool could be conveniently stored,, thereby obviating any necessity for encroaching on Wentworth Park at all. I utterly fail to see what advantage can accrue from the acquisition of this particular recreation reserve. Any wool taken either to or from the park must necessarily be carted, because there is not sumcient depth of water available to admit of its transport by sea. If the Government desire to erect temporary wool stores, why do they not erect them in suburbs where any quantity of vacant land is available for the purpose ? The other day I saw some 200 school children playing at football, cricket, and other games on about three acres of ground. When I went to have a look at the portion fenced of f , the watchman asked me my business, and when I told him, he informed me that he had to be v very careful, because only the day before a number of children, whom he had had to put off the ground, had stoned him. Good luck to them! They showed themselves to have the spirit to resent the taking of their playground. The watchman also told me that the day before, his mate had given a couple of the trespassing children a hiding, and that the fathers of the children had subsequently come down and given the watchman a hiding in return. Mr Wallace. There is no doubt that the people deeply resent 'the taking of this park. When the fencing was commenced, there was an impression that it was the intention of the Government to improve the reserve, and now that the work of erecting the wool stores has commenced, they fear that it is too late to protest. Personally, I do not think that it is too late, for at present there is only a weatherboard building; and, as the work of preparing the foundations was started only on Thursday last, the Government could very well step in. This site, from the point of view of the Government, has no special economic advantages, seeing that all the wool must he conveyed there by rail, and thence carted to Darling Harbor. It might as well be situated at Wagga, or anywhere else. must admit that Wagga is a little farther Immediately adjoining the away. must be the carriage and cartage. It is true that wool stores in this locality would „ be of convenience to wool buyers, but I do not see why the children of Pyrmout and Glebe should lose their playground on that account. A meeting of protest ia being held in Sydney to-night, and a deputation will wait on the Commonwealth' Government in due course. It appears that the Cabinet have held a meeting regarding the internment of Father Jerger. If the public are to be prevented from knowing the f u l l facts of this and similar cases, honorahle members, at any rate, should be given au opportunity to peruse the papers connected therewith. As things are, a man is interned, or otherwise punished, and we, as members of Parliament, receive letters of protest from our friends. Perhaps some of us may be. intimately connected with the man concerned, and ready to take up the case from another point of view. In the matteT of Father Jerger, I have received several letters, and had numerous interviews, but, owing to the attitude' assumed by the Government, I am able to present only one side of the case. Therefore, I urge that honourable members should be able to ascertain for themselves exactly what are the charges made against Father JergeT, and what evidence theTe is in support of them. That should be the policy pursued in all such cases under the",62,Judicial Fight Over

I concur in the remarks of the honorahle memher for West Sydney( Mr Wallace) as to the repatriation administration. I have very great confidence . in Senator Milieu, who, I believe, is putting brain and energy into the movement; hut a great deal more has yet to be done, and I hope the Government will endeavour to make the conditions for the returned men better than in the past. I regret that the modesty-the retiring and unassuming nature-of the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) has caused him to retire. tended to refer to him, and it is rather unfortunate that he should have left the chamber. Prom this evening's newspaper honourable members may learn that the honourable member to-day introduced a deputation to the Acting'Prime Minister, on behalf of returned soldiers. We ought to feel proud indeed of the honourable member for the Barrier when we find him with sufficient courage to get into the company of returned soldiers after the'speeches he has made here time after time. At that deputation, Mr there are younger brothers now just atAmos, one of the speakers, said they desired to impress on the Government the absolute necessity of finding work for unemployed returned men. He also said that the deputation was not prepared to say anything against the State War Council, but they protested against thousands of eligible single men being permitted to retain their jobs while men who had fought for their country were workless. That is what was said by a member of a deputation introduced to the. Acting Prime Minister by the honourable member for the Barrier. When the Acting Prime Minister remarked that Mr Amos was raising an argument in favour of conscription, Mr Amos said he was not a conscriptionist. He added that the returned men did not want philanthropy, but they were becoming desperate when they saw fit men enjoying jobs that returned men should have. I am sorry that the honourable member for the Barrier is not now present, because in his speech to-night he said that what he desired was a fair deal, and I would be glad if the Defence Department now gave him a chance to fall in with the view of the deputation he introduced. Two announcements have recently been made by the Defence Department, one is in tlie form of a regulation permitting boys of eighteen years of age to enlist without the permission of their parents, and the other to the effect that oflicers who are invalided home and desire to go to the Pront again must be discharged and enlist, as privates. I am sure that none of us approve of a regulation which imposes on oflicers, who have won their spurs on the battlefield, the necessity of entering the ranks as privates if they wish to once more' take a hand at the. Pront. It is said that the Government He was aware that I inare in receipt of a letter from Generals Birdwood, whose desires they are virtually carrying out; but 1 cannot believe that General Birdwood made a request of the kind. 1 do not wish to-night to stress the objection to the enlistment of boys of eighteen without the consent of their parents, but merely to express a hope that the regulation will be re-considered, seeing that it is one which will undoubtedly destroy parental control. There are many families throughout Australia which have lost sons at the Pront, and in which taining their eighteenth year who have an intense desire to avenge their loss. There are hundreds and hundreds of eligibles in Australia, and yet boys of tender age are to be induced, or seduced, to enlist against their parents' wishes. I am not going to make any threats, but I know there are members on this side, and, I believe, on the other side also, who do not agree with this regulation; and I suggest that it should be re-considered with a view to its amendment. opportunity to discuss it in the House. tion by me, honourable members were told such an opportunity would be given; and, in any case, we could make one on a motion for the adjournment of the House. The regulation has, no doubt, been made in good faith, but it is a mistake; and when there are so many eligibles in the Department it comes with bad grace from the Defence Department. As to the regulation requiring returned officers, if they wish to re-enlist, to de so as privates, I may point to Captain",63,Judicial Fight Over

It is the fact that he won his spurs on the battlefield, and that when on the platform he does not ask others to ""go"" but to ""come"" with him to the Front. These regulations all point to disorganization, and, I am not afraid to say, too much favouritism. There are a number of generals and colonels who never heard a gun. fired except at a review-toy and chocolate soldiers-and, while they are in charge and advising the Minister, this sort of thing goes on. As an instance, I may say that when Engineer officers were required for tunnelling and so forth, the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, on behalf of the Defence Department, sent out » circular letter inviting men of experience to enlist. The invitation was responded to, in a case that came under my notice, by an inspector of mines, and also by a mining engineer, the latter of whom told me that he was giving up a salary of £55 or £60 a month in order to serve the country. Their papers were approved, and they were told that, if they entered the school and passed the examination they would get commissions. .They made great sacrifices. speaking of two cases alone, because there were about twenty-six others. if I had tried to work for one or two, they would have got their commissions, but I wanted no one to receive favours that the others could not get. throwing up their positions those two came over on the pay of privates, and entered the engineering school at Sydney. There they-were ten weeks on infantry training, as well as other work. were six months in the school altogether, and received the pay of privates while there. over £24,000.

Mr Gregory. Two of them-Colbran and PearceI saw, and they were sent away as privates. They and the others had not only passed through the school, but had been recommended for commissions. Then, after all the sacrifices they had made, they were told they could have their discharges, or go away as privates. Is there not something wrong in the Department when the home service man can get all these concessions granted to him, while others are treated in that way after the country has spent over £24,000 to make offioers of them? They were told that there was no room for them, and that the Department did not want officers. I asked here how many unattached infantry oflicers went away on the Nestor and the Ormond. I was told over fifty, and that was in the last few months. These were unattached men who had beeu hanging about here. They were sent to the Front as officers, yet the men L speak of were told they could go away as privates or go outside. The Department would not even make them sergeants. When the University boys recently formed a corps, one young fellow, who had had some previous training in the Citizen.' Forces, went I am not into the Non-Commissioned Officers' School that, was just starting Being a Perhaps wonderfully clever lad, he got through, and has since been gazetted a sergeant. There was no favouritism in this case, but why is a Non-Commissioned Officers' After School wanted now, and how is it that sergeants can be gazetted to-day, when all these specially-trained men who passed through the engineers' school six months ago, after six months' training, and They recommended for commissions, are treated as they have been ? How is it that they could not be offered positions That school cost the Department as sergeants? There is something very' wrong.

"" but "" Will you come with me to the F r o n t ?"" I hope the Department will also take into serious consideration the regulation just framed permitting boys of eighteen to enlist without the consent of their parents. W it h regard to the men who went through the Engineers' Training School, it was unfair, to say the least of it , that after they had made big sacrifices, thrown up good positions, spent twelve months in the Department on a private's pay, fulfilled every condition, and passed their examination, they should be told they could go away as privates or get their discharge.. It shows very poor administration and a species of morality that marks a very poor military code. Some little time ago I spoke on a niotion proposed by the Prime Minister, that we should go to thebitter end to secure a victorious peace and the freedom of the world I said then that it was a foolish motion, as it meant that we were going to carry out the oft-repeated statement of the Prime Minister that we would crush Germany, stop German trade, and boycott Germans for all time. tion. express ourselves as favorable to peace by negotiation, and that, though the Germans were pushing' back the Allied Armies, and had even succeeded in pushing us back within a fortnight or a month over territory that it had taken us two or three years to win, they could not possibly beat the Allies.

I am supported in my view that the Germans cannot defeat the Allies by a recent statement by Lloyd George, appearing under large headlines in the daily pressIn (in interview, Mr Lloyd George expressed himself as having been amazed at the confidence shown by every one at the Front.

I protest against the refusal of the British Allies to discuss peace with the Germanic Allies. I would urge the British Allies to agree to an armistice on all Fronts, and agree to hold an open conference, not a secret one, of representatives of the belligerents, together with representatives of such neutral countries as will be acceptable to both sides.

Appeal to Australians;"" and following it this paragraphImmense reinforcements lately rushed to the Front by Germany have had to be met by great reinforcements from England, which consist very largely of English boys. These youngsters pass hour after hour on the long road towards the Front, with pink cheeks, flushed, big hearts, no right to send boys tb do what all who and slender bodies. The feeling has overcome more than one Australian onlooker of late that many a grown, hardened man is really sheltering behind these youths of England. It is these drafts of English youths thrown into the gaps in the ranks which more than anything cry aloud to grown men of our country to take the burden off them. Isi t not advantageous to the enemy to be told that, instead of grown men, English boys with pink cheeks and slender bodies are being put into the firing line. Is not that valuable military information ? Moreover, it is proposed that Australia shall bring herself into line with Great Britaini u this matter by sending her lads to the Front despite the objections of their parents. That is how the big German military machine is to be crushed. Under these circumstances the refusal to talk peace almost prompts me to say something that is in my mind, but I will not say it . One would think that members oppositeshould be the intelligent party. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) who recently told the honourable member' for Batman( Mr Brennan) that he was using language which those on the other side could not understand, this classical scholar, is supported by the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn), who would not be guilty of suoh snobbish remarks. We gence from the party following them, but Ministers not intelligent. They are the Stupid party. They first alarm the German people by saying that they are to be crushed and afterwards boycotted, so that the Prussian Junkers can say to their people, "" Lloyd George and Mr Hughes have told you what they are going to do to you if you f a i l , so you have to fight."" Having created this position, the party opposite blazons to the world the fact that English boys with pink cheeks and slender bodies are being put into the firing line. What is to be said of the censorship that permits the publication of such statements ? I am glad that some bf the members opposite do not think that lads of eighteen-who , because of the taunts that are made by various persons, are under considerable pressure to enlist, and also under great inducement because of the various appeals that are being addressed to them-shoul d be allowed to enlist without their parents' consent.

Unfortunately, when the honourable member for Dampier( Mr sympathetically inclined, he is unable to Gregory) was paying some attention to me this evening, I was not in the chamber. The honourable gentleman, in the course of his remarks, said that I was aware that he intended to refer to me .in connection with the deputation of returned soldiers that waited on the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) this morning. I wish to give that statement an emphatic denial. I had absolutely no knowledge that the honourable gentleman had the slightest intention to mention me in any connection whatever. Further, he referred, in not very nice terms, to my connection with the deputation of returned soldiers, and attempted to connect me with the alleged advocacy of the dismissal of men from their employment because they did not volunteer for the Front. I wish to say that in the report that was published in the Herald, and from which the honourable member for Dampier quoted, the newspaper very carefully omitted certain statements made at the conclusion of the interview. censor again. Honorary Minister evidently knows all about it. The press carefully omitted any reference to the fact that at the conclusion of the deputation, with the permission of the Acting Prime Minister, who will bear out my statement, I asked every member of the deputation to say whether he desired that any man who ia at present employed should be dismissed from his employment in order to find work for returned soldiers, simply on the ground that he had not gone to the war, for any reason whatever. Every member of the deputation answered "" No "" to that question. The shorthand notes of the deputation will bear out my statement that not one member of it wished to have a single man dismissed from employment by reason of the fact that he had not gone to the war, but they all insisted' that something should be done to business people who promised employees going to the war that their jobs would be kept open for them, men returned from the war. listened with the greatest interest to every word spoken by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). Perhaps, because the honourable gentleman is not understand the views of honourable members on this side which, I believe, are shared by most prudent persons, not only in this section of the British Empire, but throughout the Empire as a whole. I believe that he fails to appreciate the fact that we are not now, as we were at the time of the South African war, engaged in a conflict in which we can afford to do the weak, if the generous, thing. He has failed to appreciate the fact that we are now in a war for our existence, and that how we are to get out of it depends on our awn exertions, and on our loyalty, more than it depends upon any consideration we may expect from our foes. Right through his speech the honourable member seemed to be more prone to believe the intelligence that the other side was putting forth than that which reaches us from our own people overseas. Contrast his reluctance to believe a single word of the harsh terms exacted by Germany from Roumania with the readiness with which he believes every tale of the sufferings of the British working classes; contrast his indignation when we asked what had happened as the result of this same programme of peace ih ""open conference'' at Brest-Litovsk with his concluding admission that Russia was today merely a series of dismembered republics, running red with Russian blood, with Russian arms, aided and abetted by German arms, turned against Russians, and with German annies still marching through a country with which Germany ""has officially declared peace. After the lesson of Russia, how can the honourable member expect us to go blindly into this trap of "" an open conference "" ? Does he realize that the interests of our Allies, upon the coherence of which in this common cause our safety depends, are being separately appealed to by the Germans in every direction? The honourable member, who is a student of international relations, must be aware that there has been a very strong effort directed from Germany for over a year past towards trying, to create",74,Robebt Best W E Did Break Honourable Members Opposite Should

363,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [9.59],"Itrouble between this section of the British Empire, and so between the British Empire, and an Ally of ours in these seas, to whom we are indebted for three years of help. Is not the honourable member aware that in France, for the last year, a gospel has been preached, underground in the cellars, and everywhere, furtively, in the subsidized and bribed press, that France should make peace with Germany at the expense of England? MT. HIOGS -Hav e we not been trying to do the same in regard to Austria? to a mere statement of fact is a charge against our own people! If the honourable member holds this attitude of mind, how could he expect people to do other than suspect his motives? his motives, but I put the matter fairly and -squarely to him. A few weeks ago he raised in this House an issue which was quite capable of solution without bringing in international relations; but the honourable member dragged into' that debate the grave injustice that he said we are doing an eastern Ally by following a certain course, and he asked, "" What will they think of us in Japan?"" When he was.speaking was he ignorant of the fact that his very speech would be quoted in Japan by agents of influences hostile to our cause ? If a man behaves indiscreetly, how can he expect other persons, when these indiscretions occur, and are repeated, to have the same confidence in his motives that men who know him well may have in them? I ask the honourable member to be fair, and to realize that we cannot leave this war now of our own choosing, and that Australia, least of all, can leave it of its own choosing. Is he not aware that we have arrived at a period in this struggle when the moral endurance of the peoples at waT is at least as important a factor as is the continued courage and energies of the armies in the field? figures and past speeches, and asked whether Australia could materially contribute towards winning the war. If it were not for the fact that we are part of the British unionist may lose a strike by starting a Empire, there might be more in what the honourable member says than there is; but Australia is part of the British Empire, and its armies are fighting as near to Paris as Mount Macedon is to Melbourne. Does the honourable member realize what use could be made in the metropolis of France of any weakening on the part of this section of the British Empire? Does he realize how German agents throughout the great republic would say, "" See these flaws beginning in the solidarity of the British Dominions. Ask yourself, Frenchmen, if it is not time to lay down your arms and make your peace, letting Britain stand the cost."" At this time, when Germany realizes that could she break down the Allied endurance she must succeed; it is utter madness for Australia to do anything that can undermine the loyalty and endurance of our friends in Europe. I do not suspect How long could the British Empire stand without the continued friendship of France? One of our greatest troubles in this war has been the strain* on Allied shipping. The honourable member knows that the devastation that has occurred to that shipping has come about in spite of the fact that the whole of the Allied navies have had to watch only 100 miles or so of German and Belgian coast line and a small outlet to the Adriatic. What chance would we have of getting a ton of produce into or out of England if, added to that 100 odd miles of coast line in the North Sea, watched by practically all the navies of the world, we had also to watch the coast of France, with every port and every haven on that coast a new nesting place for underwater piracy? If we lose the friendship and alliance of France we lose our birth right. I appeal to honourable members to realize that every word we say here that spells weakness, whatever may be in the minds of honourable members, may vitally undermine the loyalty of France, upon which the safety of Australia depends. ""Can Australia win the war?"" the honourable member asks. As an old battler in industrial warfare, what The honourable member quoted would he answer if a unionist said, "" Can any single unionist win a strike""? He would say "" No ; but any man can start a rot."" Any single rot. It is only by every one standing together that a strike can' be won. That is our position to-day.

There he started to undermine the moral resistance of the Prench people, and, as a result, was ejected from Prance. He then went to America, and when Kerensky began the bond fide and beneficial revolution of the Russian people, in a moment of weakness he asked the British Government to let Trotsky, whose activities in Europe had been known and marked, return to Russia.

I only want to ask those who in this chamber give utterance to these dangerous and dividing sentiments, ""Where did Trotsky lead his dupes?"" honourable members recognise At the time of which I speak, there were to be "" no indemnities and no annexations."" The Russian people believed that. Russia was as eagerly desirous of peace as is every man in this chamber. All through Russia peace was desired, and "" No annexations and no indemnities "" was the cry raised. That cry had We know that, some foundation at the time, because the German Reichstadt had given its voice in -that direction. Russia's representatives went to the open conference at BrestLitovsk. To-day where is their peace? to-day armies are marching here and there through Russia, not to maintain order, but to seize what wheat they can find and send it back to Germany. To rob the Russian people of their stores of food, these German armies are traversing the country with which they have just concluded peace. ""No annexations,"" they said. How many persons of Russian birth are now under German control, and are-if the existing peace stands-for all time doomed to the lot of the Polish people, who have been under the heel of Germany! There were to be no indemnities, we were told, and yet to-day the very food of Russia is being stolen by the armed forces of Germany after the declaration of peace! Down south is that poor little country, Roumania, which certainly put Although up a fight worthy of the admiration of the world.

We may be unimportant units of a people who may one day be trul y great, but this is our chance to show to the world that we t r u l y realize our opportunities here. Do not let us seek to make points off each other.. Let us recognise that the safety of this country depends upon our doing nothing to weaken Allied cohesion. I am sure that the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) w ill not regret the tone in which I have addressed myself to his speech. I do hope that he w ill realize that honourable members upon this side of the House are just as earnestly anxious for peace as he is. But we recognise that the only chance of securing a peace which w ill not mean that every drop of Australian blood shed in this war shall have been wasted is to get a peace which w ill be made lasting by the fact that Germany's outrages against civilization have been proved to be of no value to her. Before concluding, I wish to Tefer to a method adopted by the last Parliament in dealing w it h German trade in this country. Honourable members w ill doubtless recollect that shortly after the declaration of war, branch houses of great German manufacturing concerns in the United States were given by their parent houses the right to exploit B r it is h dominions. A f t e r considerable time, this Parliament. decided that goods covered by enemy trade marks and trade descriptions should not be allowed into Australia. I hold in my hand a letter from the Ministerf or Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen), and in connection therewith I take this the earliest opportunity to voice my humble protest. know that if a name is owned in Germany, ultimately the trade in connection with the name will revert to its German owners. The good-will is only kept alive thing exactly. What -will happen after if we allow goods covered by those namesthe war? We shall have clever German to come in from neutral or Allied countries unti l Germany is again in a position to resume her trade. The other day I asked the Ministeri f he would do his best to see that Bosch magnetos-the well known trade name of a German-made magneto which was very popular before the war on the market. is the best to-day. best on the market. that, but it was a very popular magneto. In any case, the Government did, at an early stage, declare these magnetos to be of enemy origin, and they were for a long time prohibited from entering the country. Quite recently a company, named bhe Bosch Magneto Company, has been f ormed in America, and is importing magnetos as "" Bosch magnetos "" into Australia to-day. I ask that that practice shall be discontinued. .This is the letter, dated 8th May, I received from the Customs Department Department of Trade and Customs, Melbourne, 8th May, 1918. Dear Mr Kelly, In reply to your question in regard to the importation of Bosch magnetos made in America, I desire to inform you that this type of magneto was not, at the outbreak of war, registered under the Trades Marks Act in Australia, but on the 30th December, 1915, the Bosch Magneto Company Limited was proclaimed an enemy company, which had the effect of excluding from Australia any goods produced ,by this company in any part of the world. It was represented by numerous importers early this year that the Bosch Magneto Company in the United States of America was not in any way controlled by enemy persons, and this fact was substantiated by the United States of America Government. On the advice of the Attorney-General, the proclamation of 30th December, 1915 was revoked, and a new one was issued, making the Bosch Magneto Company Limited, of Stuttgart, Germany, an enemy company, thus prohibiting the importation of Bosch magnetos made in England, Prance, and the United States of America, or any non-enemy country. The word "" Bosch"" has become associated with a particular type of magneto, and does not necessarily infer that a magneto hearing Honourable members this name is of enemy origin, although no doubt the type was originally conceived in Germany.",77,Robebt Best W E Did Break Honourable Members Opposite Should

The very fact the name is p u t in f r o n t of the people is a guarantee that the German trader will again recover his trade after the war. This is the time to abolish the value of German trade here, and the way to abolish it is by abolishing all German trade names and descriptions. I make this final appeal to the Minister to stop this happening wherever it raises its head. I do not believe that any Government will make such investigation into the enemy origin of any firm as will guarantee that firm's nature remaining as it was at the time it was investigated. A firm may exist to-day and manipulate the trade good-will in fhis Bosch magneto, and what guarantee have we that the shareholders in the firm are all persons of non-enemy origin, or are not dummies 1 What guarantee have we that the shareholders, will be the same next month. The shares are on the market, and German influence can buy them at any moment. The only safety we have in this connection is to abolish those trade names wherever we find them, and I appeal to the Ministeri n charge of the House> at the moment to make a note of my protest. test voiced by my humble self, but I understand that the matter has been brought officially to the notice of tbe Government by the Mother Country's representatives in this country, and I ask that the practice of admitting these articles under an original German name be discontinued from this hour. to refer particularly to the administration of the censorship. Recruiting Conference the PrimeM in ister should be said that a Press Conference, which was then sitting, would deal with the matter. I pointed out that it was quite possible the Press Conference would not look at the matter from the same point of view as other persons might; and I understand that the findings' of that Conference have never been made public. From what I have heard, however, I understand the decision was that no in formation likely to prove of use or of importance to the enemy, or likely to disturb our friendly relations with our Allies, should be published. Honourable members who have not come very much in contact with the censor may think that everything is going on well in that Department, and that every paper is observing the decision of the press' conference. I have here, however, a duplicate copy of an article which was sent fro m the Labour Galli n Melbourne to the censor, and should have appeared to-day. It deals with part of the proceedings of the Conference which had to do with the case of Captain Allen, who was an area officer, and afterwards a Brigade-Majori n Victoria. This article could give no military information whatever to the enemy, and having read it through, I can say that it certainly would not in any way tend to injure our relations with our Allies. Those responsible for the administration of the censorship have taken on themselves to use it for political purposes; and I take it that, whatever may have been the practice before the Conference at Government House, and the Press Conference, it is not intended ""that the censorship shall in futur e be used in any such way. I accepted the invitation to the Conference at Government Housei n the spirit in which it was offered, and went there prepared to do ^ I have done so. my best to further the objects of that The r e is not only a proConference. As I say, there is not one word of military importance in the whole of the article that was intended for the Labour Gall, but because the oflicers who administer the censorship consider that it reflects on them, its publication is prohibited. I take it that the Government will not tolerate that kind of thing for five minutes. If it is intended to run the censorship for political purposes, especially in view of the Conference to which I have referred, the sooner we know A t the recent the fact the better. It was never in tended that area officers should devote the promised that the censorship' whole of their time to area work.

There is another matter in connection with the censorship that I should like to mention. appear in Liberty and Progress, which, as honourable members know, is the journal of the Employers Federation, but that same little paragraph, has not been allowed to appear in the Labour Gall. Is there anything in the following which would give military information to the enemy, or be detrimental to our relations with our Allies?There was neither sense nor need for raid-. ing Parliament House in order to seize the Catts' excerpts from Hansard. All that was needed was to declare them non-mailable matter, and let them lie there, or at the Post Office,-or in the gutter. But if there are ninety and nine right ways of doing things, and only one wrong way, the wily bookmaker may take short odds every time that some one in authority will find the wrong way, and do it Liberty and Progress. Do honourable members think it is giving a f a i r deal for the censor to cut that paragraph out of the Labour Gall? Here is another paragraph which appeared in the Australian Worker under the heading "" Are We Being Sold?"" It relates to the trip of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Ministerf o r the Navy( Mr Cook) to England. It is about 4 inches long; four lines to appear, cutting out everything else, although it contains not one item of military importance. I hand these proofs to the Acting PrimeM in ister ( MrW a t t ) to show what has been censored in the Labour Call this week, so that he may judge if there is anything of military importance in the matter, or [168] ' Avhether the censorship is not being used An inquiry by certain persons for their own political purposes.

TheI t was submitted to the censor, trouble is not caused so much by instructions from head-quartersI mean, of course, Ministerial head-quarters-as by the manner In which perfectly well-meaning men interpret them. I am hopeful, however, that, despite what may be said of criticism as to the wisdom of accepting the decisions of the Press) Censorship Conference as final, a great deal of A paragraph was allowed to good will come out of the deliberations of that body. I am not in favour of political censorship. It may be, of course, that a suspicion of party politics attaches to anything done by one party in a time of war, but I want the Conference to understand that I am not in favour of political censorship; and the Government will endeavour, by instructions and administration, to prevent the naval and military censorship being used for political purposes. Many members said at the conference that it was not right to use the censorship for political purposes.. I do not want anything to be published in any part of Australia or elsewhere that is opposed to the Allies' cause, b u t we have a right to know the truth , and when we find these things are being cut out for political purposes, it makes us doubtful. the purpose is political. if a man is barred simply because he happens to be of one political faith. If a paragraph is allowed to appear in Liberty and Progress, why should it not be allowed to appear in the Labour OaUl What is the opinion of the honourable member for Grampians on that point? lutely fair.

388,Mr Corser,"Why accuse the party ofstated that if he had been in my place he would have, said harder things of the censor than I have. Perhapsi t would be better if 1 said that the cutting out of the article relating to Captain Allen was due, not so much to political reasons as to military friendship. If the persons acting as censors repeatedly fail to give a fair deal, as they' are told to do, the remedy is to shift them, a i d put in their places some one else who will do the right thing. No one can defend the knocking out of the extracts I have quoted. The Press Conference, I understand, unanimously carried a motion to the effect that; nothing which would give military information of advantage to the enemy, or be detrimental to the Allies, should be published, and a committee was apr pointed to give effect to the resolution. Still, while things such as I have quoted go on, many persons feel that they are not getting a fair deal. treatment from the Acting PrimeM in ister, and am glad of the opportunity to bring these matters up while he is present; so that I may get an assurance from him on the subject. Ahout a week ago, the adjournment of the House was moved to protest against the deportation of Italians. I have received a complaint, which I have.' forwarded to the Acting Prime Minister, Priday night, at a f r u it and' vegetable shop in my electorate, when the f a m i l y was busily engagedi n attending to customers, three plain clothes policemen came to the f r o n t to search; for a man, and at the same time two< military, men jumped the back fence, and went through the living rooms, frightening a child of four and. another of eight who were sleeping there. quite well have stopped at the back gate, because tliere is no side exit,, and no. way of. escape, except at the back, and front. I hope that my complaint has reached the proper quarter. 1 do> not say that all the military or civil police act in this fashion, but. 1 know of another case in. which a house was. searched at 3 o'clock in the morning, one man breaking in at the fron t and another at the back. That was a house in which two sisters were living. Their two brothers had enlisted, and one subsequently ^deserted. Such conduct on the part of the military police is i m proper. When persons are suspected of harboring persons, places can be watched, and a search made under proper conditions, but incidents such as I have just mentioned should not occur under any circumstances. do not think that any speech has ever been delivered in Australia equal to that which we had to-night from the honourable member for Wentworth ( MrK e l l y ) , and it is with regret that I detain the House for a few minutes after such a discussion as we have had of matters of wide-world and historical importance,to call attention to a merely domestic concern. But the distillation of eucalyptus oil is an industry which employs a considerable number of persons, and, because of the war, it is on the verge of temporary extinction. There is an almost unlimited demand for the.oil, but for the last six months it has I have had fair been impossible to obtain shipping space for its exportation. be obtained for wine, but not for eucalyptus o i l ! that.

It is. news to learn that wine is on the list. These men could it was. interest that, although for a long period leather could' not be shipped away, at all events not in large quantities, it is now put on the priority list, or, owing to the representations of the Government, the exportation of a considerable quantity of leather-has been permitted.

The Defence Department promised to pay employees who had been dismissed a week's wages in lieu of a week's notice, but this afternoon I received the following telegram from the secretary to the Small Arms Factory Employees UnionEight hundred men now employed. still out.

It seems remarkable that a Department should immediately repudiate a contract entered into with these men, but that is what has occurred during the past week or two so far as the Defence Department is concerned.
