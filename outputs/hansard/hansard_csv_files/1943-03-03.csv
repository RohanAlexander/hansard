The purchaser also desires to engage in war work, but as the result of the eviction, the organization will be put to great expense in erecting new premises.

The Minister for Information (Senator Ashley) has submitted the following comments on the questions raised by the honourable member:A study of newspaper files from all capital cities indicates that on an average, over a period, substantial displays have been given to news from the ISTew Guinea front. In addition, almost all newspapers publish in full communiques from Allied Headquarters in the South-West Pacific. They also .publish lengthy despatches and special articles from accredited war correspondents. It is the practice of the press to feature spot war news, and for some time a great amount of space on edition pages has been devoted to the Russian front. Considerable space has been devoted to the Middle East front; but, despite this, considerable space is given to the New Guinea front. Whenever operations become more extensive in New Guinea, there is an immediatepress reaction and greater space isdevoted to it. It is not very often that news of the South-West Pacific is released from Washington. When it is. it concerns naval operations or air co-operationfrom the South-West Pacific command. In addition, the newspapers havepublished 80 per cent, of the photographs of fighting in the New Guinea area, distributed to them by the Department of Information.",12,Assent To Bills

14,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane,"An illustration of the growth of news promotion to flight sergeant and warrant in the South-West Pacific Area is the wordage of news cabled from Australia to America. It has increased from 210 words a month early in 1940 to an average of more than 199,000 -words over the last eight months. I doubt whether any good purpose could be served by approaching the newspaper .proprietors, as they could fairly claim that they are publishing a full proportion of South-West Pacific news from time to time. Prominence is often given to the deeds of American troops at Guadalcanal, ancl over a period of months it could hardly be said that news of activities in this sphere have not been well covered by the press. All the news of this sector comes from Washington, a; it is outside the South-West Pacific command. time past, honourable members have been the Government will be advised of asking questions of the Minister for Air developments as they occur. I hope about the delay which has occurred in that finality in this matter will be reached the promotion of sergeant pilots in the at an early date, and as soon as any furAir Foree overseas. I have myself made ther information of interest comes to many representations on the subject, and hand I shall advise the House. I am so Have other honourable members. Is hopeful that the negotiations taking place the Minister yet in a position to make a in London in that connection will result statement on the subject? time ago the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) raised in this «chajmber the question of promotion to commissioned rank of Australian aircrew personnel serving overseas with the RoyalA i r Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme agreement. This matter was raised also by -other members on both sides of the House. In my reply, I intimated that that question, with many others, was the subject of -discussion between Australian and United Kingdom representatives in London, and that as soon as I received any further information in that connection I would -pass it on to honourable members. A cablegram has just been received from the Australian representative in London to the effect that agreement has been reached -that such personnel will be eligible for officerafter six months' satisfactory service as a sergeant ami flight sergeant respectively; and'from pilot officer to flying officer after six months' satisfactory service;, and from flying officer to flight lieutenant after two years' satisfactory commissioned service. The agreement further provides that personnel will be eligible at any time for the grant of acting rank in accordance with the establishment of the appointment to which an aircrew member is posted. As to the commissioning of non-commissioned aircrew personnel, Mr Bruce advised that, whilst strong representations had been made by the Australian representative for the. commissioning of all aircrew personnel who are recommended and considered suitable according to the standards of the Royal Australian Air readied. Discussions with the United Kingdom authorities on this important very favourably. It. will be of interest to honourable members to know that during the last three months 853 members of aircrew in the Royal Australian Air Force-pilots , observers, wireless air observers, wireless air gunners, and air gunner,;-hav e been promoted from non-commissioned to commissioned rank after operational and unit experience here and overseas. Of that number, approximately 220 were gazetted only during the last week or two. From these figures it will be clear to members that every action is being taken to arrange promotions of aircrew personnel. That policy will continue to be implemented, as far as practicable, consistent with agreements that may be entered into with the United Kingdom and the dominions-which are participants in th"" scheme.",13,Australian And American Teoops Pbess Reports Of Operations

16,Mr Drakeford,"by leave-Som eWOOL APPRAISEMENT CENTRES. ber for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) asked last week for tire names of the expert committee which selected the sites for country wool storage and appraisement centres. For the information of honourable members, I point out that, consequent upon the decision of the Government to establish country wool storage and appraisement centres, Messrs. H. J. Monckton, chief controlling appraiser for the Central Wool Committee in New South Wales, and W. G. Lumby, director of Shute, Bell, Badgery, Lumby and Company Limited, were asked on behalf of the Government to report on the suitability of country sites in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Messrs. Monckton and Lumby, who are men of high repute and undoubted ability, have been associated with the wool trade for many years. They were, therefore, well fitted to undertake the responsible duties allotted to them. After making a detailed examination of all tlie factors involved, including the conservation of rolling stock urgently required for defence needs, the storage of unshippable types of wool, areas not regarded as susceptible to enemy action, and other relevant matters, they recommended Dubbo, Moree and Werris Creek in New South Wales, Roma in Queensland, and Portland in Victoria, as new storage and appraisement centres. Subsequently, the recommendations of the committee were examined by the Director General of Transport, Sir Harold Clapp, and his deputy, Mr I). J. Howse, as well as by representatives of the Queensland Railway Department. The reports confirmed in detail the recommendations submitted by Messrs. Monckton and Lumby. The comments of the Director-General of Transport are of particular interest, and indicate the exhaustive nature of the surveys made in each case to test the suitability of the selected sites. Sir Harold Clapp, in his report, saidSo far as the selection of locations for immediate consideration is concerned, the points proposed in New South Wales are ideal. In tlie case of Dubbo, the State is already bearing a bounty in freight to enable and into the quality of the food supplied wool appraised in Sydney to be re-transported to -members of the forces, including the to the Dubbo district for the carbonizing works, which represents wasted transport when rt could be met by wool which flows past Dubbo to the city for appraisement. In the cases of Werris Creek and Moree, these are ideal points for country appraisement and would be quite acceptable to the transport authorities, with considerable saving in truck mileage. 'lhe question was very f u l l y discussed with the chief traffic manager ( Mr A. Gr. Deimiss), who was in f u l l agreement with the proposal. From a State aspect, the proposals were discussed with the chairman of the State Development Committee, Professor H . D. Black, and other members-and they are unanimously in favour of the scheme and regard it as the only sound means of giving immediate relief to railway transport, as well as establishing a sound policy for the economic development of country industry. The matter was f u l ly discussed w it h the State Premier (Hon. W. J. McKell, M.L.A.), who advised that the proposals would have the f u l l support of his Government, both in respect to the State outlook and the urgent relief necessary to the transport system. As1 have indicated, the investigators were as much impressed with the suitability of Roma and Portland as with that of the New South Wales sites. The selection of Portland has since been favourably commented upon by the Premier of Victoria, who, by no stretch of imagination, can be regarded as a supporter of this Government; while the choice of Roma has been enthusiastically endorsed by the North Queensland Country party. The Government is determined to proceed with its plans for decentralizing the wool industry, and is confident in the knowledge that it is in the national interest to do so. the Prime Minister yet announce the decision of the Government in respect of Easter holidays?

Government, representatives abroad, whose duty it is to watch Australian publicity, have access in the first place to the short-wave broadcasts which are monitored and circulated; secondly, they are kept informed of current developments in Australia bearing on the war by a weekly newsletter conveyed to them by the fastest route; and, thirdly, decisions of big moment or projected legislation dealing with important war administration are explained to them by cable. All these facilities were made available in relation to the Defence Bill from the time that the question of amending the act was first announced by me last November. Government representatives ahroad had no information at their disposal that was not also available to the Australian people. At. the same time sufficient information was made available to them to enable them to correct any misrepresentations of the bill or its purposes that might have been cabled from Australia.

On the contrary, there is the most complete confidence on the part of the Government and, I am sure, of the Advisory War Council also, in the steps which the commanders are taking in order to deal, to the maximum of their resources, with any campaign which the enemy may undertake. The reason why there is to be no meeting of the Advisory War Council this week is not unrelated to the fact, that members of the council are kept fully informed of what is taking place. They know, broadly, what preparations the commanders have made, and they do not see any occasion to meet. any action against the newspaper? I am asked whether there is a political censorship in Australia, and to that question I always answer "" No "". I take it that, that expresses the wish of the Parliament. The comment in the Daily Telegraph, whilst grossly inaccurate, does not appear to me, so far as I could gather its import, to be harmful to the security of the country. It is most certainly calculated to affect the public mind in that it tends to create a belief that there is slackness in Canberra regarding the conduct of the war. The report states that no meeting of the Advisory War Council is being held this week, and the suggesin the performance of its duty. That is entirely false, but it is not a new thing for the Daily Telegraph to be false.

Simultaneously., T requested the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to take steps to ensure that a ceiling price was fixed for peaches in the metropolitan market, so that those growers who had access to that, market because of the action taken to stop the transport of peaches from other areas, would not be able to extract exorbitant prices from the public.

Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion, purpose in taking this action is to attack not the Government, but the problem that now confronts Australia in this matter. I acknowledge that much has been done by Australia with regard to food production, particularly as the main basis of what we are doing was laid down by me during the last twenty years. Honourable members opposite may smile; but I remind them that when I was Minister for CommerceI instituted the canning campaign, and initiated systematic experiments with regard to dehydration. I made provision also for a very great increase of cold storage accommodation. Our food problem is complicated by the federal system under which we live, as well as by w ar problems. I endeavoured r to overcome the difficulties arising from the first cause by establishing the Australian Agricultural Council about nine years ago. That body brought together the Commonwealth and the .States in an attempt to establish a unitary policy. In time of war, piecemeal efforts to deal with food production and consumption create anomalies almost as numerous and as difficult as the original problems. I intend to set out the basic principles that should guide us, and to give illustrations of the types of mess we are in. I shall' then show the effect of this division of control on our production, and compare our results with what has been done in Britain, where there is unified control. Finally, I shall indicate how we should proceed. Our real difficulty here is that we have no organization to ensure civilian food at reasonable prices and in continuous supply. In Sydney on Christmas Eve we dumped 3,000 bags of beans, and last. Monday the Melbourne markets were cleared out of vegetables in ten minutes. The welfare of the workers in war-time is affected by the organization of food supply and distribution as much as by the organization of industrial production and military activity. The ability and desire of the people to stand the strain imposed upon them in war-time depend to a great extent on the quantity and kind of food available to them. The chaotic condition of food distribution in the closing years of the last war was one of the principal causes of growing industrial unrest, which finally forced the British Government, to establish a wide measure of food control. One reason why Germany surrendered was because its food organization was the first to collapse. Control of supplies and distribution is more easily applied and more likely to be effective if it is introduced before shortages occur and prices begin to get out of hand. The primary purpose of production is consumption. Both production and consumption can be stimulated under a food control scheme which stabilizes the general price level. Great Britain has found that subsidizing the cost of living keeps consumer prices at a reasonable level. A remunerative price guaranteed by the Treasury stimulates production ofample supplies. The advantages of stability of general price level are significant(1) It imparts much greater satisfaction to the ordinary consumer and therefore builds up morale. (2) It stops the adjustment of wages to the cost of living, and therefore stabilizes costs of both public and private enterprise. Constantly rising wages costs will be damaging to all budgets, and particularly, to the budgets of State governments, whose revenues are now more or less pegged by the operation of the uniform taxation system. (3) It reduces the net cost of the Commonwealth Government's war effort, even though subsidies have to be paid. The Government is buying half the goods and services, and any subsidies it spends will be for payments at the basis of costs,",19,Formal Motion For Adjournment

If prices were adjusted instead of subsidies being paid, tbe final cost ordered 1,000 each in New South Wales, to tbe consumer, including tbe Government, would be very much greater than the original cost of tlie subsidies. (4) It effectively does away with all fear' of inflation and therefore makes the Government's financial policy more secure, and renders unnecessary any special action on the part cf investors, business men, and the people in general to "" hedge"" against inflation. It is important to do the whole job and not to proceed piecemeal. Later -on I shall come to the steps that we should take in Australia. should like to illustrate some of the diffiwho had been doing not only civilian work culties that arise at present, because there is no comprehensive system for handling the whole of our problem. There is no central organization to assure ample supplies of civilian food. Last spring, for instance, seed was refused to hundreds of farmers who wanted to grow their own potatoes in the coastal districts through, which he did, but all this took so of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, even for half an acre, although such production would have subsequently relieved the pressure on the market. In England great assistance to the solution of the problem of vegetables has been given by production in home allotments. seed refused? In Australia the seed seems to have been cornered for army contracts. There may have been a way of getting seed for this purpose, but it was unknown to the great mass of the general public and tbe farmers, and to me as a public man and a farmer to boot, because I tried to get it and could not find a Avay. Take as another example milking machines, in which the Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) gave us a great deal of help in our difficulties. The Government decided to stimulate dairy production and gave a subsidy to this end, actually passing an act which stated that as its main purpose. The Australian Food Council advised the installation of milking machines, and Queensland and Victoria. There are roughly 60 constituents of these machines. The manufacturers to whom the orders were given found that they could not get priorities for them from the various departments. Although the Food Council assisted them in every way to get their travellers and men to service and install the machines, the Department of War Organization of Industry and the Department, of Labour and National Service said that these could not be made available, because they were needed somewhere else. In addition, the Munitions Department would not supply the motors, all of which it said were needed for tbe Army. FinFirst, I ally in despair these business executives, but also a great deal of war work, cameto us to see what could be done. We brought them to the Minister for Supply and Shipping who was, I understand, able to overcome most of the difficulties. We asked him to co-ordinate the conflicting authorities and allot tbe priorities right long that tbe milking machines will not now be available for three or four months, and by that time tbe flush of the milking season for which they were needed will be over. Nothing illustrates more clearly the necessity for one definite overseeing authority to whom the farmer, manufacturer or other person concerned can say: ""Now, you carry this thing through for me,, and, if it is the highest order of priority, make certain that the issue comes to me at the right time "". In another case I found that the Food Council had let in tbe irrigation areas a large contract for vegetables for the servises. This was done through the Department of Supply and Development. The farmer who accepted the contract needed an extension of his irrigation system to fulfil it, but his machinery-maker could not get his raw material for this extension from the Department of Munitions. Finally the Minister for Supply and Shipping, at my instigation, insisted on tlie high priority given to the contract being honoured, and this enabled the contract, which was actually made by his",20,Formal Motion For Adjournment

They should, be able to say to him, "" There is our problem, you work with respective Ministers who are handling the various sub-departments, and let us get ahead. We are handicapped enough as it is, because so many of our staff are fighting overseas or engaged in munitions work "". There is another instance which I can give of potatoes actually grown to contract, but allowed to rot at the railway station at Grafton because no trucks were available for a week to carry them off. We must have a man in control of food wbo is able to co-ordinate transport as well, because transport is just as important as anything else. He should be able to arrange transport for food in the same way as he would do it for munitions. I have already mentioned how thousands of bags of beans and other fresh vegetables were dumped on Christmas Eve. A coordinating authority could have insisted on all tbe dehydrating, canning and cold storage facilities in .Sydney being placed at the disposal of the vegetable suppliers, planes that the world has ever who in that way would have been able to preserve a great deal of these beautiful fresh vegetables and carry them forward until the flush season bad gone, when they would have been very valuable indeed. The decrease of butter production has been due partly to tbe bad season, but a considerable fall was tbe result of the drain on the man-power of the farms fifteen months ago, and the failure of the Munitions and Supply departments to permit the installation of labour saving units. This led to many farms having to be abandoned. My experience throughout Australia shows me that one out of every five or six of the dairy farms ing the cost of living to ensure that, the which were working three or four years ago is not at present being worked, owing either to lack of labour or to lack of tlie financial incentive which is essential to enable those on the land to make a profit. The Government has passed an act to stimulate dairy production; yet there is no organization in existence to do this co-ordinating job of work. It is therefore imperative to create one. Great Britain is a food-importing country, and Tbere its Government desires to bring in every pound of fat that is possible to be eaten, and wishes every pound of other food that cannot be shipped to be stored for post-war use. It especially desires that Australian agriculture should be maintained 100 per cent, intact. Great Britain has made great progress in agricultural production during the last three and a half years. Australia, which is a great food-producing country, should make certain that it gets the maximum amount of production for Great Britain and the allies and its own people during the war, and that at tbe endof tbe war it has an agriculture which is 100 per cent, efficient, and so able, straight away, to supply post-war demands. Australia should have in reserve for that time of crisis everything that can be preserved, because it will be called on to help to feed millions of starving families in the countries which, are now oppressed. Great Britain has made sure of tbe ability of it i Minister for Food to deal with problems of transport, machinery, and labour. During the last three years it has achieved the greatest production of the engines of war, ships and aeroseen. For a long time it carried on alone its fight with the vest of Europe. It has 3,500,000 men in the fighting forces. In spite of all that it has had to face, it has increased its agricultural production by no less than 50 per cent. When the war started it was 40 per cent, self-sufficient; to-day, as regards food, it is over 60 per cent, self-sufficient. At the same time it has made its people happy and contended by learning and practising the lessons which the last war taught it in respect of food control. By its policy of remunerative prices to the producer and subsidizconsumer gets bis food at reasonable prices, Great Britain has steadily increased tbe production and consumption of milk by not less than 300,000,000 gallons of whole milk a year, and its consumption has now reached 5 pints a bead a week. This milk is being sold at 2d. a pint, whereas the pre-war price was well over 3d., and the actual cost of producing it to tbe farmer, is nearly 3fd. Despite the fact that Australia is a great butter producing country, we have experienced a decline of butter production and of milk consumption. Milk consumption in Australia to-day is not so great per bead as it tractors at work now than we were using is in Great Britain. In Great Britain tbe area under vegetables has increased from 2,500,000 acres to 4,000,000 acres, and the total quantity of vegetables available is now double what it was at tbe beginning of tbe war. In this country there has bee.n a. substantial decline in vegetable production with the exception of potatoes, in respect of which there has been some increase. In Great Britain the price of vegetables has remained at practically the same figure for the last eighteen months. Wages also have been stabilized. In fact the retail price index figures, generally, in Great Britain and Canada have remained stationary, whilst we in Australia have experienced the most extraordinary and grotesque fluctuations in the prices of vegetables and fruit especially. This has occurred largely because of our lack of united political food control. We have not established a co-ordinated necessary service, and the use of proorganization. We have not viewed our ducer-gas units was discontinued. But problem as a whole. Britain has dealt a decision on such a matter should be with food production on a unified basis. given as a matter of policy and not of The Eood Ministry considers food probgrace, and should be generally applied lems in the same way as tbe ministries by the Minister for Food. in control of the fighting services consider service problems.

The whole problem of British since been realized that many difficulties man-power has been considered in relation would have been avoided had producto the total need.

In conwork over practically the whole period of sequence of the present policy of the farm operations. Britain has dealt in the same way with months. British policy has resulted in in the problem of mechanical appliances for dustrial peace and undoubtedly has proved farm work.

I believe that in Australia we have fewer at the beginning of the war. This is also probably true of trucks. Our farming community has been engaged in a continuous fight for the right to retain farm implements, and also for the release, for such implements, of the necessary oil and other supplies. Farm machinery and fuel have been on a low priority. I must confess, however, that in this case also, when a reasonable submission has been made to the Minister for Supply and Shipping it has been favourably considered. For example, I made a request to the Minister that petroldriven vehicles should be permitted to bring butter from the Dorrigo into the factories. I pointed out that producer-gas units were absolutely ineffective in the mountainous Dorrigo country. As a consequence, the Minister agreed that timber carriers and other persons engaged in transport services should be allowed to obtain sufficient petrol to render tbe Productionfiguresin Great Britain and British Government, the cost of living has been stabilized for tbe last eighteen beleaguered England.

Such control over demand acts as a check to inflation, but to be complete it must be supplemented by a reduction of purchasing power by means of taxation. The stabilizing of the cost of living index figure is important, because that ultimately determines wage rates. The stability of the index figure can be assured by a proper policy of Government subsidies. We must consider tbe matters as a whole, because, as was found in Great Britain, if we deal only with certain items such as meat, and leave other foods out of consideration, undesirable results will follow. Without price control of foodstuffs generally, there will be profiteering. would increase the difficulty of the task. The reason why the Canadian scheme succeeded was that the boldest methods were adopted. An over-all price ceiling was fixed, which was found to be more simple to administer than a partial plan. The difficulty about a partial plan is that the levels of profits in various industries differ, and, under the present economic structure, it is impossible to isolate costs. There is a "" spilling over "" from non-stabilized industries. In Australia wages have, for many years, been adjusted in accordance with the cost of living. Tbe need for a price ceiling in this country is urgent, because in no other country are wages adjusted automatically to such a degree in accordance with the cost of living. The immediate need in Australia is a ministry of food, which has the first and last word to say regarding the production, processing, distribution and consumption of food.

My purpose is to reply to his arguments, first, by indicating how Australia stood in connection with this matter fifteen months ago, what steps have been taken by the present Government since that time, and what results have been obtained. Having that information, the House will be able to judge whether the Government has adopted reasonable and proper measures with a view to solving the food problem. When the Government took office no fewer* than 57 boards-, commisDelay in applying control sions, and other authorities under the control of different departments were dealing with the matter.

Tbe problem which faced the Government was to get a central authority that would make prompt decisions in food matters, give such directions as were necessary to producers, examine and direct all processing methods, deal with food imports, and, generally, bring together the boards required so that necessary directions could be given.

Sir matter for the State Departments of Agriculture. mainly with those agencies with which the Commonwealth is associated. merce and Agriculture has never dealt with manufactured foodstuffs. thought it most undesirable that the Department of Supply should be free to go on to the markets to satisfy tbe needs of the fighting forces without having due regard to the needs of the civilian population. It therefore decided that a production line should be maintained which would meet the needs of both the fighting forces and the civilian population. that the best means of approaching the matter was through the Australian Food Council, which would survey the sources of supply, analyse the capacity of the country, and also deal with the supply of seeds, particularly vegetable seeds. The Australian Food Council includes in its membership the M in ister for Supply and Shipping as chairman, and the Director-General of Agriculture as deputy chairman. The latter is also chairman of the executive of the Australian Food Council. Among the members of the council are representatives of the fighting forces-the Wavy, the Army, the A i r Force and the United States of America Army. The Government thought it necessary that these representatives, who know the needs of the fighting services, should also be made aware of the needs of the civilian population. For the first time, members of the fighting forces were appointed to sit, at a conference table to consider not only their own requirements, but those of the country as a whole.

That is an indication of what the Government is doing and of the importance that it attaches to the supply of foodstuffs as a part of world war strategy. We have endeavoured to assess our production not on a hit-and-miss basis, but on a scientific basis. Careful analyses are constantly being made of various aspects of the problem. For instance, the supply of seeds of various kinds has to be w atched carefully, and T the capacity of our canning and processing works must be kept under constant, review.

That matter, however, was grappled with immediately. Dr. Clements went to Queensland specially to deal with the vitamin value of various foods. It is true that for a time there was a shortage of potatoes, but since then there has been a glut of that commodity. It is better, however, that there should be a glut than a shortage of any essential food. aiming at. I could not obtain seed potatoes. seed were sent to Queensland, and potatoes were grown in that State. Moreover, farmers were guaranteed a price of £10 a ton for them. When the market price rose to £17 a ton I authorized payment at that rate in order that farmers should have no ground for complaint that the Government had taken advantage of circumstances to deprive them of a fair price for their product. The production of vegetables in Queensland generally has been watched carefully. That there is a shortage of rice is true. The reason is that we have to provide the natives in the islands with the rice that would be normally available to the Australian civilians, and to do that we bad to close down on the supply of rice to tbe civilians.

We had to bring the obtain a complete picture of Australia's needs of foodstuffs. We have had problems in regard to citru3 fruits. Honourable members know that the fighting forces need citrus juices. I need not go into details, but the obligation rests upon me to ensure, even at the expense of the civilian population, that such fruit iuices as are necessary for the fighting forces shall be supplied. The fighting forces shall be provided with fruit juices even if civilians have to go without. That is the basis of the whole system which is being operated by the Food Council. The right honourable member for Cowper said that he introduced the idea of dehydration; but, until the Food Council was established, the planning of dehydration was not undertaken. Our plans are unique in this regard. I dare to say that no other country, except the United States of America, has pushed so far ahead with the dehydration of food as has Australia. Australia is supplying the fighting forces in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The United States of America is doing a great job of work in supplying North Africa and Russia with food. I am prompted to mention that the people of the United States of America have meatless days, and milkless and butterless days, too. If the Australian people suffer no more in this war than they have suffered so far they will be the luckiest people in the world. So far we have been able to keep our people provided with meat, butter and milk, which the people of the United States of America have to do without on certain days in each week. We have reason to be proud of what we have done. The right honourable member for Cowper was able, in support of his case, to cite isolated breakdowns here and there, but I defy any one to achieve the ideal state and to satisfy every need.

It has brought together the two main departments concerned in food, the Department of Supply and Shipping and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. It has brought the British Food Mission and the American experts to Australia. It has evolved the present technical organization in which the best overseas authorities are combined with our own Australian experts. It has set up a system of production goals, quotas and similar statistical information which enable the Government to determine almost at a moment's notice the position in regard to any particular item of food. We had our difficulties in doing this job. We were faced with a situation in South Australia where the growers of a particular kind of grape found that they would obtain a better return if they sold their grapes to the wineries. Owing to the fact that the United Kingdom particularly wanted this grape in its dried form, it was necessary for the Commonwealth Government to make regulations to compel the growers to make the grapes available for dehydration. The regulation provides that the growers shall not sell to wineries more than the average of their sales to wineries over the last five years. hydrated. At question time, the matter of the fixation of the price of peaches was mentioned. We discovered that agents in Sydney were going to the growers of pi-aches in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and offering them attractive prices. The result was that, regardless of contracts, the growers by-passed the canneries and sent their peaches to the Sydney market, Tbe canneries were l e f t high and dry. We took appropriate action. consumers were fleeced by the prices they were compelled to pay for peaches. ports of obstacles which we have to surmount in maintaining production at the required levels. We had tbe same difficulty about the by-passing of canneries by tomato growers. We had to refuse to allow tomatoes to be sent to the metropolitan area from certain areas either by road or by rail.

112,Mr Francis (Moreton) [4.48],"hesitation in agreeing that the Government has done a great deal in ensuring the maintenance of food supplies to our troops. The issue is not the organization of the distribution of food, but the organization of production of food. The individual farmer does not know what he is required to produce. Thousands of farmers have no contact with the Government or with producers' organizations, and they have not been told whether they should 'produce 100 lb. or 1,000 lb. of this product or that. They are left to produce haphazardly according to their inclinations. None is more anxious than the farmer to help the nation to build up supplies of food. showed that the Australian Pood Council was handling the distribution of food, but be failed, to deal with the actual production of food. The complaint of honourable members on this side is that the actual production of food has not been organized on a national basis. have been set up for that purpose. Supply and Shipping did not say one word on that point. The fact is that for want of such organizations tbe production of food in Australia to-day is chaotic. It is being left entirely to chance. Production has not been coordinated. Consequently, our producers do not know what is expected of them. They must be told clearly of our requirements not, only for our own fighting forces and those of our allies, but also for civilians in this country and in GreatB r it a in . Until production is organized on that basis, the Government cannot deal with this problem effectively. ignored any of the recommendations made to it by the Joint Committee on Rural Industries? implemented the committee's recommendations with respect to man-power and the supply of spare parts for farmin g machinery, but it has failed to act on the committee's recommendations for the co-ordination of production. On that point, the committee reportedOne of the outstanding features of the investigations by the Joint Committee on Rural Industries has been the desire of the primary producer' to help in the ever-increasing demand for the production of essential foodstuffs and other rural products. Given guidance and leadership, fanners are only too ready to meet demands, but, lacking that guidance and leadership, the sudden changes of demand and the difficulty of making the necessary adjustments have left a sense of frustration in the minds of many men on the land. Specialized industries-wool , wheat, meat, dairying, &c -ar e organized on sectional lines, but a national constructive plan to coordinate agriculture and grazing and direct war-time activities of rural industries is wanting. The committee recommended the appointment of a Commonwealth Director of Primary Production to formulate The Minister and direct, policy on a national basis. The Government appointed Mr Bulcock Director-General of Agriculture. I know him personally, and I know that he has been doing an extraordinary amount of work; but I have yet to learn that he has made direct contact with the farmers or indicated to them our requirements on a national basis. He should make direct contact with the producers. To-day, however, the producers are still left to carry on according to their individual judgment. I admit that production has been stepped up substantially, but that has been due entirely to individual, initiative on the part, of the farmers, and to favorable seasons. Production has not been in creased on the basis of a co-ordinated national scheme. The primary producers are not represented on the Australian Food Council. That body consists solely of departmental officials. Further, it has not indicated to the farmers the classes of food which are needed most urgently. The first incentive to tbe farmer to increase production is the guarantee of a reasonable price for his product. Several committees have recommended that the Government should guarantee a reasonable price for butter. The general The Government has recommendation was that the price should be increased by almost 4d. per lb., but an increase of only $d. was granted. 'So long as we retain our present, multiplicity of boards and committees we cannot avoid duplication and confusion in our primary industries.

Not only arc we in the unhappy position of -The honourable member's time has having to daily refuse orders for milking plant on account of having no engines to drive them, expired. but production is being definitely held up. When a farmer finds that he cannot purchase a milking plant, he has no other alternative but to reduce his herd. Herds -have already been substantially reduced throughout Australia. That is a tragic fact. I know that these engines are required by the fighting services. I urge the Government to release as many men as possible from the services to assist in rural industries. On the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Rural Industries the Government in March last provided a blanket exemption in respect of all rural industries. However, the fact remains that to-day old people are carrying on most of the farms. This makes the need for the supply of engines for farming machines even more imperative. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) should obtain the release of these machines from the military, at least during the peak periods of production. I repeat that no responsible organization has made direct contact with individual farmers in order to inform them of our national requirements of various classes of products. Production goals should be allotted to each State, and the State governments should be asked to organize production to attain those goals. d i ti ons ? had one of the best seasons in our history. Butter production has been colossal, due solely to good seasonal conditions. again urge the Minister to set up a body to organize and direct the actual production of food. The Australian Food Council is concerned only with the distribution of the food produced. It has clared that no shortage of any kind of pleased that the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has submitted this motion because it gives to us an opportunity to tell not only honourable members opposite but also the people what the Government has done to increase the production of food. The crux of the problem, as I see it, is that tbe Commonwealth Government has no direct jurisdiction over primary production. That is a prerogative of the States. It is only in war-time, and through regulations, that the Commonwealth can take that power, and even then it can exercise its powers in full only through the willing collaboration of the States. Recently, the Government appealed to the States to hand over several of their powers to the National Parliament, so that it could more effectively fight the war. The States are still talking about it, and we do not know what they will do. As a matter of fact, some of them do not know where they are. For the purpose of articulating and co-ordinating the many and varied and sometimes clashing factors and interests associated with food production, the joint parliamentary committee appointed to inquire into rural industries as they are affected by the war, of which I have the privilege of being a member, recommended some time ago that a director-general of agriculture should br; appointed. This was carried out at once, ?o I do not see what we are I grumbling about.

As a matter of fact, it set about fighting the war on the same lines as tbe war of 1914-18 was fought-'business as usual.

The enemy is almost literally battering at our gates. have tens of thousands, and I hope before long we shall have hundreds of thousands, of troops from our allies using Australia as a jumping-oif place to fight the Japanese and avenge Pearl Harbour. Great Britain has been held up to us as an example in the production, control and distribution of food. 1 agree that it has done wonderfully well, but it has done it simply by appointing committees and giving them great powers. They can tell a farmer to produce certain things, and if he does not, they put him off his land. If we did that in Australia, a "" squeal "" would go up to High Heaven that the Labour party was bringing in socialism. We must bring in socialism of that kind to win tbe war, and later on to win the peace. In Great Britain, the Government has taken to itself many more powers than we have. We have appointed not only a Director-General of Agriculture, but also local committees, and we are doing a great deal already. commission was appointed to inquire into the important matter of malnutrition, and it reported that a very high percentage of Australians were the victims of malnutrition. Either they did not yet sufficient food, or tbe food they got did not contain the vitamins necessary for full development. That was not in war-time, but in peace-time, when the good old Lyons, Menzies and Fadden Governments ruled the land. There was starvation in the midst of plenty, yet honourable members opposite talk about what this Government has not done. What did their Governments do? In the midst of plenty, when wheat, was rotting in the bags or being eaten by mice and weevils, there were hungry women and children in Australia. Mr Raker. paddocks to-day. are taking measures to use it, and we have a surplus of it, so that we need not worry too much about that. I can point to some of the things that this Government has done. We are told that the dairyman is not getting a fair deal. I am one of the first to admit that he is not; but in all the years that have ""We also gone, what has he had from, the parties now in Opposition? In the last 42 years, the Labour party has been in power for only three or four. As a matter of fact, the dairymen and other producers have been in the wilderness for 40 years. When Labour came into office, dairymen had not received a price increase for nine years. United Australia party and composite governments had been in power during that period. In December, 1941, two months after the Opposition bad been defeated in the House, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) announced that he would ask the Prices Commissioner to review the previous refusal to grant an increase of the price of butter. As a result of this, an increase was granted. Feeling that dairymen needed additional assistance, the Government last October introduced the Dairying Industry Assistance Bill, providing for a subsidy of £2,000,000 per annum. This subsidy is now being distributed. I do not believe that suffiSome time ago, a cient has yet been done. At the present time, inquiries are in progress and representations are being made to the Prices Commissioner to see that tbe basic wage shall be paid to those engaged in the dairying industry. That must mean that the employer in the industry will get at least the basic wage, plus the cost of production, for his product. This Government also subsidizes the wool industry. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) was font to Great Britain, and obtained a rise of 15 per cent, in the price of Australian wool under the contract with the British Government. That was a little over 2d. per lb. and brought into this country an additional £9,000,000 per annum. orable member's time has expired.",32,Earle Page I T Was Really A Supply And Shipping Commerce And

We have had a sorry experience in the dairying industry as the result of the present lack of co-ordination. Many dairying districts have been denuded of their man-power and some magnificent herds of dairy cattle, which were formed as the result of generations of expert attention, have been ruined. Dairymen have been forced to dry off their cows and send them to the abattoirs simply because man-power has not been available for milking purposes. This is a serious situation, particularly in view of the urgent need for us to accumulate food reserves in this country.

In some soldier settlement areas, a similar situation has arisen with the prune crop. This season many growers had their best crop for five years, but, because of tbe lack of co-operation between the Department of the Army and the Department of Labour and National Service, insufficient labour was available to harvest the fruit. It is high time that the authorities concerned realized the need for co-ordination in accumulating foodstuffs in this country, particularly as we shall be required, in the future, to provide for all the fighting services in the South-West Pacific Area.

Those departments enter into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth for the production Last season, contracts were made in this way for the production of potatoes, the growers being guaranteed a minimum price. Now, in every part of Australia where sufficient inducement is offering, we are erecting vegetabledehydrating plants. More than 30 are under construction, and already many have been completed. Also, contracts are being entered into for the production of vegetables in areas adjacent to tbe factories. It will not in future be possible for vegetables to go to waste simply because there happens to be a glut. The Director-General of Agriculture has succeeded in establishing an agricultural machinery pool. We have imported from the United States of America the most up-to-date agricultural machinery available, and this is being rented to the farmers on a community basis. Some of the machines are very expensive, and it would not be possible for individual farmers to purchase them. Therefore, the machines are distributed to tbe various country centres, and are used on a hire basis by the farmers as they need them. Thus, in every direction, food production is being planned in a. way never before attempted in Australia. Australia is able to meet, the food requirements of tbe United Kingdom so far a? production is concerned, tlie only limitcerned already at what they regard .as the ing factor being shipping space. This soason, Ave have increased dairy production in a remarkable manner. The Government of the United Kingdom informed us-that if we were able to supply 50,000 tons of butter this year, that would meet all requirements. However, we shall be in a position to supply 70,000 tons of butter, to say nothing of cheese, if shipping is available. mittee says that there will be a shortage of dairy products. there will be a shortage. This year, we shall produce, according to the latest estiwonders in some respects in supplying tlie mates, 1S0,000 tons of butter, which represents a considerable increase on last year's production. Onr only concern is storage space, and a sum of £25,000 has been made available for the erection of extra cool stores in Sydney. Cool-storage space of essential foodstuffs. is necessary in order to hold surplus food products until they can be shipped to Great Britain. In all parts of Australia, butter production during the last few months has reached record proportions. In southern Queensland, production has been very high. extraordinarily good season. what it is due, but the fact is that production is very high. I am trying to prevent panic among the people, panic which might be induced by this consbant croaking about food shortage by members of the Opposition for political purposes. -The Minister's time has expired. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has taken up an extraordinary attitude in regard to this subject. The .Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) admitted that the right honourable member for Oowper( Sir Ear. 1 Page) had raised a matter of very great importance. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is somewhat belated in his fears that we may create a state of alarm among the public. I can assure him that the people are very much conineffective handling of the general food situation. Every housewife who goes to her grocer knows how difficult it is to get some of her most commonplace requirements. Every one engaged in the bulk handling of foodstuffs knows of the difficulties which have been created by the bureaucratic control of supplies. _ I have no desire to minimize the difficulties which confront the Government. The right honourable member'for Cowper did not bring this matter forward in a spirit of carping criticism. He analysed the situation in a. capable manner, and offered constructive suggestions.

Mr Holt (Fawkner) [5.27],"Theblind honourable members or the public to the fact that there are grave shortages of certain commodities, and that this is not altogether due to the demands of the fighting services. Problems of distribution 'and production bave been mishandled, not so much by this Minister or that, as by the control bodies which have been set up by tbe Government. I regret that the Ministerf or Supply and Shipping, rather than face the issue raised by the right honorahle member for Cowper, attempted to make the situation appear as favorable as possible by implying that most of the difficulties with which we are confronted had their origin in the obligation which rested upon us to supply foodstuffs to the American troops. In order to innate the Government's achievements in meeting their requirements, he gave figures as to the quantities of beef, veal, potatoes and other commodities supplied in pounds weight! I thought at first that the figures related to monetary pounds. Converting his pounds to tons, what do we find? . In 1939-40, Australia exported 275,000 tons of meat, but. last year, we exported only 100,000 tons, and supplied 15,000 tons to the American troops. Minister for Supply and Shipping are in correct, because I have merely converted the pounds mentioned by h i m into tons. Every housewife knows that canned fruits are now unobtainable. I understand that fi vp-sixths of the total production is made available to the fighting forces. We do not cavil at the needs of the services, but, when we are told that tliat is an answer In the production problem, we reply that, at the time when Australia was able to export canned fruits it sent overseas 1.200,000 cases in a year. Of that quantity the Minister has accounted for only '.1S0,000 cases. The subject of primary foodstuffs has been amply covered by previous speakers. Irrespective of the demands of tbe services or our allies few people anticipated that such commodities as eggs, bacon, canned fruits, potatoes, tomatoes,oranges, lemons and dried fruits would be in short supply, and in effect unobtainable in the quantities required by the great mass of the people. Government to say that these commodities are being supplied to the fighting services. tendered as indicating the total quantities supplied to the services cannot by any means represent the total peace-time production of those commodities. We have been told that the Australian Pood Council has been established to coordinate the food-producing activities of this country, but, as the Minister pointed out, the chief executive officer of that body is apparently the .Director-General of Agriculture. Much more than agriculture is involved in the production of foodstuffs for the community, as a large proportion of the food consumed by the peopl'j in tbe cities is manufactured. While the Government contends that the needs of the services must be supplied, without recognizing that due regard must be paid to the general supply position and the need'; of the civilian population, the present chaotic and unbalanced condition of affairs will continue. The proposal, submitted by the right honourable member for Cowper in favour of the appointment of a kind of dictator of food distribution i i a sound and sensible one. We have all admired Great, Britain, which has been essentially an importing country, for tbe If so, the figures of the manner in which the people of a ber Ieaguered island have overcome their food difficulties by means of a prudent system of control. is decrying his own country. great an admiration a? anybody else for Australians, and I consider that as GreatB r it a in has been able to produce a capable food controller, Australia can and should do likewise. right, honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) has compared the food problem of Great Britain with that confronting Australia to-day. Let me quote the following story, written by an eminent authority, on the position in Britain at the outbreak of the war:Every day of the year sin nvcra<ic of 4.1 British shifts are steaming between Australia and Ceylon, 13 between Singapore and Ceylon, 22 between Singapore and Hong Kong, and 49",36,Earle Page I T Was Really A Supply And Shipping Commerce And

In the holds of those vessels is contained a good slice of the 50,000 tons of foodstuffs and 120,000 tons of merchandise which must be imported into Great Britain every 24 hours. Those ocean routes -ire tlie very life-blood of the British people. despite what the Minister has said, there "" If our sea communications are c u t "" , Sir Samuel Hoave has declared, "" we have a supply of raw material that will last our industries for only three months, but that supply would be inure than we should need, for within six. weeks we should be dead by starvation"". Clearly those thousands of sua miles linking Australasia and the Pacific with London river form a British interest vital enough to justify all the fortress guns and bombing squadrons recently shipped east. I now remind honourable members of the position in Australia at the outbreak of war. At every railway siding throughout this country huge parcels of wheat were being eaten by weevils and rats. The production of apples and pears totalled 11,000,000 bushels, of which tbe people of Australia were able to consume only 6,000,000 bushels. The then Minister for Commerce dealt with the problem 'by ordering tbe destruction of 5,000,000 bushels of that fruit. The conditions appertaining to meat were similar to those with regard to wheat and fruit. Sheep couid be bought in country saleyards at 5d. each. Various primary products were left, lying in the paddocks, not because the labour or machinery required to place it in consumption were not available, but because up to that time, when anti-Labour governments had been in power for over twenty years, efficientorganization had not been evolved. For a considerable part of that time, the right honourable member for Cowper had been Minister for Commerce. Is it surprising that the Government and its supporters view with suspicion the proposal now submitted by him? We know that there are some shortcomings in the present organization but the right honourable gentleman has not told the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture anything that' he did not already know. The motion before the House could have come more appropriately from any other member Order 257B. than the right honourable member for Cowper. agree with the motion, ancl am astounded at the attitude which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has adopted towards it. I am convinced that it would be of great advantage to have one person in control of the production and supply of foodstuffs, because, is still much disorganization in this sphere. Only within the last few weeks, more than 1,000 tons of potatoes was sent from Western Australia to the other States, but because of poor organization they lay at railway sidings for eight or nine days and finally had to be dumped. Growers of vegetables in Western Australia were urged to grow more beans, beetroot, carrots and other vegetables, and arrangements were made for them to be processed at a factory at Gosnells, in that State, which had ample supplies of tinned plate for the purpose and machinery for making the tins. The can factory was in charge of a man who thoroughly understood the process of making and sealing the tins, but he was called up by the Army. After a tremendous fight, he was released by the Army authorities for a month, after which he was called r up again. Later he was released for a further short rjeriod. Now he is in a camp for the third time, while his canning plant is idle, and the country is going without the vegetables which he could have preserved. Such instances emphasize the urgent necessity for one man to have complete control of the production and distribution of foodstuffs. I believe that the Minister for Supply and Shipping( Mr Beasley) is capable of handling the problem. He is the only Minister from whom I can get a prompt ancl satisfactory reply whenever I make representations in relation to any difficult problem. Tin til some one person is given complete authority over foodstuffs there will continue to be waste and chaos. Many valuable suggestions have been advanced during the debate, and I hope that they will be heeded. Debate interrupted under Standing PfTX'EDENCH .

143,Mr Marwick (Swan) [5.41],"IINCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1943. Debate resumed from the 18th February (vide page 905), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read >i second time. This bill is another reminder that wars cannot be won by cheers or wishful thinking, and that heavy and burdensome sacrifices must continue to be made by the people of Australia. The burden may be even heavier still before final victory is achieved. Whilst the financial sacrifices are so great that more than one-half of the national income is being devoted to war purposes, they are as nothing compared with the loss of life and suffering of the men of the fighting services, and the sorrow ancl anguish which war causes to those nearest and dearest to our gallant men. [Quorum formed.] The task of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) in this time of crisis is not easy. It requires much detailed consideration of all aspects of the complex problem of distributing equitably the tax burden over all sections of the community. Although no one realizes more than I do the difficulties which confront the Treasurer in submitting a bill of this sort, there are certain aspects of this legislation about which I am not happy. In the first place, it places upon the shoulders of the lower-paid workers a large share of the burden of direct taxation. That taxation has been imposed for two reasons: first, in order that a scheme of true story. social security may be inaugurated and, secondly, in order to help the war effort. The Treasurer told us that from this find it. The honourable gentleman can tell form of tax it was expected to raise another story if he likes to do so, but £40j000,000, of which £S,000,000 would nothing can controvert the facts that I be obtained before the end of the present have presented. financial year. The Treasurer proposes, for the first time in our experience, that by 70 per cent, the income tax of a man instalments over and above the 'amount who is already paying ISs. 6d. in the £1 ? required to discbarge each taxpayer's liability for income tax will be funded; ister suggest, that such a man's income that interest at the rare of 2 per cent, tax is being increased ? The Treasurer per annum w ill be paid on that amount, said that, it was proposed to levy income so long as it remains funded; and that tax ranging from 6d. to ISs. 6d. in the the money will be available for the pay£1, but the fact, is that men in the top ment of income tax in subsequent years. ranges of income are already paying I should like to know why it has been l.Hf. 6d. in the £.1. decided to pay interest at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum. I imagine that that rate has been Ghosen because it is the rate paid on the deposits placed with the Commonwealth and States savings banks, but as interest at the rate of 3 per cent, is paid on war loans, I am of the opinion that either the rate of interest payable on funded sums under this legislation should be raised to 3 per cent, or the interest payable on war loans should be reduced to 2 per cent. The Treasurer has given us a good argument in favour of lower ""interest rates, .and, to that degree, there is some benefit in the legislation. In a statement which accompanied this bill, the Treasurer set out. at very great length and with much diligence a comparison between the proposed income tax for 1943-44 and the income tax for 1942-43. Glancing at the comparative table, I find some anomalies. For instance, a married taxpayer with one child, on an income of £300 per annum, will have his tax increased from £13 2s. to £22 18s., au increase of 70 per cent. A taxpayer in the same category with an income of £500 per annum will have his tax increased by only 60 per cent., ancl one on £1,500 per annum will have his income tax increased by enly 25 per cent. It is the same with married taxpayers who have two children. It seems to be regrettable, therefore, that in legislation introduced by a Labour Treasurer we should find that tlie rate of increase on small incomes is much greater than it is on the higher incomes..",38,Chjixky Agreed To

148,Mr Calwell,"W h y does the Minthe £ 1 . my view of the system of income tax is different from that of the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini). If the honourable gentleman is in a mood to offer opinions, I ask h i m to say why another and a better system of income tax should not be adopted, a system of imposing such tax as would ensure that no one in the community should have more than £400 per annum in this time of crisis. It would be possible, by levying such an income tax, to raise more than the Treassurer hopes to raise by means of the present proposal; the honourable member. with the personal effect. As we have adopted a system of conscription of men for overseas service, I see no reason why the House should baulk at a system of taxation which would amount to conscription of wealth. I also see no reason why we ought to continue in the present crisis a system of income tax which sufficed in peace-time, particularly as the people on lower incomes arc now burdened with rising costs of living and a scarcity of commodities. Tbe adjournment motion of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) was designed to draw the attention of the House to the difficulties people have in obtaining food. I know just how real the problem is in industrial constituencies, but, great as that problem is, tbe problem of making the best use of the wages the workers receive is even greater. Consider the price of commodities-orange s at 6d. each and apples at. 3-Jd. each! mean that the workers on small income.* to be asked to pay tax at the rate of 6d. can purchase very few oranges, apples or in the £ 1 .

They argue rather jubilantly that boys and girls in receipt of big wages w ill now be forced to pay something towards the financing of the war effort. However, it must be remembered that many people, now in the evening of their I am not concerned lives, are trying to live on £2 a week which they receive either by way of interest on investments, or as payments under superannuation schemes, or by way of annuities, towards which they contributed when they w ere in employment.

I have received many complaints from persons who have retired from governmental and semi-governmental employment, or from offices which operate superannuation schemes, that the amount they receive to-day is altogether insufficient to enable them to live.

158,Mr Calwell,"Yes, the value ofTreasurer will amend the bill to ensure that no additional hardship shall be placed upon these old people. Much more can be said in support of the principle of a ceiling income to which I referred, earlier. tbe proposal which I have previously enunciated in this respect will not evoke enthusiasm in this chamber or among many people outside, I cannot see anything wrong with it, at least for the duration of the war. When we are demanding that those males who were born between certain years shall be prepared to sacrifice their lives, if necessary, in order respect to reports of administrative waste that we may live in comfort and safety while the war is on and after it concludes, then those who possess wealth which will not be worth anything to them should the Japanese capture this country, should be prepared to surrender all of their wealth except sufficient to enable them to purchase the bare necessaries. The ceiling income scheme seems to approximate more nearly than any other proposal I have yet heard to the ideal of equality of sacrifice. In the debate on the Loan Bill last week I drew attention to the burden of direct and indirect taxes on persons on low incomes. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has now returned to the chamber because he seemed to doubt my claim that indirect taxes bear very heavily upon persons with small incomes. On that occasion I cited estimates on tbe authority of a group of Melbourne students of economic affairs who are not on the pay-roll of this or any other Government, and therefore can be accepted as absolutely impartial. mated that direct and indirect taxes on an income of £6 under these proposals amounted to £1 15s. a week in the case of a man with no dependants, £1 lis. a week ii: the ca3e of a man with a wife, £1 63. a week in tbe ease of a man with a wife and one child, and £1 os. a week in the case of a man with a wife and two children. Erom those figures it will be seen that a single man will be in a very much better position than a man with a. wife and one child, whilst a man with a wife and two children will be only Is. a week better off than a man with a wife and one child. The larger the family, the greater the Mr Calwell. benefits it should receive in respect of exemption from tax. Under these proposals, however, in conjunction with indirect taxes, a man with a wife and two children does not receive any great Although benefit. He will be obliged to pay £1 5s. a woek out of an income 01 £6 a week, whercr.5 a single man will pay only 10s. more. I should like to see the difference between those classes of taxpayers increased to the benefit of the man with the most dependants. I also said in the course of the debate on the Loan Bill that much resentment existed among the public with and inefficiency, and that people would pay their taxes much more readily and with less grumbling if they were assured that waste ancl inefficiency were reduced to a minimum. This would be so particularly if they were convinced that some people were not enjoying big incomes in a time of war, and, many others were not deriving big incomes directly as the result, of war expenditure. In the latter connection, I shall refer to certain recent happenings with respect to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. As honourable members will remember, that company was given a monopoly of the manufacture of motor cars by the Menzies Government, and that action was responsible for that Government's loss of the Corio seat in a. by-election. I have no intention to discuss the lease of a racehorse by the managing director of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited to the then Minister for Trade and Customs, who signed the agreement on behalf of that Government; but it is a They estifact that the public at that time learned much about Australian Consolidated Industries Limited and the friendships between monopolistic interests and the Menzies Government. A little later Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was declared for profiteering. After tbe outbreak of the war tbe managing director of the company was appointed Director of Gun Ammunition Production, in which capacity be served under both the last Government and this Government. He has since resigned. In my view, lie should have resigned long before. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein) brought to the notice of the House certain matters relative to the manufacture of horsefloats by the company, at a time when it was supposed to he engaged on war work. little patient with me, Mr Speaker, you will realize that, as a lawyer in a case, I am working round to the main point. In fact, I had just reached it when you called me to order. As a result of the disclosures of the gallant, learned and honourable member for Watson, an investigation of the affairs of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was made by the Joint Committee on War Expenditure. An officer of the committee examined cerlain records of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited and subsequently the company refunded to the nation an amount of £48,000 of excess profits. 1 submit, therefore, Mr Speaker, that I am entitled to discuss the subject. The people of Australia would bo very much happier if they could be relieved of the activities of the "" Knock-out Smiths"" and other people who make excess profits which they subsequently have to refund. There is a feeling in the community that all the. excess profits that have been made have not yet been refunded, and that, in fact, some will never be refunded, because they will never be discovered. The Parliament owes a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Watson for having brought, the subject under notice, even though it was done in a somewhat oblique fashion. The managing director of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was doing certain war work for which he was provided with certain labour. personalities is remote from the provisions of the bill, and is not in order. beinir made by this company ber must not proceed along these lines. Mr Speaker, that you rule that I shall not he in order in discussing excess war profits under this bill? ber may discuss excess war profits, but he may not indulge in a personal attack, based on happenings of some years ago. that stage, for I have reached the point in my story at which Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was compelled to refund £4S,000 in excess profits. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. other matters to which I have referred that cause discontent in the minds of the people, and make them doubtful of the necessity for increased taxation, is the fact that many individuals in the community evade the payment of taxes. In the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation, which was tabled in this House recently, were some figures relating to companies which have evaded taxation over a period of years. One of these is Australian Consolidated! Industries Limited, which has evaded taxation to the amount of £330,S19. The average worker wonders why there is immunity from prosecution for a company such as that, whilst others on much smaller incomes would be gaoled for lesser offences and be branded a3 "" black marketeers "". If the Government wishes the people to accept, the increasing burdens rendered necessary by the impact of war something more drastic than has been done will have to be done with regard to the big companies which flagrantly evade taxation. Not only did Australian Consolidated Industries Limited evade its income taxation to the amount of £330,819, but the managing director, according to press reports, attempted to evade personal responsibility by transferring shares to his children. Those shares, in the opinion of Mr Justice MeTieman, who heard the action brought against him by the Commonwealth, were really his own property. It seems extraordinary how gently Mr W. J. Smith has been treated, whilst other people have been subjected to rigorous prosecution, and have incurred heavy penalties for acts which could be called anti-social, and are contrary to this country's desire that the war should be conducted with earnestness and even enthusiasm by every body, with nobody seeking to evade his just contributions to' the Treasury. There are other matters to which I could refer, in order to indicate that",40,Chifley

In disclosures at an inquiry recently held into the affairs of Australian Iron and Steel Limited at Port Kembla, which is a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, it was .admitted that officials of that company, such as managers and directors, had had repairs done to their private cars by defence, workers employed by ths company, ancl that the cost of the repairs had been charged to defence contracts and passed on to the Government No action was taken against those guilty of that conduct, although, if ever action was justified, it should have been taken against those who would misuse their power at such a time of crisis as this. Such frauds and the failure to punish the perpetrators make the workers restless and undermine public morale. People wonder whether the monopolies are above the law. The best way to make the worker? accept increased taxation is to nationalize all monopolies. They could 'be nationalized before they become allpowerful, ancl pave the way for maybe another ""sell-out"", or some subversive movement which would tend to overthrow governments. The Production Bulletin dealing with production in secondary industries during 1940-41 contains some interesting figures regarding the amount which workers receive as wages and salaries out of the total sum representing the value of the output, of Australia's secondary industries. In 1930-31 the wages and salaries received amounted to 21.48 per cent, of the value of output of Australian secondary industries, whilst in 3939-40 the amount paid in wages and salaries amounted to 20.70 per cent, of the value of output. The margin of profit and miscellaneous expenses represented 19.21 per cent, in 1930-31 and 19.30 per cent, in 1939-40, which indicates that, the workers are receiving less money from industry than formerly. Therefore, all the talk on the part of honourable members opposite about high salaries and wages is exposed as fallacious. The workers are not getting more money, and therefore they are not ju a better position to bear increased Mr Ctilwell. taxation, but this bill sets out to make them pay heavier taxes. It is true that £30,000,000 of the £40,000,000 proposed to be raised is to be paid into a Commonwealth welfare fund to finance certain social benefits. sarily £30,000,000; probably the amount will be much less. because it was the figure mentioned by the Treasurer. When we enter the postwar world, and prices drop, the amount raised may well be considerably less than £30,000,000. I object to this proposal to pay such a large sum into a Commonwealth welfare fund, because for the first time in Australia's history the workers are to be asked to pay for their own social benefits. one reason, but there is another. ' This has never been done before. Invalid and old-age pensions were paid for out of excise and other revenues up to 1914, when tbe Commonwealth invaded the field of income taxation. After that they were paid for by the people in receipt of the larger incomes. paid for out of general revenue. out of revenue which was raised at that time by indirect taxation. After 1914. invalid and old-age pensions were paid for from revenue raised by indirect taxation and by means of increased taxes on persons having the larger incomes. The maternity allowance was also paid for without recourse to the system now proposed. A previous government introduced a scheme of child endowment which it financed by means of a pay-roll tax. It did not invade the field of the lower wages in order to raise the funds for that purpose. Therefore, the present proposal of the Treasurer seeks to establish a precedent, as far as the Labour party is concerned. The Lyons Government proposed a. scheme of national insurance which the Labour party fiercely resisted; but, although legislation was enacted to put that scheme into operation, effect has never been given to it.

173,Mr Calwell,"They were paid for.Labour party objected to the scheme of national insurance, because basically it provided that the worker should pay for I113 own old-age pension. The Labour party does not stand for that. It believes that the workers are entitled, to a .certain basic wage, which is sufficient to enable t'hem to maintain life and have a reasonable standard of comfort.; but, in addition it wants benefits in the way of social services which are paid for out of the national income. It certainly does not -desire that the money should be contributed by workers in receipt of the basic wage or about that amount. It has been said from time to time that the workers should not agitate for an increased basic wage, but should seek improved conditions and ask for greater social benefits because these things have a real cash value. There is something in that argument. I have always hoped that the worker will .receive, not only that basic wage, but many other benefits such as health insurance and the old-age and invalid pensions benefits, without the Government having recourse .to the imposition of a tax on his wages. Under this scheme, however, the basic wage is not sacrosanct, but is to be taxed in order to provide social benefits. I have already shown that the workers were receiving less in 1939-40 in wages and salaries out of the total value of output of secondary industries than in 1930-31. Conversely, those who were managing businesses for profit were, taking an increased sum out of secondary industries in 1939-40 as compared with what they took in 1930-31. I it is the last normal year of employment. Therefore, the present proposal is a sugar-coated pill. It says to the worker, "" You can have certain increased social benefits, but you will drawn upon national credit to the extent have to pay a portion of the cost"". A number of other provisions which have not. been included in the scheme might have been embodied in it. Of the £40,000,000 proposed to be raised by means of increased taxes, £30,000,000 is for the payment of social benefits and £10,000,000 is to be used for war purposes. If honourable gentlemen opposite ever take control of the destinies of this country I fear that they wild .u3e this precedent for maintaining increased taxation on the lower incomes, and will embody the whole of our social legislation in one scheme, making it all contributory., so that the worker will pay for his own old-age pension and other benefits out of his basic wage-a basic wage w hich isT regarded by the Arbitration Court as only sufficient to enable a man and his dependants to live in reasonable comfort. [Extension of time granted.] Honourable members opposite have mentioned inflation, and we have been given to understand that an amendment will be moved which has for its object the introduction of a system of post-war credits. The honourable member for Robertson argued in favour of post-war credits, and once more dragged in, like King Charles' head, the danger of inflation. I remind honourable members that there cannot be inflation in Australia whilst, in the first place, the system of price control continues in operation. In the second place, goods are rationed, so that there cannot be that competition which leads to inflation. Mr .FADDEN -Some goods are rationed. been adopted, and eventually more and more goods will be rationed. Wages are pegged, prices are fixed, rents are fixed, and taxation, already heavy and steeply graded, will be heavier still when this legislation is passed. Investments are rigidly controlled, and the use of man-power and woman-power chose the year 1939-40 because is strictly regulated. Therefore, it seems to be absolutely impossible for inflationary tendencies to develop. Members of the Opposition have argued that, because the Government has temporarily of several hundred million pounds, the financial edifice is about to collapse, but they have been saying things like that ever since 1931. They warned us about inflation when Australia was being pushed into deflation. In the very depths of the depression they were still worrying themselves and Australia about inflation. They have always failed to recognize that both deflation and inflation can be cumulative in their ill effects, and can both",43,Chifley

It is pretty tough that such salaries should be paid while pensioners receiving £2 a week are taxed to pay the cost of government. Salaries of that kind seem to indicate that typists associated with three members of thp Advisory War Council, the right -honourable member for ( Mr Menzies), the honourable member for Warringah Mr Calwell. asked in this House the following questions :1.

175,"Orable Member F O R I N D I ( Mr Mcewen),","private secretaries were increased by £3 a week with a new maximum salary of £650 as I have indicated. Occurrences of that kind do not encourage the workers to accept increased financial burdens. It is the duty of Parliament to endeavour to prevent the cost of government increasing unnecessarily, and we should see that whatever money is raised is spent with reasonable care and caution. Leader of the Opposition) [8.25] I congratulate the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) on the speech he delivered on this bill. With his expert knowledge of the subject under discussion, he gave the House a clear analysis of the Government's taxation proposals, as outlined in the measure. Then, to use the words of one Sydney newspaper, he "" tore the tax bill apart"". As the honourable member pointed out, the principal features of the bill involve matters of policy which only the Government itself can determine. The present Government, having resolutely set its face against sharing the task of administering the affairs of the nation with the other partie 0 in this House, must accept the whole of the responsibility for formulating a policy for financing the war. Members of the present Government, when in opposition, rejected my Government's plan for financing the war. Since the defeat of my Ministry, the Opposition has persisted in its demand that the present Government should adopt a realistic approach to the problem of war-time finance, but it has refused to take action along the lines we have suggested. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the Government-and the Government alone-shoul d carry out the task of framing a war-time financial plan. The Opposition fully recognizes that the Government must have all the money it requires for the defence of the Commonwealth and the effective prosecution of the war, in association with our Allies. The latest proposal which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has outlined reveals that, the Government has again failed to make a proper approach to this all-important matter of war-time finance. There is evidence of timidity on the part of the Government in (planning to raise the finance necessary to meet the constantly increasing costs of war. As I intend, when resuming the debate on the Treasurer's financial statement, to examine the Government's financial policy in detail, I do not propose at this juncture to deal with its main principles. It is, however, only fair, because the measures are interlocked, that I should emphasize that the Government's national welfare scheme is nothing more than political window dressing. The reason underlying this is only too apparent. The Government, for the first time, is making some attempt to obtain some of its finance from those in the lower income groups. That section of the community includes a great many who normally support the Labour party, and it is unworthy of a war-time government to adopt subterfuge to appease those in the lower income groups, and to disguise its real intentions. This attempt at appeasement has taken the form of a nebulous social services scheme. The Government promises tbe worker social services which will not come into being until the dim and distant future. By means of this artifice, it hopes to retain the votes of the lower wage earners, who, for the first time, it proposes to tax. Despite some hostility from trade unions, the Treasurer has at last realized the necessity to spread the burden of war-time taxation so that all classes of the community will be called upon to assist in financing the war effort. The principle of spreading the taxation burden over all ranges of income was adopted in the budget which I presented to this House nearly seventeen months ago, and was rejected by the Labour party. At that time, the bulk of taxable income in Australia was earned by those in receipt of incomes of under £400 per annum. Yet, compared with other sections of the community, that class was either relatively lightly taxed or paid no income tax whatsoever. My 'budget contemplated a combination tax and loan which would embrace the lower ranges of income for the first time, for a threefold purpose-(1 ) to provide additional revenue for war purposes; (2) to spread the burden of war costs more equitably;",45,Chifley
176,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"and (3) to reduce the danger of inflation. This was termed a national contribution, and the rate of contribution was to rise to 18s. in ^he £1. The present Treasurer has, seventeen months too late, realized the soundness of the proposals which were contemplated by me. He finds that war expenditure has been, and will be, a great deal more than he contemplated; in fact, the amount of finance necessary to wage the war in an efficient manner for the current financial year was under-estimated by £90,000,000. The gap of £300,000,000 which the Treasurer envisaged in his budget speech last year has increased to £390,000,000. To the degree that the gap is not filled by revenue, the bulk of which is derived from taxation, reliance must be placed upon loans and bank credit. Heavy loan raisings have already been made, and further loans are contemplated in the near future. This measure may mean that a slightly bigger proportion of war expenditure will be paid out of revenue instead of relying upon bank credit, although this improvement will be nullified unless the Treasurer shows more determination with the loan, raisings. The perils of inflation have been pointed out many times to the Government, ancl any measure brought before the House which tends to curb the undue use of bank credit is welcomed. Although the theory of taxing all ranges of income according to capacity to pay is sound policy, the methods of implementing the Treasurer's proposals are clumsy, unscientific and grossly unjust. introduction of taxation payments by instalments on the 1st January, 1941, by the present Opposition, during my period as Treasurer, has been of great advantage to wage-earners. Instalments were deducted throughout a period of 40 weeks in each year, or until the tax was paid, when a certificate of exemption wus granted. Any excess payments of tax were refunded to the taxpayer. The Treasurer now states that, "" the Government proposes to spread the deductions over the whole of the 52 weeks of the yt'.ar. instead of requiring the tax to be met in a period of 40 weeks "". He goes so far as to claim that ""the spread of Mr Fadden. deductions over this longer period will tend to ease the burden "". The Treasurer conveniently overlooks the fact that as well as paying 52 instalments, instead of 40, the taxpayer will be called upon to pay an increased amount each week. Furthermore, any surplus payment of tax will not be refunded to the taxpayer. For the first time in Australian taxation history, income taxation will be compulsorily payable in advance by wage and salary earners only, for the Treasurer states that "" to assist in the payment of tax it is proposed that employees shall build up credits by using .any excess instalment, deductions made during the war period "". It is true that "" a certificate of credit will be issued to any taxpayer whose excess instalments are held by the Commissioner of Taxes"". In creased instalments are to operate as from the 1st April, 1943, five or six weeks before a great many taxpayers have discharged their current taxation liability. In other words, whilst taxation will not be increased technically during this financial year, an extra £8,000,000 of revenue will be obtained through greatly increased instalments of taxation compulsorily paid in advance, which, by means of a book entry, are technically applied to taxation payable in a subsequent, year. The surplus is to be held by the Commissioner to be applied to the payment of subsequent taxation, and a non-assignable "" certificate of credit,"" is given to the unfortunate taxpayer. This certificate will be merely a form of receipt for taxation paid in advance. The The taxpayer will never receive any of the money which it represents. It is not even an IOU . This is a clumsy expedient to save the face of the Government because of its unwillingness to recognize its mistake in casting aside the post-war credits plan which I endeavoured to introduce. The present arbitrary proposal, with its non-assignable ""certificates of credit"", is poles apart from a scientifically adjusted post-war credit, system. It ignores entirely the principle of capacity to pay, because the advance payments of taxation will not be the same for each individual on the same income and with the same family responsibilities. The advance payments will be determined solely by tbe approximations of tbe instalment scale. Tbe instalments payable under this bill are in most instances a little more than the amounts which would have been taken under my budgetary proposals. My plan was to build up' for the taxpayer a credit representing a certain proportion of his tax, to be retained by the Treasurer during the war, together with interest at the rate of 2 per cent, per annum, and to be repayable to him after the war, when he would most, need it, and when the re-established civil industries would get a much-needed fillip by tlie greater amount of money in circulation. Contrast this with the Treasurer's proposal to give a "" certificate manner. The only justification advanced of credit""a document which merely acknowledges that certain amounts have been paid in advance to meet taxes which may be due sometime in the post-war period. This unfair discrimination is to be made againsfc employees as a class, and individuals comprised in that, class. The bill provides tliat any excess instalments accumulated by a taxpayer on the 31st March will not be retained. That is a. hollow concession, because taxpayers who will have discharged their tax liability after the 1st April in this financial year will receive no refunds and will be compelled to continue their payment of instalments at an increased rate until the end of the financial year, even though no tax is owing by them. At the end of the financial year, instead of obtaining a refund of the excess tax paid, they will get a piece of papera "" certificate of credit "". Even to the lay mind, advance payments of tax and the issue of a ""certificate of credit"" appear, at the very least, to be a dangerous practice to adopt. I submit that the present bill authorizes the Crown to levy and collect a tax before the rate of sueh tax is. determined and imposed by act of Parliament. It will be the province of a post-war Parliament to determine the amount, of post-war income tax payable, if, indeed, income tax is imposed by such Parliament. ' Future liability for payment of tax is conditional on a statute being passed by a subsequent Parliament. This section of the bill is to be condemned, jbecause, first, it mortgages the revenues which should properly be available to a post-war Parliament, and, secondly, because it allows the Crown to have access to revenue from taxation,, the rate, amount and period of operation of which have not been determined by Parliament. This thing of shreds and patches would not have been adopted by the Government were it not that it is driven by the dangerous consequences of its financial policy to concede that the foundations of my proposals of September, 1941, were financially sound. It is making a pretence of reducing the present inflationary trends and increasing revenue, and doing 1 so in a most unfair and discriminatory by the Treasurerfor this iniquitous advance grabbing of employees' wages is that with the termination of the war overtime payments will cease, incomes will' diminish, and employees will find it necessary to pay taxes based on the greater income of the last year of the war. If the Treasurer's real motives are, first, an increase of revenue, and, secondly, a. careful regard for the workers, who will find it difficult to pay post-war taxation, he could achieve those results with much less hardship by combining a post-war credit scheme with a current "" pay-as-you-go "" tax plan. Should this legislation become law, hundreds of thousands of Australians, mostly workers, will pay instalments based on current income, and they will receive no refunds, although their instalmentsexceed their tax liability. It is beside the point to argue that the 1942 income is merely used as a convenient basis on which to assess the payment of tax, because under the present system we are always one year in arrears with our income tax payments. Take the case of a worker who dies on the 30th June, 1943. Throughout the financial year 1942-43, until the date of his death, instalments of tax have been duly deducted from his wages. These instalments will cover only his tax liability to the end of June, 1942. His estate will be liable for the whole of the taxation which will subsequently be assessed on his earnings during the financial year 1942-43. The injustice to taxpayers of being a year behind the year of income should be removed by legislation, providing that the instalments collected as from the 1st July, 1943, would meet the liability for income tax on income earned during the financial year 1943-44. Except for the adjustments mentioned by the honourable In other words, 4s. 4d. per annum inoro wages. member for Robertson, which would be £1 Gs. per annum more tax. necessary in the case of graziers and others who receive the bulk of their income in a lump sum, such a plan should be as simple to implement as daylight saving. Mr Beardsley Ruml, who advocated tbe "" pay-as-you-go "" plan in the United States of America, makes an interesting 4s. 4d. a year more wages; £2 12s. per annum comparison. He saysVV'e need to rind and adopt a plan that automatically shifts taxpayers to a current basis. It would have done little good to argue with employers or employees that in order to save power, every one ought to go to work at eight in the -morning, instead of at nine. The same result in power saving was achieved much more simply by moving all 3 10 1 . . tlie clocks forward an hour, so that we actually go to work at eight, although we nominally still go at nine.

The comparatively high rates of income tax which can be expected have accentuated the problem, which should be solved by an immediate legislative remedy. We do not oppose the raising of the extra revenue, indeed, we sympathize with the Treasurer in his predicament; but we do insist that the taxation shall l>e raised in an equitable manner and in strict accordance with the principle of capacity to pay. We are opposed to the inequitable methods by which the Treasurer proposes to raise additional revenue.

The taxpayer will receive a certificate of over-payment. -Just imagine a man with an income of £1,250 per annum being allowed only £45 for concessional deductions! Why, a ma.u earning that salary would pay at least, £100 a year in insurance premiums. That shows that the whole scheme is out of focus. The scale is unscientific, unreal and inequitable. A married man on £4 16s. 2d. a week will pay only 2s. a year, by instalments, less than his tax liability. should be left with more than 2s. a year to cover his concessional allowances! On the one hand, a man on £1.1 10s. 9d. with dependent wife and child will have to pay by instalments 12s. a year more than his tax liability. On the other hand, a man on £15 7s. Sd. a week will be expected to pay £20 2s. a year less than his tax liability. In no case, let me repeat, will there be refunds to adjust these absurd anomalies. There is neither rhyme nor rea-on in the fact that a man who has more than the low average allowed for medical and other expenses should have to make a greater advance payment of taxation when another, who has only the average, does not. The effect, on taxpayers who have heavy insurance commitments is likely to be serious. It is possible that many will have to surrender policies, the premiums on which are proving an invaluable source of loan finance, because they are invested by the life assurance companies in the war loans. As the tax concession they obtain is several times less than tlie total of their premiums, the withholding of the full rebate due to them is likely to have a multiple effect in reducing vital war saving for the war effort. For the benefit of the House, Mr Fadden. £ posals in an actual case, of which I know. .. . . 4 5 It is the case of a married man with a .. . . 5 0 wife and one child, who earns £675 a .. . . 5 5 year, that is, just under £13 a week. .. 65 As the result of the increased rates, he .. .. . . 7 7 .. 96 will be called upon to pay £59 12s. extra . . 158 a year, by instalments. But, in addition to that, he will have to make an advance payment of taxation, representing tax rebates withheld from him-, of £37 16s. 6d. The instalment scale allows him tax rebates on only £34 of concessional allowances, whereas, in fact, he is entitled to rebates on £155 of concessional allowances, arising from heavy medical expenses, assurance, and rates on his cottage. The fact that this man is compelled to pay nearly as much a year through the withholding of his refund, as through the increase of his tax rate, shows the subterfuge in the present proposals. Actually, he will have to pay £97 8s. 6d. extra a year, not the £59 12s shown in the Treasurer's instalment Surely, in most cases, he tables. Admittedly, the bill provides that, the Commissioner of Taxation may vary instalment deductions "" for the purpose of meeting the special circumstances of any ease or class "". How the Commissioner is to exercise this proposed discretion is all-important; but that is not stated. Apparently, taxpayers will still have to face the indignity of claiming that they are suffering "" serious hardship "" to obtain what is only rightfully due to them. If , on the other hand, the Commissioner is to exercise his power so as to correct all the individual cases of anomalies and injustices, he and his staff will be overwhelmed with unnecessary work at a time when the proper utilization of man-power is of the greatest importance. This can be avoided if refunds are paid at the end of the collection period. The tax proposals are heavily weighted against the family man. The Government has a poor conception of the cost of maintaining a wife and children, or other dependants. Compared with single men earning the same income, married men are left with only the following extra amounts as net wages after paying the proposed taxes. A married man on £6 14s. 7d. a week, or £350 a year, is left with only 8s. Id. a week more than a single man on the same wages, with which to maintain his wife. If he also has a child, he is left with an extra 6s. 2d. a week to maintain the child. A married man on £9 12s. 4d. a week, or £500 a year, is left with 10s. 9d. a week more than a single man on the same salary. If he also has a child he is left with an extra 7s. 9d. a week. A married man on £19 4s. 7d. a week, or £1,000 a year, is left with 13s. 6d. a week more than a single man on the same salary. If lie also has a child he is left with an extra 10s. 4d. a week. A married man on £4 16s. 2d. a week, or £250 a year, is left with only 7s. 4d. a week more that a single man on the same wages, with which to maintain a wife. I.f he has a child he is left w-ith an extra 4s. 3d. a week with which to feed, clothe and educate that child. How this is possible I leave, it to the Treasurer to explain. It is obvious that the schedule is a gross injustice to the family man. It is not unfair to compare the situation of a married man with a. wife and child earning even £9 12s. 4d. a week, or £500 a year, with that of a single person earning £4 16s. 2d. a week, or £250 a year, which is exactly half as much. The latter to-day might not even have reached the age of 2.1. The man on £9 12s. 4d. a week, which to many may seem a large wage, has to provide for a wife and a child. Presumably the concessional allowances on which rebates for dependants .are calculated bear some relation to the cost of maintaining them, although with the rising cost of living they are conservative estimates. Therefore, from the family man's income, £500 per annum, which is tlie equivalent of £9 12s. 4d. a week, we should deduct at least £100 for maintaining his wife and £75 for his child, as well as, say, £75 to cover medical expenses, superannuation, rates, &c, after paying £89 in taxes. That would leave him a balance of £161, or about £3 2s. a week. The young man earning £250. which is £4 16s. 2d. a week, has nobody to support but himself, and after paying his tax of £37, will be left with £213, or about £4 2s. a week, mainly for personal expenditure. When it is considered that the man on £500 per annum is bound to be an older man, a person of greater skill and experience, the injustice of their relative positions is apparent. There can be no doubt which of the two will be able and tempted to indulge in non-essential spending. The Government has paid insufficient attention to the relationship between income and family responsibilities. Thereby it creates all manner of anomalies, places a premium on birth control in a country whose most vital need is more population, unfairly discriminates between classes, and neglects a. field of taxation which could help a lot to close the yawning gap between government expenditure and revenue. The bill deals unfairly with private companies, in a manner which is not readily apparent, as compared with public companies. Undistributed profits of private companies bear taxation at the same rate as that payable by shareholders. Private companies will be compelled to pay substantially increased taxation as the income tax paid by shareholders will be increased by this measure. Public companies will be affected only to the degree that shareholders will pay more tax on that portion of their income received as dividends. This applies with equal force to shareholders in private companies. At present; private companies pa.y considerably more tax than public companies on the same profit, and the bill further accentuates the disability. When the Income Tax Rates Bill is before the HouseI shall give comparisons which will show what the taxpayer would have been called upon to pay under my national contribution scheme, and what he will be called upon to pay under the present proposals. These figures will demonstrate the hollowness of the protests of Labour members of this Parliament when the national contribution insurance, scheme was proposed in October, 1941, and their insincerity while insisting upon safeguarding the interests of the wage earners. To-day, members of the Labour party, in control of the Government, propose to impose taxes, in many instances, approximating that proposed under the national contributions scheme, upon those for whom their hearts bled when my budgetary proposals were announced. The proposals which the Government has outlined for financing the war fall far short of what one would expect from an administration that has had almost seventeen months in which to evolve a sound financial policy. The Government has been forced to admit that, even taking into consideration the success of the recent Austerity Loan, its adherence to the voluntary principle in the financial field has produced nothing but disappointment. Notwithstanding the mass of controls it has introduced, the Government finds that a great body of the Australian people still indulge in spending in a way which in no way benefits tbe war effort. In this bill, it has made some attempt to put a brake on spending on non-essential goods. It has invaded the field of the lower wage-earners, but has shown that it lacks the courage to introduce into its financial policy that principle of conscription which, after so many years, it has now introduced into its defence policy. The Government should not shirk the issue. This is every body's war and every body must bear his or her reasonable share of the cost of the conflict. The Government has gone a little way along the road towards bringing home to the people of this country a realization that each and every one must make some contribution to the common pool of war-time finance. It has, however, failed to go about it in a way which would leave no cause for complaint. The bill reeks of injustice and bristles with .anomalies which will serve to accentuate still further the present exceedingly complex system of taxation. I move That all the words after "" b ill "" be l e ft out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:""be withdrawn and re-dra,fted either by itself or in conjunction with the Income Tax Bill to provide that(1) the anomalies and injustices inherent in the bills be rectified, inter alia, the arbitrary and unfair discrimination against the taxpayer with family responsibilities, employees as a class, and individuals comprised in this class; (-2) as from the 1st July, 1943, all instalments and assessments on income from salaries ancl wages should be based upon current earnings for the year of tax, which in the first year would he 1943-44, with an adjustment at"" the end of each year of tax. and cash refunds to taxpayers who have paid more by instalments than is legally assessable; Mr Fadden.

As a matter of fact, the ' instalment plan of paying tax was introduced by the right honourable gentleman himself, when he was Treasurer. He provided for the collection of tax from wage-earners by instalments payable as early as eight or nine months before taxpayers in the other classes he mentioned were called upon to pay their taxes. suggested that that should be adjusted. an anomaly that wage-earners are called upon to pay tax before professional or business men, it is most extraordinary that from November, 1940, up to the date the right honourable gentleman relinquished his office as Treasurer, he did nothing about it.

206,Mr Chifley,"I think that thefor he runs fast and often. Let us consider the position of the taxpayer who makes excess payments, keeping in our mind this notable performer, post-war credits. The Leader of the Opposition has complained that under the Government's plan excess tax payments will be held against taxes payable in the following year. That is perfectly true. But the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition provides that certain proposed postwar credits shall be held by the Govern"" ment for three years after the war. Incidentally, it is interesting to discover go"". that, at last, the Opposition is prepared to name a time when these post-war credits will be repayable. A stated period for repayment appears for the first time in this amendment. The right honourable gentleman appears to be solicitous about the small excess payments that taxpayers may make under the Government's instalment plan, but he is not at all concerned about the suggestion that post-war credits shall be held for three years after the war. I am quite satisfied that, with the new steps, regular income earners will pay very little excess taxation; but, under the post-war credit system advocated by the Leader of the Opposition, a proportion of the taxpayer's money would be kept for three years after the war and it would carry only 2 per cent, interest. would keep the money altogether. ing two points, whether intentionally come. The effect of this would be to I do not know. There is a difference make the year of income used as a basis between cash credit and post-war credit. the difference. Many people wbo bave come into industry in this country may assessment made. go out of it immediately after the war. post-war credit scheme. circumstances many people find themare in receipt of high incomes.

After the war these people will immediately leave their employment and return to their homes. If the Government does not make some deductions from their income during the year in which the income is received, many of these people will have a substantial tax bill to meet at the conclusion of the war when they have returned to their homes and may have no means of discharging tbe debt due in tax. in favour of the principle of "" pay-as-youpoint later. The tax owing by married women who are now receiving high wages may have to be paid after the war by their husbands or by others responsible for them unless a proposal such as that now submitted in the bill be adopted. Under the present proposal there will be a sufficient sum to the credit of these persons to meet the tax due. The honourable member for Robertson contends that the principle of "" pay-asyou-go "" should be adopted, but that system might provide an opportunity for the evasion of just dues. The honourable member said that that system was applied in part in the United States of America, and I am willing to examine it. Mr Beardsley Ruml, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of New York, was at least Government honest, when he propounded his plan for "" pay-as-you-go"" taxation. He suggested that the basis of assessment should of taxation coincide with the year in which the tax was paid. can see things as they are.

Some honourable members seem to be under a wrong impression regarding the year of taxation. I draw attention to an extract from Mansard, volume 78, page 5S54. When the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) introduced the first Income Tax Bill on the ISth August, 1915, the following observations were made:Mr GI.YNX -The honourable member does not propose to take the returns of last year for tlie calculation of the incomes of this year; In Canada, where the financial year ends lie proposes to tax the income of last year. to say what he will earn during a year not yet completed; but we can ask taxpayers to say what they earned during the calendar your which ended on the 3.1st December last, or during the financial year which ended on the 30th Juno last. We cannot tax the income of the current year during this year. notices, it was said that the tax was levied on the income earned during the year ended the 30th June. Every assessment notice has borne a similar notification. the Opposition proposed the instalment plan he advanced as one of the advantages the argument that it would bring in an early flow of income and would spread the payment of the tax more evenly over the year. That was one of his main arguments in favour of that proposal, but apparently honourable members opposite are not so sure as to its virtue now. I shall refer briefly to the systems in operation in other countries. In Canada the tax on the incomes of wage-earners is collected on the instalment plan, and the collection begins four months before the end of the year in respect of which the tax is levied. I mention this fact because reference has been made to the system in operation in the United States of America. In that country the taxation year ends on the 31st December, and the returns have to be lodged in the following March, or three months after the completion of the taxation year. When the taxpayer sends in 'his return, he must forward with it one-fourth of the total amount due in tax. The amount payable is assessed by himself. I am glad that the honourable member for Robertson mentioned this system, because it seems to have many excellent features. If the taxpayer is unable to estimate the amount of tax due for that year, he may calculate the payment due on the basis of the tax for the previous year. Although no assessment is received by the taxpayer, he must pay one-fourth of the tax quarterly, and by the time he has received his assessment the whole of the amount due must have been paid. on the 31st December, non-wage-earners are required to lodge their returns by the 30th April in the following year, but payment of the tax must commence on the 15th October in the financial year. Although a taxpayer has not to send in his return till the 30th April, 1943, for income earned during the twelve months ended, tlie 31st, December, 1942, he must begin to pay his income tax in the previous October, panies in Australia with thousand's of pounds on deposit, but they cannot pay the money to the Government because they cannot get assessments. If the American system were in operation here, money would be coming into the Treasury. order. Is this a speech or a duet?

I understand that great difficulty is experienced in regard to adjustments. One relates to the averaging of the incomes of primary producers, which are averaged over . a number of years, but I shall be quite willing to investigate the system. seems to me that small business people and other non-wage-earners would have difficulty in paying their income tax many 7noi)ths before it was due. Their income return is not made until January, but they must start paying in October of the taxation year.

There is this difficulty: Some primary producers and some companies have obtained extension? of time already, and it would probably be regarded as a bard ship to ask them to make advance payments in October of this year. If I had brought forward such a proposal I am sure that it would have met with opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition or the for Robertson said that the Government's honourable member for Bobertson, or any one else, thinks that the Government's social welfare proposals are nebulous, let him disabuse his mind of that belief at once. Of course, the putting of the proposals into effect depends upon the Government remaining in office, but it is a fact that legislation in connection with some of the recommendations of the Joint, Committee on Social Security is already being drafted. available until after the war. -bu t my words have been grossly misrepresentedlegislation in connection with the unemployment benefit, proposals will be brought down as soon as the legal draftsman is able to prepare it.

Some of the other proposals are still the subject of inquiry by a committee of Parliament. They include medical and hospital benefits, and the provision of medicines. Those proIt posals will be brought before Parliament as soon as those who are inquiring into them are able to complete their work and present their reports. The Government does not propose to defer until after the war legislation designed to give the people some measure of economic security, nor do we propose to go to the people at an election without being able to show them that we have taken some definite steps in the direction of achieving the better order about which there has been so much talk.

I cannot ask the Commonwealth Bank to discount treasury-bills to meet those charges, and I do not think that honourable members expect that I should.

The records of Fadden) has moved that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to conform with what he thinks ought to be done. .Some of the points raised can be considered in the committee stages of the bill. The Treasurer bas already indicated what it is proposed to do to remedy anomalies which become apparent as the rate of taxation increases. were inherent in the taxation system from the beginning, but they are brought out more sharply as rates increase. As one method of dealing with the anomalies, it is proposed to substitute gradations of 2s. 6d. for those hitherto applied.

The Government says, for reasons which the Treasurer has stated, that the assessment given to the taxpayer will be based on current conditions. There will come inevitably a time when the earnings of the taxpayer will be substantially less than those upon which his previous year's assessment was based. Thus he will, by his taxation pay-, ments, establish a credit which will be available to meet his debt to the nation. Surely it cannot be regarded as a hardship to require citizens who owe a debt to the nation to discharge that debt. Can it be said that money is being withheld from the taxpayers because machinery has been devised to facilitate the payment of taxes when otherwise there would be insuperable difficulties in the way of their meeting their obligations? nation. may say so, but, as a matter of fact, it is stern realism. apply to every body. taxation bill which has contained anomaof a particular individual has been made distinct from the category in which he is grouped.

It should be understood that the purpose of the deductions is to make sure that the obligations of the taxpayer to the Crown can and will be met. apply to all taxpayers. can be dealt with in committee. It is said that some of the additional taxes should be set aside for post-war credits and that there should be a refund to the taxpayer. In the matter of post-war credits we have to choose between different fundamental principles. The purpose of a part of this additional taxation is to lay the foundation of a better social order-to make it clear not only to our own people but also to the world at large that the Australian nation is resolved that the disparity between rich and poor, the inequalities of the social order, the lack of capacity to produce a contented virile and healthy population-wil l be tackled definitely and immediately. We cannot have a repetition of the spectacle of a nation which, when it ought to have been preparing for war, had not money with which to undertake the task because thousands of its people were compulsorily idle since no man would hire them. At that time private enterprise was depressed, and national enterprise non-existent. At the present time, when the nation is short of many things of value, and would be glad to find an additional labour unit to engage in service for the nation, we look back upon a period when thousands of our people could not find useful employment. The reason was that there was no money; the banks said that they did not have it, and the Government could not, get it because the people did not have the Treasurer has said that the Governit. Consequently, there was what economists describe as a diminished wages fund. This country cannot afford a state of affairs in which any considerable section of the people will suffer unemployment in the years ahead. We cannot afford it, not only from the point of view of national morale and physical fitness, would be jeopardized thereby. It is clear that we must have a better health service, and that such service must commence with the very young; it must relate intimately to maternity and to the health of the mother during the period of her expectation. On top of that, infant health must be treated not only from the medical standpoint but also from the standpoint of combatting diseases which, even if they do not cause mortality, lay tbe foundation of semi-invalidism and reduce the fitness of the people. that the right honourable gentleman is discussing social security rather than the taxation proposals of the Government. point which constitutes a fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government. Instead of making a refund to individual taxpayers of part of the tax which is being imposed under this bill the Government proposes to use tbe proceeds for the purpose of establishing a national fund to promote the welfare of the nation. purpose ? purposes. matter of national welfare? that the refunds contemplated by the right honourable gentleman are approximately the same amount as will be used by the Government for the purpose of laying the foundation of a national welfare fund. money under a compulsory scheme? one which is based on the capacity of the citizen to pay in accordance with the general principles of income tax assessment law. It is for those reasons that ment cannot accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition providing for a re-drafting of this measure.

260,Mr Curtin,"The fairest system isannum is right and proper in existing circumstances. The Government believes also that the progressive rate of the tax by gradations of 2s. Sd. is proper, having regard to existing circumstances. The Government is ako of the opinion that there should be no argument about the taxpayer being unfairly treated in respect of the amount of money that is credited to him; it holds that that money is unquestionably the personal property of the taxpayer and can be used by the taxation authorities only to meet claims that the nation lawfully has against the taxpayer. Any amount in excess of such claims remains the property of the taxpayer. the money into a trust'fund? necessary. Any obligation of the nation will be met out of the Consolidated Revenue fund. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) knows the reasons why certain trust funds have been established. This money does not come within the same category. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) on the very illuminating speeches which they have delivered on the bill before the House. I shall support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, because I believe that it, contains many constructive proposals which, if adopted, would enable the Government to bring before tbe Parliament a better bill than that now under consideration. Perhaps the most, striking feature of this income tax assessment bill, to the political observer at any rate, is the decision of the Government to do what it censured and defeated the Fadden Government for proposing to do, namely, to bring into the taxable field the .lower ranges of income which formerly have been exempt from taxation. It is estimated that at least, two-thirds of Australia's national income is in the hands of people whose earnings are under £400 a year. It seems to me that it was inevitof spending power at a time when frugal able that a huge volume of spending power would be required to provide more than formerly towards the increasing costs of carrying on the war. The present Government has now adopted the same limits of exemption as were proposed by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer seventeen months ago, and on. which his Government was defeated. I think that it can fairly be said that this is another of many instances in which the present Government reaches an unpopular but inescapable decision a year or eighteen months after those opposed to it have arrived at that decision. The next most striking feature of this legislation, in my opinion, is the severity of the tax and the extraordinary anomalies connected with the instalments which have already been alluded to so put strikingly by the Leader of the Opposition. Under the new rates, income tax is expected to yield £132,000,000 from 7,000,000 people-a n average of about £19 from each man, woman and child. The amount is enormously greater for those who actually will pay the tax. When the present Leader of the Opposition, as Prime Minister and Treasurer seventeen months ago, realized that the taxation exemptions had to be lowered lie tried to soften the blow by providing that a proportion of the money to be extracted from taxpayers would be regarded as a compulsory loan, to be repaid after the war. The present Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) not only takes considerably more than was proposed by his predecessor but he takes it for good. A third feature, which is, perhaps, the most unusual of all to be met with in the bill, is the proposal to deduct tax instalments during the last three months of this financial year-fro m the 1st April to the 30th June next. That is a system of payment in advance of next year's tax and before that year's tax becomes due. We have heard a lot about an alleged tax lag-whic h I ' do not, believe exists-bu t here is taxation in advance for one section of the community. I admit that where high wages are ruling the stopping of the practice of taking instalments for three months would release a large volume living should be the rule; but the danger of over-spending could be avoided just as effectively and with more justice by treating these advanced exactions as a postwar credit repayable by instalments. That",60,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

262,Mr Curtin,A trust fund is not,61,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
263,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [10.7].,"would be fairer than to exact taxation before it is due, and after the tax for the current year has been paid. I support the method referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in the fourth paragraph of his amendment. Indeed, I go further, and. urge that half of the increase of the tax after the 1st July next, as proposed in this bill and in the accompanying rates legislation should be a post-war credit. That is to say, I suggest that the whole of the money proposed to be taken in advance from the 1st A p r i l next u n t i l the year and necessary adjustments could be fiid of the financial year should be a post-war credit, and that half of the increase after the 1st July next should :iUo be treated in the same way. Repayments by instalments would be a tremendous help to many workers after the war is over aud war activities have ceased and we are in the difficult transition stage between war employment and normal peace employment. That is a stage which will take more bridging than anyth ing we have previously experienced, because of the tremendous scale of dislocation which will take place. Post-war credits repayable by instalments over a period would be a good way to help many people at that time. The proposal to tax wage and salary earners three months in advance of the beginning of the financial year when the tax becomes due is explained by the Treasurer as necessary in order to overcome the difficulty which must arise when war stops and high overtime rates no longer boost earnings, and when our present system of tax assessment on the previous year's income will cause hardship. There seems to be no good reason why income received in the form of wages and salaries should not pay the current year's tax from the current year's income. That is what in fact takes place-the current year's tax is paid from the current year's income, although on the basis of last year's assessment. It is really paid from the current year's income because of the fact that instalments on the current year's income are taken in order to pay it . Therefore, the position is overcome very largely with the wage or salary earner, although the amount of tax that he has to pay is determined by the amount of income earned in the previous year. of an income tax? and the income year should be the same, instead of the tax year being this year and the income year last year. The Treasurer reminded me of the difficulty that there would be in the case of business men and primary producers, but I think that in their case tlie assessment year could be brought forward to the tax made by way of refunds of overpayments or payment of additional tax as soon as possible after the amount of the income earned was definitely known. I contend that we are paying this year not the tax for last year but for this year, although, for the sake of convenience, the tax is assessed on earnings last year. If the tax year and income year were made one and the same a, lot of problems would be solved and injustice removed. Consider the case of a man who earned a. good income last year, but who, through ill ness or other misfortune, has earned little or no income this year. H is tax is assessed on his earnings last year and, when he is called upon to pay a considerable tax and has no income from which to pay it , he must sell his assets or mortgage his home. That could not happen if the income year and the tax year were the same. Some people have the entirely erroneous idea that if the tax year and income year were brought into line the Government would lose income tax revenue for one year. The Taxation ""Department would collect income tax every year without interruption. The only change would be of the period chosen for assessment. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) suggested as a means of dealing with business people that, when the change was made, for the first year the income of the previous assessment year should be averaged w i th the income of the new assessment year. That would eliminate any danger of unscrupulous taxpayers dodging their liability by placing as much of their income as they could into the year proposed to be dropped. lose the tax paid by the estates of deceased persons.",61,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

266,Mr Jolly,"The Government wouldassessment year and the tax year the same section 217 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals with the tax levied on the earnings of deceased taxpayers in the year of their death, would become a dead letter. It is a blot on our income tax legislation. I commend the final suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that a committee of experts should be set up to try to devise ways and means whereby the tax year could be made the assessment year for all payers of income tax. Reverting to the erroneous impression that to make the income year and tax year the same would involve the Commonwealth Government in the loss of income tax revenue for one year, I direct the attention of the Treasurer to the first Income Tax Act which became law in September, 1915. That act was not retrospective; income taxation began in 1915-16. There was no Commonwealth income tax in 1914-15, although the earnings in 1914-15 were for the sake of convenience, because they were known, used as tbe basis for the assessment of the tax to be paid in respect and the income year the same, section of 1915-16. It follows inevitably that the 217 will die from inanition. Should the income tax that we pay this financial year is the tax due for this financial year, although it is based on the income earned last financial year. When that tax has been paid by a taxpayer he will have completely satisfied the whole of his liability for income tax up to the end of this financial year. therefore that section 217 of the Income Tax Assessment Act that was slipped through this Parliament in 1936 at the suggestion of the Taxation Department is utterly unjust and indefensible. I admit quite frankly that, until I studied the income tax legislation in connection with this measure, I did not know about that section although I was a member of the Ministry at the time that the act was amended. That section is a complete contradiction of the section of the act which sets out with crystal clearness the liability of taxpayers and which shows that when the taxpayer has paid the tax for the particular year in which the tax is levied he has entirely satisfied the claims of the Taxation Department. Section 10 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915 statesSubject to the provisions of this act, income tax shall be levied and paid in and for each financial year upon the taxable income derived directly and indirectly by every taxpayer from sources within Australia during the period of twelve months ending on the thirtieth day of June preceding the financial year in and for which the tax is payable. Tbat makes it abundantly clear that our tax liability for any year ends when we have paid the tax levied in that year on the income of the previous year. It is true that that section was amended in 1936, but the amendment does not affect the principle, because "" year of income "" is defined as meaning the financial year next preceding the year of tax, and "" year of tax"" means the financial year for which income tax is levied. I repeat that the income tax we pay during this financial year is definitely for this year, although assessed on last year's earnings, and I hope that the blot on the income tax legislation contained in section 217 of the act will be erased. Of course, if the House agrees to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition for making the tax year amendment be not accepted, and the House decides to continue with the old method of the payment of tax based on the earnings in the previous year, section 217 should be deleted from the principal act, because it is nothing more or less than an additional .probate duty. Let us It will be seen take the case of a taxpayer who commenced to pay Commonwealth income tax in the year in which it was instituted, namely, the financial year 1915-16, that is, 27 years and eight months ago. Let us assume that that, man paid his tax in that year aud in every year since, and that in May of this year he will have paid his tax for the financial year 1942-43. He will then have paid tax for 28 years in a little less than 28 years. Let us also suppose that he dies before the 30th June next. He will have paid his tax liabilities beyond the date of his death. He will have paid tax in respect of 28 years in less than 28 years, yet section 217 of the principal act provides that out of his estate shall be paid tax in respect of a",62,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
267,Mr Paterson,"If we made thetwenty-ninth year. Thus, the tax levied under that section is nothing more or less than an additional probate duty. Such an imposition is utterly indefensible. If the House agrees to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and the assessment year is brought forward to coincide with the tax year, so that a taxpayer will pay tax on current income, section 217 will automatically become a dead letter. If the House does not agree to that proposal, I shall raise the matter in ^he committee stage, because I regard section 217 as dishonest and indefensible. Having said so much about a provision for which the present Government cannot be held responsible, and for which I am prepared to accept my share of responsibility, because I was a Minister in the Government that enacted it, I note with pleasure that this bill provides that there shall not be any penalty rate on income from property up to £200. That minimum is rather low, but this provision is better than differentiating between income from personal exertion and income from property to the degree that was the case in the past, because £200 earned from property will buy no more than a similar income from personal exertion. A differential rate in respect of income from property, as compared with income from personal exertion, is not justified until such income from property exceeds the basic wage. I am also pleased to note that under the bill some relief is to be given to the taxpayer who supports an incapacitated child over sixteen years of age. That is a very necessary reform, because many people who have children over that age who are unable to earn a living owing to physical defects do not seek to obtain a pension for them. At the same time, those parents feel that it is not right that the exemption which they formerly enjoyed in respect of the child should be taken away after the child reaches sixteen years. I am glad that that anomaly is to be rectified, and I give the Government full credit for that reform. The bill also provides that 20 per cent, of the profits derived from metalliferous mining shall be free of tax. Will that exemption also apply to profits derived from the production of mineral oil? that aspect. vested in the production of oil should be treated on a similar basis, because investments in that field are just as risky as investments in metalliferous mining. In addition, we require oil urgently for war purposes. In conclusion, now that our tax rates have risen to Himalayan heights, I stress the desirability of reforming our income tax system by assessing tax as far as practicable on current income. Many examples have been cited in support of that proposal. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) cited the case of a man who was earning £5,000 a year, and retired on £800. With an income of £800, he will be obliged to pay over £3,500 on account of his income of £5,000 for the previous year. He can pay this tax only by realizing on his assets. Another man who had an income of £800 in the previous year, and now receives an income of £5,000 a year, will be in the happy position of paying tax on only £800. That would be as unjust to the Treasury, for the time being at any rate, as the imposition in the other case is to the taxpayer. The only way by which we can remove such anomalies is by making the tax year and the assessment year the same. It is easy to do so with respect to salaries and wages, and similar incomes, but more difficult with respect to income from business. However, I do not think that the difficulty in regard to the latter class of taxpayer is insuperable. It could be overcome, perhaps, by the taxpayer paying tax on an assessment for the previous year, as is done now, and then, as quickly as possible after the taxpayer ha's sent in bis return for the new financial year, by making an adjustment which would bring him right up to date. I shall have something further to say on that matter in the committee stage. House should congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) and his departmental officers on the masterly way in which they have handled the country's finances since the Government took office.

Oue of the aims is the securing for all of improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security. policy of The Government is convinced that it would be a great mistake to postpone the pursuit banks, of these objectives until after the war.

For that reason the establishment of the proposed national welfare fund is highly commendable.

I believe that they will returnthis Government with a bumper majority at the next general elections. they be misled by the cry of anti-Labour politicians that money is not available for social benefits. Only a few years before the war an anti-Labour government introduced a scheme for national health and pensions insurance which was estimated to cost about £2,000,000 a year. The necessary legislation was passed, and an expenditure of about £1,000,000 was incurred in assisting societies' to give effect to the scheme; but, at that point, the financial authorities informed the government that money could not be found to .carry the plan any further. Yet. this Government is proposing, in the midst of the war, to provide £30,000,000 a year ultimately for social security, and I believe that its scheme will be put into operation even in the unlikely event of it not being returned to office. The Curtin Government has hecn able to find time, in the thick of its war administration, to carry out, to some degree at, least, the social security policy of the Labour party. I am glad that the Treasurer does not intend to leave this important work until the post-war period. There are some people who consider that that should be done, and they are not all in Australia, as the following newspaper extract indicates :POST-WAR WORLD-CRIPPS' S WARNING TO PEOPLE. London, Feb. 7th. "" Signs arc not wanting that privileged, selfish interests are busily preparing to cast which many statements have been pubthe future in tlie mould of the past,"" said the Minister for Aircraft Production. Sir Stafford Cripps, on Saturday. Certain interests in Great Britain, as well as Australia, are endeavouring to prevent the passage of any social security legislation until after the war. The Beveridge plan, in particular, is being attacked. This is clearly indicated in a report in a recent issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, which read as follows:MOVE TO POSTPONE SOCIAL SERVICE PLAN . London, Sunday. Four Conservative M.P.'s w ill ask the Government to defer legislation on the Beveridge social service plan: when the Commons debutes the plan at its next session. The four M.P.'s are Sir Patrick Harmon, Never again will Sir Peter Bennett, Sir John Mel lor and MrH . R. Selley. They w ill ask tlie Government to postpone all legislation committing the Government to expenditure under the plan until tlie Government's f u l l proposal on post-war employment and the restoration of export trade are known. Sir Peter is a director of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and a former chairman of the Federation of British Industries; Sir Patrick is chairman of Birmingham Small Arms and several other companies. The Curtin Government intends to proceed with its legislation for social welfare, and, in doing so, it is seeking to implement the promises that had been made by the Allied Nations to members of the fighting services. The Treasurer is wise in not leaving^ this matter for post-war consideration. If the legislation foreshadowed by the Government is placed on the statute-book now it will no doubt be administered by whatever government may be in office in the future. There is need also to give attention to the improvement of the health of the nation. The Joint Committee on Social Security has given a lot of attention to this subject, and I agree with its view that action should be taken now to improve national health and fitness. Unless action be taken now, the experiences of the years following the last war may be repeated. In that period, a world-wide pneumonic influenza epidemic resulted in the death of more people than were killed during the war. I am sure that a good-'' deal of the absenteeism in industry, about which we hear a good deal, and about lished in the press, is due to the stress and strain to which the workers in war industries are being subjected. A national health scheme should be introduced by the Government at an early date. I have been supplied wiih",64,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

Probably a much larger sum was expended on private hospitals and in private medical attention by many people in the community. It is deplorable that only £18,000 could be found for preventive treatment in relation to national fitness. A much more substantial amount should be ear-marked for this purpose. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and some other honourable gentlemen have referred to the need to overcome waste and inefficiency, and to avoid unnecessary expenditure, in war industries. I agree with the views that they have expressed. Insufficient attention has been given to this important subject in the past.

288,Mr Morgan,"I am contending thatco-ordination. Our various production departments are apparently operating in watertight compartments, and there should be a co-ordinating authority. Considerable waste is also occurring in some service departments. Recently, I directed the attention of the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) to the activities of a certain enterprise, and pointed out that the employees were dissatisfied with the situation. They felt that they were wasting a good deal of time because orders were not coming in freely from the service departments. In his reply, the Minister saidI desire to refer The honourable member may not proceed along those lines. We are considering a taxation measure, not a loan bill. If the honourable member desires to refer to rates of taxes he will be in order. of the Chair, I fear that I shall not be able to carry my case much further. I submit that I should be allowed to discuss not only the raising, but also the expending, of money. In particular, I consider that I should be allowed to follow other honourable members in discussing instances of waste and inefficiency in industry. However, I bow to the ruling of the Chair and will reserve my remarks for another occasion. I support the amendment, moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and desire to address myself briefly to certain points specifically mentioned in it. The way in which the Treasurer ( Mr time, and obviously there had to be a base Chifley) has dealt with the "" pay-as-yougo "" proposal advanced by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) amounted to a scant and casual dismissal of a subject that requires deeper consideration than the Treasurer has pretended to give to it. It is not sufficient to dismiss it by saying, "" This is merely an attempt to escape taxation "". I do not agree with those who contend that persons in receipt of the higher incomes should not bear the imposts placed upon them. I have said more than once that in times of war persons in receipt of high incomes must be taxed at high rates. We cannot, dispose of the problem to which the honourable member for Robertson has directed attention by merely referring to what was said by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in introducing the first Income Tax Bill in 1915. We should consider the whole picture from the commencement of income taxation to the present time. Nobody can dispute the fact that taxpayers are called upon to pay a large amount of their current income in respect of tax on income earned in the previous year. With the rapidly mounting taxation rates, at what in equity shall take place when the income earning capacity of the taxpayer suddenly ceases. Suppose the taxpayer is stricken with paralysis or some other illness which prevents him from working? If he dies, what is the position with regard to his estate? If a taxpayer happens to die on the first day of the financial year Ids capacity to earn income ceases, but his estate is obliged to pay income tax in respect of his previous year's earnings. Owing to the fact that income tax has been imposed at high rates, I know many people who will be called upon to provide substantial sums by way of income tax when the breadwinner's earning capacity has ceased. In the great majority of instances the tax-payers I have in mind are not wealthy. Their incomes range from £500 to £700 a year, and in some instances they are even lower than that. The position of people in like circumstances becomes more desperate from month to month. In September, 1915, the Commonwealth income tax was introduced for the first on which to assess the tax. It was provided that for the financial year commencing on tlie 1st July, 1915, income tax should be levied, based on the amount of income earned during the preceding twelve months. It cannot be fairly said that, what the Government was seeking to do was to impose income tax on past earnings. It was imposing the tax prospectively, but, to enable it to be collected, it was necessary to have a base, and the base selected was the previous year's earnings of the' taxpayer. That system has brought a great deal of distress to many people who, over a number of years, have, on small incomes, provided themselves",67,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

291,Mr Spender (Warringah) [10.59].,"and their families with a home and have made provision against old age by means of insurance. They have incurred commitments for which I am sure they should be commended, but now they are called upon to pay income tax at high rates. During the lifetime of the breadwinner, he normally can meet the tax out of his earnings, but, in the event of his death, section 217 of the principal act provides that his estate shail be liable in respect of income tax on the previous year's earnings. I contend that when, in September, 1915, .the Parliament declared for the first time that income tax should be levied as from the 1st July of that year, and that it should, be payable upon earnings during the year ended the 30th June of that year, it was never contemplated that taxation would ever reach the dizzy heights it has at present attained. Accordingly it cannot be contended that on these altered conditions if the taxpayer dies, his estate should be called upon to bear the whole burden of the tax payable in respect of the previous year's earnings. In my own case my income tax amounts to a substantial part, if not the greater part, of my earnings, and I am paying that out of the present year's income. At the end oP the financial year my total earnings will have been what I have already paid to the Taxation Department) together with the balance which I have been able to retain for myself. IfI were to die on the day after the end of the financial year my family would have to provide a substantial sum by way of tax based on what I have already paidby way of tax plus what I have been able to retain for my own private purposes. That is the position of the large number of people throughout this country in the middle range of income. I am not so much concerned about, those who have substantial capital assets, but the great majority of people have no such assetsAll they have is a cottage, which is probably subject to a mortgage, a life assurance policy and some furniture. By reason of section 217 of the act, when the breadwinner dies the family must raise the money necessary to meet the tax due in respect of earnings of the previous year. Many of these people will then become bankrupt and the financial policy Mr Spender. adopted by this 'Government will have achieved that result. It may be that the' Government has not faced up to the problem. able member deal with the matter when he was Treasurer? elapsed since I have been Treasurer, but the problem has become acute owing to the taxes imposed during the last eighteen months. Take the case of a taxpayer receiving £400 a year. Upon marriage he immediately sets about procuring a home of his own, and he proceeds to pay for it probably over a period of, say, twenty years. Later his income increases to £500 or £600 a year, and owing to the in creased taxes due to the war he is called upon to pay out of his current earnings a large sum of money. has applied the same system as that which has been in operation throughout the world for the last 60 years. comes apparent we must deal with it. When the income tax rates were not very high it did not much matter whether the tax was based on the earnings of the previous year, but the point becomes material when the stage is reached at which a large proportion of one's income is required for the payment of the tax. It seems to me that section 217 of the act must be reviewed now. early conclusion, there would still be ample time to meet that difficulty, say, in the next budget or in the following budget. great injustices are being perpetrated. People in my own constituency have come to me complaining of heavy charges which they have been called upon to meet a.*; a result of the operation of that section. They have been forced to mortgage their assets. Taxpayers have been "" paying as they go "", but they have been doing it on the basis of a past year. Because taxation rates are higher now it is important to relate taxation provisions more closely to the ability of the taxpayer to meet his obligations. Every year since 1915 the taxpayer paid as he went, but the tax was",68,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

297,Mr Spender,"In the meantimebased on tbe previous year's income. I believe that special attention should be paid to section 217 of the act in order to remove the feat in the minds of many people that if the bteadwinrier were to die his estate would be unable to meet taxation demands on the previous year's income. Mfembers of the middle class, like all others, are loyally anxious to discharge their responsibilities in time of war, but their needs are apt to be overlooked. As I previously pointed out, the ordinary man in steady employment is the one who makes arrangements to buy a home, and who takes out insurance in order to make provision for his family. If such a man is stricken down with illness, and his income ceases, he may get, into grave financial difficulties because of the commitments into which 'he has entered. I have previously urged that those who have long standing commitments of this kind should receive special consideration in the way of taxation deductions. I know many men who are having a hard struggle to remain solvent, while others have been driven to the wall. I represent a constituency in which live many people in the middle income groups, as well as many others on the basic wage. Time and time again one hears of men getting into difficulties in their efforts to keep up the payment of premiums on life assurance policies. For many of them it is a losing tight. The Leader of the Opposition made out a good case on behalf of the married man with heavy financial responsibilities, and the Government should pay 'heed to his representation. Otherwise, families will be saddled with a heavy burden of debt. I suggest to tbe Treasurer for his consideration-thoug h I do not offer this as a firm opinion as to the detail-tba t the law should be amended to provide that if a taxpayer died when the year of tax is, for example, three months spent, the amount of tax which his estate is called upon to pay should be related to the time during which he was earning in that year. In the case of this example, it would of the tax otherwise payable. The same principle should apply in the case of a man whose income is suddenly cut off, whether by incapacity or for some other reason. must be aware that the act provides for tbe granting of relief in such cases. is given only in cases of definite hardship in respect of which it is almost impossible to satisfy tlie Commissioner upon under existing legislation. I am asking that such an amendment be made as a matter of right. Moreover, if it can be shown ihat the taxpayer is able to raise the amount of his tax, it is unlikely that the commissioner would listen to a plea of hardship, however just the claim might be. principal purpose of this measure is to obtain £40,000,000 additional revenue from taxation in a full year. The need to raise this money has been forced on the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) by the sensational growth of war expenditure. In September last he presented a budget which was an all-time record for the amount of money proposed to be expended. The budget provided for the expenditure of £549,000,000, of which £440,000,000 was for war purposes. A little more than four months after he had almost stunned the Australian people with that budget, he now estimates that expenditure will be increased by £103,000,000, bringing the revised total to £652,000,000. However, we have still four mouths of the financial year to run, and no one would be surprised to learn that, by the end of the financial year, the 7,000,000 people in Australia were to be called upon to provide £700,000,000. Even if the revised estimate of £652,000,000 is unaltered, it represents an amount of £93 for every man, woman and child in Australia. If we exclude the men in the services, and those directly producing for war needs, as well as the women in the homes and their children, we get some idea of the financial burden which must be borne by the rest of the community. This group must provide goods and services for the civilian community, and also the greater part of the finance for the conduct of the war. 1 amount to 25 per cent, mention this because I believe that the community can perform this herculean task, at a time when it is already becoming physically worn, only if the strongest incentives to production and saving",69,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro

300,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [11.22],"Th eare maintained. What are the incentives to production and saving? The knowledge that we are assisting in the war effort is itself a powerful incentive, hut human beings and human nature have not changed much throughout the ages, and one of tbe strongest incentives is the belief that tion tables ' in Australia with those personal effort will bring some personal gain. That powerful incentive should not be entirely disregarded if a maximum effort is to be obtained. The most powerful incentive to save-and saving must be encouraged if we are to avoid wasteful expenditure and harmful competition for goods and services-is confidence in the country's financial structure, and the stability of the currency. If these incenin Great Britain:-tives are to be maintained, there must be a belief that the money provided for the Government is being wisely expended, and the person who earns money must continue to believe that part of it at least may be retained by him for his personal benefit. The third requisite for the maintenance of these incentives is that there should be some assurance that the struggle to maintain business organizations under war-time conditions is worthwhile; that the post-war order will leave full play for individual enterprise. In passing, I refer to the experience of the United States of America, a country in which the principle of individual liberty and enterprise has been carried to perhaps greater lengths than in any other country, and yet there has been developed there the highest standard of living and the greatest industrial efficiency seen in any country in the world. Finally, there must be maintained that confidence in the financial stability of the country which will encourage investors to put their money into war loans. They must feel confident that the money which they invest will retain its purchasing power. I mention these things because we shall is even worse off in comparison. I repeat not attain our goal of maximum producthat, although the present taxation tables tion unless all these elements play their do something to remedy the previous inproper part in the framing of government equity, they still do not measure up to policy. The weakness of the Governwhat has been found a fair adjustment in ment's policy at the present time is that other countries, particularly in Great it does not measure up to the tests which Britain. I have suggested. In the first place, the Government's taxation tables are inequitreveals a weakness is in relation to the able. It is true that, for the first time, tax lag. Here we must not lose sight of the Government proposes to tax those on the important element of incentive. One Mr Holt. the lower incomes where so much excess purchasing power lies. The Government is to be commended upon taking that step, however belatedly, but the taxation tables still perpetuate it in a lessened degree a fault which has all along been present. If we compare the taxain Great Britain we find that those in the lower income groups in Great Britain are contributing proportionately a good deal more, and those in the middle and higher income groups a good deal less than do the corresponding groups in Australia. The following table sets out the tax payable under the Government's proposals and that paid on similar incomes Income. Australia. Great Britain. £ £ £ 250 37 47 300 55 66 350 75 88 400 95 111 500 137 156 2,000 951 931 3,000 ' 1,747 1,537 5,000 3,530 2,912 10,000 8,155 6,937 It will be seen that, whereas in the higher ranges of income the Australian tax is higher, the reverse is true in respect of taxpayers in the lower ranges of income. A taxpayer in Great Britain with an income of £10,000 will have over £3,000 left after he has paid his tax, whereas the Australian taxpayer with a similar income will have less than £2,000 after meeting his tax. A further point which should not be lost sight of is that in Great Britain the collections include a post-war credit, so that the Australian taxpayer in the higher ranges of income The second point which, in my opinion, of the factors which will counter that element of incentive is the concern which every taxpayer must have as to the uncertainty of the future, owing to the methods adopted by the Government in regard to the collection and payment of taxes. The merit, of the pay-as-you-go scheme is that the taxpayer, knowing his present income, is able to calculate his present liability. but the effect on the individual would be He knows that, whatever his financial circumstances may be in the succeeding year, he will at least have discharged his obligation this year for the income which he earns this year. That, I suggest, is a most important factor in the minds of taxpayers. There is scarcely a section of the community which does not believe that its earnings to-day are higher than they are likely to be in the years immediately after the war. That is not so much because the calling or vocation of individuals will alter, as that there is scarcely a person in Australia who is not working under much greater pressure to-day than he normally does. The average skilled workman is earning overtime to a degree that is not usual in normal years. In the years after the war, a skilled workman will probably not work more than ordinary p.e ace-time hours. whereas he may be in receipt of £12 a week to-day as a result of overtime payments, after the war he may receive only £6 a week. That will be the time when, with his income reduced by one half, he will be called upon to pay a tax based on bis higher earnings for the previous twelve months. It does not require much imagination to realize that the average professional man to-day is working under greater pressure than usual because of manpower shortages, and is probably in receipt of an income 50 per cent, greater than under normal conditions. The Treasurer cited the case of the married woman who has come into industry as the result of the war, and does not expect to remain in industry after the war, but will be called upon to pay taxes based on an income earned in a year when she was in receipt of what was for her an abnormally high rate of income. The more we examine the problem the more we must become impressed with the merits, in terms of sound national policy, of removing the fear which taxpayers now have because of uncertainty as to their financial position immediately after the war. Even if we were to abandon our claim for one year of tax, the position could easily be met by having a higher rate after the war than otherwise. The Treasury need suffer no financial loss at all, beneficial because he would know that out of his current earnings he would be able to pay the tax which would discharge his obligations in respect of the year in which the income was earned. That would remove his concern as to the future, and, in respect of deceased estates, it would remove a serious obligation which the estates of deceased persons, especially those who die immediately after the war, will carry. In the last two or three years estate duty has been doubled. In passing, 1 suggest that that is a matter which we ought to consider as soon as the financial circumstances of the Commonwealth permit us to do so. ""We have not only doubled estate duties, but also we are now calling on the estates of deceased persons to carry this heavy obligation when no additional income will be received. The Government would be well advised to In other words, accept the constructive criticism which honourable members on this side have offered. When this amendment was put forward the Treasurer said that it was merely a vote-catching proposal, but he justified the amendment when he admitted that he was already taking action to remedy the defects, first, in respect of the scale of weekly deductions, and, secondly, in respect of deductions m relation to concessional allowances. The third weakness to which I desire to draw attention is the destruction of the incentive which should be present in the community if we are to reach our maximum goal under war-time conditions. I refer to the absence of any post-war creditscheme which would give to the taxpayer, whether in the higher or lower ranges of income, the knowledge that there will be preserved to him some portion of his earnings, because of the existence of a post-war credit. Let us take the case of a worker whose normal income is £300 a year, but receives considerably more because of overtime earnings. I have taken a normal income of £300 because that roughly represents the wage of a tradesman under normal working conditions. The tax on an income of £300 is £55, which leaves him with £245. Should he, as a result of overtime payments, earn £500, he would pay £137 in taxes and have £363 left. In other words, he would retain approximately £2 of every £4 received by him as overtime. Should his income be £600 a year, he would pay £179 in taxes and retain £421. That is to say, he would retain £3 of every £6 that he earned as overtime. It is not to be wondered at that the Government is not getting the full quantum of work from the overtime which the average man is paid. argument can be applied to the greater earnings of professional men and of married women now working in industry; unless some incentive is provided, we shall not get from the community that return, in terms of effort, of which it is capable. The final weakness to which I direct attention is the fact that the incentive to save will be lessened if the people have no confidence that, their investedsavings will be returned to them, at the expiration of the period of the loan, with purchasing power unimpaired. weaknesses of the Government's financial policy is its excessive reliance on treasury-bills. The Prime Minister said that one reason why he was not prepared to adopt the post-war credits scheme was the fact that the repayment of £20,000,000 worth of post-war credits would endanger the national welfare scheme: If the Government could not conveniently find £20,000,000 with which to convert post-war credits into cash, how does it propose to find the £249,000,000 which it will need to fund the treasury bills already issued? Undoubtedly, as time passes, the issue of treasury-bills will be heavily increased. In citing what Canada was doing, the Treasurer, to suit his own purposes, omitted to say that Canada had adopted post-war credits as a. part of its method of financing the war. On the subject of confidence in the financial structure generally, and the currency in particular, Lenin is said to have declared that the best way in which to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. I have been Mr Holt. amazed at the light-hearted way in which members of the Government discuss the depreciation of the currency. They adopt an almost flippant attitude towards the issue of treasury-bills. I am led to believe that they are not concerned that the debasement of the currency destroys the purchasing power of the money which people have invested in the loans, because they think that the burden on future generations will thereby be lightened. If the objective of the Government is to destroy the capitalist system by destroying the confidence of the community in the currency, it is 1 having a great deal of success. It is a The same significant fact that the Fadden national contribution scheme, under which a part of the money contributed to Consolidated Revenue by the people would be repaid after the war, provided for smaller contributions by the people than are provided for in the present scheme under which all the money paid by the taxpayers will go into Consolidated Revenue and stay there. Under the Fadden scheme, a man earning £250 a year would have paid £33 6s. as a national contribution and £16 would have been returned to him after the war; but, One of the great under this bill, that man will pay £36 7s. in tax and receives no refund. A man earning £500 a year would have paid £95 2s., of which £23 would have been a post-war credit, as against the £136 14s. which he will have to pay as income tax if this bill becomes law. The man on £1,000 a year would have had a post-war credit of £48 out of the £282 18s. that he would have had to pay, compared with the £255 8s. of tax that the Treasurer proposes shall be levied on him. man's comparison does not hold good, because the amount of revenue which the Fadden budget proposed to raise from national contributions was only £25,000,000, compared with the £40,000,000 of additional revenue which we intend to raise under this bill. post-war credit scheme based on the tables applying in Great Britain, because that would provide a far more equitable distribution of the burden than is contained in the Treasurer's proposal.

302,Mr Holt,"-We should welcome amain point is that at all costs the Governis the normal rate of tax and, in addition, ment must maintain to the full extent the incentivefcowork and save. ""Workers will make an extra effort to assist the war effort, but the history of human nature proves that the incentive of personal gain is one of the strongest driving forces in the community. Whatever the dogmatists and doctrinaire theorists may think, the workers want to carry on their way of life, which allows them to exercise freedom and initiative. With regard to the incentive to save, the worker wants to feel that whatever he lends will be returned to him with its purchasing power undiminished. I condemn the Government's proposals, because they will destroy initiative. I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, because it has many advantages over the bill submitted, and I hope that the House will adopt itI cannot support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr fore, paying about what they used to Fadden), because, although it has features which commend themselves to me, it has other features which are objectionable. I do not think that this bill is a just measure, and in committee I shall vote for the amendment or rejection of some of tbe clauses. The proposal to reduce the statutory exemption from income tax is intolerably unfair. I have contrasted the scheme contained in this bill with tbe scheme cura further impost, because it pays 100 per rent in Canada, which the Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons described as more onerous than the income tax of the United States of America or Great Britain. But, contrasted with the proposals made by this Government, the Canadian income tax, from my point of view, is much faireT. The Government proposes that the statutory exemption, rates shall be reduced from £156 to £104. The Canadian system is explained in the speech of the Minister for Finance and Defence, reported at page 92 of volume 80 of the House of Commons Debates. It appears that the present Canadian scheme is the result of the fusion of two former systems of taxation. There was formerly a national defence tax, as well as a graduated income tax. Both are now fused in the one tax, and there a graduated rate of tax. It is curious to notice that, taking the Canadian dollar at the present rate of 5s. 6d., the statutory exemption for single men is. £1S1 10s., and for married men £330660 and 1,200 dollars respectively. In addition, married men have further exemptions in respect of children. It is true that Canada has adopted a system of what has been described as post-war credits, but it is also true that, in adopting that system, Canada has not materially increased the contributions from the earners of lower incomes. For instance, a single man earning 700 dollars a year used to pay 35 dollars and received no refund. He now pays 40 dollars and will receive 20 dollars of that back as a post-war credit. A married man on 1,200 dollars used to pay 50 dollars and receive nothing back; but he now pays 50 dollars, of which 25 dollars will be returned to him as a post-war credit. The earners of low incomes are, therepay, and will get about half of it back. It is important to remember the substantial exemptions given to both married and single men. The rate of tax upon large incomes is very substantial, and very heavy tax is levied upon the profits of companies and the profits of private individuals. A company pays, first, a corporate income tax of IS per cent., a tax of 12 per cent, of its total profits, and also cent, of its total excess profits, or 10 per cent, of its total profits whichever amount is the greater. Those rates apply not only to companies, but also to private individuals who make profits. Part of the 100 per cent, tax is repaid by way of post-war credit. Companies and private individuals who make profits, instead of paying 75 per cent, of their total excess profits as they did up to 1942, now pay 100 per cent, of their total excess profits and receive 25 per cent, as a post-war credit. Thus the Government has the advantage of the use of that extra money. In .substance, my objection to the bill is that it brings tlie exemption level far too low. Even the present level of £156 is too low; but it is now to be reduced to a level lower than was ever intended or desired by the people, and far lower than",73,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
303,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [11.56j.,"has ever heen advocated by any political party in this country. The new exemption level is unfair, and represents an intolerof goods that are available for civilian able burden on the people which they resent. I am not prepared to support that provision. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in response to an inquiry which he made ^ to the economists at the Melbourne University was informed that they estimate that under these proposals, direct and indirect taxes on an income of £6 a week represent 35s. a week in the case of a man with no dependants, 31s. a week for a man with a wife, 26s. a week for a man with a wife and one child, 25s. a week for a man with a wife and two children. Those figures show that the burden of tax on those with small incomes is considerably more than that represented solely by a direct tax. I am opposed to this burden being placed on persons with small incomes. The swing of direct taxation should be checked. I oppose the lowering of the exemption level as proposed under the bill, and I shall support any other honourable member who is prepared to vote against that provision. If it be not defeated, further exemptions should be provided. I have given notice of amendments in that respect which I propose to move in the committee stage. I am also opposed to the provision to enable the Commissioner to refuse to refund overpayments of tax; and I shall also support any other honourable member who is prepared to oppose it. Most of what I desire to say on the bill can be more appropriately stated in the committee stage. Generally, my attitude to the measure is that it is bad and unjust, particularly insofar as it reduces the exemption level. Thursday, 4 March, 191$. The views of honourable members on this side have been excellently stated by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner). Our present financial position is serious. recognizes that fact. No amount of social service camouflage will hide it, and hence this taxation. The danger arises from two main sources: first, the amount of money that the Government is pouring out in credit expansion; and, secondly, the declining quantity consumption. As the result of those two factors, as well as others, prices are rising. I do not need to emphasize that point in relation to this measure. Other honourable members have spoken of the tremendous amount of bank credit that is being utilized, whilst the decrease of civilian commodities is generally recognized. When an increased amount of money is competing for a decreasing quantity of goods the result under the law of supply and demand is, inevitably, a rise of prices. That is going on. When the previous Government went out of office prices had risen by 9 per cent, on pre-war figures, and at that time the £1 was worth about 18s. 2d. To-day, prices have increased by 22J per cent., and the £1 is worth only 15s. 6d. That means an additional flat rate tax of about 20 per cent, on the whole of the community. The Government realizes that price control must be assisted, and it has, therefore, brought forward these taxation proposals which are estimated to yield £40,000,000, including a proposal to tax lower incomes. These proposals are vitally necessary. The Government's loan programme has produced only £83,000,000 which is substantially less than its estimate; and the £60,000,000 war savings certificate campaign which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) introduced so optimistically in his budget speech has failed so badly that sales of war savings certificates total only about £11,000,000. Therefore, it is necessary that the purchasing power of two-thirds of the people on lower incomes be reduced. That is the reason for these proposals, although under them the rates of tax are to be lower than the rates applied to corresponding incomes in New Zealand and Great Britain. One sympathizes with the people who will now be brought into the tax field, and wishes one could join advocates of the social credit system in saying that those on lower The Government incomes should be allowed to keep their purchasing power. But we see signs of very great danger. Savings banks deposits at call are increasing; and it is obvious that hoarding is going on. The Government, therefore, believes that it is",74,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
304,Dr. Price (Boothby) [12.5 A.m.],"unwise to risk a position in which any alarm, or uncertainty, might mean the pouring out of great sums of money with the result that price control would be broken and black marketing would develop. The Opposition realizes the difficulties confronting the Government, and it has made practical suggestions in this respect. We suggest, first, changes in the scale of these "" pay-as-you-go"" payments in order to make them more equitable, and also the refund of overpayments of tax. Secondly, we suggest that an inquiry be made by an expert committee into the extension of the "" payas-you-go "" system to all taxpayers; and, thirdly, a lightening of the taxation burden by treating 50 per cent, of the aggregate increase of taxes as post-war credits. It is vitally necessary to adjust anomalies with respect to tax instalments. I am not a mathematician, and I do not pretend to criticize the new taxation scale; but I point out that the mathematical economist, MrH . S. Carslaw, very strongly criticizes the taxation scale as laid down in respect of the uniform income tax. He saysWith the Commonwealth the sole taxation authority on income one might expect under present conditions a very severe, but simple and reasonable, graduated tax. uniform tax is very severe on high incomes is evident, but that it is simple, and in every feature of its graduation reasonable, is far from clear. He went on to say that next year we might hope for a simpler and more reasonable scale. This Government has not provided a more reasonable and simpler scale. Common justice demands the repayment of surplus instalments. There is no earthly reason why the Government should penalize members of the community who over-pay their tax in advance. Many of them have obligations such as life assurance premiums, and they rely on the repayment of surplus tax instalments to meet them. The Government's proposal to retain surplus instalments is causing widespread discontentMany people have already complained to me in that respect. Great advantages may be gained from an examination of the "" pay-as-you-go "" system by an expert committee. Such a system will enable the Government to collect its tax sooner, and consequently to reduce the purchasing power of the community more quickly. That is a vital point. Further, the Government will get the benefit of high taxation rates at a time of high national income; and when the nation's income falls, it will not be creditor for huge sums of uncollected tax which, possibly, will never be paid. Further, taxpayers will know where they stand, and will not carry a huge burden of tax debt should incomes fall. The Opposition's third proposal is that'50 per cent, of the aggregate new taxes for AprilJune, 1943, and 50 per cent, of the aggregate of the new taxes from the 1st July, be treated as post-war credits to be repaid in six instalments during the three years following the conclusion of the war. I do not propose to go into all the arguments concerning the old horse of post-war credits which is galloping again; but I should like to stress several points. First, the advantage of the scheme proposed by the Opposition is that we should owe this money to ourselves. There will be no question of Australia mortgaging its future to overseas creditors. Secondly, the scheme will have a tremendous psychological effect. Apparently, the Government fails to That the realize that aspect. People quite rightly consider that money paid in taxes is lost, but they do not regard as lost money which is lent and for which we propose that they be paid interest at the rate of 2 per cent. Honourable members are able to ascertain the views of the public on these matters from those who speak to them in the streets. Many have come up to me and expressed the hope that the Government would on this occasion introduce a system of post-war credits, and would not take all this money permanently and at once. It is possible for the Government, if it adopts the Opposition's suggestion, to graduate the scale of taxes and loans so that those on lower incomes may pay tax and post-war credits on the scale set out in the Fadden budget, and along the lines being followed in Great Britain. If that were done persons on incomes in lower and middle ranges would have first call on the national capital and income after the war. In Great Britain, Baron Keynes proposes that the post-war credit shall be repaid by means of a capital levy after the war. That could be adopted here, but whatever the method, the point is that under this scheme the lower incomes would pay less and have the first call on the national income and capital after the war. It could be regarded, quite rightly, as it is regarded in Britain, as being a transfer of wealth after the war from the people with tlie higher incomes, if any are left, or with capital, if any be left, to the people with lower incomes. That is why it, always seems so extraordinary to me that the Government should oppose postwar credits. Post-war credits are, in a sense, a socializing scheme. The only reason I can possibly imagine why the Government is acting in this way is that it opposed post-war credits originally as n means of seizing power and it considers it must maintain its opposition. If the Government accepted the post-war credits plan it could also adopt the Padden suggestion and make such credits available immediately in cases of sickness, unemployment or marriage, as is done in Great Britain. Having made these general remarks I wi3.h to refer to one or two particular considerations which arise in connection with the bill, and which have not yet been touched upon in detail in tlie debate. I support the suggestion that a committee of experts be appointed to examine the very difficult problem of private company taxation. Public companies are taxed at a flat rate of 6s. in the £1 on profits, plus In view of the fact that the taxation of war-time company tax. Private companies are taxed 6s. in the £1 on profits, but do not pay the war profits tax, although they have to pay a special tax on undistributed profits at the shareholder's rate. Consequently if the shareholders in a company be people with small incomes the undistributed profits will be taxed at their low rate, and if they be people with large incomes, the undistributed profits will be taxed at the high rate. In many companies owned by three or four people who used to be wealthy this means that undistributed profits will be taxed at the new rate of up to ISs. 6d. in the £1. That is only an increase of Gd. People with small incomes, among the middle income shareholders, will now have, to pay new rates of Dr. Price. Is., Is. 6d. and 2s. in the £1 and will carry those rates to the taxation of the undistributed profits of the companies in which they are shareholders. This is grossly unfair. It is even more grossly unfair in view of the fact that no extra tax is being imposed on the profits of public companies. The proposal is so outrageous, in fact, that it is doubtful, whether the point was appreciated when these proposals were being prepared. The whole position in regard to private company taxation is extremely difficult. The subject was reported upon twice by the Joint Committee on Profits. The first report, which was presented in October, 1941, statedI t will be observed that private companies ii ro exempt from tlie operations of the Wartime (Company) Tax. We think this exemption is justifiable at the present time, having regard to the other imposts which apply to private companies, and we gather that it was for the purpose of avoiding an unjust impost upon private companies as compared with public companies that they were exempted from the act. There is evidence before us to suggest that, at least in some cases, the total tax imposed upon private companies is considerably in excess of that which operates in the case of a public company. But while it is possible to point to anomalous cases, we think, looked at as a whole, that the taxation upon private companies is fairly comparable with that applicable to public companies. It is not possible to make an exact comparison, but the figures placed before us indicate that the burdens upon the private.and the public company do not differ so greatly from each other as figures in relation to isolated cases may suggest. private companies will be considerably higher under these proposals whereas the taxation of public companies will remain unaltered, the anomalies will be accentuated. The second report on the subject by the Joint Committee on Profits was made in if arch, 1942, after the committeehad taken a great deal of additional evidence. Although the committee came toan indefinite conclusion it stated in its reportThere are, we have little doubt, anomalousoases in which by reason of recent increases in tax the burden on some private companies may at the moment lie extremely heavy but such' anomalies are inseparable from war-time conditions. There is no doubt that many such anomalies exist. The joint committeeheard much complicated evidence from company representatives and also from officials of the Taxation Department and also examined various suggestions with the object of insuring a greater measure of justice to private companies, 'but it did not consider any of them practical. I was not present at'the meetings on these occasions, as the Broadcasting Committee of which Senator 'Gibson was chairman, was preparing its report at the time, but I have since read the evidence and reports and. I thoroughly agree with the view that the Subject is extremely complicated and should be examined by accountants. For that reason I strongly support the proposal in the amendment that it should be referred to a committee of experts. The extraordinary incidence of the taxation on private companies was amusingly shown by a hypothetical case submitted to the Joint Committee on Profits by the Commissioner of Taxation. The committee asked the Commissioner to submit a case and he prepared one in which the profits of a hypothetical private company were shared by three persons, each of whom received a salary of £1,000 a year. The company made a profit of £55,300, over six years, in varying amounts. The distribution of the whole of its profits to the three partners, after the payment of normal company tax and shareholders tax, would have given them £5,204 between them, for the six years, or £289 a year each. under the new rates. under the new rates, the tax on undistributed profits has been bumped up. That the Commissioner of Taxation was able to submit such a case is clear support for the contention that these high rates will kill initiative and hard work, with the result that .taxation will dry up at its source. I remind honourable members that it was found to be necessary in Great Britain to reduce the confiscatory rates of war tax and excess profits tax on companies. Confiscatory rates of tax on undistributed profits are thoroughly bad. They produce a tendency to cause companies to push out as much of the profits as .possible to shareholders, rather than to lay up reserves for depreciation, repairs, future taxation, future expansion and -difficulties after the war. Quite a number of representatives of private companies urged the Joint Committee OJI Profits to recommend to the Government that it should allow some part of undistributed profits to remain untaxed. The representatives said: ""Take some part of our undistributed profits away from us, and hold it for us so that it may be made available to meet the difficulties of the post-war reconstruction period."" It, was put to us that if the Government would relieve the companies of taxation in respect of part of their undistributed profits, such profits could be regarded as post-war credits repayable for the purpose of helping the companies to re-establish themselves after the war. There is no doubt that private companies have been hit very hard. They have to pay. first, a flat rate of 6s. in the £1 on their profits; secondly, land tax as companies: and, thirdly, a tax of np to ISs. 6d. in the £1 on undistributed profits. If the proprietor in a private company is lucky enough to get a dividend under such conditions, he pays another tax upon it at the personal rate. He also pays lam! tax on his OAvn land as well as on his proportion of the company's land. He loses tlie advantage of the remissions of taxation on dividends which formerly were allowable by Commonwealth and State taxing authorities. I therefore strongly urge the Government to appoint an expert committee to examine this subject. I congratulate the Government on the proposal in the bill to reduce the rates of tax on property income under £200 to the lower rate chargeable on personal exertion. In this connection, I support the favorable comments made by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). In my view, this new concession will tend to meet the problem to which I have referred on previous occasions in this House, of the plight of small income-earners who have invested their savings in companies. As I have pointed out, an increase of company taxation and a decrease of many dividends hits small shareholders and small income-earners very hard and it will probably cause them, ultimately, to become applicants for pensions. These individuals have no redress in respect of increased taxation. They have put their",75,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
305,Mr Jolly,"They would, get even less",78,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
306,Dr. Price,"That is so, becauselife savings into companies and they receive no consideration in the way of costof-living increases, as do pensioners and basic wage-earners. They have to meet tlieir expenses from a dwindling income due to a fall in company dividends and the depreciation in the value of tlie £1. I am quite certain that unless these persons are afforded some relief, they will he compelled to apply for pensions. I wish now to raise several points in my capacity as a private member, and not as a member of the Opposition parties. The first has relation to bearer bonds. It has been suggested to me by people competent to speak on the subject that a considerable leakage of taxation occurs in respect of Commonwealth bearer bonds because, under the present system, the rate of tax depends entirely upon the honesty of the bond-holders. I understand that, about 1930, it was discovered that a serious leakage was occurring and that many people were brought to book when such bonds had to be converted at a lower rate of interest than previously operated. The people who held these bonds had to convert them so their owners were discovered. It has been suggested to me that this subject also should be examined by a committee of experts. The Taxpayers Association has examined ways of helping the Government to track the holders of bearer bonds. It has been suggested that the problem should be dealt with by the levying of a flat rate of tax on such bonds. Another point to which I desire to refer is the proposal to impose a tax on 5 per cent, of the deferred pay of members of the fighting services. This proposal is causing much indignation and many of us have received strongly worded circulars on the subject. People generally consider it to be scandalous that husbands, brothers, sons and friends who are offering their lives in the service of their difficulty. In Australia, despite our country should be taxed upon what ia regarded as a compulsory saving. The amount of money involved is not great and there is a feeling that service personnel should not he subjected to such miserable treatment. It seems to me to be foolish for the Treasurer, who has himself admitted that the amount involved is small, to arouse so much hostility over it. Dr. Price. unfair. recognized section in the community which suffers severely at present from income taxation. I refer to those who have given up good living standards in order to enter the combatant services at much reduced rates of remuneration. These people carry the burden of the taxation based on their previous year's income. That is due to the tax lag which the Opposition desires to abolish. Many of them have taken up life assurance at fairly high figures, and they cannot possibly meet their liabilities in that regard out of their service pay. I understand that a moratorium is granted to them, but the payments due will come out of the assurance money or the bonuses. Therefore, I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the position of those who have enlisted in the fighting services. Some time ago I raised the subject of deductions from taxable income on account of payments incurred in educating children, but the Treasurer said that I had raised the matter too late to enable the Government to consider it. Therefore, I ask the Government to examine the matter in connection with this bill. If the war continues for a considerable period, the matter of educational deductions will become important. Tbe tremendous increase of direct and indirect taxes throws a great strain on those who have to educate children. The Commonwealth Government has already come into the field of State education in war time by providing bursaries in the universities for students of parents with slight financial resources. The Government of Great Britain has already recognized that it may have to take up the matter of secondary education, because many of the British public schools are in financial secondary system of State education, the private schools are of great importance. In South Australia they carry one-fifth of the educational burden, and the proportion may be even larger in other States. It seems to me that the Commonwealth Government may have to consider the problem which these schools present, as has been found necessary in Britain.",78,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
307,Mr Duncan,HUGHES -It is also very,79,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
308,Dr. Price,"There is another unTwo cases have been brought to my notice which the Government should consider with regard to the increased taxation to be imposed. One is that of parents who have to maintain children at secondary schools at the ages at which they could leave school and earn income. It would be of no use to give bursaries in universities to students if they were called a big national effort is made, the Ausupon to leave school at the secondary school age. The other case is that of countypified on the cover of The Worker. try parents who cannot afford to give a secondary education to their children because it involves sending them to boarding schools or putting them into city lodgings. It is therefore necessary for the Government to consider the granting of deductions from assessable income in respect of money expended on the education of children. The Opposition has made some helpful suggestions to the Government. It asks first that overpayments of instalments of tax shall be returned to the taxpayers. It also asks that certain of the new increases of taxation shall be made post-war credits returnable during the three years after the close of hostilities. The third suggestion of the Opposition is that an expert committee should consider the application of "" pay-as-you-go "" methods to all taxpayers, in addition to wage and salary earners. Finally the Opposition urges that the proposed committee should review the present taxation of private companies. . I trust, that the Treasurer will consider also my own suggestions as a private member. I urge that the Government should tax Commonwealth war bonds at the source. This matter could be considered by the proposed expert committee. Secondly, I ask that the Government examine tbe position regarding the taxation of the deferred pay of members of the fighting services and the taxation of civilians who have enlisted in the services. FinallyI urge the Government to consider the effects of income taxation on secondary education. a.m.] I understand that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) was once editor of the Australian journal known as The Worker. It is an extraordinary publication in many ways and has a remarkable illustration of the Australian working man on its cover. The worker is depicted as a rather angular and muscular person with a head somewhat between that of a man and an animal. The brow could only be described as low and some people might say that the Australian working man has been represented as a mere clod. Often when the Labour party advises an appeal to the public, and tralian working man is judged as he is Something of that kind has been done in presenting this bill. It is not a transparent measure. There is a good deal of camouflage about it. The Government seems to say: "" We have got to tax people in the lower income group, but we shall camouflage our action with a national welfare scheme. We shall do what we have to do in a very clever way, because we shall say to the Australian worker ' You know we are going to do this, but there is something in it for y o u ' "" . On investigation, the worker will find' that there is very little in this proposal for him. On close scrutiny of the matter, as we have realized by the admirable speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), the more we dissect the bill the more curious and numerous are the anomalies inherent in it. For some time members of the Opposition have been asserting that the time must come when people in the lower income groups must be taxed, but no great satisfaction has been derived by the Opposition from such a declaration. No one desires to obtain money for the war effort from the people in the lower income group if it is possible to get it from the higher incomes, but figures presented to the House from time to time leave no means of escape from such a policy. There has been delay on the part of the Government in coming to the inevitable conclusion that the lower income group must be taxed.. The exigencies of war made it apparent that with a reduced quantity of goods available for consumption, with greater purchasing power due to bank inflation and with pegged prices, there was every indication from what we have witnessed in the last nine or ten months of increased inflation. Considering the expansion of credit that has taken place, one must be alarmed at the enormous amount",79,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
309,Mr Hutchinson (Indi) [12.36,"of bank credit that has been created in the last fifteen months. When the Leader of the Opposition left office, the treasury bills on issue amounted to a mere £1,-7'50,000. Up to June, 1942, the issue had increased to £71,250,000. In fifteen months, treasury-bills have been issued to the amount of £213,000,000, and the position to-day is that the Commonwealth and States combined have treasury-bills vo the total amount of £260,000,000. for trouble. policy be pursued the people on the lower incomes will suffer, because the experience of other countries shows that the wage earners are the first to feel the effects of inflation. No doubt the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), and every other member of the Government, agreed that it was necessary to tax people in the lower ranges of income, but they have not placed before the people a graduated scale providing for post-war credits. They wrapped die pill in a sugar coating, and said to the lower-paid sections, "" We shall set aside £30,000,000 a year for certain social services "", but, on investigating the measure, we find that only about £4,250,000 is to be used for any form of social service, the remainder being devoted to war finance. I quote the following interesting remarks by the Treasurer in the financial statement delivered by him on. the 11th February last:in its oarly stages the fund will build up some credit balances which will bo used later when the welfare scheme reaches full operation. For instance in the first year a substantial credit may accrue. These balances will not be allowed to remain idle, but will Ininvested and will thus provide a useful sourt-c of temporary finance for war purposes which will he replaced by long-term borrowings last war loan, £83,000,000 was subscribed when the moneys are required later for welfare purposes. .The Leader of the Opposition directed attention to this important point: the change-over from 40 instalments to 52 does not provide relief for the wage-earner because the rate of taxation is being increased. The wage-earner is not a clod; when something hits bis pocket he is intelligent enough. He will see the hollowness of the proposed welfare scheme under which ho must pay 52 times in the year instead of 40 times and pay more each time. The Government has adopted the strange principle that the wage-earning class alone is to be denied any refund when too much taxation has been paid. This does not affect me because I am a primary producer. It does not affect members of the business community, but it will affect the wage earner. There is even a legal doubt whether a man's executors will have a claim on such over-payment after he dies. It is evident that these points have not been properly considered by the Government. If we cite a few examples we shall see how the Government's proposals work out. A single taxpayer earning £2 2s. 6d. a week will pay £1 6s. a year tax. Another taxpayer who earns only one penny a week more will pay double as much tax, or £2 12s. a year. Because he earns one penny a week more, he will actually receive 5d. a week less. Let us now consider the case of a married man, and it should be noted that in nearly every instance it is the married man who must pay the piper. A married man receiving £4 16s. 2d. a week will pay 2s. a week""less than his tax liability. Surely lie should be left with more than 2s. a week to cover his concessional allowance. A man receiving £11 10s. 9d. a week, and who has a dependent wife and child, will pay l is . a week more than his tax liability, while a man on £15 17s. Sd. a week will pay £22 2s. a year-less than his tax liability. In no instance will there be any adjustments or refund. We should also consider the case of a man who has taken out life assurance, and most honourable, members will agree that it is wise to do so. At the present time, it is especially important that the practice should be encouraged. In the apart from conversions, and of this amount £59,000,000 was subscribed by those in the higher income groups. It is safe to say that a great part of that money wa3 subscribed by the great mutual life assurance companies. Therefore, it is important that these'companies should be kept in a sound financial condition. But how do the Government's taxation proposals affect those who have heavy life assurance commitments? A married man, with a wife and one child, who earns",80,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
310,Mr Duncan,HUGHES -That is asking,81,Allowances Other Than I Have Worked Out The Effects Of The Pro
311,Mr Hutchinson,"Yes. If thisJE667 a year, -will be called upon to pay an extra £59 12s. under these taxation proposals, and in addition he will have -to make an advance payment, representing tax rebates withheld from him, amounting to £37 16s. 6d. This is due to the adoption by the Government of a mistaken principle of trying to average the concessional deductions on certain incomes, and fixing the rates on that basis. We know that it is impossible to arrive at an equitable arrangement in that way. Few people have the same fixed -commitments in the way of life assurance, friendly society payments, trade union dues, and so on. When that 'method of taxation is applied, some people will pay too much, and no provision is made for refunds. And it is always tlie wage-earners who .suffer. The Leader of the Opposition pointed this out with great clarity, and so shocked the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that we were treated to the unique spectacle of seeing them rise one after the other in an effort to justify the post-war years. In the speech in which 'Government's policy. The Treasurer, as if solving the problem, said, ""Well, we recognize that the scale which we proposed was a mistake. We shall introduce another one. We shall step up the gradations by 2s. 6d."". Asi f that solves the problem! Of course, it does nothing -of the kind, because it does not remove the essential unsoundness of the scheme. It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition asked the Treasurer across the table whether he had obtained the idea from the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles). Seeing that the Government's proposals are so unsound, and are aimed directly at the wage-earning classes, surely the House will agree to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The incidence of taxation on private companies is most unfair. I am not referring to big companies with a capital of thousands of pounds, but to small private companies in which there are only a few shareholders. In my electorate there are many such companies consisting of two persons, who are really working a partnership. While a public company pays at the rate of 6s. in the £1, and a. flat rate levied on undistributed profits, a private company on its undistributed profits may be taxed at a rate as high as 18s. 6d. in the £1, because the personal exertion rate operates in its case. Thousands of persons throughout Australia are suffering hardship because of this provision, and I hope that before long relief will be afforded them. To-night, the Prime Minister made it clear that he was himself not sure of the legal position in regard to some of the points raised by honourable members of the Opposition. It is evident, therefore, that the bill did not receive the close attention it deserved before being submitted to the House. I trust that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition will be agreed to, and that the bill will be withdrawn. It is true that, under a system of post-war credits, the money might not be repaid for one, two or three years, but at any rate the taxpayer would know that within a certain definite time'he would receive payment. The scheme would be of infinite value during the he dissected this bill ancl revealed its many imperfections the Leader of the Opposition rendered valuable service not only to this Parliament but also to the nation as a whole. adjourned. That the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity to refer to a matter to which reference was made last Thursday. I then said that the late Sir Ernest Riddle had said in London that the policy of the Commonwealth Bank had been altered by the Commonwealth Bank Board and by an amendment of the act which established the bank. When I said that' I could not remember bis exact words the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) interjected "" Of course not; they do not exist"".

Moreover, the Commonwealth Bank's policy was not to take advance business from private banks, even with its own money. When a customer of a .private bank asked the Commonwealth Bank for accommodation, the Commonwealth Bank undertook to investigate his position, and if satisfied that he was entitled to the accommodation, the private banks were and are notified and informed by the Commonwealth Bank that, if they were prepared to do the business, the Commonwealth Bank would withdraw from the negotiations. If not, the Commonwealth Bank would make the advances. In nearly every case, said Mr Riddle, the private hanks made the advances.

February, the honourable member for from Commonwealth stores. I have had Lilley( MrJ o l l y) asked me the followinquiries made and the facts are as ing question, upon notice1. What is the total amount received in war damage insurance premiums for the year ended the 31st December, 1942r 2. What was the total amount of claims paid during that period? 3. What is the total amount of unsettled claims received up to that date? ; 4. What is the total amount of administration expenses for the year ended the 31st December, 1942? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. £7,272,645. 2 and 3. The total of claims received for the period to the 31st December, 1942, is £7,-531,940. Claims totalling £2,666 have been paid, whilst claims of £230 have been assessed and recorded for payment at a later date. 4. £171,127. the honourable member for Griffith ( Mr Conelan) asked the following question, without notice:A number of young men have been sent into the fighting zone with less than six months' training. Deferred pay becomes operative after a man has served for a period of six months. Will the Prime Minister seriously consider the giving of deferred pay to men who have been in the fighting zone for three months, instead of their having to wait for six months? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :At the present time deferred .pay is credited after six months' service or on embarkation for service overseas. It has now been decided that deferred pay will be credited to all members of the forces as from the date of embarkation for service outside Australia, and that this decision should be applied retrospectively to the 7th December, 1941. This will mean that all members who have served in, the external territories since the 7th December, 1941, will be credited with deferred pay for the period of that service, irrespective of whether or not they had completed six 1 months' service on embarkation. the honourable members for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) and Robertson ( Mr Spooner) asked for informatio n concerning remarks made by Judge Markell at the Sydney Quarter SessionsO n Friday, the 26th on the case of the t h e f t of razor blades follows (a) Before the arrival of the vessels containing the razor blades instructions were issued by the Division of I m p o r t Procurement for special police supervision over the unloading of the cargoes. Some of the packages had been broached either before the commencement of the voyage or during the voyage. The razor blades were transported from the ship to the division's store under special escort and on arriva l were placed in specially secured store known as the Dead House/ The storekeeper in charge was the only officer who had keys to the Dead House. (6) The store in which the Dead House is located is part of a special storage area. It had been f u l l y enclosed and the entrance to the area had since the opening of the store been under special police guard for 24 hours each day. (c) The person charged and convicted w it h the offence was a stores employee of the division and one entrusted with the custody of the contents of the store. He betrayed that trust in the first place by breaking and entering the Dead House, and in the second place by stealing the razor blades. (d) The total deficiency of razor blades, including those pillaged before or during the voyage, is approximately one-tenth of 1 . per cent. This percentage will",83,Timber Freights And Rates

318,Mr Beasley,"On the 24th February,compare more than favourably with the pillage rate on ordinary commercial importations of razor blades. (e) The stores and the stores area have been under 24-hour supervision of Oommonwealtk police; a stores officer has been in charge of the whole area and a storemau has been in charge of the particular store, together with his staff. A t the time of the robbery special electrical warning appliauces were being installed-thes e have been completed and it is practically impossible for any one to break into the store without being detected. Insofar as the question asked by the honourable member for Robertson is concerned, I wish to state that the razor blades were imported primarily for service requirements. Over all, there has been no excess, but in one particular brand there is an excess quantity due to the fact that this blade fits a. razor of a particular design only. It was rather fortunate that this excess quantity was available, as acute shortages developed within the United States Army, and the Commonwealth Government was able to make immediate supplies available. The reason for placing the razor blades into Commonwealth-owned Store was not that ascribed by the honourable member. All the razor blades were taken into store in order to enable certain distribution decisions and arrangements to be made. Insofar quantities of other goods is concerned, it is freely admitted that careful and requisitioning difficulties. so diverse and change so rapidly shortages Practically all the deficiencies in requisitioning, estimation There have been very few excess importations under lend-lease. now established, which provide for careful examination sion, should ensure that very few, if any, approved quantities in excess of essential requirements.
