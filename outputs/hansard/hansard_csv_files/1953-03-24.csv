JOHN SOLOMON EOSEVEAE, M.P. UT. MENZIES (Kooyong Prime Minister) I have to inform honourable Tuesday, H March, 1958.",9,Setup
1,Mr Speaker (Hon. Archie Cameron),"members officially that the Honourable John Solomon Rosevear died on the 21st of this month, at the age of 61 years. Before Mr Rosevear entered political life, he played a leading part in the affairs of the Timber Workers' TJnion. Indeed, his industrial activities were widespread. He first entered the Parliament in 1931 as the member for the New South Wales Division of Dalley. He represented the -division continuously thereafter until the date of his death. He was re-elected for the division seven times. During his long period in Parliament, Mr Rosevear rendered distinguished services in many and varied capacities. Prom 1932 to 1936 he was a member of the bankruptcy legislation committee. He was a member of the parliamentary committee, established early in 1941, that inquired into man-power and resources for war purposes. From 1942 to 1945, he held the important position of Controller of Leather and Footwear. During the war, that was a very important and responsible position. During 1944 and 1945, he was chairman of the post-war planning committee for the leather and footwear industries. He was the Speaker of this House from 1943 to 1949a long period of service in the most responsible office within the gift of the House. In recent years, as honourable members know, our late friend, Mr Rosevear, had drastically to curtail his parliamentary activihis meritorious public service, and tenders its ties. A couple of years ago, he contracted a severe illness, from which, as was quite obvious to those of us who knew him well, he never quite recovered. It left him seriously impaired in health. He is survived by a widow, a son and a daughter. On occasions such as this, it is always the late Mr Rosevear in the power and profitable to go behind the controversies strength of his manhood. During the last of the political kind that we all have one few years, he was stricken by illness, with another and recapture the really which took the form, first of one attack, warm personal relations that exist between and then of another, but he showed most membersI hope all members of tremendous physical courage in sticking this House. It is in that sense that I to his job, and trying to perform every put aside all kinds of .arguments that one of his duties. I am pleased that the have occurred and remember what, to me, Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has looked were the outstanding features of our back into the past to recall for a moment late colleague. In a land which, I am what this man was and what he did. happy to say, is still a land of opportunity Many years ago, he was the honorary for men of talent and vigour, he was a secretary of the Leichhardt Labour conspicuous example of a man who made League, and an honorary official of the his own way in life with no adventitious aids. He became the Speaker of this House. That, of itself, is a very remarkable story. I always thought he was a man of notable native ability. He was an admirable debater. When he became a member of this Parliament, he took the opportunities that presented themselves to him and added enormously to his store of knowledge. I think that all honourable members will agree with me when I say that until his elevation to the Chair removed him from the ordinary debating arena, he was one of the most powerful debaters in this House. He was a man with whom it was always a pleasure to cross a sword, if I may say so without being misunderstood. So we remember him as a consistent, able and vigorous fighter for the things in which he believed. His own career exemplified the wonderful opportunities that exist in this great and free country for a man, by his strength of mind and his own efforts, to rise to one of the highest positions in the land. I should like to pay this tribute to him, and, on behalf of the Parliament, offer to his widow and children our deep sympathy in their irreparable loss. I move That this Houses expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honorahle John Solomon Rosevear, a member of this House for the division of Dalley and a former Speaker of the House, places on record its appreciation of profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

During the course of that rise he had the honour of sitting, as Speaker, in the chair of this House, and thus occupied the most important position that the House has to offer. He was a most congenial man. He had a most acute sense of humour, and he was always good company. We all regret his passing. All of us' will miss him, particularly the members of the Australian La/hour party, to which he rendered meritorious service and in which his counsels always prevailed.

He was a man whom we all admired because of his personality and integrity. I join with other honourable members in offering our condolence to his widow and family.
