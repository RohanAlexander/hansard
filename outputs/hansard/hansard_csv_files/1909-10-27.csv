CATTS, M.P., Dear Sir, With regard to your inquiry as to wages paid to assistant waiter and pantryman, I may say I was communicated with by telephone from the Federal Parliament on Friday last, and stated that such men were receiving as low as 20s. and 25s. per week in private employment. We do not regard any of these amounts as a living wage, and claim the right to a minimum of at least 42s. per week for an adult; but having no right to refer our case to a Wages Board under the Victorian law, we are compelled to suffer in silence. We have tried to secure a Wages Board, but have received a replv from the Department, on the authority of the Crown Solicitor, that we are not legally entitled to a Wages Board under the present Factories Act. Yours faithfully , In view of that later information, will you take such steps as will insure to the man referred to at least a living wage?",14,Wages

43,24.98 29 Mr Groom,The answer to the hon,19,Western Division
44,21.62 36 Motion .(By Mr Joseph,"COOK) pro.provide Ways and Means to finance it. We aie drifting into a most lamentable procedure in this regard Time after time measures are submitted without any proposal being made to find the money necessary to administer them. Many proposals are brought before the House, the fate of which might be materially altered if honourable members knew that Ways and Means to finance them were to be provided from certain sources. It is unfair to provide Ways and Means for financing this measure by means of Customs taxation. Customs taxation is borne largely by the working classes, and is almost entirely a class tax. Unless duties are levied to a large extent on the necessaries of life, the yield from Customs taxation is Very small. To raise a large Customs revenue, duties have to be imposed on articles in general consumption hy the working classes. under which we are governed provides for the defence of the hearths and homes of the people, those who hold large properties-the wealthy of the community-d o not contribute adequately to the defence of such properties by merely submitting themselves to compulsory training. number of men are called upon to train to assist in safeguarding them, and it is only fair that something in the nature of a direct insurance should be paid by such properties for the provision of defence made very largely on their behalf. The principle of providing for defence by means of direct taxation is accepted in Great Britain. The cost of preparation for both military and naval defence there is largely provided by means of death and succession duties, and the income tax. I need not, however, refer in detail to that phase of the subject, for the honourable member for Coolgardie dealt with it very effectively in a notable speech which he made in this House last session. going to finance the Bill by means of borrowed money, or by Customs taxation? Mr J. H . CATTS -We ought to know whether the cost of defence is to be met by Customs or direct taxation, or whether the Government propose' to borrow for that purpose. Direct taxation would be the best system to adopt. such a purpose is objectionable, and borrowing would be even worse, since it would mean saddling future generations with a permanent debt in respect of the defence of the Commonwealth at the present time. I have -no desire to speak at length. The issue that I put before honourable' members is a simple one, and I hope that the Government will agree to' tbe recommittal of the clause, so that we may provide that the coming into operation of the Act shall be preceded by provision for direct taxation. I trust that, in the' absence of a specific understanding to that effect, the Government will state hpw they propose to find the -money necessary to finance it. is not my desire to take up much time, or to retard the passingof the Bill. The honourable member for Cook has moved in accordance with a motion which the honourable member for Coolgardie'has had on the notice-paper in more than one session, with the object of defraying the whole cost of defence from land revenues. I remind honourable members that we are Whilst the Constitution merely parasites, clinging to a ball which is whirling through space, and that, while ours is only a life tenure, the earth is here for always. In the Old Land the revenue was at. one time divided into three portions, one for the civil list, one for the clergy, charity, and hospitals, and a third for defence; A large and we. know that in one hundred consecutive years of warfare not 'one penny-piece of debt was incurred. It was only unfortunately under the Hanoverian succession that the National Debt grew-and I do not mean unfortunately in view of that succession, because as between the Stuarts and rhe Georges, God knows which was worse! It was in the reign of Charles II . that there was created that huge incubus known as the National Debt of England. It would be simplicity itself if the revenues of the land were devoted to the purposes of defence. If twenty ironclads were required, all the Minister of the day would have to do, if supported by the taxpayers, would be to increase the taxation in order to obtain sufficient money. I cannot understand how any one, knowing our short tenure of life, can combat the idea that the land only should be the basis for raising the necessary money for defence. With our untold millions of acres, we have resources that would impress nationalities more than, perhaps, thefew thousand soldiers we could place in the field. On Customs taxation for the other hand, if we have recourse to the Customs House, then our policy cannot be protective, because, as we know, the more revenue a Tariff produces the less protective it is. To raise money in this way for defence would mean an infamous system",19,Western Division
45,Mr Mcdonald,Are the Government,20,Western Division
46,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.0],"I tof revenue tariffism, which any decent Free Trader would regard witb contempt and loathing. An an uncompromising Protectionist, I have every respect for the true Free Trader, but I have nothing but dislike for the revenue tariff man. I understand the difficulty of the Government, but now is the time'to grasp the nettle and set an example which every other country would wish to follow. the land which has to be defended, and which will always be here, should provide the means of defence. In view of the evils of a national debt, I look forward with some trepidation to our obtaining the necessary revenue from the Customs House. The majority of honourable members are adverse to borrowing; and the State of Victoria alone, which has paid over ^50,000,000 in principal and interest, and still owes ^54,000,000, furnishes what ought to be a sufficient warning. I have restrained myself during the whole time this Bill has been before us, but I enter my protest now. If the House fails to recognise the necessity of ear-marking the land revenues for defence, it will show that it is not wise enough to read the future. I have already cited is the best that any historian could produce in favour of making the lands bear the burden; and in that case, although there was fifty years of civil war, only one-third of the revenue was used in the way I advocate. I support the recommittal of the B ill ; and if the motion be carried, I shall be content with the decision at which the House may arrive, even though it does not meet the view of the honourable member for Cook. response of "" A y e "" when you, Mr for defence out of revenue, or out of loan Speaker, prompts me to say a few words. After the honourable member for Cook had taken a rather unusual course in introducing this question, I think that we might have been given some indication of the intentions of the Government. We have to thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his historical researches, which remind us of Hallam's Middle Ages, and, in view of the expressions of opinion we have heard on. various occasions, particularly when the Budget and the Defence Estimates have been before us, we should have some statement from the Government. Under this Defence Bill' the expenditure will be ^1,750,000 or ^2,000,000 per annum; ^505t> ami it is only right that we should know the direction in which the Government intend to look -for this money. Australia has been singularly fortunate, inasmuch as none of the loan moneys have been used for war purposes. Whatever may be said against the loan system, it cannot bt denied that we have assets for our expenditure. The money has been used in the useful work I repeat that of developing the country, the portion spent in defence being insignificant; and we ought to know whether it is the intention of the Government to meet the forthcoming large expenditure from current revenue. If it is intended to borrow for defence purposes, we are entering a downward path, and are' not dealing fairlv with the people. The Bill provides for compulsory training, and our expenditure on naval and military defence will be very large. At the present time, we have only Customs and Excise revenue from which to defray it. Neither Free Traders nor Protectionists desire to have their Tariff burdens increased. The main sources of the Commonwealth revenue now, apart from the duties on intoxicants and narcotics, are the duties on food supplies, apparel, and so on, whicb bear heavily upon the masses. It would The example of England which not be fair to increase or extend those duties to provide additional revenue for defence purposes. Buti f the Customs and Excise revenue is not increased, we shall either not have a sufficient sum to pay for defence, or shall have to go short in regard to necessary developmental works.' We are considering legislation concerning large projects which will have to be put' on one side altogether, if the expense is: to be paid for out of the existing revenue. The Government must have a policy, and should say whether it is intended to pay formally put the motion, money, and whether, if it is intended to pay for it out. of revenue, the revenue will be increased by direct taxation or by ar> alteration of the Tariff. Personally, I favour an income tax rather than a land tax in this connection, because I think that it would give the larger return, and would call upon those possessing property, whose safety had been guaranteed, to pay the cost. Mr J. H . CATTS -The motion speaks only of direct taxation. has not indicated his preference in the matter. I feel strongly' that' the masseson whom the Bill imposes military service should not have to bear the extra cost)",20,Western Division

I trust, however, that a Minister will indicate the intentions of the Government in regard to effectively financing the defence scheme. In any case, we should see that those whose wealth is safeguarded do not escape fair taxation. If the Government refuse to agree to that, we must vote for the recommittal of the Bill to place our opinion in the matter on record. affords me satisfaction to note that the idea of levying direct taxation to provide funds for the defence of Australia is making headway. When the matter was first mooted by me . in this chamber, it was considered that we should not ear-mark any revenue for a specific purpose, but it is now seen-and will appear clearer in futurethat the cost of defence should be provided by the' wealth of the country. The underlying prinpicle is that, just as the owner of a house pays premiums to an insurance company to recoup him his loss from fire, and as the ship-owner insures against disaster, at sea, so property owners generally should pay for the defence of their belongings from confiscation by a foreign foe. In proceeding on those lines, we are on sound and unassailable ground. may be no misunderstanding because of the remark, of the honourable member for Melbourne, that we propose to tax land solely to provide for national defence, I wish to read a motion which I submitted to the House on the Sth November, 1908. It is this 1. That in the opinion of this House the practice of defraying the cost of national defence out of the Customs and Excise taxa'tion is inequitable and unjust, and ought to be discontinued. 2. That as one of the main objects of national from those of the other States. The Savings defence is the protection of private wealth in its Bank returns do not furnish a wholly relivarious forms, the possessors of such wealth should be required to contribute by direct taxa-able guide, because many persons are in tion an average sum towards the naval and military expenditure of the Commonwealth. That summarizes the position of .those who view the matter as I do. We think that taxation should fall, not on one, but on all forms of wealth. I do not think that the farmer or pastoralist who owns £5,000 or £10,000 of land should be compelled to pay more for the defence of the country than the holder of ,£5,000 or £10,000 worth of Government bonds. pay more than the shareholder, because in the last analysis it will probably be found that bank shares already contribute something to the revenue of the country. I regret that the Government has not indicated how it intends to provide for the defence of Australia. Speaking in support of the motion which I have read, I predicted -and the prophecy will be borne out very nearly-that we shall shortly have to pay £2,000,000 for defence, or 24s. a year for each breadwinner. I added thatThe office-boy earning 5s. per week will give a month's pay to the fund. The farm labourer, the navvy, the miner, and the shearer w ill do five or six days' extra ploughing, delving, and shearing to make up for their rich employer's evasion of his liability in connection with the defence of his wealth. If any one of them were bluntly commanded to do this he would probably revolt. Quite 80 per cent, of the revenue from Customs and Excise duties is drawn from those whose incomes are small, or who work for weekly wages, and possess but little property. I regret that the Commonwealth Statistician has found it impossible to estimate the value of the privately held lands of Australia. He has reported that he cannot obtain the necessary information without the co-operation of the Governments of the States; and they, while not refusing to furnish the information, show no inclinaSo., that there tion to accommodate us.

We ought to know who are resolved to go on making poverty pay for the protection of wealth; and who, on the other hand, are prepared to place the burden of the cost of defending this country on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. ture is the trouble in the case of the English Budget at present. follow the English example in this matter. From the earliest times down to the present the cost of defending England and carrying on her wars abroad has been borne by property. those days, and whenever it was necessary to raise money for war purposes, property in towns and cities was levied upon, so all that the workers had to find were the men to fight the battles. If Australia ever has to fight an invader, it will be the masses of Australia that must defend the country, and it is grossly unfair to expect them also to provide the munitions of war and the cost of maintenance in times of peace. therefore hope that the honourable member who introduced this proposal will persevere with and carry it to a vote, and that we shall get some intimation from the Government of how they are going to finance the increasing burden of defence. That phase of the question has never been properly placed before the community. the various estimates of the cost of defence furnished in the Budget papers from time to time, I have found that no interest has 'been charged on the capital sunk in forts and guns. are continually depreciating they are being charged at their original value as if they were still worth the money first expended upon them. The expenditure on defence has also been continually under-estimated. I believe that if the matter were gone into thoroughly it would be found that we are really spending fully £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum on defence, and that the money is coming almost exclusively from the pockets of those who possess little or no property. That fact constitutes a grievance against which the people of this country have a right to revolt. This proposal will be resisted by those honourable members who have vast possessions and "" flocks on many I hope we shall hills."" Payment by the community of an assurance premium for the protection of their wealth is a very comfortable arrangement for them. But I venture to hope that the masses will wake up to the fact that for them it is an evil and iniquitous arrangement. It should be enough that the manhood of the nation is drilled and disciplined for any conflict, that it should risk existence for the preservation of our independence, without being required also to shoulder the financial burden which should be borne by the accumulated wealth of the country. I should be content to view of the fact that this Bill will not come into operation until the year 1911, there is no necessity for this proposal at the present stage. In the course of the next two years the questions connected with the matter can The kings had vast estates in be fought out, both at the general election and in this Parliament. The necessity for making provision for defence is of vital importance, and must be faced whatever source the money is to come from. But at present debate upon this most important subject, regarding which I admit there is a great deal to be said, will be an unjustifiable call upon the very short period which we have for the transaction of the I remaining pressing business of the session. honourable member who , brought this question' before the House is to be commended. We have been engaged in pushing through a defence scheme practically irrespective of its probable cost, and without any consideration of who is to pay for In the upkeep of this big machine. It seems a very pertinent question to put to the Government from what source they intend to raise the necessary taxation. The people are to-day paying through the Customs Although those forts and guns House about 48s. per head. That, for an .average family of six, is over £ 1 4 per annum. family to pay £ 1 4 . Customs taxation is £ 2 ios. per head. head. A family of six, including father and mother, is not at all excessive.

Compulsion in defence has never been very palatable, to me, but if it is to be adopted, and the cost of it is to be borne by the Customs revenue, it will be one of the cruellest pieces of work that this Parliament has ever perpetrated on the masses. Although wages have been slightly increased during the last few years, and will find their billets filled when they the increased cost of living, chiefly as the result of the Customs duties imposed by this Parliament, has in all the States pracdo something substantial to establish an tically counterbalanced that increase. able member supported the honourable member for Hume in increasing the duties, or his party did. ber has only just awakened. about 300 amendments on the Tariff, all in the direction of reducing duties. If it is the intention of the Government to make the Customs revenue bear the additional burden of defence, it will be cruel to the masses of the people. Another suggestion is that the cost should be met from loan money, but God forbid that we should start a compulsory defence scheme and couple it with a loan proposition. Eveni f that policy were temporarily adopted, the interest would still have to come from Customs revenue, and the masses would have to pay it. I do not say that the land should bear the whole of the burden. Such a proposition would be as unfair as that the Customs revenue should bear the whole of it. But 110 honourable member can object to land and income bearing their proportion of the cost of defence. It is all very well to put off the evil day. We are reminded that the Bill does not come into operation until 1911, and because of that we are, forsooth, asked blindly to accept a compulsory enrolment and training policy, with an expensive Defence Force, and leave to the future the question of devising methods to find the money for it. I do not feel inclined to take that course. I admit that we have not a great deal of time this ses-sion, but no question has come before the House that deserves more consideration than this. It is due to the House that the Government should give some indication, if they have a policy on the subject, of what that policy is. If the money is to be found through Customs taxation, the country is entitled to know it. if the masses supply the bone and sinew for the standing Army which we are about to create, wealth should contribute something towards its upkeep. We should not ask the people, not only to make sacrifices by submitting to compulsory training, but also to find the necessary funds.. There will be some heart-burnings when the Bill, as it stands, is put into operation, because many lads will be taken away from their work, come back. At the same time, it is generally admitted and approved that we should effective Defence Force. I cannot credit sess wealth are not sufficiently patriotic to contribute their share towards the upkeep of the new force. I moved point of order as to whether the proposal is relevant to the Bill. So far as I know, there is nothing about finance in the Bill.. to obstructa systematic game honourable members opposite are playing. opinion in regard to the matter. that an opinion upon the matter is also irrelevant to the Bill. The only question to be considered is whether we are to have defence or not. Do honourable members suggest that unless we propose direct taxation they will refuse to vote for the Bill?

The contention of honourable members opposite is that wealthy ought to bear its share of taxation"", the Government have in view a scheme of and with that view we all agree, the only question being as to the adjustment of the incidence of taxation to secure that result. It is suggested that the greater part of the Customs revenue, amounting to about 80 per cent., comes out of _ the pockets of the masses. A little while ago, when we were discussing the Tariff, one of the chief arguments of the Protectionists, who form a large majority, was that Protection reduces prices, and I I was connected that was its first effect. If the people get their goods cheaper under Protection, it cannot be said that they pay the greater part of the revenue, because it must be really the importer who pays. I The desire of the honourable cannot agree, however, that 80 per cent, of the Customs revenue is contributed by the masses; and, with the honourable member for Coolgardie, I think it would be much more satisfactory if we had before us thoroughly reliable statistics on the question. of the goods pay the duties. member, as a Free Trader, takes that view, or, at any rate, it is a Free Trade view that he is expressing. But the argument that was used throughout the Tariff debate was that Protection not only gives us the I regard the advantage of having the goods manufactured here, but also makes the goods cheaper to the people. At any rate, I merely rose to make the^ suggestion that, perhaps, our Statistical Department could give us some reliable figures on the point. I see that the Customs revenue amounts to £ 2 ios. 8|d. per head, and that, of this amount, 17s. represents taxation upon luxuries. No doubt a fair proportion of the burden falls on the trades unionists; but there are other classes of employees, who are provided for by their employers, and who, therefore, have not to pay the duties. However, this We are faced with is not the time to discuss such a question. The Bill will not come into operation until July, 1911, and I suggest that there will be time in the next Parliament to adjust the taxation. [4.6] I hope that the clause will be recommitted. It is true that the Bill does not come into operation until 1911; but it will be a question placed before the electors at the forthcoming election, and, therefore, it is essential that we should be able to say how the money is to be raised. If direct taxation, the necessary measure could not be passed.before the middle of 1910; and, if we allow another six months before it can be put into operation, we art within a few months of the Bill coming into force. Under the circumstances, the desire that the financial proposals shall go with the Bill is not at all unreasonable.

I had hoped to see the revenue from our so-called Protective Tariff diminishing, and I think every thorough Protectionist had a similar anticipation. AmI to understand that the Prime Minister totally abandoned the principle of effective Protection? I cannot believe that the Government are irrevocably committed to borrowing; at any rate, I deprecate any attempt at defraying the cost of our defence by means of money raised in Great Britain; and it seems to me folly to deal with the question of defence without having before us proposals for the necessary financing of the scheme. The Minister of Defence may be tactically clever in his attempt to bu'rk the question; but the people outside ought to be considered, seeing that they have to bear the cost.

Like other honourable members, I think that to put the whole burden on our land-holders would be unfair; we should tax all incomes, whether from land or from other forms of investment. I refrained as much as possible from speaking on the Defence Bill, because I very much desire the establishment of a proper defence system. Every man who has the good of the Commonwealth at heart must desire that. But Ministers are not as enthusiastic about it as they should be, if they will not make a reasonable proposal for financing this measure, which I regard as only temporary. I cannot believe that it will prove permanently sufficient. Besides £2,500,000, we shall have to find a much larger sum before our defence arrangements can be wholly effective. I ask honourable members to support the motion for the recommittal of clause 2, so that they may draw from Ministers a reasonable statement of their intention with regard to the financial side of this great question. [4.14] -The House would not do justice to itself if it refused to consider how the additional expenditure-no t for the whole Defence Bill is to be financed. We are making very radical changes in our defence system, greatly enlarging our naval* and military expenditure. In the Territorial Forces we propose to enlist a great many of our youths, and have provided; not merely for voluntary, but also for compulsory, service, to secure the widest training possible. In past years, many complaints have been voiced in this Chamber and others have about the inability of the Department to meet the demands made upon it for the establishment of companies of the Australian Light Horse in country centres, the institution of civilian rifle clubs, and other necessary expenditure; but the cry has always been, not that the proposals were not desirable, but that the Commonwealth could notfinancethem. Now a new scheme of defence is being provided for which will greatly increase our expenditure, and we ask for definite information as to how the necessary money is to be found.

Therefore, to provide the cost of defence wholly from Customs and Excise revenue will enable accumulated wealth, which is vitally concerned in defence, to escape a large part of its just obligations. The honourable member for Cook simply asks that the Bill may be recommitted with a view to the insertion of a provision which, while it would not impose taxation, would indicate to the Government the feeling of the House that a considerable portion of the defence burden should be borne by accumulated wealth rather than by the wage-earning sections, of the community.

Every Act of Parliament encroaches uponsome special privilege hitherto held by a boodleier. The following occurred at the Brisbane ConferenceI t was further agreed, after discussion, that Mr Catts' amendment, providing for direct taxation for naval and military purposes, should be separated from the amended motion. The motion foT the Citizen Force and Australian Navy was then put and carried by 24 -to 7 in this form : That the following be substituted for the present plank : "" Citizens' Defence Force, with compulsory military training, and Australian owned and controlled Navy."" The motion of Mr Catts, seconded by Mr Lamond, was put and carried by 29 to 3 in this form : "" That military and naval expenditure be allotted from proceeds of direct taxation."" I wish also to show that I opposed this military business at the Brisbane Conference. I do not believe in compulsory training or extraordinary military expenditure. There should be a financial proposal for finding ways and means attached to every scheme for military expenditure, because it is an unfortunate waste. It produces no bread, increases no national wealth, reduces no taxation, but robs the millions to protect the property of the .few. This is the report of a speech which I made at that ConferenceMr King O'Malley wondered if the Labour party had gone mad on militarism. Labour had been fighting and "" warring"" for justice and freedom, and now they proposed to adopt the most diabolical methods of Europe, and give the gilt-spurred roosters power to blow a bugle and snatch farmers' sons, business men's sons, If the amendment, when suband Labour men's sons, and send them to the front. the honourable member that that matter does not come within clause 2. it does not, I recognise that you are the embodiment of the power of Australia, and I at once submit, but I should have liked to get that in, in order to show how I tried to save even my own party at BrisO'MALLEY (Darwin) bane from this hereditary military madness. ber is supporting them now. can I do?

The clause ought to be recommitted in order to secure direct taxation, because this is extraordinary expenditure. It goes beyond anything that 4,000,000 of people ever did in the history of the world, except when engaged in actual war. It is without example that 4,000,000 of people, a part of a great nation, which is the Mother of 'Nations, the Mother of Parliaments, and the Queen of the Seas, should enter into an unparalleled expenditure of this sort without making any provision for ways and means. Any man, whether a business man or three parts foolish and one part business, would get his plans and specifications for any expenditure that he was entering upon. Yet seventy-five members, chosen for their intellect and knowledge, day after day vote away millions of the people's money, and make no provision whatever to ascertain where it is coming from.

If we are not good trustees in the national sense, we are certainly not fit to be trustees in the private sense. It is admitted by the best military thinkers of the twentieth century that fortifications are useless. Yet every penny of this expenditure may be spent upon building torts in which men may be imprisoned to be shot down, just as Bazaine was at Metz.

It has been shown during this debate that if the cost of defence is to be provided for by means of Customs and Excise taxation, the poorest man -with the largest family will have to pay as much towards the cost of the system as will the richest man with the smallest family. Lloyd George has shown' that in Great Britain the burden of taxation has fallen hitherto on the multitude of the workers and the battlers on whom we have lived. Why should we provide for the cost of this B ill by Customs taxation, which must be borne by the poor in the proportion of ten to nine? The Labour party are the missionaries of the twentieth century. We are trying to carry the gospel to the'' heathen. We feel that the wealthy ought: to pay their fair share towards the cost of defence, and we hope to convert the Ministry to our way of thinking TheyI can assure have gone on the wrong track, and we desire to draw them from it . We wish to COOK -The Speaker has save the Government from themselves, but apparently it is useless to discuss this question further.

All this I wish to be money is to be wasted, while we make no provision to improve the lot of hundreds of our own people who are in a state .of semi-starvation, and live in hovels.

CATTS -That was how 1 sard, page 1603, while the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill was under consideration, I moved that it be recommitted for the reconsideration of clause 10. That, sir, was held to be in order, and upon its rejection on division I movedThat the Bill be sent back to the Committee for the purpose of reducing the age at which pensions are payable under section 15 of the principal Act as amended by clause 10. The honourable member for Maranoa askedIs the honourable member in order in moving to increase the charges on the revenue? The late Mr Speaker Holder then ruledI have not to decide that point now. The question before me is the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration of clause 10. If the House recommits the clause, it will be competent for the honourable member to raise the 'His point in Committee. The decision of the Speaker was that the purposes for which the recommittal was asked was a matter on which he was not then called on to give a ruling. It was certainly open to debate, if the B ill had been recommitted, whether such a proposal would have been in order; but the Speaker would not then give a ruling. As a matter of fact, the Chairman of Committees not after had previously decided that such a proposal would not be in order; so that there wasreasonable ground for strong difference of opinion. The essence of the proposal was to recommit a certain clause; and I submit that the ruling I have quoted governs the present case. page, in the second column', showing that Exception was then taken; and the late Speaker saidI rise to order.

No member of the Force shall be_ compelled to answer any question as to his religion, nor shall any regulation or other order compel attendance at any religious service. The question is that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of considering the new clauses as read. I do not object to the recommittal of the Bill for the consideration of the clauses as read, but I foresee difficulties from the present mode of procedure. If the motion is carried in its present form, it will be an instruction to the Committee to deal with the new clauses as you, Mr Speaker, have read them out, and with nothing more. If a further new clause is necessitated, I do not see how the Committee will be able to deal with it in the circumstances. Minister is trying to avoid a recommittal of the whole Bill in such a way that endless amendments may be moved, and from his point of view he is quite right, but he ought to see that, in view of the previous decisions of the House, the recommittal of the Bill would not reopen the question of the clauses with which the House bas already dealt. If , however, the Bill is to be recommitted in the way which is now being adopted, I can foresee endless trouble, and I would advise the Minister, in the interests of the proper conduct of business, not to insist on the motion being put in that form. going to do?

It does open up vistas of possibilities so far as delaying the Bill is concerned, although I am not suggesting that that is my honourable friend's intention. The honourable member for Corio has been away sick, and consequently has bad no opportunitv to bring these matters before the Committee. In the circumstances it will be only common fairness to allow himto put his case. Mr J. H . CATTS I submit that, the proposal of the honourable member for Corio is not in order. I understand that he has moved that the Bill be recommitted, but the House has already decided that two portions of the Bill shall not be recommitted. If he moved to recommit a certain other portion of the Bill he might then be in order, but a bald motion that the Bill be recommitted, without specifying the particular clauses, is, I submit, out of order. plainly that new clauses are dealt with in Committee after the original Bill has been The dealt with. The honourable member forCorio is now moving for the recommittal of the Bill for the. purpose of proposing certain new clauses. If that motion is agreed to, it will be impossible in Committee to deal with anything but the question of the addition of those clauses. Mr J. H .

I have no doubt, however, that the Minister will succeed in weaving something efficient out of the present unsatisfactory web of clauses and powers to prescribe. I can sincerely hope so, at any rate, for I have great trust in my honourable friend. [5.37] I hope the Bill will be recommitted.

CATTS -Yes, I wish to indicate that when the Bill is recommitted I propose to move another new clause. I do not think it is necessary for ' me to specify it. that the honourable member was going to do something of that sort, and I told him that he had already spoken. The honourable member said he desired to speak to the motion of the honourable member for Corio. He would have been in order in doing so, but he is not in order in moving the recommittal of any further clause. He has already moved for the recommittal of a clause, and has exhausted his right. -In order to give the honourable .member for Cook the opportunity he desires, but without committing myself to the proposition, I desire to propose the retoria, and applied to this State, but it committal of the Bill in order that a new clause may be added specifying that Ways, and Means shall be provided for the purposes of the Bill from the proceeds of direct taxation. If the Bill is to be recommitted and any honourable member wishes to propose a new clause he ought to be allowed to do so. indicated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh would not be in order, as the House has already decided the question. The question is that the Bill be recommitted for the purpose of considering the new clauses to be proposed by the honourable member for Corio. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee: (Recommittal). move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 6A. In section 36 of the Act the words ' of not less than three years' are omitted."" Section 36 of the principal Act readsPersons voluntarily enlisting as members of the Permanent and.

That provision will be affected only by the omission of the words "" of not less than' three years""; but a consequential amendment of the form of the motion will have to be moved in the Senate. There is, in force a regulation made under this section by which every warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and soldier, and also every petty officer and sailor have to be re-enlisted and medically examined at the end of five years after their enlistment, and thereafter every three years, irrespective of whether or not such an examination is necessary. In 1907 the Military Board tried to overcome the; difficulty by issuing with the approval'of the Minister of the clay a regulation whicb avoided the necessity of that triennial reenlistment and medical examination. That regulation was put in fGrce for a little while, but it was found apparently to be contrary to the provisions of the section,' and an order was then issued that pending the alteration of section 36 of the Defence Act and the form of oath laid down in the third schedule to the Act, the old period' of .re-enlistment for a period of three years in the Permanent Forces should be adhered to.

I am sorry that I was unable to be present to assist the honourable member for Hindmarsh when he moved a day or two ago for the insertion in the Bill of a provision under which all future promotions in the Citizen Forces must be made from those who haveserved in the ranks. That provision was agreed to; but it may be necessary to amend it in another place. I would remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh that in I failed last connection with the British Army men have been put into the ranks for a day in order that advantage might be taken of the rankers' section withregard to promotions. It will be necessary to fix a specified term of service in the ranks in order to meet those who may try to defeat legislation of this kind.

As a matter of fact, in the opinion of some people, too many rankers were passing the examinations. . Men who have been working hard on the guns or performing other similar duties are-now asked to-pass an examination in English, which is quite proper, and also in the following(a) Mensuration -Properties of matter with regard to mass and volume.

Under the head of chemistry, there are(a) Classification of Matter -Gases, liquids, solids. (i) Constitution of Matter -Elements, compounds, mixtures. {c) Study of Water (I.)

If it were only ranker against ranker, it would not matter how hard the competitive examination was; but the injustice arises when we have men from the ranks put in competition with university men, who have received a much better education, and have been specially trained for the examination. If A. B., who is a university man, gets 375 marks, while C. D., who may have been a sergeant-major, gets 374 marks, the latter gets no show at all at the hands of the examiners; and unless we make some provision in the Bill we shall find that men in the ranks will absolutely stop offering themselves for examination. To show howthe ranker is blocked, I may say that the qualifying and educational examination is put first; that is, the examination in which the ranker could do best does not count first as part of the competitive work. The Minister of Defence has been very good to afford me this opportunity, and I ask him to accept this new clause ? Dr.. MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.2] I quite agree with the honourable member for Corio that these subjects are selected for the examination to prevent men in the ranks getting commissions.

This book of regulations bears no date, so that I do not know under what Government or Minister it was issued, and, therefore, speak with absolute impartiality. The very word "" mathematics "" is sufficient to startle the average man who is endeavouring to educate himself at a night school.

I hope that the honourable member for Corio will stand by his proposal, although I do not altogether agree with the three years limitation. If a young man after his recruit drills puts in a 12 months' course, shows special 'aptitude for military work, and is able, to pass a reasonable examination in theoretical subjects, he ought to be given a commission, especially as we have now a difficulty in obtaining officers. The honourable member for Corio proposes to make the period of service too long. making a new departure. We shall need a great many more officers almost at once, and we ought certainly to prescribe a simple examination for the position of second lieutenant. I could well understand a second lieutenant being required to pass an ex amination in the subjects set out in the : syllabus in order to secure promotion to the position of lieutenant or captain.

There is nothing in the original Act that fixes the character of the examination, and if that now prescribed is found to be beyond what is necessary, it may be altered by administration. We are indebted to the honourable member for North Sydneyf o r having pointed out that this proposed new clause will not do away with the necessity for an examination. -it the amendment of the section in the principal Act can mean nothing..

Under. section 14 of the principal Act a candidate has to pass "" the prescribed examination,"" ' and there are only two courses open to us. The first of these is to prescribe the examination in the Bil l itself. That, I think, is most undesirable. We could not even indicate what kind of examination -should be passed.

I am not in a position to say to what extent artillervmen are compelled by virtue of their profession to go; but for an infantryman, there is not the slightest necessity to go so far in mathematics. A man has to take either history and geography, a modern language, or chemistry, and I regard the chemistry subjects as quite unnecessarily severe, while 1 fail to see their utility. choice of one of the three subjects. see why there should be a choice of the sort. History and geography may be all right, though, perhaps, history tends to confuse and to hamper one's judgment. I have no objection to a modern language, but if the idea is to utilize the man as an intelligence officer, I do not see any use in his passing an examination, including easy translation, and easy composition and grammar. most of the objections by simply stating to what extent he has modified or intends to modify the regulations. We may assume that a man who has served three years will be reasonably familiar with the duties, for unless he is quite competent, he ought not to be appointed. No doubt, he ought to have other qualifications. A man who has to lead ought to have some grounding in education, because, other things being equal, he' is all the better officer for it. After all, there are very few men who could pass this examination. I know that neither the Minister of Defence nor myself would admit incompetency, and yet I think we should fail, and there are hundreds and thousands of very excellent men, who by reason, perhaps, of their not having been educated in the particular subjects when young, find it almost impossible to read the subjects up for examination. The Minister does not desire it to be said that the men in the ranks cannot rise if they possess ability, and, therefore, he should inform us as to how far he is prepared to modify the examinations. honourable member for West Sydney was net present when I moved the amendment, bat he has noticed section n , which was intended to give men at present in the ranks the right to rise. This is a working man's question, and the man who has to go into the ranks young, and work hard at his capacity for studying such subjects as are set down. The fact is that section 11 has been altogether nugatory. When a ranker becomes an officer, the service Lets the advantage of years of experience in dealing with and obeying men. come out on the military side of the examination. worse system in the world for bringing out has a the qualities of a man or a commander; it brings out often the ability of the man who can cram, rather than those of the man who would be of service in a tight place orable member desire to abolish examination ? . ference to be given to the rankers, with a standard of qualification for all, when we should find no such ridiculous regulations as have been reqd.

I desire that those who have spent fair to the ranker. undergo examinations, when they are made stiffer and stiffer; and if the military examination stood first, very few outsiders would try. At present, however, everything is in favour of the outsider. Would the Minister be surprised to hear that, under these regulations, no man in the Engineer Forces can become an officer? For appointment as an officer in this branch of the service, a man must have served three years in an engineering workshop, including one year in the drafting office, served for three years as an articled pupil to a reputable civil engineer, or have completed a three years' course for bachelor of engineering. A man, before he can join the Engineers, must be an artisan-a n electrician, smith, carpenter, or fitter-and, although he may serve for a good many years, he has no right, in this democratic community, to become an officer, whatever his professional ability may be. If the Minister of Defence is honestly advised, he will be told that those who instruct the officers are really the senior warrant and non-commissioned officers in the Artillery and Engineers. Men who are not good enough to be officers teach the officers their work. the honourable member is intentionally misleading the Committee, but I do not think he is putting the case quite fairly. The"" outsiders'' he spoke of just now are militia men. What chance has a member of the Royal Australian Engineers to obtain a commission under these conditions? men have passed that test? attempt to do so. member's amendment would not improve matters. the honourable member for North Sydney, and to the Minister, that the proposed new section 148 provides that no one shall be appointed to, or receive promotion in, the Administrative or Instructional Staff until he has passed a prescribed course at the Military College.

No doubt he wishes to do his best for the forces. I have brought this matter up on the Estimates year after year, and have been promised, and sometimes obtained, reforms by Minister after Minister, but during the last six months there has been retrogression, of which I think the cause is the increase in the number of rankers applying for commissions. In my opinion, certain subjects are set for examination merely to prevent rankers from rising. I desire that my amendment shall be read with proposed new section 148. Then it would not matter what the examination was, because those who were compet ing would all be rankers. The present examinations are designed to give privileges to a class, and to take rights away from another and more deserving class. Had the Minister had some one at his elbow to advise him, he would not have agreed to the syllabus which has been quoted from. The Act is being administered by unsympathetic persons, who do not like to see rankers' obtaining commissions.

Proposed new section 148 provides that no officer shall be appointed to, or receive promotion in, the Administrative or Instructional Staff until he has passed the prescribed course at the Military College. The honourable member for Macquarie wished to give the same facilities to privates and non-commissioned officers as are to be given to commissioned .officers. The Minister would not accept that. 1 was opposed to the underlying principle. was fair enough to say that the same facilities would be given to all applying for commissions. If proposed new section 148 were amended by the insertion of the words ""applicant o r "" before ""officer,"" it would get over the difficulty so far as applicants for positions in the Administrative and Instructional Staff are concerned, because then even a private seeking promotion could go to the College for the necessary instruction. The honourable member for Corio might look into the matter, and try to draft an amendment, to be moved in another place, which would carry out what he desires to have done. WhatI have suggested would, I think, be sufficient in regard to the Administrative and Instructional Staff, and it should be easy to make the provision apply also to other candidates for promotion. Minister of Defence) [8.35] -Notwith standing what has been said about the disabilities of the ranker, mor than half of e our permanent officers have risen from the ranks. have been rankers, and that should he the shops, finds, if he desires to secure a comcase here. that the provision which the honourable higher than the position of a non-commismember for Corio wishes to insert would sioned officer.

The examinations must be as . prescribed by the Director of the Military College, and our object should be, not to only one mark less he is passed over. lower the standard of education, but to multiply the facilities for acquiring it. 1 promise the honourable member for Corio that I shall look into this matter very thoroughly, and that no effort of mine will be wanting to secure for the ranker every opportunity which he should possess for qualifying for a commission. orable member for Corio does not wish to make the examinations easier. He is ready to accept the stiff examinations prescribed in the syllabus. What he wishes to do is to give the ranker the opportunity to obtain the necessary qualifications. A man who has been in the Royal Artillery or Engineers for a number of years must know more about practical work than the lad who has just left the grammar school or college, and who would pass the educational test with flying colours. There are not many in Australia who can afford to keep their sons at school until they reach the age of seventeen or eighteen years. No doubt, a smart boy of fifteen can work quadratic equations, and knows a little about mensuration, including logarithms, but the average lad has to leave school when he has passed the standard of the sixth class, and, unless exceptionally brilliant, has not then acquired a sufficient knowledge of mathematics to be able to pass an examination based on this syllabus. The lad whose parents can afford to send him to a college will be able, when he reaches eighteen, if there is anything in him at all, to master the matters referred to in the syllabus, but there is in Australia only a limited number of lads of that class who can get commissions.

In my younger days I often met men in the ranks of the Permanent Forces in New South Wales, and was very much surprised at the high educational qualifications which many of them possessed. In mathematics many of them were better qualified than the average university student. In those days Professor Wilson, of the Sydney University, held a lieutenancy in the Scottish Rifles. He was teaching mathematics at the University at the time, and was astounded at the mathematical knowledge of many of the rank and file of the New South Wales Permanent Forces. will understand that the honourable member for Corio and those who are supporting him in this matter do not desire to officer the Australian Army with incompetents so far as educational requirements are concerned. obstacles that prevent a ranker from ever going higher than the position of a non-commissioned officer. As the honourable member for Corio points out, the ranker will have an opportunity of going to the Military College when it is established, to supply the deficiencies in his early education. Many of us were misunderstood in our attitude towards the Military College proposal. Our desire was simply to test the practical knowledge and fitness of officers. After all, in all the professions, the sooner a man forgets his early examinations the better it is for him. The object of an examination such aj this is only to run the rule over men; not to see whether they are. educated, but whether they are instructed, which is a very different thing. Education is supplied in the forces by seven or eight years' practical experience in the use of arms, field organization, and command. The test of a good officer is noi how much he can remember on the field of battle of his hydrostatics or his dynamic syntheses, but his knowledge of handling troops, and the power of his arm. Scholastic examinations are no more than tests of retentiveness of memory. As things are now the lad whose parents can afford to send him to college can at the age of eighteen or nineteen walk into the commissioned ranks. I do not say that he should not be admitted, but certainly the obstacles in the way of the ranker should be removed. Eveni f the Minister is right in saying that the honourable member for Corio's desire is already met by the Bill, the carrying of the amendment will make assurance doubly sure. An interesting instance is to be found in. the career of Colonel Owen, now a highlyplaced officer in the Department of Home Affairs. He obtained his training in Mort's Dock Engineering Company. He learnt his trade with the original intention of being a mechanic or artificer in connection with engineering work, but he had an aptitude and desire for engineering and joined the Volunteer Engineers. He became an officer of high standing in the Engineer Forces of Australia, but is no longer on the active list. That is the class of officer that should have been retained I hopethe .Minister in the forces. He is a practical man. He was not college fed or college bred.

If the honourable member for -Corio has made a mistake he has made it with some experience, whereas the Minister bas not had experience. He has to rely simply upon the advice of his Central Administration. supporting the honourable member for Corio. The Minister alluded to two officers in South Australia who failed in their examinations on the practical and not the theoretical side. I am glad that the Minister has brought that case before the Committee, for there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in regard to it. In the theoretical tests, where everything, was in black and white, they passed with honours, but in the practical test, in connection with which there was nothing in black and white, they failed. No one could say, apart from the examiners, whether the candidates did right or wrong. that they have been fairly treated? but they wonder why they failed. practical -test. in that respect I think that the examination is very, unfair. In Victoria three men failed at the same time, but they have since been re-examined and have passed. The two South Australians, on the other hand, have not been given a chance to pass. Such occurrences will be detrimental to the defence system. I hope that the Minister will see that these two men are afforded an opportunity to undergo a thoroughly practical examination, and that a record is kept of the marks secured by them. would appear that whilst a record is kept of the marks secured by candidates in the theoretical examinations, no record is kept -of those secured in the practical tests. think that the fairest course to pursue would be to have a record of the marks secured by candidates in both the scholastic and practical tests, and that that record should be open to inspection by the candidates and others. Applicants for commissions who had failed would then have an opportunity to learn what their shortcomings were. I have heard a good deal of talk as to the failures in practical tests, and those who have failed have received no satisfactory information as to the grounds on which they were rejected. In all these matters, everything should be open and above board. It is not right that a man who gets within one or two marks of the number necessary for a pass I have much pleasure in should be deprived of an opportunity to be re-examined. The marks secured in each division should be recorded, and those who obtain the highest aggregate should win. _ That is the practice followed in connection with rifle competitions, and indeed, in connection with the election of members of Parliament. The returning officer, in determining the choice of the people, takes'into account the returns, not from only one polling booth, but from the whole electorate. If the course I suggest were pursued, there would be no cause for complaint. As one who sympathizes with the ranker, knowing how difficult he has found it to secure a commission, I shall support the proposed new clause. As a humble volunteer in Tasmania, a good many years ago, I found that people from outside could secure commissions, while men in the ranks were denied well-deserved promotion, although they had sometimes to tell the officers who marched .beside them what they had to do. to understand why the object which the honourable member for Corio has in view could not be secured under section 11 of the principal Act, if the Minister of the day were really worthy of his position. The section readsIn the first appointment of officers preference shall be given, in the case of equality of quali. fications, to persons who have served in the Defence Force for three years without a commission. The Minister prescribes what those qualifications are to be. If he allows to be prescribed qualifications that have the effect of deliberately shutting out men who, in accordance with section 11, have served in subordinate positions for three years, he is not fit for his position. The' duty of a I Minister is surely to guide his Department on questions of policy. We have in the principal Act a broad statement of the",48,Physics

I may say that an official mark is relied on in the Old Country. If honourable members turn to clause 19, they will find, on comparing it with the section in the original Act, that at present an elector who desires to vote, must not only have his name on the electoral roll of the division for which he seeks to vote, but must also reside in the' division. An amendment is proposed providing that the appearance of the name on the roll shall be absolute proof of the elector's title to vote, subject, of course, to his answering the statutory questions as to whether he has voted previously, and so on. Hitherto, it has been held to be possible to upset an election if it could be shown that an elector, at the time be voted, did not reside in the electorate. resides in two districts? one can do that. The elector will be compelled to declare his; place of residence, and will be entitled to vote in the division in which it is situated. deavoured to simplify procedure by reducing the number of forms which now have to be used in connection with registration and postal voting. forms in use for applications for enrolment. The first of these is for applications for original enrolment, the second for applications for transfer from one electoral division to another, and the third for applications to change from one subdivision to another within the same division. This is confusing to electors, and, in their interests, and to prevent the inflation of the rolls, it is proposed to substitute for these three forms a card, upon which the elector will declare: first, that he is an inhabitant of Australia, and has lived here for six months continuously, which is necessary to entitle him to original enrolment; secondly, that he claims to have his name placed on the roll for the subdivision in which he lives, and has been living, for not less than a month preceding the date of the claim j thirdly, that he is not under twenty-one years of age; fourthly, that he is a natural-born or naturalized subject of the King; fifthly, that he is not disqualified; and sixthly-in the case of an applicant for transfer or changethat his name is on the electoral roll for a certain subdivision. If ' t h e claim is an original one, he adds the words "" no other "" before the word ""subdivision,"" to indicate that his name is not previously enrolled. In Western Australia the card system is already in existence, but two cards, original and duplicate, are being used. We intend to adopt the card index system, and to utilize a single card only. ' On the cards being received by a registrar, he will make entries in his register, and then forward them to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of the State, who will ascertain whether the applications are for original enrolment, transfer, or change. It is hoped that by this system the rolls will be kept purer, and made more complete, and that it will be easier to trace electors than it is at present.

431,Mr Fuller,"Yes ; as many as areany longer. This is a purely machinery Bill, in which there are no departures in principle from the Electoral Act. If honourable members desire to submit any amendments I should like them to let me havethem as early as possible so that I may have an opportunity to confer in regard to them with the officers of the Department who have had in their hands for some years the working of the electoral laws. My sole desire in submitting this Bill is to make our electoral machinery as complete as possible, so that the elections may be carried out in the purest and most satisfactory manner throughout Australia. on the roll for an electorate from which he has been away for more than twelve months without securing a transfer, how can the Department make him transfer his name to the roll for the electorate in which he is actually residing? there are any means of compelling him to secure a transfer. An elector -is entitled to member ought to know what occurred in vote in the electorate for which he is enrolled. honourable member for Yarra, the name of the elector would be struck off the roll of the electorate in which he formerly resided. out that information is obtained as to such removals when the lists are being compiled, and that if information as to such cases were supplied to the Department in that or in any other way the name of the person concerned would be added to the roll for the electorate in which he resided and removed from the roll in respect of the district which he had left. 1 congratulate the Minister of Home Affairs on the provisions of the Bill which will enable additional polling places to be established in the various divisions. That is a step in the right direction. The old practice used to be to have only one polling place in each subdivision, and that method of grouping electorates prevented thousands of electors from recording their votes. The change proposed is very necessary, more particularly in mining centres, where settlements grow up rapidly and consist of men from all parts of the Commonwealth. In one corner of my electorate, within a few months, over 1,400 men gathered. They had come from mining fields all over Northern Queensland, and at the last general election the majority of those men 1 were disfranchised. They did not have time to secure postal votes, as they were far removed from the returning officer. Thesame experience fell to the lot of men in other parts of Queensland. I rose, how-' ever, to deal more particularly with that portion of the Bill which relates to postal 1 voting. To my mind it opens the door to the most flagrant violation of the secrecy of the ballot. At the last by-election for Echuca no less than 1,800 postal votes were recorded. This Bill provides thatAn elector who(a) has reason to believe that he will not during the hours of polling on polling day be within seven miles of any polling place for the division for which he is enrolled . . . may make application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. Under that clause every elector in the community could record his vote by post. Queensland at the State election before last. A more disgraceful state of affairs could not be imagined. Under the system of voting by post there the secrecy of the ballot was violated in the worse possible way. Any man may say that he has reason to believe that on polling day he will be more than 7 miles from a polling booth, and will, therefore, be able under this Bill to vote by post. similar provision in the electoral law of South Australia, and it has not been abused. South Australia are apparently so honest that they need no laws to control them. able member say that the secrecy of the ballot was violated in Queensland ? ment of Queensland appointed 300 justices of the peace of their way of thinking, so that their party might' have their services in witnessing postal votes. In many cases these justices of the peace were canvassers and paid agents of the very party that had conferred upon them the commission of the peace.

It is idle for the officers detective could have found grounds for aof the Department to say that there is no abuse of this system in Queensland; and such a statement can only arise from gross ignorance or wilful misrepresentation. In the second election for the Federal Parliament an election was declared invalid, and the country and the parties were put to great expense, owing' to the abuse of the postal votes. It was proved in Court that such votes had been obtained in an illegal' manner; and we remember that when the election was recontested the present member for Melbourne defeated Sir Malcolm McEacharn. votes for the city of Melbourne. election presented a worse case, because then there were 1,800 postal votes recorded. If the postal vote is allowed as prescribed, how can a man depend on its proper use, especially in view of the manipulation of the women's vote in Queensland? An employer may go to a man, and tell him that he will be sent away on business on the day of election; and the postal vote can be recorded as the boss desires. All persons familiar with elections know the old method, under which a man would go into a polling booth, put a blank piece of paper into the ballot-box, and thencome outside and say to another, "" Here, you take this in and bring vour ballot-paper out.""
