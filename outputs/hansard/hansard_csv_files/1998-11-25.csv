So within three new rebate, not one cent. Although this months of the new rebate coming in, we will amending bill gets rid of the old scheme in see the insurance companies taking their first the year 2000, the minimum incentive paybite out of it.

But, if this proposal does not get the health insurance funds, from the private through the parliament, is the minister going hospitals and from the medical profession to to do what the public is calling for and put control costs.

The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) ActWednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 687 Wednesday, 25 November 1998 BILL (No.1) 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by Mr Vaile: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (10.00 a.m.)-The opposition intends to support the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998. It basically repeals the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978 to end the equalisation of export returns received for dried vine fruits, and it also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to take account of the fact that the Australian Food Council's Processed Meat Forum has replaced the former National Meat Processors Association as the meat processors' representative body. With the repeal of the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978, this legislation continues the initiative of Labor in 1991 which saw the equalisation for the domestic market abolished. It is very important, especially in this day and age, that producers in all rural industries respond to the market signals that exist where the product is sold extensively on international markets. This particular piece of legislation will make sure that producers in this industry receive better market signals from the marketplace for the products they produce. It is an industry that has undergone significant structural change over the past decade, and it is like many other rural industries at this point in time: it is coming to grips with its commercial and market environment and the changes in that environment. There have been significant structural changes. The number of p,roducers has declined considerably and we have seen Australian production in this area decline as well, but in the international marketplace there is increased competition for the products we sell, even in the face of world production that has increased by 130,000 tonnes in 199& to 770,000 tonnes. To give you an idea of the change in the production, consumption and export of this particular commodity, in 1988 the production of sultanas was 71,766 tonnes. That has declined to an estimated tonnage of 36,000 tonnes in 1998. That is a fairly significant drop. For raisins there has been a slight increase over the period from 2,265 tonnes to 2,300 packed tonnes. But when you take the total production of sultanas, currants and raisins, there has been a decline in packed tonnage from 78,768 tonnes in 1988 to just over 40,000 tonnes estimated for 1998. The domestic consumption of this particular product, or this range of products, has also declined slightly. In 1988 it stood at 27,877 tonnes. That was down in 1996 to 25,513 tonnes. Exports have roughly been halved over a decade. I noted in the 1996-97 annual report of the Australian Dried Fruits Board some very interesting comments on the crop of the 1996-97 season. The report said that the crop of the 1997 season was the smallest dried vine fruits production for 70 years. It severely reduced the export capacity of the industry. The 1997 year was typified by a light crop, a large intake of product by the wine industry and reduced plantings as growers moved from the production of sultanas to wine grape varieties. What we have seen in this industry over the past decade is an alternative use for land and water in major production areas, which has induced many",132,Notices
359,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,"688 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 farmers to switch their productive base to supply the wine industry. That particular industry's growth has been spectacular over the past 10 years. I was at an NFF dinner last night, and the guest speaker was Mr Brian Croser, past President of the Winemakers Federation. He gave a very lucid and entertaining address on the wine industry and challenged the audience not to view his industry as a rural industry but as part of the entertainment industry. By the nature of his address, one would suspect it falls in the latter rather than the former category. It was an extremely entertaining address but challenging to those present, because he outlined the spectacular growth of the wine industry over the past decade and its potential for future growth. Of course, that is one development that has significant implications for the industry which is the subject of this legislation today. The reality is that the market is inducing many farmers out of producing for the dried vine fruits industry and into production for the wine industry. I think there is a danger here for the dried vine fruits industry in that it cannot have too many producers moving exclusively from one activity to the other or else it will lose its capacity to supply quality produce to reasonably lucrative export markets. The industry has undergone significant structural change in the production and marketing areas, and the internal structures of the industry have changed substantially as well. But the future of this industry will be determined by the sorts of factors that are at work in all our rural industries at the moment, particularly market access for the products that they produce and their capacity to enter and sustain viable export markets. Of course, the future of the industry will be driven by continued improvements in productivity and efficiency. Market access issues are very important to this industry, and the industry will be watching very closely the next round of WTO negotiations that we will be preparing for in the course of 1999. The increased productivity and efficiency along the production and marketing chain will obviously be critical to this industry in positioning itself into the new millennium. Issues such as the protection of the land and water resource base are perennial for all sectors in agriculture today. This is an industry that relies oli a fairly heavy chemical input into its production processes, and environmental issues are certainly issues that this industry has to grapple with. It is perhaps not one of the big rural industries but it is important to particular regions of Australia, particularly in the state that I come from; the Mildura area is very much dependent on the production in this particular industry. The opposition, in making those few remarks in this debate, supports the initiatives in the legislation. I should point out that the great reforms in Australian agriculture were made by Labor in government over the 13 years that we held the reins of government and I am pleased to see that the government is continuing the process that we began in 1991. I guess that if there is one source of disappointment in all of this it is that the industry really did expect that this legislation would be on the deck for their 1998 season, but it was not. There were good reasons for that. . We understand that the government in its first term had a lot of problems with instability, resignations of ministers and the sacking of ministers from their portfolios. In that situation, the legislative schedule of the government got fairly much out of kilter. I have made the point before in these debates to honourable members opposite that it was a source of disappointment to many in the rural sector to see the government go through these traumatic times. The government had some seven resignations from the ministry over a period of 2Y2 years, and Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 689 that is the worse record of any government since Federation, certainly in our postwar experience. Of course, one of the sufferers in that situation was the legislative program of government. Industries such as this expected the government to legislate in 1998 for their 1998 season. But we have the legislation here now that is going to prepare the industry for the next season. It is a measure, as I said earlier, that will certainly mean that producers will receive more accurate price signals from the marketplace. It puts the industry on a better footing to cope with the demands that will come upon it as it seeks to make its way in very competitive export markets. We will also be supporting the amendments to the Pig Industry Act of 1986. That act provides some changes to the selection process for the committee that makes recommendations to the minister with regard to membership of the Australian Pork Corporation. The term of the· current board of the Australian Pork Corporation runs out on 30 June 1999, and the amendment will allow for a new board to be formed by that date. I understand that the peak industry body, the Australian Pork Council, is generally supportive of this legislation. I am pleased that the opposition will be offering no opposition to this piece of legislation. We will support its passage through the House. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1998. I thank the honourable member for Corio for the indication that the opposition will support the amendments the bill makes-a pleasant surprise, in the circumstances. They are fairly simple measures. The fact is that the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978 is antiquated for present conditions, and the industry acknowledges that. It is interesting to look back, I dare say, over the history of certain industries and see the changes that have taken place. The particular provisions that were within the act were seen as being necessary some years ago, as was so in a number of industries and not just those under the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act. Of course, changes have taken place. I dare say that the major change in this particular industry, as with other agricultural industries, was when England decided to join the Economic Union---or the Economic Community, as it was at the time-because Australian industry before then had been tied very closely to supplying that particular market and there was no actual competition, because the market was assured. In return, we bought Bedfords, Morrises, Austins and other goods and produce from England. But that all changed. I also believe that this proves another point about competition, that it is not just the outside forces that are at play. As the honourable member for Corio mentioned, other crops are at play. Obviously, the producers look closely at what they can make a profit from, and some are moving from the dried fruits industry into the wine grape industry. Maybe in a few years time they might even move back to the dried fruits industry, depending on the markets at the time. The Australian wine industry has been very successful, and I note that the honourable member for Corio tried to claim the credit for the Labor Party for all the changes in agriculture. I remind him that most of the controls in these industries are at the state level and while we might have some control over exports-giving some freedom in those areas-the controls are in the state areas. When I was Minister for Water Resources in New South Wales, I clearly recall attending a meeting in Griffith in 1988 after I became the minister, and I looked very closely at what",133,Representatives Main Committee
360,Mr Causley (Page) (10.13 A.m.),"It is with great pleasure that I rise in support of the690 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 . was known as farm maintenance areas. These were very interesting little conditions that were placed on farmers. They were set in about 1915, probably with good reason because the irrigation areas were set up at that time. It was a decentralisation scheme to try to get people involved in those areas. Some boffin in the bureaucracy was given the job of deciding what area was profitable and economic. So we had farm maintenance areas. As a young and inexperienced minister, I stood up in the Griffith town hall and announced that I was going to abolish home maintenance areas. I was lucky to get out of town that night. Change is always difficult and people saw a risk of big companies taking over. I saw that the Department of Water Resources in New South Wales told producers where they could grow grapes, how many grapes they could grow, and what size their properties could be. To me that was absolute interference in the marketplace, and it did not achieve efficiencies. If government gets out of the hair of the farming community, farmers will achieve the efficiencies. There is no doubt in my mind that this has been perceived by the dried vine fruits equalisation area, and they have asked the government if it could put this small change through to allow this to be changed. There has been a lot of debate about the pig industry in recent times. I note that the National Meat Processors Association, with reference to the Australian Food Council Processed Meat Forum, is a meat producers' representative body. This apparently has been agreed. I note that the Australian Food Council Processed Meats Forum is to be defined as an eligible industry body, thereby obliging the Australian Pork Corporation to consult before approaching the minister. That is a very important point because in some of the debate in recent times I do not believe there was enough industry consultation, and certainly not enough consultation with the minister about some of the problems that were involved in the importation of pork. It is a sad reflection probably on the previous government that, while they signed the World Trade Agreement, they did not do anything to implement article 32 of the World Trade Agreement which allows industries to adjust to competition from overseas. That was one of the important factors affecting the pork industry at the time. In these areas there needs to be more consultation. I found during the election campaign that what the Pork Council of Australia was saying was not necessarily what the pork producers of Australia were saying. That is not new.

Equalisation of domestic returns was dispensed with in 1991 and the export of dried vine fruits is the only statutory equalisation scheme still operating. The amendments were initiated by the Australian Dried Fruits Association and have been introduced following considerable consultation with industry members. The repeal of the legislation will result in less industry regulation, but, more importantly, it will allow individual companies to realise benefits from innovation and marketing in this important industry. The second element of this amending legislation is the amendments to the Pig Industry Act 1986. These amendments result from changes to the industry representative body and will allow for a nominee of the Australian Food Council's Processed Meat Forum to be nominated to the selection committee for the Australian Pork Corporation, in lieu of the disbanded National Meat Processors Association, which is currently stipulated in the act. It also provides for the Processed Meat Forum to be defined as an 'eligible industry body', thereby obliging the Australian Pork Corporation to consult with the forum before approaching the minister on a number of issues, such as making regulations, prescribing levy amounts, formulating and revising a corporate plan or annual operational plan and appointing the Australian Pork Council company auditor. This bill introduces legislative amendments which will provide fOr'lnore efficient operation in two important industries.

Given the nature of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1998 that is before me, I regret to advise that this is probably going to be the most substantive part of my speech. The Telecommunications Act 1997 currently imposes a requirement for telecommunications carriers to notify the Commonwealth where a proposed activity may affect a matter of Commonwealth environmental significance. At the time of drafting the provision, it was envisaged that this requirement in the Telecommunications Act would be superseded by a similar provision in the proposed Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. For this reason, the Telecommunications Act 1997, which came into effect on 1 July 1997, contained a sunset provision of 1 January 1999. Due to legislative and other delays in the environmental reform program of the government, it is proposed to extend the sunset",136,Representatives Main Commiitee

Whatever criticisms may be made in respect of delay or otherwise of the environmental legislation, so far as the substantive portion of this amendment is concerned in relation to telecommunications, it is a sensible extension of the sunset clause which ensures that telecommunications carriers fulfil their obligations to environmental standards of the Commonwealth. So the opposition has no difficulty with this bill; it supports it.

We support the bill. greater challenge, and that is to. say something useful for the length of time it takes to getMr Stephen Smith-Or something nice about the Deputy Speaker. election, Mr Deputy Speaker, is always something nice. I will share a few thoughts about this very brief Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1998. It is about a line and there is not too much you can talk about a line, so it is best to talk about why the line is here, I have found. In the meantime, we are hopeful that the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation bolts over from the ministerial wing. The bill before the committee today is a technical one. I compliment the previous speaker, the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, on his attempt to rework the second reading speech-I have had a go as well. It is a technical amendment designed to ensure that telecommunications carriers are still required to notify the Commonwealth where an activity that they have proposed may affect matters of Commonwealth environmental and heritage interest. Under the Telecommunications Act 1997, carriers are required to notify the Commonwealth where an activity they propose to undertake may affect matters of Commonwealth environmental and heritage interest. In essence, section 55 of schedule 3 of the act currently ensures that the Commonwealth has the ability to intervene in matters of special Commonwealth interest. Such interventions must be initially recommended by the environment secretary, known to most of us as the Secretary to the Department of the Environment and Heritage, and involve consultation with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and, where required, the Australian Heritage Commission. Currently, section 55 of schedule 3 of the act has a sunset provision of 1 January 1999. It was envisaged that at this' time section 55 would no longer be necessary as similar arrangements would be in place through the proposed Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 and subsequent heritage legislation. This package of bills, which I hope to have the good fortune of speaking on in the not too distant future, will enable the Commonwealth to intervene in matters of Commonwealth interest. There have been delays in introducing this legislation but the intention is to introduce the bills into the current sitting of the parliament. The proposed Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1998 therefore provides for a temporary two-year extension to the sunset provision-from 1 January 1999 through to 1 January 2001. This will provide sufficient time for the whole package of environmental bills to be introduced and considered by the parliament.

A non-contestedWednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 693 which this bill is being discussed, that that package might also enjoy the support of the opposition, although I doubt it. The scope of carrier activity affected by the brief provisions in this bill covers: installations not authorised by a facility installation permit, that are not a low impact facility, that are not temporary defence installations or not simply a subscriber's connection that does not cross the street. Beyond obtaining owner consent and the relevant state, territory and municipal approvals, the carrier needs to advise the environment secretary of the proposed works where environment or heritage concerns are involved. If the sunset provision of section 55 is not extended, the Commonwealth will have no powers to regulate relevant matters of Commonwealth environmental and heritage interest. For the benefit of those who have chosen to show an interest in this bill, I did track down a copy of the sorts of installations that have already benefited from this provision that we are seeking to extend today through this bill. Such projects include: the joint Optus-Vodafone tower in the Sydney Harbour Bridge area in New South Wales; Mount Blackwood National Park in Mackay in Queensland; Martin Place in Sydney, where I understand Vodafone have deployed some technology; installations by Vodafone in the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney; Optus's work on Dunk Island in the Whitsundays; and there are others such as Orchid Beach on Fraser Island-those sorts of things. So, clearly, the legislation has been doing what it has been designed to do thus far. The proposed Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1998 therefore provides for a temporary two-year extension to the sunset provisions, and I feel I have already covered that subject. . I have a special interest in the link between telecommunications policy and environment policy, which I will not go on about at this stage. I emphasise that the support of the opposition is welcome. I think, with the benefit of hindsight, we all accept that the former Labor Party telecommunications regulatory regime was perhaps skewed a little too much in favour of installation deployment. The package of measures that the government introduced under its telecommunications reforms included this provision that we are talking about today. There is clear evidence that it is making a difference in finding an appropriate balance between the deployment of new telecommunications technolpgy, and environmental and other concerns that our community has. An example I can point to is where the new regime has encouraged the likes of Optus to work with me and Tony Crosbie of the St Augustine's Primary School and John Burrell of Mount Erin Secondary College to have an Optus tower more appropriately deployed on RACV land rather than on the front door area of those school communities. This is a good outcome that would not have been possible without the reforms that the government has introduced. Extending the sunset provision-as it relates to this particular check and balance in technology deployment arrangements-is a step in the right direction, and it shows that conservation and heritage concerns need not be put to one side in the interests of making world-class telecommunication technology available to our citizens.

(Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998 seeks to give effect to some of the social security measures announced in the 1998 budget. All of the measures contained in this bill are essentially beneficial, and we do welcome them. But if members of the government were to be candid they would acknowledge that these positive measures are cast in a very deep lake of shame, especially to elderly Australians. The government will need to do a good deal more to undo the mess which it has created in the delivery of welfare services, before the Australian people will accept that the government's attitude has changed one bit. It must also be said that the opposition is concerned by what the government has left out of this bill. There were several other social security measures announced in the last budget which are not included in the bill, some of which are far from beneficial. This government's track record speaks for itself. Whether it is the betrayal of retirees or families, young people and the unemployed, or the systematic attack upon agencies like Centrelink, the government's form card tells a very perverse tale. They have demonstrated nothing but arrogant indifference to the plight of ordinary Australians and their actions leave nothing but a legacy of shame. During the government's last term, they ripped $500 million out from aged care, introduced nursing home entry fees and extra daily fees and forced many elderly Australians to unwillingly sell their homes.

That is the government's track record when it comes to the commitment to ordinary Australians-the battlers whom the government so faithfully promised to help. This betrayal is a perfect reflection of the government's mean approach to social security. For this reason, it is not surprising that the opposition views this bill, and the government's intentions for the future, with some suspicion. This bill has three schedules, each dealing with different subject matter. Schedule1 of the bill changes the way in which income is assessed and increases the income test limit for the purposes of determining the eligibility for a seniors health care card. First of all, I do support the extension of seniors health cards to a larger cross-section of independent retirees. But the extension of this measure should also be set against so much that has been done to elderly Australians, particularly self-funded retirees, with the nursing home entrance fees and higher daily fees. Self-funded retirees know that this government has not been acting in their interest when it has come to changes in nursing home policy in particular. Nevertheless, I do support this measure. Both before and during my time in the paddock, I was able to listen to the concerns and hopes of various independent retiree organisations, including people like Bill Turner from the Northern Suburbs Independent Retirees, Al Fielding of Burnie Brae, John Bailey of the Sandgate Senior Citizens and many others. They, like most other self-funded retirees, are very supportive of this measure. I know how important the extension of the seniors health care card will be to independent retirees. Holders of the seniors health care card are entitled to eligible pharmaceutical prescriptions for $3.20, with any prescriptions above the 52 per year available free of charge. Under the current provisions, the card is available to people of pension age who are not entitled to the pension because of the operation of the assets test and who, therefore, are not entitled to the pensioner concession card. Qualification is subject to· an income test, employing the notion of ordinary income as defined in the Social Security Act. Ordinary income is generally gross income, with a very limited range of deductions set out in the act. Under current provisions, singles earning more than $21,320 and couples earning more than $35,620 do not qualify for the card. This bill proposes to increase these amounts to $40,000 for singles and $67,000 for couples. Our concerns about the effects upon Centrelink notwithstanding, Labor regards this as a very positive measure, and we support it. The bill also proposes to change the income used to assess entitlement to the card to include taxable income plus the value of any fringe benefits and to target foreign income and net rental property loss. The assessment will be based on such amounts received, firstly, in the most recently completed tax year if the applicant has received a tax assessment notice from the tax office for that year or, secondly, in the tax year before the last completed tax year if they are yet to receive a tax assessment notice for the last completed tax year or, thirdly, in the current tax year if the applicant requests this option and provides an estimate of current income which is accepted. This represents a significant departure from the way in which income is currently treated in this context. 696 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 In the memorandum to the bill, the government says customers complain that the current method of assessing entitlement is too cumbersome and intrusive and that, consequently, many customers do not apply for the card. The financial impact of this change is quite significant, with the estimated outlays being $13 million in 1998-99, $28 million in 1999-2000, $30 million in 2000-01 and $31 million in 2001-02. While the opposition accepts there may be some advantages in the new way of assessing entitlement, we are not convinced that the government has fully considered the immediate impact of these changes in the way in which it is costing this proposal. I accept that we are moving in some instances into the unknown here and it will be interesting to see what the costings turn out to be in the years ahead. So, in the long run, change to assessment based on taxable income may simplify the procedure but it may also have unintended consequences. In the short term, the changes would result in considerable extra work for Centrelink, as it is likely to cause some confusion and certainly, from recent experience, very many inquiries from the public, also from people who may not be eligible but who respond to the general advertising of the measure. This will come at a time, as everybody is aware, when Centrelink-and particularly their staff-are already unable to meet customer demand and are currently facing absolutely massive staff cuts. This is a very important area of concern. It is a very bad environment to be introducing such a worthwhile change into. I will return to that in a moment. It may also raise issues regarding the ability of some people to minimise their taxable income to qualify for the card. That is also a considerable problem for the future, and the opposition will be watching that closely. Schedule2 of this bill proposes to exempt people living in certain kinds of accommodation from rules under which single people without dependent children who share accommodation can only receive up to two-thirds of the maximum amount of rent assistance available to people who are not sharing accommodation. This is a very pernicious measure which goes back to a previous coalition budget. This two-thirds sharers rule was introduced by the coalition in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Act 1996 and that was certainly a budget in which very many Australians were punished by this government. The act came into effect on 1 July 1997. We strenuously opposed that measure at the time. We opposed it because we felt that it ignored the actual situation of those renters in shared accommodation. At the time, the government's justification for the rule was that people who share accommodation derive economies of scale from that arrangement-a very, very shallow assessment and subsequently proved to be so. As we pointed out during the Senate debate, the amount of rent assistance paid is determined in accordance with the amount of rent paid. If people pay less rent because they are sharing accommodation, they are likely to receive less rent assistance. People in high rent areas such as Sydney might well pay more for shared accommodation than people in other areas pay for separate accommodation. Many people on low incomes who live in high rent areas have no realistic option but to share accommodation and therefore originally this was a very pernicious and mean measure. The government's argument that shared renters can derive economies of scale in respect of other costs relies upon questionable assumptions about the ways in which shared renters live: for example, that they share food bills rather than buying food individually. While the current provisions exempt from the rule boarders and lodgers, that is, people who are provided with meals on a regular basis in connection with the provision of lodging, they Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 697 do not exempt other residents of boarding houses, guest houses, hostels, private hotels, rooming houses, lodging houses or similar accommodation. People residing in such accommodation do not generally derive any financial advantages from doing so and have suffered very significant hardship as a result of this government's sharers rule. Fortunately, and thankfully for those people, this bill proposes to exempt accommodation from the sharers rule if, in the opinion of the secretary, it is a boarding house, guest house, hostel, hotel, private hotel, rooming house, lodging house or similar accommodation. The secretary's opinion is to be formed taking into account a number of matters such as: whether the premises are known as a boarding house or hostel; whether a manager is retained to administer the accommodation on a frequent basis; whether staff are employed to work in the premises; the existence of house rules limiting the rights of tenants; the number of bedrooms and bathrooms; whether accommodation was offered on a leasehold basis and whether it is available only on a short-term basis. The application of the sharers rule to people in these forms of accommodation is no doubt the most unfair aspect of the rule and has created an enormous amount of hardship. I am very pleased the government has finally seen its error in applying this rule to these people and has seen fit to finally correct one of so many very, very bad changes in social security. Schedule3 of the bill improves the qualification criteria for the parenting payment in respect of single foster carers and extends eligibility for a health care card for children in foster care. Once again, that is quite a beneficial measure. Under the current provisions a child must be wholly or substantially in the care of a single foster carer for 12 months, and likely to remain in their care permanently or indefinitely, before the carer can become qualified for the parenting payment in respect of that child. This requirement does not apply to foster parents who are members of a couple. The bill seeks to remove this requirement in respect of a single foster carer. Under the current provisions of the National Health Act 1953, families who are receiving less than the full rate of family allowance in respect of a foster child do not qualify for a concession card for that child. The bill seeks to extend ongoing qualification for a health care card to a fostered child in respect of whom family allowance is being paid at less than the full amount, provided that the child is a holder of a health care card. It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that, under the measure, fostered children in respect of whom family allowance is being paid at less the maximum rate will now be issued with a health care card if they were included on a health care card or pensioner concession card held by their original family. This intention is not fully reflected by the requirement in the bill that the fostered child must be the holder of a health care card. I do urge the government to amend the relevant provisions of the bill to ensure that the intention expressed in the memorandum is put into effect. That is something we will be watching closely. I said at the outset that this bill contains essentially beneficial measures from the 1998 budget and does not include other measures, some of which are far from beneficial. For example, one particularly harsh proposal included in the budget, but absent from this bill, would treat lump sum compensation payments for pain and suffering exceeding $10,000 as ordinary income spread over 26 fortnights. That is a very, very vicious piece of flagged legislation. In that sense I am pleased that the government has not seen fit to include it in this bill. This would mean that many people receiving such compensation would have a reduced social security entitlement, or no entitlement at all for 12 months. This is very similar to what 698 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 the government has done to unemployed people aged 55 and over, forcing them to use their superannuation before they qualify for benefits-another very vicious act of social vandalism. Thankfully, as 1 said before, we are not considering this proposal here and it would be a pleasant surprise if we could hold out some hope that the government would reconsider it. 'I am sure that the member opposite will take up that cause. Unfortunately, judging from the government's previous record, 1 regard that as being highly unlikely. 1 might now return to the opposition's principal concern with proposals contained in this bill, specifically the government's failure to acknowledge the problems of Centrelink and what effect those problems will have on the implementation of these changes. At least in the short term, the proposed changes to the way in which eligibility for the seniors health card is calculated will cause, as a matter of common sense, considerable extra work for Centrelink. No doubt the proposed change will make it easier for Centrelink to calculate a person's eligibility for the card-that is probably true-but the change will prompt a large number of inquiries from among the large pool of current and potential cardholders. There is no doubt about that. The government has failed to acknowledge this fact publicly and in discussions with the sector, and 1 suspect probably in any discussions it chooses to have with Centrelink. That is not surprising given the government's complete indifference to the problems of Centrelink and, indeed, its cutbacks to Centrelink of recent times. Centrelink has around seven million people who rely upon its services. 1 would urge members of the government to follow the opposition's example to get ou t and take some time to meet with Centrelink clients and the dedicated staff who are very committed to delivering invaluable services to our community. Perhaps then, instead of the rhetoric we get from the minister-who claims she is not responsible-and from her junior minister, we might actually get some realistic assessment of this problem. There is in Centrelink a crisis, almost a gridlock, and you cannot throw a measure like this into the middle of a crisis and expect that it is going to be administered in a competent, efficient and fair way. Centrelink is in crisis, and it is a crisis which is a direct result of this government's obsession with slashing services, cutting budgets and reducing staff. How on earth can you cut $150 million from a budget of an agency such as Centrelink, cut staff by 5,000, and then turn around and say that service is going to increase and that the objective of that organisation is to provide one-to-one service? One-to-one service with 5,000 fewer staff is a nonsense. The government would do very well to remember the debacle and disaster of the implementation of the Youth Allowance in June last year, chronicled in the Ombudsman's report. Do not take the opposition's word for it. Do not take the word of the staff. Do not take the word of the people who were left hanging on the end of phones getting busy signals for weeks on end. Do not consider all the complaints and the letters to the editors of the newspapers. Do not listen to any of that. It is obvious that you have not listened to that. Listen, look and learn from the Ombudsman's report. At the height of the debacle with the common youth allowance, of the 900,000 calls in a single day to Centrelink-900,000 of them-only 90,000 were answered. That is from the Ombudsman. That is where that evidence comes from: 15 million calls in one month, when Centrelink had assigned resources for 18 million calls in an entire year-IS million calls in a month. Two-thirds of all calls to Centrelink currently go unanswered. So, when the opposition moves around the community---even if the government does not---every second Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 699 or third person that you meet can tell you a story about not getting through on the phone to Centrelink. What do Centrelink say? When. they had a press conference a couple of weeks ago to announce the slashing of staff numbers by 5,000, they said that they want people to use technology. They do not want people to see someone behind a counter. They want them to use the telephone. They want them to use the equivalent of an ATM in a kiosk in a shopping centre. But the technology is not working now, and the technology they are forecasting is years away; the crisis is now. The· changes in this biU take effect almost immediately. The changes outlined in this bill will mean another massive number of phone calls to Centrelink at a time when there are fewer staff to answer their questions. It is not too difficult to work out what will happen: more delays, more mistakes, more problems, more pain, more chaos and, at the end of the day, more disrespect for government. Ultimately there can only be one outcome of the government's mean strategy. It is just plain mean and indifferent towards the delivery of services to pensioners, families and the disabled. It is mean and indifferent to the sick; mean and indifferent to all the people named, affected and reported upon in this report. Its case studies are real, but any member of parliament who is doing their job does not need the Ombudsman's report: their office is flooded with these sorts of case studies day in, day out. The government is simply mean and indifferent. Of course, the government does have a solution, doesn't it? It says that the business sector and community organisations will have to fill the void, as government cannot do it all and government will not pay for it all. Who is going to bridge the gap? It is going to be business, we are told by the Prime Minister, and we were told this by Minister Newman yesterday. It is completely illogical and irresponsible for the government to propose to financially jeopardise many voluntary and charitable organisations by the application of a GST on the one hand, and then tum around and expect them to pick up the pieces after the disaster of its numerous policy changes and the cuts to Centrelink. When people cannot get through to Centrelink and they cannot get their money or their pay, where do they end up? They end up at St Vincent de Paul. The charitable, organisations are facing a growing demand for their services. A report from ACOSS a few weeks ago chronicled that in detail. The victims of this process are increasingly being forced to tum to the charitable organisations and they, in tum, are increasingly turning to commercial operations to raise more money to bridge the gap that the government says they should bridge. There has been a great deal said in recent days of the effect of the GST on charitable organisationsa great deal of difficultly sticking vaguely to the content of the bill before the House. Could he bring his attention back to it, please? member has been saying.

372,Mr Swan,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Groups like ACOSS, and charitable700 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 services will not be eroded by budget measures. Allow me to quote some of the comments that have been raised. They say: We will be forced to reduce the level and quality of care, and cut staff caring for older Australians if the Government does not recognise the consequences of some of its tax proposals. That is from Aged Care Australia. They continue: The proposal to tax the commercial and fund raising activities of the not-for-profit aged care providers ignores the fact that their 'profits' provide services and care not available from the government or private sources, particularly in rural areas. An extra tax will reduce this care. The Australian Council of Social Service says: The most critical issue about a GST has always been its impact on low income and vulnerable people. Its effect on the community and welfare services they need is a big part of this. What is the significance of this? The significance of this is that these are the organisations that Centrelink works with. If Centrelink is not working, and if Centrelink is implementing measures like this contained in the budget proposals, the whole system falls apart. I am pleased to say that the government has finally decided, in some sense, to come out of hiding on the issues of Centrelink and the GST. Last week in Tasmania Senator Newman came out and said that she was not responsible for the operations of Centrelink. I have got news for her. That is not what the organisational arrangements of the government say. She is directly responsible for a cut of $150 million to its budget and a subsequent cut of 5,000 staff. These measures are producing chaos and gridlock in that organisation and they will make it very hard for the self-funded independent retirees that are supposed to benefit from this bill to actually get through to the organisation which has to deliver those services. come out and talk to people in his electorate affected by the cuts to Centrelink. We have the problem of the impact on the charities that have to pick up the difference of the GST. This is what the Treasurer had to say on this matter in the House yesterday. He said that charities are actually going to do better. He went on: The argument which is occurring at the moment is in relation to charities which run commercial operations. Where commercial operations are competing with the private sector, we have said that the GST free status extends to non-commercial activity-that is, charitable activity-and not to commercial activity because, by definition, a charity is actually selling a service at a commercial rate in competition with the private sector. That is what the Treasurer said about the delivery of welfare services to the people affected by this bill. Clearly the Treasurer and the government have very little grasp of the reality of community organisations in Australia and the support that they provide to retirees and other welfare beneficiaries. I suppose we should not be surprised. I am completely amazed, however, that the Treasurer and the government should be so ignorant of the situation faced by Australian charities. If you tax the operation of charities, you will impair their ability to deliver vital services and assistance to ordinary Australians. -t is as simple as that. Subject charities to any new taxes and, by definition, all you will do is hurt the people who rely on their services. And that is exactly what the government is proposing to do, and not proposing to walk away from. I understand that very few, if any, members of the government will know someone who relies absolutely on the invaluable assistance of charitable organisations.

374,Mr Swan,"That is very good from the member for Moreton. I will be very pleased toWednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 701 the House, we do. To many of our nation's families and individuals, local charities are nothing short of an absolute lifeline. Make no mistake; if you diminish the ability of these groups to deliver services, you will be attacking those who are in most need. It is the worse kind of hypocrisy for this government to cut Centrelink's funding and staff, announce that it expects charities and community groups to fill the void, and then slap those charities with a tax which will undermine their ability to help those failed by the government. What the opposition understands, and the government has chosen to ignore, is that the difference which needs addressing is not the difference between commercial and non-commercial activities. It is the difference between profit-making and charitable organisationsa completely different concept. The simple fact is that profit-making and charitable organisations engage in commercial activities, but they do so for diametrically opposed reasons. By definition, charities are dedicated to supporting those members of our community who do not enjoy the benefits from profit-making organisations. Their activities have nothing to do with market share, shareholder profits or rationalisation, and everything to do with helping those in need. Despite the Treasurer's obvious confusion, the truth should be fairly self-evident. Hurting charitable organisations will hurt first and foremost those in need. To justify such an attack with platitudes about competition is disgusting, nonsensical and damaging. The government's ignorance, or perhaps indifference, to these issues speaks volumes to all of us who await the next round of GST debate. Let us face it: this government's community and welfare blind spot is exactly why there has been such an impassioned plea for a decent investigation into the GST. Those charitable organisations need it and they need it absolutely and desperately. If the government has failed to grasp such an obvious and serious point, why should the people of Australia trust the rest of its vague assurances? The shOtt answer is that they should not. The cost of applying a GST to the operation of charities is clear. I will once again quote Aged Care Australia: Time after time the Government has demonstrated its complete lack of interest in the situation faced by ordinary Australians. The Government goes into hiding every time it is asked a question which has anything to do with the plight of families, pensioners and other welfare recipients. We saw it yesterday when the Prime Minister refused to say one meaningful word about runaway bank fees. We saw it again when the Treasurer missed the point about the effect of the GST on charities. While we support the measures contained in this bill, we condemn those opposite for their repeated betrayal of Australians and those who assist the most vulnerable in the community. Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (11.02 a.m.)-I apologise in advance that my address is actually going to relate to the 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998. In that sense it is probably going to seem a little out of place here. In responding to the member for Lilley, I make the point that, in terms of charitable organisations, the best thing we can all do as a society, and governments included, is to reduce the potential demand that is placed upon charitable organisations. I suppose we all dream of the day when there will be no need for the Smith Family, the Salvos or St Vincent de Paul. Even Jesus Christ prophesied that there would always be poor people. Like most of his prophesies, it was fairly accurate. 702 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 In terms of reducing demand on charitable organisations, there are things that governments need to do. The member for Lilley was a member of a government that governed at a time when over a million Australians were unemployed and 60 businesses a day were going broke. I worked in an area where houses were being repossessed. They are things that none of us wants to revisit. In terms of minimising the future risk to our nation and the economic welfare of people whose lives were literally destroyed by the recession that we were told we had to have, what we need to do is to reduce, as much as we can, the problems that Australia has in trying to compete with the rest of the world. We also need to set up a tax system which effectively finances social infrastructure in a country that has got rapidly collapsing age dependency ratios. However, the 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill does a number of things. First, it changes the income test for the seniors health card to one that is based on taxable income and introduces more generous income limits for it. This was one of the issues that we considered in some detail in the previous parliament in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The second thing the bill does is to exempt people who live in hostels, rooming houses, boarding houses and other similar types of accommodation from the operation of the sharers rule for rent assistance. On that point, if any honourable members really want to see poverty, just visit some of the boarding houses that are throughout this country. I think it remains an indictment of our society, and of governments of all political persuasions, that people still continue to live in these circumstances, paying the price of deinstitutionalisation from mental institutions, apart from anything else. The third thing the bill does is to align the treatment of single and partnered people by removing the restriction that requires that a single person needs to care for a foster child for at least a year before they qualify for parenting payment. Finally, it will enable a health care card to be issued to foster carers who receive family allowance but who do not currently qualify for a health care card, provided, of course, that the foster child was eligible for a health . card or a pension concession card when they were with their original family. Again, this is certainly another group of unsung heroes in Australia. Over the years, I have never ceased to be amazed by them. At times when you feel despondent about the way our society is going, you see the selflessness of people who frequently have a lot of problems of their own and who take foster children into their homes. Changing the income test for the seniors health card to one that is based on taxable income, and introducing more generous income limits, is something that is long overdue. One of the thematic representations that I receive, particularly from self-funded retirees, is not that they resent people who are on age pensions, but that they worked very hard, they worked at a time when they believed that it was important not to rely on the government-many come from a period when they would have felt some sense of shame at going on an age pension-they saved, they went without holidays, they went without the luxuries that they saw others having, which often in those days was having a car or getting a television set or things like that, and then they finally reached retirement. In my electorate they are living in homes where they have been for 40 or 50 years and they havhad relatively modest incomes throughout their lives. But now property values have escalated enormously and they find themselves living in half-a-million dollar houses but on incomes of $25,000, $27,000 or $28,000 a year and they are finding it extremely difficult to Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 703 survive. They continually approach me and say, 'If only we could get a concession card of some sort.' So this is an extremely welcome measure. The current uptake rate for the seniors card is only 15 per cent of the estimated 240,000 people that are potentially eligible. It is estimated that about 70 per cent of those eligible will now access the seniors card, assuming the legislation is passed. Feedback has suggested to us that the low uptake is because the application process is too complicated. It is also quite intrusive for the benefits that are received-on average, the card is worth about $216. The people who currently apply for the card have to have their assets examined. The process was originally inserted in legislation to determine eligibility for pensions and concessions; it was not originally intended for approval for the seniors card. The measure means that, from 1 January next year, the income test for the card will be based on taxable income for nearly all claimants. I take on board the comments made by the member for Lilley in relation to lump sum payments and I presume the minister will also examine Hansard in relation to this. It will only be adjusted for those people with foreign income and certain employer provided fringe benefits. A person will just have to show their previous tax assessment notice supplied by the Australian Taxation Office, which I think is perfectly reasonable. The income limits for the card-and this is a significant thing-are going to increase from $21,232 to $40,000 for a single person and from $35,620 to $67,000 for a couple. One of the groups that I think we all have some concern about are those who retire early, who retire before pension age-at 55 or up to the age of 65. Some of my constituents have said, 'I have retired and I am 59 and I want to get the seniors card.' One way to put it to them is that the pension age is the benchmark for income support and that, while all governments would obviously like to give as much as they can to everybody, unfortunately there is a limit to what we can actually do. By the years 2000 and 2001, the budget estimates on this measure are $31 million. You would love to extend it to people in younger age groups who have retired but, unless we are living in a country that is growing at six or seven per cent or unless we cut services in other areas, if we want to finance social infrastructure on something other than debt and asset sales, we have to limit the extent to. which we provide these sorts of supports. The measure will greatly assist self-funded retirees, especially in relation to pharmaceuticals, which I know will be welcomed in the electorates of all of us whatever our political persuasion. I think there are many things upon which the major political parties ought to agree. We ought to be constantly looking for common ground, not just trying to fight one another and engage in ideological posturing. But every now and again someone says something in the Main Committee, in the chamber or in the committee process which really stops you dead in your tracks and reminds you that there is an enormous difference between the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Labor Party. In the process of writing our report for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in the last parliament, we were debating the need to provide a seniors card for self-funded retirees and how high up the income scale we ought to go. One of the Labor members, whom I will not name, because I think he is one of the good people, said-to the acclamation of his Labor colleagues, I might add-'Of all the people in my electorate that I worry about, self-funded retirees are at the bottom of the list.' He went on to say, 'When I have families who are earning $25,000, $30,000 or $35,000 a year, with two 704 MAIN COMMITI'EE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 kids, why should I worry about someone that has $400,000 in the bank and already owns their car?' In one sense I can understand people having that view or attitude but I think it brings into stark contrast some of the different philosophical attitudes of the two major political parties. I asked him if he minded being quoted on that, and he said he did not, but sometimes people need to be protected from themselves, particularly when they are otherwise good human beings. Finally, I can tell you that, of all the groups that I worry about in my electorate, self-funded retirees are either at the top or very close to the top, particularly when 30 per cent of Il!y electorate are self-funded and not working. We also need to recognise that there need to be rewards in life for people who make sacrifices and strive very hard to care for themselves and their families. I know $31 million is a lot of money but it is not a lot really when you think of the savings that these people have given to government and future taxpayers by providing for themselves. entirely with the comments of the honourable member for Bradfield. I think his reflection upon the role of self-funded retirees in this nation was a very worthy one, and that is why I want to be associated with them. The measures contained in this bill are not just about rewarding the efforts of self-funded retirees; they are also about sending a signal to others who may aspire to follow in the footsteps of self-funded retirees. There are many people in our communities who, when they look at things such as the forced acquisition of retirement incomes under superannuation compulsory savings measures-which were set up under the previous government and continue under this government-say, 'What is the point? We are not very confident that the value of our efforts with regard to saving for our retirement will be valued by government and government measures.' In fact, it was not until the advent of this government that we finally saw some administration in place that wanted to send good, strong signals to self-funded retirees and those who aspire to be self-funded retirees. This bill confirms the government's word as written. This is a government that puts forward a proposition and fulfils on it. We work very hard on the negotiation process in the other place, in particular, to make sure our word becomes law. But there is the effort of those opposite, day in and day out, and their constant negativity, their constant effort to tell us everything that they oppose rather than to state in any coristructive way what they stand for. It is this government which is proactive, which is producing some strong results for this country, and which promises to do so much more, if given the chance to pass this bill. I welcome the support from the Australian Labor Party for this government measure. This is a government which has listened to older Australians, which helps older Australians, and which is giving them what they want. The member for Lilley, in his own words, is now back from the paddock. I am not sure exactly what grass was in that paddock. I suspect there were some varieties of clover there, because I think he is not listening to his constituents-and has not been listening-as well as he should. It is unfortunate that the member for Lilley is part of an opposition which is so vigorously opposing the government's private health insurance rebate measure. If you want to talk in the context of this bill about providing something that self-funded retirees want to see, it is private health insurance rebates extended to 30 per cent. I suspect",146,Representatives Main Committee
375,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.13 A.m.),"Firstly, I would like to associate myselfWednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 705 they would love to see rebates go to 100 per cent, but 30 per cent is a measure that is supported strongly by them. SoI would recommend to the honourable member for Lilley that time in the paddock has not been spent as productively as it could have been. He came to this place with a 'party first' approach. He was tossed out after one term by somebody who had a 'community first' approach-the former member for Lilley, Mrs Elizabeth Grace. I would welcome the return of Mrs Grace, because she was a strong advocate for the people first, not the party first. I find it always disturbing when the Australian Labor Party continue to try and unravel history. But the member for Lilley in his contribution today has yet again shown that rewriting history-in fact, drawing a line pre 2 March 1996-is his style. He wants to hide the fact that he was part of an administration and part of the Labor Party machine that produced the administration which did so little for self-funded retirees in this country. Having dealt with the member for Lilley, let us get onto the positive notion of this proposal. A seniors health card given out a lot more universally than it has been is something that self-funded retirees in particular want. Self-funded retirees copped it pretty bad under Labor. It you talk to self-funded retirees on a pretty constant basis, as I do, they know all too well that this government has at least delivered on what it said it would do. The tool for changing the particular arrangements that have been the case with regard to the health card is simply the changes to the taxable income ratio. In fact, the income test levels will increase from $21,320 to $40,000 for a single income person, and from $35,620 to $67,000 for a couple. In addition, we are streamlining the system that the Australian Labor Party left behind. They left a cumbersome and intrusive system. Even the member for Lilley confessed that in his contribution. The system was all over the place. It borrowed from many parts. There was a very small take-up of this health card of some 15 per cent. The paperwork was confusing. It was intrusive; it was cumbersome. It was the sort of thing that people gave up on rather than try to negotiate. So this government is doing something about tidying that up. This is all about implementing a number of the 1998 budget initiatives. Now, in the Family and Community Services portfoli,O-it was previously Social Security-220,000 self-funded retirees are going to benefit as a result of this bill. We will be exempting people living in commercial boarding and lodging accommodation from the application of the sharers rule for their rent assistance payment. We will be extending the eligibility for health care cards to children in foster care. We will be aligning eligibility requirements for parenting payment for all foster-carers. Essentially this is good news. It will mean that cardholders will be eligible for pharmaceuticals at the concessional rate of $3.20, with any prescriptions above 52 a year being free of charge. This is the good news signal to self-funded retirees in particular that their effort is to be rewarded. It is the good news signal to those who aspire to apply effort to their conduct as citizens in this nation that their effort will be rewarded. We have had a problem in this country where those who have sacrificed, those who have put something away for tomorrow, have been discriminated against just by the way the legislation works. Self-funded retirees are completely generous in their nature. They do not begrudge-and nor does anybody, I think, on either side-for a moment the older pension recipients. People who need benefit should get benefit, and this government is right behind that proposal and in fact is improving the range of benefits available to people. But it seems to me that it is not true at all levels of government. The 706 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 member for Lilley might be well placed through his machine contacts in the Australian Labor Party (Queensland Division) to try and influence the Brisbane City Council. They can smile and laugh but this is real life. I have constituents in my electorate who reflect upon the fact that the Brisbane City Council gives a rates rebate to pension recipients but not to self-funded retirees. What they are saying to self-funded retirees is the same thing the Keating government-and the Hawke government before that-was saying to self-funded retirees, and that is, 'We are not going to encourage you to be a self-funded retiree.' This measure is unpicking a lot of that as far as federal government matters are concerned but the Brisbane City Council would be very wise to look at extending their rate rebate to self-funded retirees as a show of support. You could literally end up in a situation where somebody could go off to work for 40 years and live next to a bloke whom he goes off to work with for 40 years. Both earn the same amount of money. One bloke blows the money on a weekly or monthly basis and rightly receives a pension because he has no means to support himself but the bloke next door has put the money aside and saved for his tetirementnevertheless, I think, also responsible, which may be another good word. He has done something to take the pressure off those who have not been able to look after themselves. That particular self-funded retiree, living in exactly the same street next door to somebody who is not a self-funded retiree, will not get an incentive measure like a rate rebate from the Brisbane City Council. They will, though, from 1 January get a seniors health card, which is what this bill before us is all about today. The other thing that both those little anecdotal examples are looking for is the private health insurance incentive rebate that we are offering from 1 January provided the Australian Labor Party passes the measure in the Senate. In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is worth reminding the member for Lilley that there are 33,394 constituents of his that he is ignoring by being part of an opposition that is prepared to say no to the government's private health initiative. That is 39 per cent of his electorate. I know he is pretty good on numbers but there are 33,394 people in his electorate who the member for Jagajaga said yesterday are the rich and should not be encouraged-and should in fact be ignored. They are being ignored by the Australian Labor Party. I would remind him that those 33,394 people in the electorate of Lilley are not likely to be impressed by his particular stand on that matter. is right that the member for Lilley was in one paddock and 33,394 were clearly in another. take a point of order about relevance to bring you back to the bill.

In closing, I would just simply ask that those opposite reconsider their quite stupid, naive and ignorant stand on the matter of the private health initiative. and guidance on matters of relevance. The package of measures before the Main Committee today in this bill, the 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998, flow as a direct result of the coalition's ,1998-99 budget that was delivered so eloquently and thoughtfully in May of this year by our federal Treasurer. Despite all that the member for Lilley had to say, a snippet of which actually related to the bill, this bill is actually about beneficial, thoughtful, good-hearted measures from the coalition that have been made possible by a sound fiscal approach. With the budget back in shape, back in the black and bac,k on track, which was the slogan at the time, that provides new opportunities to implement policy measures that help and support those who need encouragement and support. In my first term as the federal member for DunkleyI spoke often about the importance of the self-funded retiree community and how the coalition government would look after them. That is exactly what happened in the first budget, although not quite to the same degree in the second budget, but very much so in the third budget. This bill we are discussing today is implementing the most recent bits of good news for the self-funded retiree community. In 1996 we opened the batting with what I call tax justice for self-funded retirees, for those low income self-funded retirees who found themselves treated quite nastily by the tax system when compared to pension recipients, people who arguably were in some cases in an equivalent, if not better, position in terms of the funds or discretionary spending power available to them. Over those two years we have seen that improvement embraced by the self-funded retiree community, and the bill before the House today is a further step in looking after that important section of the Dunkley electorate. The budget in 1998 included a proposal to extend the Commonwealth seniors health care card to around 222,000 self-funded retirees. I am pleased that a good many of those benefiting from that measure are in the electorate of Dunkley and I am sure they will be pleased that this bill is being introduced today. The thing that troubled a number of them, and troubled them to the extent that they contacted me during the election campaign, was the fact that the Labor Party had been so wishy-washy on many of the government's good proposals, and this one in particular. They were uncertain about what would happen with this measure if the coalition was not returned to government. I am delighted to see the Minister for Community Services has returned and I can now get right to the nub of my speech. The good news from that election was the return of the coalition. That meant that this measure that had been introduced by the coalition in the budget was certain to receive the continuing support of this side of the House. The bill enacts that proposal and is another step towards turning around the distaste that the Labor Party showed to self-funded retirees. The coalition has been left with the task of restoring an incentive to those people who are in a position to provide for their own retirement.",152,Representatives Main Committee

386,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.25 A.m.),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your support708"" MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 Something that so often comes up when I speak with self-funded retirees, particularly those who are not at all wealthy, those who are on modest incomes and fending for themselves, is how little encouragement they got from the former government. This coalition government is turning that around and is in vivid contrast to the former Labor government that seemed to detest self-funded retirees. The 1,500 self-funded retirees in the Dunkley electorate, enjoying the coastal environment of Dunkley by the bay that stretches from Seaford down to Mornington, will benefit from the extension of the seniors health card. Many of them will remember how the complex application procedure for this card under the former Labor government meant that 70 per cent of applicants missed out on low cost pharmaceuticals. Retirees just did not understand what Labor's requirement of ordinary income actually meant. The coalition has now changed the criterion for the card to be taxable income, a simple, straightforward, clean approach, and it is accompanied by vastly increased thresholds. I listened to the member for Lilley talking about Centrelink. The two Centrelink offices in the Dunkley electorate are staffed by outstanding professionals who work very effectively with us, and where we have a concern or they have a concern we work quite effectively as a team. In fact, as my office is next door to the Centrelink office in Frankston, we often refer to my office as 'the complaints desk'. If someone leaves Centrelink unhappy with the service, occasionally we will get a phone call saying, 'So-and-so is coming in the front door. Here is the story. Can you help us with this particular matter?' So there is a very constructive and positive relationship between coalition members and Centrelink employees, and I am pleased that my office and I and the local Centrelink staff have managed to work in a cooperative and supportive way through a number of the changes that the government has implemented. The member for Lilley also talked about tax evasion. I would guide him towards the coalition's tax plan. We are the only team in town actually talking about a comprehensive review of the tax system. I am not quite sure how the Toorak tractor tax or the very short-lived capital gains tax idea-the only two ideas about tax that came out of the Labor Party during. the eleCtion campaign; those absolutely insightful ideas-would go any way towards addressing the member for Lilley's concerns about tax evasion. If the member for Lilley is genuinely concerned about tax evasion and draws a rather spurious link between that and the use of taxable income as the basis for receiving the seniors health card, I would suggest to him to get on the train that is actually going somewhere in terms of reviewing the tax system to minimise tax evasion-and that is not your side of politics; that is the coalition. You guys think the tax system is just fine, except for taxes on four-wheel drives and hopping into pre capital gains tax assets of self-funded retirees. I appreciate the fact that, in the paddock in which he has been grazing and has kept his form---congratulations on your return-the member for Lilley has not heard about those issues that the coalition is tackling head-on. I am sure his support within the caucus for what the coalition is doing will mean that the member for Werriwa is not the only thinker on the opposition benches. So apprise yourself of those tax reforms and what a constructive contribution they make towards reducing tax evasion. But the link goes further. The member for Lilley was talking about vaguely linking some other related matters that the coalition has had to take to fix up the $10,500 billion bankcard bill the Labor government left for the Australian community. You were in the fortunate situation of having a virtual spending spree in the dying months leading up to the 1996 Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMI1TEE 709 election, almost a Christmas sale on government outlays, trying to purchase support within the community, and then you left the coalition with the bill and we had to do something about it. While you were grazing in the paddock we were trying to work out how to pay the feed bill for those millions of people who rely on income support, for those millions of people who rely on government services and for the worthwhile activities undertaken by the Commonwealth. Someone has to pay for it. It is not satisfactory to leave debt and deficit to our kids. That is intergenerational theft. This government has tackled that issue and, as a result of its prudent examination of expenditures, it is now in a position to introduce worthwhile measures, such as the ones that we are talking about today, that benefit people who deserve the support, warrant the assistance and will benefit from the encouragement the government is providing in these new measures. Probably the saddest thing I see when I talk with some of the members of the opposition is that they cannot connect policy ideas. The warm-up speech by the member for Lilley, the theatrical overblown angry rhetoric that the Australian electorate are sick and tired of-but he has not heard that message in the paddock either-the dry run for the speech to the CPSU that he delivered as a substitute for a contribution to this debate, ignores the connection between elements of government policy. While you are talking about your portfolio-and I admire the gusto with which you pursue your responsibilities-there are a whole lot of other interrelationships. A simple one I would ask you to consider is that, if you do not have the cash, you cannot implement the programs. If you do not do the tax reforms that the coalition is supporting, how do you provide for the 2.2 million aged people that will be in this country in the next decade-half a million more than we have now, if my memory serves me correctly? How do you provide for those people? The stuff does not grow on trees; cash does not grow in paddocks. The interconnection between policy is something this side of the parliament takes seriously. I would encourage the member for Lilley to consider those things and to fold that broader picture into his remarks so that they might be more worthwhile and so that we might be able to get something out of them. In terms of the restoration of incentives for self-funded retirees, the proposition put before the government is good news for seniors and veterans. As the Prime Minister said in an interview on 13 May, this welcome extension provides some recognition by the coalition government of how this older age group came from a generation that was often thrifty, saving for their retirement. But we need to put the encouragement and the incentive back for those people so that they can see that by going without, by being frugal in their working life, by perhaps not having that holiday-though maybe I would be encouraging them to have that extra holiday on the Mornington Peninsula and enjoy the Dunkley electorate-by putting that money aside or by putting it in a retirement savings investment account, they will be able to comfortably live on their own means in their retirement. This is something we should be encouraging. This bill is about encouraging that. Retirees of pensionable age with incomes of $40,000 if single or $67,000 if a couple will receive the Commonwealth seniors health card. These income limits are almost double what they are now. This part of the bill represents a $103 million commitment by the government over four years. The minist-r will know that $103 million is a big commitment-again, a commitment you cannot make unless you have your fiscal house in order. 710 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 The National Seniors Association does excellent work. I know Nancy Field, the representative of the Frankston National Seniors Association and with whom we often have contact, is quite pleased to see that things are happening for the seniors community, particularly the self-funded retiree community. On 15 July, the NSA's Chief Executive Officer David Deans said: NSA has had great success in lobbying the Federal Government to give older people a fair go. I think they could probably count this as one of their successes. A second aspect of the bill is a measure that will assist lower income Australians. This bill proposes that the sharers rule relating to rent assistance will be abolished for those who share in boarding house accommodation. This will mean higher levels of rent assistance for residents of boarding houses. The amount of additional spending involved will be $20 million over four years. Again, that is another example of how, if you do not have the resources, you cannot implement these worthwhile measures. I am reminded of the number of people with intellectual disabilities who are forced to seek some form of supported accommodation in these sorts of boarding house facilities. It saddens me that many are forced to get what is not the most appropriate residential care in these sorts of facilities, and this, I hope, is a measure that will assist those families that have an awesome task of caring for a family member with an intellectual disability. It is one of the issues on the unmet needs reference group that former Minister Smith and current Minister Newman have asked me to convene to look at these issues of unmet needs for disability services. Just by way of example, in the region that I represent there are about 229 people with intellectual disabilities on the supported accommodation waiting list. I think we have nine places through to about the tum of the century, and many of the family members caring for those people have long passed retirement age. It is an important issue and, hopefully, this will make a contribution in the right direction. Foster parents will be assisted by the bill. Carers who receive family allowance at less than the maximum rate will now be eligible for a health care card to be issued to their foster child, provided the child was previously eligible for a pensioner concession or health care card when with their original family. Almost 4% thousand carers will benefit from this measure. Again, it is another example of how, if your fiscal house is in order, you can do worthwhile things for our community. About 900 single carers of foster children will be pleased that the 12-month waiting period for parenting payment will be abolished. Sometimes, for instance, a relative cares for a child, and that 12-month period represents a financial burden that can act as a disincentive for some choosing that courageous and selfless role of a foster parent. To my mind, these people are some of the unsung heroes in our community, and this provision aims to encourage the awesome service and selfless contribution they make not only to their community but to the lives of the young people they take under their wings. They deserve the recognition they are now receiving from the coalition government. In closing, I would like to return to the self-funded retirees issue. I am mindful of the sometimes awkward situation that early retirees face-those who are caught in the halfway house of being under pensionable age but deemed by other policy measures to be retired. As the government's improved financial position continues in the future, that is an area I would like to see a bit more attention given to. In some instances, we find that these people are Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 711 treated as if they have retired, for purposes of calculating eligibility to income support; but, when it comes to other retiree related benefits, they are outside the loop. I hope the minister is taking these comments in the good-natured way in which they are intended. Certainly, down the track there are a few things we could do to recognise either the retired or the not retired status of those people and to look at extending some of the concessions that are available to retirees over pensionable age to that early retiree group within our community. I commend the bill to the committee and I am pleased to see that the opposition is not opposing it. I congratulate the minister on his appointment and the continuing good work that he is doing for the constituency he represents. Deputy Speaker Gash, I commend you on your appointment to the Speaker's Panel, wish you every success in the position, and assure you of our cooperation in the important office that you hold. I thank the honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998, in particular the members for Bradfield, Moreton and Dunkley, who all demonstrated a clear understanding of the importance of these matters and also addressed important social policy issues that are addressed in the bill. The legislation is unambiguously good news, and so it was very disappointing to see the mean-spirited approach of the member for Lilley in responding to this legislation. Even when he had to acknowledge that everything in the bill was good and that the opposition would not be opposing it, there was certainly no demonstration of any compassion or caring for those who are benefiting from these measures, but just naked political opportunism. I thought that was particularly disappointing, particularly since many of the things that he actually said in his prepared address were in fact not even accurate. A lot came straight out of the ALP propaganda machine, in which the honourable member has obviously been a keen player over the years; but in fact you cannot substitute party political propaganda for meaningful policy· development, and there is only one person on· the opposition benches who is prepared to address policy issues. The honourable member for Lilley still prefers political propaganda over an honest assessment of the issues, and that is somewhat disappointing. The reality is that these measures provide real benefits to a.large sector of the Australian community and to many people who had been missing out in the past. The government's response and policy approach to self-funded retirees contrasts markedly with the 13 years of Labor administration. I felt that the crocodile tears of the member for Lilley in relation to self-funded retirees were particularly hypocritical, in view of his government's response in their 13 years to the needs of self-funded retirees. Frankly, they did nothing; in fact there was even an aggressive attitude towards self-funded retirees, a suggestion that these people should be punished for having put aside during their working careers funds for their own retirement. No benefits were ever provided. The government has in fact responded positively. We gave them the tax free threshold equivalent to that for pensioners on the same income-the first time that any positive action had been taken in that regard-and now we are offering to extend fringe benefits to self-funded retirees in a way that they have asked for for years, which provides some degree of equity in our society. As the member for Dunkley said in his remarks, if we do not in fact encourage people to put aside during their working career funds for their retirement, the burden will fall inevitably",153,Representatives Main Committee
387,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Comrnunity Services) (11.41 a.m.)-Firstly, Madam712· MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 on taxpayers in the future. As the proportion of retirees in our society grows-firstly, because people are retiring at an earlier age; and secondly, and perhaps most significantly, because they now live for longer periods in retirement-the burden on taxpayers becomes all the greater; indeed, it becomes unsustainable in the future. So it is important that there be incentives provided by governments in the long term. . I trust that the opposition comes on board and accepts the importance of providing incentives for people to put aside funds during their working careers so that they can adequately care for their own retirement. It is important that there be benefits available also for self-funded retirees. I noticed a number of comments were made during the debate about Labor's incredible decision to oppose the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance, which is one of those measures that provides support for low income earners and those who put aside during their working careers for their own retirement. It benefits both groups evenly, and also provides benefits to the taxpayers in the longer term. The honourable member for Lilley also made a number of comments about health care, and particularly aged care. I draw to the attention of the Main Committee that the government spends about $4 billion a year in subsidies to support the 130,000 residents in aged care facilities. We have demonstrated a real commitment to improving the quality of care that was simply not evident under Labor. After 13 years of Labor, 40 per cent of nursing home residents still shared their bedroom with, four or more people, 13 per cent of homes did not meet fire regulations and 11 per cent of homes did not meet health standards. Labor had that information at their disposal. They commissioned a report which delivered that sort of information but they did nothing. They just left the bill. They left this government to fix up the mess, as has happened in so many areas. We have moved to provide improved capital availability to the nursing homes sector to.ensure that something can now be done to start upgrading nursing homes. The honourable member also had quite a lot to say about tax reform. It is quite extraordinary that the ALP should be opposing tax reform measures, particularly the benefits to pensioners. One of the contrasting features of the last election campaign was that one side of politics was offering real pension increases, real benefit increases, while the other side was offering nothing. The government-the coalition parties-are offering real increases in benefits above the anticipated CPI impact of the goods and services tax--:-a guaranteed 1.5 per cent increase in pensions in perpetuity. All pensioners, all welfare beneficiaries, are better off under the coalition's taxation policy than they ever would have been under Labor. All Labor wanted to do was tax Toorak taxis and introduce a capital gains tax on jewellery or family heirlooms. That was their response to the needs of pensioners. We are not only offering major tax reform which will improve our national economy-and that, naturally, has flow-on benefits to. the whole of our society, particularly those who are dependent upon welfare benefits for their income-but also providing real increases in those benefits. It comes as something of a surprise therefore that Labor, the party that like to go around pretending that they represent the downtrodden in our society, and who claim and feign some interest in those who need particular benefits, are now opposing the potential for real benefits for the welfare sector. I find this quite remarkable. It is a clear demonstration of the emptiness of what the Labor Party have to say about social security and about benefits for those in need. They are crying crocodile tears. When they have an opportunity to actually support real benefits, they complain. Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 713 The Labor Party are supporting this legislation somewhat begrudgingly. They have found it within their means apparently to oppose a 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance-an unambiguously good measure to help people with private health insurance, yet they are going to oppose it. Perhaps it is not surprising because in that same mood they also opposed extending fringe benefits to self-funded retirees. They are not quite that mean-spirited, it seems, but they certainly are prepared to stoop to fairly low depths. The honourable member for Lilley was also critical of the announcement by the board of Centrelink to introduce a new service delivery model to improve the quality of service to Centrelink customers. Again, Labor opposes improved services. The board of Centrelink have announced a new more personalised service delivery arrangement for customers. Centrelink customers-6.2 million of them-will now have better access to the people who control their files, a more instant point of contact with the decision making process and the capacity to talk to the person in their town who is dealing with their file. There will be a broader range of access options, an expanded point of contact with decision making, more Centrelink offices around Australia in more convenient locations and an improved back up for the call centre systems, which often become overloaded, particularly at times when there are changes in benefits or when some problem occurs in the system. People will only have to tell their story once to a Centrelink officer because they will have dealt with the same person previously. These kinds of radical improvements in the service which Centrelink wants to offer to its customers are deserving of community support. Those people who have been frustrated at the fact that they had only talked to machines and those people who have been frustrated at the fact that they had to retell their story to different Centrelink officers will welcome these improvements. I will be monitoring the performance of Centrelink in the delivery of this improved service network; it certainly has the potential to deliver improved customer satisfaction. What is more, it will also provide greater job satisfaction for Centrelink staff. I am sure they will appreciate the opportunity to case manage files, make decisions promptly and deliver the quality of service that Centrelink is committed to and which is so important to its customers. Real benefits and real reform measures are being proposed by the government to improve the quality of service. We are looking to Centrelink-the government's one-stop shop agency-to demonstrate that it has this capacity to deliver personalised service, quicker decisions and, indeed, a caring and compassionate response to its customers' needs. Turning particularly now to the elements of this bill which implement a number of the government's 1998 budget initiatives for the Family and Community Services portfolio, the most prominent feature is the extension of the Commonwealth seniors health card to an additional 220,000 self-funded retirees. Currently, the combination of eligibility and application requirements has meant that the Commonwealth seniors health card is not taken up by many retirees who are currently eligible. Customer feedback has suggested that this low take-up is because the application process for the card has been complicated and intrusive. This legislation will greatly improve and simplify the application process for the Commonwealth seniors health card. More importantly, in recognition of the significant contribution that self-funded retirees make to the community through self-provision for their retirement, the government has lifted the eligibility requirements for the seniors health card by lifting the income limits for the card from $21,460 to $40,000 for a single person and from $35,858 to $67,000 for a couple. This will 714 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 mean that the major benefit for those who take up the Commonwealth seniors health card will be that they will be eligible for pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of $3.20, with any prescriptions above 52 for a year being free of charge. This is an outstanding new initiative that has been taken by the government. It will certainly be welcomed, and has been welcomed, by self-funded retirees. It delivers a degree of equity to the fringe benefits available for those living in retirement. There are changes to the sharers rule. Single people, living in boarding houses, hostels, rooming houses and similar accommodation, did not receive the advantages normally received by people living in shared accommodation. This measure will benefit about 12,OqO recipients. The legislation also extends access for fostered children to the health care card. This measure is aimed at encouraging people to foster children. A health care card will be available to foster carers who receive family allowance and who do not qualify for the health care card, provided the child being fostered was eligible for a health care card or pensioner concession card when they were with their original family. It is expected that this measure will benefit the carers of around 4,400 foster children. We are also aligning the parenting payment for all foster carers as a further measure aimed at encouraging people to foster children by removing an inequity with access to the parenting payment currently existing in the legislation between single and partnered people. It is expected that 900 single foster carers will benefit from the abolition of the 12-month waiting period. I believe these measures are unambiguously good news for those people who are in receipt of benefits and, indeed, it extends benefits to people who in the past have not been eligible. It is a demonstration of this government's care and concern for those in need of assistance. It also recognises the importance of rewarding those who have put aside in their working career for their own retirement by ensuring that they also receive benefits that are provided to other sectors of the community. I commend the legislation to the Main Committee, and look forward to implementing these measures and seeing the benefits that will flow from 1 January, in most instances, as a result of this legislation.

It has been proven over the past two years that it can achieve substantial savings in public expenditure. The data-matching program is also valuable in encouraging voluntary compliance with the rules in place to ensure payments are targeted to those in need. It reminds the community that it is not a case of if fraud will be detected, but when. It has now become an important feature of the review mechanisms that are helping to build the integrity of the system and the confidence of the public that the system is, in fact, secure from fraud. There are ongoing review and reporting arrangements in place to allow the parliament to maintain its scrutiny of the program. The present government, when in opposition, argued successfully for continuation of this scrutiny. The Privacy Commissioner continues to play an important role in ensuring that the government agencies participating in the data-matching program abide by the strict conditions already set down in the legislation to protect the privacy of individuals. In addition to the Privacy Commissioner being able to seek information and scrutinise the activities of the agencies involved in the data-matching program, there is a requirement that those agencies report annually to the Privacy Commissioner. The act also requires that these reports are laid before the parliament. There is also a triennial report to the parliament covering the three previous financial years. The first triennial report is due in the second half of this year. In 1996 the Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, conducted a follow-up of its 1993 audit of data matching within the Department of Social Security. This review was in keeping with this government's 1996 election commitment to review the data-matching program. It can be noted that the ANAO's audit opinion given in its 1996 report was as follows: Overall the department has made substantial achievements through implementing legislative changes, improved reporting procedures, savings collection, better targeting and project evaluation processes. These changes have resulted in both substantial increases in savings generated by the program and in efficiency improvements. When the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 was first enacted it incorporated a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. That sunset clause has, however, been extended by the parliament on three separate occasions. The latest occasion was in 1995 when the sunset clause was extended until 23 January 1999. In part, the sunset clause was kept in place because of concerns in the parliament that the data-matching program would not achieve the expected savings and in part as an attempt to allow the parliament to maintain scrutiny of the program. The data-matching program has now proven that very substantial savings can be achieved, and the parliament has been regularly informed of the operation of the program in addition to its deliberation of bills previously introduced to deal with the sunset clause. The program has become an important feature of the overall social welfare system and one that needs to be given a permanent place in the continuing efforts to maintain and improve that system. In the event that the sunset clause is allowed to come into effect, the loss of savings that could be achieved would be in the order of $560 million over the four years from 1998-99. Accordingly, this bill seeks to remove the sunset clause. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. 716 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 25 November 1998 Amendment Bill 1998 (No.2) seeks to make the data-matching program a permanent feature of the social security system, and the opposition welcomes this. The approach of the opposition in these areas is one which does give great emphasis to responsibility and to incentive but also to compassion. There is a lot of rhetoric thrown around using those words and it depends on how they are put into practice. In an earlier debate, we heard discussions about the ethic of incentive and how people who worked hard were entitled to get additional benefits. I think that is true whether you are dealing with self-funded retirees or low income families. People who work hard to make this country great are certainly deserving of support from the government. That could be nowhere more true than it is with elderly Australians. Someone mentioned the concept of intergenerational theft before. There could be no greater intergenerational theft against elderly people than the imposition of double taxation on them through a GST, for example, or the passing of legislation to take away their family home when they require essential nursing home care. Of course, in this bill we are dealing with another form of theft. We are dealing with theft from the social security system-something which the opposition regards as an extremely serious topic and which must be dealt with as effectively as possible. I am sure that members on both sides of the House will recall that the data-matching program was introduced by Labor, just as was the seniors health card, which was discussed earlier. The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act of 1990 gave effect to measures announced in the 1990-91 budget. Now, of course, the government does not seek to highlight that fact. This Labor initiative introduced a method for detecting inconsistent payments being made to a person by two or more agencies and the detection of possible tax evasion. An independent person listening to members of the government, particularly the minister, could be forgiven for thinking that the government invented measures to catch social security cheats. But it is a matter of record that it was the Labor government which first got tough on social security fraud after the total neglect by the previous coalition government, the government in which the current Prime Minister was the Treasurer and should have been concerned with matters such as that. Labor's original act defined the method of data matching and placed a limit on the number of data-matching cycles. It gave force to data-matching guidelines that have been used by the Privacy Commissioner. The act permitted the use of tax file numbers to assist with the verification with the tax office of income information provided by social security recipients. It also increased data matching between a number of government departments, including Social Security; Veterans' Affairs; Health, Housing and Community Services; Employment, Education and Training; and the tax office. Labor's initiative placed Australia in the enviable position of being recognised as a world leader in fraud and review work. In fact our approach was copied and adopted by a number of other nations. TodayI want to signal that protecting the tax revenue that pays for social security from fraud and abuse is a very important priority of the opposition. We all need to take responsibility. It is a very important word, responsibility-for ourselves, individually, but we also need to take responsibility for each other. We as a community have to reach out to those who are not able, for whatever reason, to get by on their own. That is Labor's historical and contemporary commitment to the social safety net: to look after those who cannot get by on their own.",160,Representatives Main Commitfee
389,Mr Swan (Lilley) (12.03 P.m.),"The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax)Wednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 717 The coalition have a different view. They would actually prefer a system where people did not have access to a decent social safety net. Only last week the IMP recommended that Australia cut the level of unemployment benefits and kick people off at a certain period of time. What was the minister Senator Newman's response? It was very interesting. She said that the government would look at these recommendations to see which ones they could adopt. She is yet to reject the policy prescriptions of the IMP, which were presumably originally written by the government anyway. Labor knows that just knocking people off welfare unfairly does not solve the heart of the problem. The problem in the end can be solved only by creating sustainable jobs and greater opportunity and making sure that people have the skills to get decent jobs. maintenance of the credibility and sustainability of the safety net. To maintain the credibility and the sustain ability of the safety net you have got to stamp out fraud and abuse. It is just not one without the other. You have got to work at both ends of the spectrum. You have got to have both a commitment to opportunity and jobs on the one hand and a commitment to the safety net on the other-and essential to a commitment to the credibility and support for the safety net is stamping out fraud and abuse and error. The opposition is delighted the government has taken up the important work that we began. We are pleased the government is so enthusiastic about the mechanisms that we created. But the opposition is somewhat bemused by the government's claims of leadership in the area and by attempts to claim that we are unconcerned by social security fraud. We do welcome the opportunity of speaking to the amendment bill. We are pleased to remind the government of some of the facts about social security fraud. The original act contained a sunset clause which was to come into effect in January 1993. That sunset clause has been extended three times, most recently in 1995 when it was extended to 22 January 1999. The bill before us now seeks to remove the sunset clause altogether. The data-matching program has proved to be very effective in maintaining the integrity of the social security system. When in government, Labor was running between five and seven data-matching cycles a year for each of the years 1991 through to 1996. Savings in 1993 were $80 million, in 1994 they were $84 million, and in 1995 they were $92 million from that measure alone. Awareness of data matching and the use of tax file numbers by the public have also increased voluntary compliance with the social security system, so the effective savings resulting from data matching are certainly greater than the figures that I have just quoted. When the Australian National Audit Office reviewed the program in 1993 it found it was 'a valuable compliance and control technique'. It is important for us to have on the record the history of the program as it was an important part of Labor's overall effort to put in place a social security system which was effective at identifying and preventing incorrect payments. In 1990-91 when the data-matching program was put in place, the annual report of the Department of Social Security said: An effective social security system makes it as difficult as possible for incorrect payments and fraud to occur, has systems in place that minimise the risk of such occurrence, detects it at the earliest possible stage, deals decisively with the cases which are detected, and creates a public recognition of the risk involved in attempting to defraud.",162,Representatives Main Committee

It is not the system that Labor inherited in 1983, for example. In 1983 our social security system did not have a systematic method of identifying and collecting incorrect payments. When Labor came to power the only method of monitoring the system which was reported on concerned the negotiation of fraudulent cheques. That is the way that most social security payments were made then, by cheque. In the last full year of the Fraser government there were just under 11,000 reported fraudulent negotiations of cheques, with a value of $1.35 million. I am pleased to say that it did not take Labor long to begin the reform of the system. By 1984, Labor had embarked on a major project to convert most payments to the direct deposit method-payments straight to bank accounts-with the goal of reducing the incidence of fraudulent negotiation of cheques. It was also Labor that put in place the range of review mechanisms including mobile review teams, the use of employment declaration forms, the extended use of duration reviews, and the data-matching program. By the end of Labor's .term in government, in just over one year, 237,176 overpayments were identified thereby saving $42 million a fortnight, or just over $1 billion a year. That was a far cry from the $1.35 million in 1982. All these initiatives should sound very familiar to the government because they are almost identical to the fraud catching and review mechanisms which they have been crowing about in the media. This government has not been too interested in the historical facts when it comes to the issues. It just believes there is political mileage to be gained out of focusing on a media strategy of claiming to be tough on fraud. But the fact is that, if you look at the government's cutbacks, particularly its staff cutbacks in Centrelink, it is very soft on fraud because it is actually undermining the mechanisms to implement the strategy; it is undermining it systematically. The government's cost cutting and job cutting agenda is actually undercutting the very effective system that it inherited from the last Labor government. Before it even began its savage 5,000 job cuts, Centrelink's resources were already stretched to the absolute limit. of this bill is to repeal the sunset clause and I would be grateful if he could try and be a little more relevant to the bill itself. a data-matching bill to eliminate fraud, and what I am talking about are the mechanisms to get rid of fraud.

That is the problem. Anyone who works in these organisations, and any member of the public and any member of parliament, ought to be extremely concerned about this situation. If fraud escalates as a consequence of staff cuts, that undermines the credibility of the system. It is not just a question of a political debate here between sides over staff cuts in Centrelink; this goes to the heart of service delivery. If these concerns are not heeded, then we are going to have a growing fraud problem. I appeal to the minister to have a look at this again because at the end of the day it is not the board of Centrelink that is responsible for the integrity of our system; it is the government. It is the minister, Senator Newman, and Mr Truss, the member for Wide Bay, who are directly responsible for this. In the end, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the board of Centrelink. So if Centrelink is less able to conduct reviews, then it is less able to catch social security fraud. bill is a very narrowly cast bill which deals primarily with the sunset clause that is going to be removed from data matching. That is the purpose of the bill. It is a very narrow bill, a very small bill. It has got nothing to do with personnel or with capacity; therefore the member's remarks are irrelevant. Lilley, I will again refer to the minister's speech in which he made the point that it is an important control on personal financial assistance schemes, helping to keep them free of abuse and fraud. I. think that opens the way for the honourable member for Lilley to talk about fraud. The minister also said that it reminds the community that it is not a case of if fraud will be detected, but when. He also said that it has become an important feature in the review mechanisms that are helping to build the integrity of the system and the confidence of the public that the system is, in fact, secure from fraud. talking about fraud and welfare cheats. I just want to make it clear -again that there is an absolute commitment from this side to weed out whatever fraud or abuse there is in the system. What we do not hear a lot about from the government-and I would like to hear a lot moreis about putting in place opportunities for people to move forward, to move off welfare and into work. Governments have to do both. They have to look at how they maintain the integrity of the social security system, but, just as importantly, they have to provide opportunities for people to move ahead, to get off welfare and into work. Australia needs a government that will do both of those things: that will protect the integrity of our social security system from fraud and abuse, but will move people off the benefits and back to work so that they are not actually in the system. Look, for example, at those dependent on unemployment benefits, particularly those dependent upon unemployment benefits for 12 months or longer. more people being caught in the system, and the government seems to be unconcerned about it.

Labor wants to do much more than just make sure the system is not open to abuse. We will support any legitimate means of stopping abuse. We want to make sure the system does not trap people into a cycle of poverty and dependence. Labor intends to make sure that the social security system provides the security of knowing that if you lose your job there will be an unemployment benefit to make sure that you do not fall into poverty. Our system will also offer the opportunity to make sure that, when you do get a job, it will be worthwhile. So we are pleased to support this bill today. We call on the government to recognise that social security has to do so much more than just prevent fraud and abuse, important as that is. It has to provide the opportunity for those who are looking for work to find those jobs and, when they do, to be able to hold onto those jobs and take home much more than they currently do. I encourage him to remain within the same limits of relevance that he was so keen to apply to the honourable member for Lilley. member for Lilley, Mr Swan, stay within those limits because that is the area that I want to confine my remarks to. The government has a very strong social conscience in many of the matters that were referred to by the member for Lilley, and which will be matters for other debates in other places. This government is concerned for people seeking jobs and for those who are on welfare. Every act of this government has demonstrated its compassion and concern for the people, as described by the member for Lilley. Today we are dealing with the control of fraud and the abuse of welfare. The government has decided to remove a sunset clause from the Datamatching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998 (No.2). When in opposition, this government opposed the removal of the sunset clause. The honourable member was right in that regard. We were not sure that there were going to be the gains that the government of the day said there would be by going into data matching. When in government, the Australian Labor Party's program for data matching started slowly. They were so revved up at one point that the Australian Labor Party felt, as a government, that they should introduce the Australia card to make sure that everybody was tagged somehow or other through the taxation system, social security and unemployment benefits. They felt that people should be tagged and identified under a single system which could be data-matched across departments and easily administered by bureaucrats. That is certainly a simple datamatching process but it moves into another matter, and that is the matter of privacy. It is a matter that the member referred to, but not at great length, and I believe he should have done that if he has the concern for people he seemed to express. The conflict in this area is always how much information will be gained and stored in one place; how much information will be cross-matched, and from which agencies; how that information will be held; and whether it will remain private. That is what part of this debate is about. Of course, the other part of the debate is whether or not the removal of this sunset clause removes a capacity for greater personal privacy of the clients of various departments. Whilst we were in opposition, we opposed the removal of the sunset clause because we felt that the government of the day had not demonstrated a worthwhile yield from data matching, in catching or dealing with fraud.",166,Representatives Main Committee

Sitting suspended from 12.51 p.m. to 12.53 p.m. matching where it applies to""the Department of Social Security, that department being the main agency in charge of data matching. The department is given access to a range of files across the spectrum of information held by government, including tax file numbers and other matters. The removal of the sunset clause was proposed by the current opposition when it was in government in 1995, but at that time it was rejected by members of the current government. However, since then we have had an assurance that the results from data matching are successful and that the privacy provisions that worried us at that time are now adequately attended to. I will refer to comments made by an Australian National Audit Office report in 1996 that said that overall the Department of Social Security had made substantial achievements through implementing legislative changes, improved reporting procedures, savings collection, better targeting and project evaluation processes. It said also that these changes had resulted in both substantial increases in savings generated by the program and efficiency improvements. I refer the House to an inquiry commenced in 1993 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs resulting in a report in June 1995 entitled In confidence. That report dealt with the ever increasing amount of confidential information held by government and the information being obtained quite properly so that the government could provide benefits for those enrolled, so benefits could be paid and grants could be allocated. People who provide information to government have a right and an expectation to think that that information is going to be retained in a confidential manner. A report that was prepared for the New South Wales government by the ICAC group in New South Wales identified the sale of confidential information by New South Wales agencies for huge amounts of money, and there was a concern by the House of Representatives committee that that may be occurring in Australian government agencies. There was no indication that that had happened, or is happening, but the inquiry became aware of some very cavalier attitudes amongst Commonwealth government agencies-in particular, Telstra, which seemed to think nothing of tapping its clients' lines in order to gain information about their operations. We need to look at that privacy invasion process when we look at data matching. If my memory serves me right, at that time the Department of Social Security held something like 12 million matches on databases ready for access, and nobody was taking any care of the possible future of those matches and the information held. I think those days have changed. The government has assured itself and, as the Privacy Commissioner has identified, the process has now become clearer. The Australian National Audit Office has said, 'You have clear goals; you are managing this area better,' and the government is satisfied with the results of dealing with fraud. There have been some spectacular gains by the government in dealing with fraud, and that is very pleasing.",167,Representatives Main Commitiee

420,Mr Cadman,"We are debating a bill which seeks to remove a sunset clause from dataWednesday, 25 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 723 I would have liked to have dealt in some detail with the Audit Office report on data matching. Suffice it to say that generally the ministers have presented the details accurately, but I do consider there is a factor of ongoing privacy that must be safeguarded. The removal of a sunset clause is a protection that was put in place so that the parliament could be aware that we were about to extend the data matching for another three years-that it was going to go on automatically. Yes, I know that my time limit is 12 minutes. is going to be attention to the privacy factors with the removal of this sunset clause. I am satisfied at this point that that will happen, but the government needs to be aware that there will be numbers of us in the parliament that appreciate the need to attack fraud. But we are also aware of the high commercial value of the information held by government, of the fact that it can be sold and that it should be retained in such a way that the clients of the government have a right to expect confidentiality. I would like to conclude my remarks by supporting the bill and a splendid government which so assiduously attacks fraud but also has a compassionate heart. the honourable members for Mitchell and Lilley for their contributions, particularly the member for Mitchell, whose experience in this field and the work that he has done in this area in the past is recognised, I am sure, on both sides of the House. I acknowledge freely the importance of protecting privacy in these matters. He rightly rvcognises that there are permanent . procedures in place, and they need to be there not just from the point of view of data matching but in relation to the whole management of personal information by governments. The honourable member for Lilley involved himself in quite a bit of historical revision to try to make out that this measure was somehow all to the credit of the Labor Party. I acknowledge that they certainly introduced the legislation initially and that they at least paid lip service to the idea of stamping out fraud in the social security system. But it has really been only under this government that rhetoric has become action, and we have in fact been successful in saving currently around $46 million a week as a result of stamping out social security fraud and improved compliance. There have been 4Y2 thousand prosecutions under this government, so we are really serious about getting rid of the cheats. Social security fraud is not only cheating on the taxpayers; it is also cheating on genuine beneficiaries. Most people receiving social security benefits do so because they are entitled to them and because they are in need. Those who cheat on the system are in fact placing suspicion on all recipients, and doing so unjustly. So there is strong community support for stamping out welfare cheating, and I think that is an important social objective as well as one that is important from the point of view of maintaining the integrity of the system. This bill will help in that regard. If the sunset clause were to take effect, there would be lost savings of up to $560 million over the next three years; no-one wants that to happen.
