Tissue friction is being studied to ascertain what happens when tissues are broken and disease is likely to enter the potato. These investigations are being continued, and 1 shall obtain a full report on the matter and pass it on to the honourable member. I am glad he has raised this question, because it is obvious that as a result of the increase of the price of potatoes owing to shortages everything possible must be done to prevent losses of the magnitude of 250.0C0 bugs such as occurred in Tasmania this year. Mr S. R. FRASER I address a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. I preface it by saying that 1 hope he will recognize my continuing interest in the matter to which it relates as I recognize his ability to give detailed answers on technical questions. What research has been undertaken by the Commonwealth into the causes, incidence, and extent of a disease known variously as mycotic dermatosis or mycotic dermatitis in sheep? Will the results of any such research be disseminated as widely as possible among graziers in the areas in which this disease is prevalent? made a quick inspection of the animal biology laboratory just outside Sydney. Unfortunately, the matter mentioned by the honourable gentleman was not referred to. Frankly, I had not heard of it before this morning. If it involves one of Australia's greatest industries, it is naturally of week she ceases to be eligible for a pension, great interest to the honourable member and to other honourable members. I shall find out what research has been done with respect to this disease and shall let the honourable member know as soon as I can. the Minister acting for the Minister for Trade. The Minister for Trade stated recently that a senior officer of the Department of Trade would visit Western Australia at regular intervals to discuss the local difficulties in connection with import licensing. Can the Minister acting for the Minister for Trade tell me whether any such visit has yet been made, and, if not, when it is proposed that the first of these visits shall take place? gentleman has raised this matter on several occasions. The Minister for Trade has been endeavouring to arrange for such a visit by officers of his department. I am glad to inform the honourable member that a decision was made early this morning to send two officers to Western Australia about the middle of November. I am not quite sure of the date decided upon, but I think it is either 14th or 21st November. I shall ascertain the precise date and let the honourable gentleman know. Services inform me whether a widow without children is entitled to a widow's pension at the age of 49? What means test provisions apply regarding the income or property of a widow without children? children does not qualify for a widow's pension until she attains the age of SO years. A widow with children, on the other hand, who has been receiving an A class widow's pension and whose youngest child has reached the age of sixteen years, becomes eligible, by a recent amendment of the act, to receive a B class widow's pension upon reaching the age of 45 years. A widow may have a permissible income of £3 10s. a week, or property to the value of £200. without prejudice to her pension. If and when her income exceeds £6 17s. 6d. a and if and when her property exceeds £1,750 in value she likewise ceases to be eligible. Minister tell me whether the Government has considered the situation that has arisen in Europe as a consequence of the revolt of the enslaved peoples against Soviet and Communist tyranny? Will the Government immediately send Australian observers to the areas involved, so that they may obtain first-hand information of the events that are occurring there? Is it not a fact that these peoples were subjugated by force of Russian arms, and have not their governments been put and kept in power by a series of blatant electoral frauds and acts",12,Potatoes

Was not this done under the direction of the late Marshal Stalin, whose career as a murderer and criminal has already been admitted by the Soviet authorities in connection with the internal affairs of Russia, but whose even more monstrous international crimes have not yet been repudiated by his successors? In these circumstances, will the Australian Government direct the attention of the United Nations to the acts of constructive aggression that have been and are still being of Civil Aviation will maintain and care committed by the Soviet Government and its Communist agents against these satellite nations, and will it urge that the United Nations should conduct free elections in the nations concerned, as the only way of obtaining for them their freedom, other than by methods that involve bloodshed? description applied to recent events by the honourable member is substantially correct. There is no doubt, according to the information that we have received, that since the denigration of Stalin a very deep cleavage has developed in the Communist ranks, between Stalinists and non-Stalinists. established a committee and appealed for No doubt this has given some encouragement to people who have for so long been enslaved, in effect, by the Soviet Union.

I cannot give the honourable member an answer to his question at the moment, but I shall give him the best answer possible as soon as I can do so. ""SOUTHERN CROSS"" AIRCRAFT. Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. Before the Minister relinquished the Civil Aviation portfolio, what arrangements did he make for the transfer to Brisbane of Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith's historic aircraft, "" Southern Cross ""? Were arrangements made for the aircraft to be stored at Brisbane or Amberley until such time as a committee was ready to take it over? Will he confirm that the Department for the memorial when it has been completed? Finally, can he give an assurance that there will be no alteration of the arrangements that he made prior to relinquishing the Civil Aviation portfolio as a result of the appointment of a new Minister? Minister for Civil Aviation, arrangements were completed for the removal of "" Southern Cross"" to Brisbane. The honourable member for Lilley has been actively interested in the project. The citizens of Brisbane, headed by the Lord Mayor, funds to house this historic aircraft at Eagle Farm aerodrome. Eagle Farm was chosen, first, because the late Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith was born very close to the entrance gates of the aerodrome, and secondly, because it was the terminal point for his famous trans-Pacific flight. Just before I handed over the Civil Aviation portfolio, I went to the department's store and inspected "" Southern Cross"". Considering that it is a fairly old aircraft, it is in a very good state of preservation. It has been stored carefully and has been well looked after. I made arrangements with the Royal Australian Air Force, which has the facilities, for the transport of the wings and other parts on low-loaders. I have spoken to the new Minister about the matter, and he has the project in hand now. I think that the aircraft will be ready to go to Brisbane within the next few weeks. Arrangements have been made for it to be housed temporarily in a hangar at Amberley, so that it can be renovated and made ready to go to the place at Eagle Farm where it will be housed. The Department of Civil Aviation has made arrangements for a suitable area of land to be reserved at Eagle Farm for the purpose.",13,Europe

In my view, the Federal Government's diagnosis has been faulty and the treatment, in many cases, worse than the disease. In view of Mr Fairfax's strong criticism of the Government and the apparent desertion of this stalwart from the cause, will the Treasurer heed his appeal and proceed, without further delay, to change the policy of the Government taking, even at this late stage, the necessary steps to restore financial and economic stability to Australia? to the honourable gentleman's question is "" No "". ter for Air has only recently taken up that portfolio, but will he, at the first available opportunity, familiarize himself with the Minister whether, in view of the reported existing set-up of the active reserve of the revolts in Poland and Hungary, against Royal Australian Air Force and give his Soviet occupation-indicatin g an imearnest and speedy consideration to any perialistic and colonial control of these projected changes? member for Bowman that I will certainly the Soviet Government against the alleged do as he suggests and acquaint myself very colonial and imperial policies of other fully with the position of the Air Force countries. reserve and its problems.

House, and I trust that this arrangement will meet the convenience of honourable members. Let me start by referring to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Much of the content of this bill can be dealt with quite quickly, for there is nothing contentious about most of it. Clauses7 to 13 simply make the intentions of the legislation passed last session more abundantly clear. They put beyond all doubt that the President of the Conciliation and Aribitration Commission can, by one instrument, assign to individual presidential members, the general responsibility for dealing with industrial disputes in the Maritime, Snowy Mountains and Stevedoring industries. Clauses 17 to 21 are designed to clear up a few drafting points revealed when the act passed last session was finally printed. There is nothing of any substance here, and to be wearied with a detailed recital of the reasons for each individual clause. Clauses deficiencies in the transitional provisions of last session's legislation. The drafting of transitional provisions always presents difficulties and, in the case of the conciliation and arbitration legislation, the difficulties were extremely complex. Clauses 15 and 16 of the bill deal with the right of audience before the new Commonwealth Industrial Court and the old Conciliation and Arbitration Court which has been retained in existence for certain purposes. This matter of audience before these courts has already been raised in this House. Honourable members will recall the instance which brought it to our attention at the first sitting, or one of the early sittings, of the newly constituted Commonwealth Industrial Court. Section 63 of the present Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes provision for audience in proceedings before the Arbitration Commission. It allows, for example, officials to appear for their organizations. No special provision, however, is made in relation to proceedings before the new Industrial Court. Section 46 of the 1947 act contained provisions relating to proceedings before the old Arbitration Court, not dissimilar from those appearing in the present section 63. Section 46, however, was expressed not to apply to judicial proceedings and consequently, strictly speaking, the provisions of the Judiciary Act applied so as to limit representation to properly qualified barristers or solicitors. Nevertheless, even in relation to some judicial proceedings the Arbitration Court appears to have followed the practice of allowing officials to represent their organizations. The Government has considered what special provision should be made in respect of proceedings before the Industrial Court, and has come to the conclusion that the",17,Public Service Arbitration

58,Mr Harold Holt,"I thank thearrangements to operate in future should, generally speaking, conform with the practice of the past. Accordingly, except in relation to proceedings which, put broadly, involve questions of law or involve offences against the act, clause 16 of the bill enables border. parties to elect whether to appear personally, to be represented by lawyers, or to be represented by officials. The bill also provides that even in respect of proceedings which involve questions of law, except appeals from other courts to the Industrial Court, the parties may, if they wish and the court grants leave, be represented by officials. The Government regards this as a practical way of approaching this problem.. The solution is, as I have said, by and large to apply the practice of the past. Clause 15 of tbe bill applies the rule I have stated respect of all persons who may be conto analagous proceedings before the old Arbitration Court. A second matter of substance is dealt with in clause 14. In recent years, the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities have undertaken a number of major projects. The Snowy Mountains scheme, Woomera, Maralinga, St. Mary's and the Menai reactor come quickly to mind. The Opposition, when in government, recognized the desirability of Commonwealth tribunals dealing with such projects. For example, it conferred jurisdiction on the Commonwealth tribunal in relation to the Snowy Mountains scheme. The Government believes that the principle underlying that decision is sound. There is no reason for thinking the Commonwealth will not in future years undertake other great national projects, and the Government considers that it is entirely right and proper that the industrial conditions governing them should be determined by the federal tribunals and not by the tribunals of each individual State. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is the appropriate tribunal to develop codes of conditions applicable to large-scale construction jobs undertaken by the Commonwealth Government and its instrumentalities wherever they may be located. What clause 14 does is to empower the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deal with industrial disputes or industrial trial matters affecting any such project will matters affecting such projects as are declared by the Minister to be Commonwealth projects. The commission will have jurisdiction whether the work is actually undertaken by the Commonwealth or one of its instrumentalities or by contractors or sub-contractors for or on behalf of the Commonwealth or its instrumentality, and irrespective of whether the project is located in one State or spreads across a By and large, the industrial problems that will arise in the case of major Commonwealth projects will concern conditions of employment on the site, but it may be desirable in some cases that the power of the commission should extend to people who are working in connection with the project and not necessarily on the site. The Parliament may not have unlimited power to confer jurisdiction on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in nected with a Commonwealth project. For example, persons driving trucks moving earth to or from the site of the project would appear to be within this power. At the other extreme, people working in a factory supplying equipment for the project may not be. In any case, it might be quite undesirable that they should be so regarded. Therefore, power is given to the Minister in the proposed new section 88B (4) to define who are to be regarded as working in connection with a Commonwealth project, and it will be in relation to such persons that the commission will have jurisdiction. It may even be that there will be some persons working on the site of a project in respect of whom it would be undesirable that the commission should have jurisdiction under this new proposed division. Such persons may be Commonwealth public servants directing operations who are covered by the Public Service Arbitrator's decisions or decisions of the Public Service Board. Yet other persons may be officers or employees of a State Public Service or State instrumentality. To meet this situation, provision is made in the proposed section 88B (3) to permit the Minister to exclude from the jurisdiction of the commission in respect of a Commonwealth project such persons as he designates. Indusbe dealt with by the commission in the normal way, that is to say, by commissioners assigned by the President for the purpose. Other provisions of the present act will enable the President himself to deal with, or to assign a presidential member to deal with, a particular industrial dispute affecting a project. I now turn to clauses 4 and 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and I should like at the same time to deal with clauses 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of the Public Service Arbitration Bill. The need for these provisions really stems from a recent decision of the Public Service Arbitrator, who found deficiencies in amendments to the Public Service Arbitration Act passed in 1955. That decision also led to an examination of the basis upon which the old Arbitration Court and the conciliation commissioners have over many years been making awards in respect of Crown employees, for example, in Canberra and the Northern Territory. The problems thrown up are complicated but, at the risk of over simplification, I will try to explain them briefly. I think it is fair to say that the clauses in the two bills I am now dealing with introduce no new principle or concept. In the past, the industrial problems of Crown employees under the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities have been dealt with by both the Public Service Arbitrator and the old Arbitration Court and the conciliation commissioners. The reasons are no doubt explained by history. Originally, public servants had no access to the Arbitration Court. Only those Crown employees who were engaged in an industry had this right. Of course, in the early days of federation, there were few such people. In 1911, however, all Crown employees, including normal public servants, were given access to the court. In 1920, a separate Public Service Arbitrator was established. The idea was apparently that the Arbitrator exclusively would deal with claims by organizations which were confined to Crown employees. Provision to that effect was made by section 11 of the 1920 act. Some Crown employees, however, and they have grown in numbers over the years, belong to organizations whose membership is not limited to Crown employees. Some of these organizations continued to go to the Arbitration Court and later to conciliation commissioners. Others have gone to the Arbitrator. This division of responsibility led to all sorts of problems, principally in respect of what I might call Commonwealth industrial-type employees. For« [ 7 3] example, there was a tendency for organizations to go to the Arbitrator or to the court or commissioners, depending on their assessment of their chances of getting most -natura l enough perhaps. Different conditions governing the same type of employees awarded by the Arbitrator or the court or commissioners led to dissatisfaction. Those concerned with the functioning of the Arbitration Act and the Arbitrator have commented adversely on the position. The High Council of the Public Service organizations has also been dissatisfied with the position. So have the Public Service Board and the departments. How to go about dealing with these problems has received much attention over the years. For example, an inter-departmental committee was set up by the late Mr Chifley, when he was Prime Minister in 1949, to examine the question. The amendments made in 1952 dealing with appeals and references to the court alleviated some of the problems. In 1955, the Parliament went further. It then empowered the Public Service Arbitrator to refrain from dealing with a claim in certain circumstances. Put broadly, he was enabled so to refrain where he thought it was more appropriate that the claim should be dealt with by another tribunal. This provision, like those contained in the present bills, was really directed to claims in relation to industrial-type employees of the Commonwealth, engaged on work comparable with that performed in outside industry. It was with this provision that the Arbitrator found difficulty. He found himself unable to refrain from dealing with one claim on the ground that it would be more appropriate for the Arbitration Commission to deal with it. First, because section 11 of the Public Service Arbitration Act, as it now stands, prevented the claimant organization taking its claim to the commission; and, second, because in his view the commission was not empowered to do what the Arbitrator was permitted to do, namely, make an award inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth affecting the wages and conditions of the employees concerned. The fact is that the old Arbitration Court and the conciliation commissioners in .the past seem to have been doing just this; whether with or without authority is beside the point, for the bills now before the House make the position clear. So much for the background. What the bills do is(a) to restate the circumstances originally set out in the 1955 amending Public Service Arbitration Act, under which the Arbitrator may refrain from dealing with a claim on the grounds that it could be better dealt with in some other way, (b) to allow the Arbitrator to consent to a claim being dealt with by the Arbitration Commission where he believes it is one which he should refrain from dealing with; (c) to allow an organization comprised only of Crown employees to take a claim to the commission where the Arbitrator refrains from dealing with it or consents to its going to the commission; and (d) to permit the commission, when dealing with matters affecting Crown employees, to make an award though it may be inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth affecting the wages and conditions of the employees concerned. NowI just want to deal briefly with this last point. Ever since provision was made for arbitral tribunals to deal with Crown employees-the Arbitration Court from 1911 to 1920 and the Arbitrator since the legislation has provided that an award or determination may be made inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth relating to salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms and conditions of service or employment, but that any such award or determination may be disallowed by the Parliament. The reason is clear. Employment under the Crown is usually governed by statute. Thus the Public Service Act deals with the great run of public servants and ancillary employees; and statutes providing for the creation of statutory authorities deal with the conditions of employment of their employees. Sometimes these statutes lay down in detail many of the conditions of employment, for example, as to appointments, promotions, discipline, and matters of that character. Sometimes the authority is given power to determine conditions of employment generally or subject to specific legislative provision. Therefore, unless power were given to the Arbitrator to make a determination inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, his function would be very limited. By the same token, however, since a power to make an inconsistent determination virtually gives power to override an act of the parliament, it is necessary that the Parliament should have the right to disallow such a determination. When public servants were first admitted to the arbitration tribunals, public service employment was almost all, if not entirely, governed by the Public Service Act. As time has gone on, legislation applicable to all Crown employees has been passed. The Superannuation Act, the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act and the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act are instances. These acts govern the terms and conditions of employment of Crown employees generally, but as the Public Service Arbitration Act now stands the Public Service Arbitrator could make a determination inconsistent with them. It would appear to be entirely at odds with principle to permit the Arbitrator to override an act of general application and to rest on the Parliament's power to disallow a determination that did infringe such an act. Inevitably, disallowance proceedings lend themselves to political disputation. Similarly, it would seem entirely at odds with principle to permit the Arbitrator to make an award at variance with, for example, the promotions appeals and disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act and other acts constituting services for statutory authorities. Fortunately, the Arbitrator has recognized this. Although it may well be that the Arbitrator, working in a background ol public service tradition, would in future continue to follow this course, it is considered that the matter should not be left to chance. There is, however, a stronger reason; for now we need to put in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the same provisions about awards inconsistent with laws of the Commonwealth as are in the Public Service Arbitration Act. Therefore, we have provided, in both the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the Public Service Arbitration Bill that determinations or awards which are inconsistent with the acts I have named shall not be made. We have also made provision enabling the prescription of other acts or of the provisions of other acts in respect of which inconsistent determinations or awards may not be made. At the same time, we are carrying into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the provisions for disallowance that have always applied under the Public Service Arbitration Act. The remaining clauses of the Public Serand Arbitration Bill, which I have already vice Arbitration Bill require no particular described, will, of course, enable the Conexplanation. Clauses3 and 6 cover mere matters of drafting change. Clause8 removes a doubt that previously existed as to the time at which the Arbitrator should send a determination to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. Clause 10 cures a technical defect which had not previously adjourned. been noticed. Clause 12 fills a deficiency in the transitional provisions of the legislation enacted during the last sessional period. I now turn to the Australian National Airlines Bill 1956 and the Aluminium Inler for Labour and National Service) dustry Bill 1956. The only purpose of these [11.30] I m o v e bills is to exclude the activities of the Australian National Airlines Commission and I have already indicated the reasons for this the Australian Aluminium Production Commission from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator. In view of what I have already said, the particular reasons for these bills need little additional explanation. The adjourned. exclusion of particular classes of Crown employees from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator is not novel. Labour, when in government, excluded employees of the Snowy Mountains Authority. Trans-Australia Airlines is engaged in a ter for Labour and National Service) highly competitive industry. The Govern[11.31] I m o v e ment believes that Trans-Australia Airlines should, so far as its industrial conditions I have already outlined the reasons for this are concerned, be dealt with by the same measure. tribunal as deals with its competitors, that is. the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Both the Public Service Arbitrator and' the former Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration have commented on the problems thrown up when two tribunals deal with employees in the highly competitive ter for Labour and National Service) airlines industry. So, as with the Aus[11.32] I m o v e tralian Coastal Shipping Commission Act passed during the last sessional period of This measure is linked with the earlier ones, this Parliament, we propose that TransasI have explained.

61,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Ministake this opportunity to grieve about the Government's inactivity in relation to the standardization of rail gauges. It is true that the Government appointed a committee of Government supporters to report on this matter, but I think it is regrettable that when Kalgoorlie to Fremantle section. The total the Opposition proposed that a committee representative of both sides of the House be formed to consider the standardization of rail gauges the Prime Minister( Mr monwealth Railways Commissioner has Menzies) did not see fit to appoint such a committee. If we can believe newspaper reports that we have read it appears that the views of the committee of Government supporters and those of a transport committee appointed by the Opposition practically coincide. This matter should not be considered in a party political spirit. The standardization of rail gauges should be a national project entirely divorced from politics. The Opposition transport committee has made certain recommendations on this very important matter. Its first recommendation was that in view of the urgency of coordinating rail and road transport the Commonwealth should take steps immediately to begin the construction of 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge rail links between Broken Hill and Adelaide via Port Pirie, between Albury and Melbourne, and between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle. Because these three rail links were mentioned in that order in the report it does not necessarily mean that the committee regarded that as an order of priority. It purposely refrained from suggesting any priority because it acknowledged that there may be arguments about which link should be given priority. That point should be left to the experts. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, for example, believes that the link between Broken Hill and Port Pirie should receive priority, because it would provide a standard-gauge line from Brisbane right through to Kalgoorlie. However, there are different views on that matter, that will shortly submit a report. and for that reason the Opposition committee considered that it should be left for the experts to determine. If standard-gauge links were constructed between the centres I have mentioned all the capital cities on the mainland would be linked by lines of a standard gauge of 4-ft. 8i-in. stretching right across the continent from Brisbane to Fremantle. That would be a worthy achievement. We estimate that, or present day cost levels, it would cost £14,000,000 to provide the link between Broken Hill and Adelaide, £10,000,000 for the section from Melbourne to Albury, and £15,000,000 for the amount involved is £39,000,000, which is not excessive when we consider the importance of linking these centres. The Comsuggested that the connection between Port Pirie and Broken Hill would cost £10,000,000, and that it could be completed within eighteen months, thus providing a standard rail gauge from Brisbane to Kalgoorlie. In the past many reports have been submitted regarding this important matter. In 1921, it was estimated that most of the main lines could have been connected by a standard gauge at a cost of £21,000,000. Another report in 1945 suggested that the work could have been done for about £76,000,000. The important point is that the longer we delay the more it will cost us to complete this work. We believe that the work of linking the centres I have mentioned could be completed within five years, at an average annual cost of £8,000,000. We do not suggest that that would necessarily be the cost in the first year, but it would be the average annual cost in the five-year period. Our second recommendation is that^with a view to arriving at an amicable arrangement for the provision of a standard-gauge railway between these points, early consultation should take place between the Commonwealth and the States affected. I repeat that we do not believe that a project of this nature should be delayed because of financial considerations. The Commonwealth should meet the whole of the expenditure. On this aspect of the matter, if the newspaper reports are accurate, we again agree with the committee finance the work as a defence project. but also because of its economic importance. Consultation should take place between the Commonwealth and the-States in regard to this important matter, because section 51 (xxxiv) of the Commonwealth",22,Supply Grievance Day

64,Mr Webb,"Yes, as a defence project,Constitution gives power to the Commonwealth to construct or extend railways in any State, with the consent of the State. I suggest that it would not be very difficult to reach an agreement for work of this nature to be done, particularly if the whole of the cost were borne by the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the Premiers resolved, at their 1945 conference, that the work of standardization should be proceeded with as being essential to national defence and development. The third recommendation that we make, and which, if the newspaper reports arc correct, is not recommended by the committee to which I have referred, reads as follows:For the purpose of co-ordinating transport in Australia, a federal body should be set up, to be known as the Australian Interstate Commerce Commission, with power to(a) control all types of interstate transport in Australia (rail, road and water), and (b) to fix rates and charges for all such forms of transport and control conditions of carriage. This is a very important recommendation, in our opinion. The Constitution provides for the establishment of an interstate commission for this very purpose, and there is no doubt that such a body should be constituted. It is obvious that some national body should be set up on the lines of the American Interstate Commerce Commission, which has power to do the very things that we wish to achieve by the establishment of the proposed commission. Sections 101 and 102 of the Constitution make the necessary provision. We suggest that the body could be known as the Australian Interstate Commerce Commission and that it should have the powers that I have already outlined. I draw attention also to the report on the operations of the Commonwealth Railways for 1955-56, in which, at page 4, the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner had this to sayIt is submitted that there is a real need in this country for a statutory authority with power to fix freights, fares and conditions of carriage for interstate railway traffic, and to enforce its decisions. Similar authorities operate in other countries; for example, the Interstate Commerce Commission in the USA. This statutory body regulates those railroads, motor carriers, water carriers, pipelines (gas and water excluded), stockyards and freight forwarders operating in interstate and foreign commerce. Its jurisdiction covers, among other things, tariffs, rates, service and safety, and includes the power directly to prescribe intrastate rates when necessary to remove discrimination against interstate commerce. Among statutory bodies in the British Commonwealth, with somewhat similar functions, are the Transport Tribunal in Great Britain and the Board of Transport Commissioners in Canada. There is constitutional power for the Commonwealth to set up an interstate commission, with powers of adjudication and administration of the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce 'and laws made thereunder. And the power of the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends, inter aha, to railways the property of any State. It may be that, under the powers conferred by the Constitution, a statutory body could be set up having the duties and responsibilities suggested in the foregoing. We believe that this commission could and should be established. We direct attention to the fact that due to recent decisions of the High Court the State governments have not been able to co-ordinate their transport systems, and certain legislation has been invalidated. There is, therefore, a greater need now than ever before for the establishment of an interstate commission to co-ordinate all forms of interstate transport. A sub-committee of three members, selected from our full committee of fifteen, made certain recommendations which have been adopted by the Australian Labour party, and we ask that the Government give consideration to them. ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I hope, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that you will not rule me out of order when I say that I do not rise to grieve but to express a certain measure of satisfaction. I wish to comment on the matter of standardization of rail gauges that has been raised by the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb), and which has been mentioned in this House on several occasions during the last few weeks. One aspect of the matter that causes me satisfaction is that some progress does seem to have been made, and I am glad that this subject is being treated on a non-party basis.

66,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [11.43].,"The Government parties appointed a committee, of which I have the honour to be the chairman, to consider this question. We have completed our report, which is in process of being duplicated at the present moment. When the report is laid on the table of the House on Tuesday of next week, copies of it will be available for the use of honourable members. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) was kind enough to consent this morning to the report being laid on the table of the House, for which, as honourable members realize, leave is required. it? will be able to debate it, but I do not know the time-table, lt will, at all events, be laid would be considerable economic and polion the table of the House on Tuesday next, and honourable members will be able to study it. 1 am afraid it is a lengthy report, running to over 80 pages. We have discussed in it the pros and cons of the various proposals and we have reached quite definite conclusions. Some of the conclusions are set out in detail, but in the case of others 'the details have still to be provided. Our conclusions are not very different from those that have been reached by a similar committee comprised of members of the Opposition. We believe that there are three missing links in the Australian railway system that should be provided without delay. They are a standard gauge line from Melbourne to Albury, a standard-gauge line from Broken Hill to Port Pirie and then on to Adelaide, and a standard-gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. The committee, in passing, had a look at a number of cognate questions, including the extremely important proposed railway between Mount Isa and Townsville -whic h is, of course, of almost vital concern to the development, not only of Queensland, but of the whole of the Commonwealth. We were able to make quite clear and definite recommendations with regard to the missing links. We thought that the full scheme would cost something in the vicinity of £41,500,000. Honourable members will know that one cannot give an exact figure, and my feeling is that substantial economies could be effected when the actual constructional work was proceeding which would bring the cost below that figure. Howevei. we have given what is, I think, a safe ana fairly conservative estimate. We thought thai the work should bi* started within six months of the presentation of the report. 1 believe that it woulo not take more than six months-it could take less-l o tee up the first proposal. We thought that, taking delays into account, the work might take up to seven and a hall years. That, again, was an estimate that did not differ materially from that made by the Opposition. But we came even nearer to the Opposition when we said thai we regarded seven and a half years as the maximum, not the minimum period. Out view was that as the work proceeded it> benefits would become so manifest thai on the completion of the first stage, there tical pressure for the more speedy completion of the other stages. We said we believed that the work should be clone in stages, concentrating available resources on one project at a time, so lhat the first project could be in operation and paying i i \ way as soon as possible. When we looked at the three projects we felt that the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle' link stood rather below the Broken Hill-Adelaide link in the order of priority. They formed a part of the same system, but we felt that the Broken Hill-Port Pirie-Adelaide line would be of more value in the early stage> because it would do away with two breaks of gauge, and also because, according to the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner -thi s information rather surprised us-w e could save nearly £1,000,000 a year by putting in a more efficient railway system fot the transport of ore from Broken Hill to Port Pirie. That sum of nearly £1,000,000 a year-the exact figure given was £860,000 -is a very substantial sweetener which gives that part of the line an additional priorit\ It was a much more difficult matter to decide whether priority should be given to the Albury-Melbourne line or the Broken Hill-Port Pirie-Adelaide line. Both lines seemed to the committee to be high priority jobs which, on any criterion, merited construction straight away. We thought thai the choice between the two lines should depend upon an administrative decisionthat is. upon which of the States concerned was able first to come to terms with the Commonwealth and make the requisite",24,Supply Grievance Day

68,Mr Wentworth,"I hope that wearrangements to co-operate with the Commonwealth. Our conclusion was that as they both were high priority lines, the project that could be teed-up first should be the project to be put under way first. 1 think that when honourable members have read the report, they will agree with the committee that priorities should be allocated in accordance with that principle. We must get one work started at the earliest possible moment. the governments of South Australia and Victoria to agree with it? honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr notice and for supplying him with a statuThompson) has asked that question The members of the committee would like to express their gratitude to the Commissioners for Railways and the Ministers for Transport of the States concerned for their ready co-operation. It would not be right to say that they committed themselves in any way. I do not want to give the House the impression that we got from any one of them a commitment, but we did get the most friendly co-operation, first, from the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and his staff and from the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge), and secondly, from the Commissioners of Railways and the Ministers for Transport of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. I do not think that the committee could have got as far as it did without the considerable measure of technical assistance that it received from those gentlemen. The committee also acknowledges gratefully the assistance that it received from many members of the public and representatives of public bodies, who made available facts that otherwise would not have been accessible to us.

On 19th April, 1954, 1 was advised by the Minister that the scope of the investigation had been considerably widened in order to ascertain all the facts. The Minister statedThe investigations will be most extensive and I will not be able to obtain a full report on this matter for some time.

72,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.53],"I continuing1 waited patiently for the further letter and, having made another inquiry of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, I was informed on 4th March, 1955, that the Minister would be back in Australia on 8th March and that my letter would be shown to him then. AgainI wailed and, after reading that the Minister had arrived in Australia, I sent him an urgent wire in which I saidWhen may I expect further advice re inquiries instituted into activities Cody& Willis Pty. Ltd.? The Minister repliedReturned yesterday and immediately asked Attorney-General's Department for report as matter still in their hands. I waited for some time, and then sent another urgent wire to the MinisterWhen may I expect further advice re case of Cody& Willis Pty. Ltd. I received this replyStill awaiting advice from Attorney-General's Department on case of Sydney building firm. On 18th April, 1955, the Minister advised me by letter as follows:as yet it has not been possible to decide whether proceedings will be instituted against the firm. Tlie Commonwealth Investigation Service has made three lengthy reports after investigations of a most complex and detailed nature. The stage has now been reached where the Investigation Service has been supplied with a detailed list of some fifty particular matters which are thought to require investigation before final consideration can be given to the institution of proceedings. I have been assured that investigations have not been interrupted, and that every effort is being made to reach some conclusion in this matter. ThoughI wrote to the Minister on 20th June, 1955, and then sent six urgent wires seeking information I received no reply and I was obliged to write to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) drawing attention to the fact that the Minister was apparently refusing to give me any information whatever. Upon being pressed in this way, the Minister replied on 5th July, 1955, in these termsInvestigations have been completed I had been advised in 1954 that they had been completed, but evidently they had formation, which I received from the Minismotand the report of the investigators is at present with counsel.

I am continually pressing for this matter to be brought to a head and as I have said to you in the past, I will write to you when some decisive action is about to be taken. AgainI waited. On 8th August, 1955, I received this communicationIn confirmation of my telephone message of this morning, I desire to advise you that I have just received information from the Solicitor-General that charges were laid on the 5th August against Messrs. Cody and Morrison and the Company. The return date for the charges is 16th August, but it is expected that Shand QC. (for defendants) will be granted an adjournment. Thirty-five charges have been laid, as follows:(a) One charge of conspiracy in respect of the claims under the "" rise and fall"" clause; (b) Two charges under the Crimes Act, section 29B (untrue representation) in respect of the fire; (c) Three charges under section 29B regarding the total claims in respect of hours worked by all employees ("" rise and fall"" clause); (d) Twenty-nine charges under section 29B in respect of individual wage sheets. ("" rise and fall"" clause). I am sorry this matter has been so long delayed, but the inquiry was a very long and complicated investigation. I am now, as promised, taking the first opportunity of advising you of the information I have received from the Attorney-General's Department. AgainI waited. On 23rd March, 1956, I was informed as follows:The committal proceedings in respect of the conspiracy charge against Cody and Willis and others were concluded on the 8th March, 1956. The defendants were committed to stand trial at the Quarter Sessions on the conspiracy charge, bail of £200 each being allowed to Cody and Morrison, and £10 to the company and it is anticipated that the case will be heard in September or October next. There are five other charges yet to be heard, including that of a fire, and it is understood that the fire charge may be heard in September, 1956. However, it is not proposed to proceed with the remaining charges pending the further hearing of the conspiracy charge. Time does not permit me to tell the whole story and I shall pass now to the latest inter for Works( MT . Fairhall) on 16th October. The Minister wroteI refer to your further letter of llth September, charges, set down for September or October of this year, has now been deferred and the latest advice received indicates that they will now be heard early in 1957. As you are aware, the hearing of the fire charges will not be proceeded with until the conspiracy charges have been finalized. These incidents occurred in 1951, and it has taken the Government five years to reach the present unsatisfactory position. Order!

In locomotives and railway carriages, there is a tremendous' loss of earning capacity.

74,Mr Anderson (Hume) [12.3],"I it is an indictment of all previous governThe defence aspect of our transport services is most important. Without doubt, our railway system will play a most important role in the event of war. The changeover in recent years to major use of oil-burning transport both by rail and road indicates that in a war our transport will have to rely to a great extent on oil supplies. Since only failure has so far met efforts to discover oil in commercial quantities in Australia, we shall have to rely for our oil supplies on overseas sources. The shipping lanes along which these supplies are carried will, in war, be subject to enemy attack. Any potential enemy that we have in the Pacific will have larger fleets of submarines preying on our shipping than any nation has ever before controlled. We v.iust, therefore, insure ourselves against the eventuality of serious interruption to our oil supplies by having available alternative fuel for use in major transport. For that reason, we should not turn completely away from the use of coal-burning railway locomotives, but keep such of these locomotives as are not in use in mothballs against the time when we may need them. The report refers to the programme of member for Mackellar, which strongly supdieselization of our railways. This underport the action proposed. lines the importance to us of uninterrupted oil supplies. The statements in the report Order!

This matter has been speaking from memory, of four to one. under consideration for some years. It was From the defence aspect the maintenance raised by the Premier of South Australia. of our railway transport system is of para Mr Playford, at the Premiers conference mount importance. The threat to our oil supplies in the event have suggested that, in order to raise addiof war is a most potent consideration. Our tional finance to improve our increasingly air services and our Air Force are entirely bad road position, we should tax diesel fuel, dependent, so far, on petrol for motive thus putting that fuel on all fours with power. In time of war, petrol supplies to petrol, which is taxed by the Government. air services would be severely rationed. The position of the States regarding the Probably our civil airline services would be financing of road construction and mainturned over for use for war purposes, and tenance is becoming well nigh desperate becivilian air transport would cease. In any cause, as everybody knows, the State goevent, civilian air services and road transvernments have practically no money to port services would probably be completely devote to the large programme of road condenied petrol, which would be necessary struction and reconstruction that is vital if for war purposes. Therefore, our reliance we are to have road transport befitting a for transport will shift to the railways. That brings me back to the point that I mentioned earlier. Our railways still have vehicles has been steadily increasing. Not a large number of coal-burning locomotives which will gradually go out of use with the progress of dieselization of the railways. As I have said, those locomotives should be kept in working order, and mothballed for use in the event of war, when we shall be forced to rely on forms of transport which will help us to conserve oil for war purposes. This is a proposition which, I think, the nation must take up, especially as the cosi of making our railway systems efficient£40,000,000-doe s not seem very high by modern standards. As the honourable member for Mackellar has said, it is not necessary to spend all that money in the first year or two of the programme. It could be spent gradually over a period of up to seven years. I agree with the honourable member entirely that once the public realizes the strength of the logic of rehabilitating our railway systems, public opinion, including commercial opinion, will be so strong on the need to link our capital cities by a standard rail gauge that the Government will be forced to push on with that work. The report also contains some figures, which were mentioned by the honourable in 1951. Since that time numerous bodies modern, civilized nation. In recent years the use of diesel-propelled",28,Supply Grievance Day
75,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,,29,Supply Grievance Day
76,Mr Bird (Batman) [12.13],"I proposeonly have the numbers of such vehicles in use on Australia's roads increased, but their size and weight has also increased. Anybody who has seen a diesel-propelled semitrailer hurtling along a highway can well imagine the dire erlects on our road surfaces caused by the huge numbers of such vehicles now in use in Australia. I do not think :hat anybody either in this House or outside it would deny the damage done to our road surfaces by huge diesel trucks. In recent years there has been such a widespread Jemand that fuel for these vehicles should be taxed in the same way as petrol. All petrol used by motor vehicles in Australia ts taxed, and two-thirds of the revenue from that tax at present goes to the States for expenditure on roads. 1 argue, of course, that the whole proceeds of the tax should go to the States, but that is not a matter under immediate discussion. Surely it is only fair and reasonable for the Commonwealth to accept the principle that if it is right to tax petrol-driven vehicles by taxing the fuel they consume, it is right to tax all vehicles that use our roads irrespective of the fuel they use. Mr 3. R. Fraser -Tyres could be taxed. but, at the moment, we are dealing with a tax which is levied on petrol and not on diesel fuel. A tax is imposed on tyres in the United States of America, but that is not the subject on which I am speaking. I am pointing out the anomaly in the treatment, for taxation purposes, of the two different fuels used in the propulsion of motor trucks. The latest organization to come into the arena and demand the imposition of a tax on diesel fuel is the Australian Automobile Association, which is easily the biggest motor organization in Australia. That association recognizes the gross iniquity of taxing one -set of motor users and not another set. The Government, for reasons best known to itself, refuses to say what it proposes to do. \bout fifteen months ago, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) for information ibout the Government's intentions in relation to motor fuels. I received a reply from him in October of last year stating that the matter was still under consideration and that, possibly at the latter end of the finanGovernment recognized the iniquity of the cial year, the Government would make some decision. The latter end of the financial year is long past. Recently. I asked the Prime Minister a question in the House on this matter and he told me that, because it was a matter of policy, he could not disclose the intentions of the Government. 1 suggest to the Government that because of the desperate condition of Australian roads, it must raise additional finance to assist the States to put the roads into even a mediocre condition. I will not say "" first class condition "" because it is not possible for State governments, with thefinanceleft to them, to make one decent highway. The observation of all overseas visitors when they travel around the country is, ""What poor roads you have compared with roads in Europe, Africa, or America"", or whatever country they come from. At the present time, the States are not receiving sufficient money to enable them to maintain the roads properly. The Government should explore every possible source of revenue in order that the States may be assisted in their terrific fight to maintain, at least, the semblance of a road system. It is quite anomalous that trucks that use* diesel fuel should be exempt from the payment of fuel tax while trucks that use petrol must pay an impost. Not only must they pay an impost but, from March of last year, they had to pay an additional 3d. a gallon in tax. I suggest that that is only adding insult to injury. I wonder why the Government leaves the diesel trucks alone but increases the tax on petrol. Something has to be done. This is a source of revenue for the Government. Such a tax as 1 have proposed would give little offence except to a small group of hauliers who are waxing fat as the result of the Government's ineptitude. Let us look at what is done overseas. After all, this country is not the Alpha and Omega of all knowledge with respect to transport. Let us see whether there is any reluctance in other countries to impose a tax on diesel fuel. In Great Britain, 25 years ago, the United Kingdom Government recognized that there was a case for the taxation of diesel fuel. In 1931 there was in operation a tax of 8d. a gallon on petrol but no tax was, at that time, imposed on diesel fuel. The United Kingdom position. So, in 1932. it imposed a -uniform tax on petrol and diesel fuel. The United Kingdom Government realized that it had",29,Supply Grievance Day
77,Mr Bird,"That has been suggested alsobeen losing a lot of money and that the position which had existed was unfair. So the taxes on the two fuels were equalized in 1932 and on each occasion on which the tax on petrol has been increased the tax on diesel fuel has risen correspondingly. To-day, the price of diesel fuel in Great Britain is 92 per cent, of the price of petrol, because tax is paid on both fuels. In Australia, the price of diesel fuel is only 60 per on the standardization of railway gauges, I cent, of the price of petrol because the Government will not face up to the position and do the fair thing by the State governments and the motoring community. Crossing the Atlantic, we find that a tax was imposed on diesel fuel in the United States of America in 1942, ten years after the tax was imposed in the United Kingdom. In the United States, both State governments and the federal government have the power to impose taxes on motor fuels, and 46 out of the 48 States have a diesel fuel tax. In 39 of those States, the same tax applies to diesel as to petrol fuels. In the other seven States there is a heavier tax on diesel fuel than there is on petrol. In addition to the State taxes, a federal tax of 3 cents a gallon has been imposed on petrol and diesel fuel. So, both England and America have realized that this problem cannot be solved, as this Government is attempting to solve it, by burying their heads in the sand. It is accepted in .England and America that if vehicles are to be taxed for the purpose of maintaining the roads that they use, all vehicles that use the roads should be taxed, not only vehicles that use one kind of fuel for propulsion. One of the arguments that has been used in this country, although faintly, is that a lot of diesel fuel is used in vehicles that do not use the roads. That problem can easily be solved. In America, a refund of diesel fuel tax is made in respect of those vehicles which do not use the highways. If anybody suggests that that cannot be done in Australia, my reply is that it has been done in America for many years. It has been found that it presents no grave difficulty in that country because, when all is said and done, the use of diesel fuel is concentrated in the hands of a few transport companies. No difficulty has been experienced in America in taxing only those firms which use diesel fuel on the highways. If that is the Government's reason for not taxing diesel fuel in Australia Order! The honourable member's time has expired. ber of the Government parties' committee wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the honourable members for Stirling( Mr Webb), Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and Hume( Mr Anderson) on this very great problem. The honourable member for Stirling drew attention to the way in which costs have increased over the years since the report on the cost of rail gauge standardization was made in 1921. Reports on this subject date back prior to federation, when the whole job could have been done for approximately £2,000,000. But, due to procrastination and interstate jealousies, nothing has been done and various reports have been shelved. Never has there been complete agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on this matter. Even to-day, some people agree that standardization is desirable but they state that the time is not opportune. Tbey argue that we should be endeavouring to reduce government expenditure at the present time. I say that this argument has no basis in fact. In the view of these people, the time has never been opportune and it never will be opportune for the standardization of rail gauges. In the period since federation, we have had two world wars and a long and serious depression. In one way or another, the excuse has been made that the time is not opportune and that no money is available for this job. We of the Government parties' committee say it is not only desirable but it is necessary thai the job of standardization be commenced without delay, on the score of both defence and economics. During World War II., as a member of the Royal Australian Air Force, I was stationed in various parts of Western Australia and on five occasions travelled between Melbourne and Perth. I know from personal experience the inconvenience suffered by troops due to the various breaks of gauge and the necessity to change trains at Melbourne, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie. I believe that if the heads",30,Supply Grievance Day
78,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,,31,Supply Grievance Day
79,Mr Fox (Henty) [12.23],"As a memof the various defence departments could be assured that the work of standardization of gauges could be completed without cost to defence votes they would support the scheme to the utmost. As a matter of economics, the members of the committee are convinced that standardization would pay for itself many times over because of the increased revenue which would flow from the greater use of railways, both by passengers and consignors of freight. We are of the opinion that the Commonwealth would be able to recover completely the cost of the work. A link between Brisbane and Perth would enable the various State governments to replace their out-of-date steam locomotives with diesel-electric locomotives, which require long hauls for economic operation and which are able to haul freight at a fraction of the present cost. This would result in greater business for the State railways which, in turn, would improve their financial position and, possibly, could even result in converting their huge annual deficits into surpluses. Since the Commonwealth continually is obliged to make special grants to help State governments balance their budgets and recoup losses on the rail systems, the Commonwealth budget would benefit accordingly. The members of the committee believe that standardization of the section between Wodonga and Melbourne, and of that between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, would each result in an immediate saving of more than £500,000 a year because of the additional freight that it would be possible to carry, and also because of reduced handling charges, particularly in respect of the section between Wodonga and Melbourne. By the use of diesel-electric locomotives and the making of long hauls, the present heavy traffic on the Hume Highway could be reduced in volume, with a resulting reduction of the huge expenditure on road maintenance. In support of that contention, I point to the fact that, at the present time, road hauliers who travel between Adelaide and Perth make use of the railways on a pick-a-back system. Their vehicles are transported by rail from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie and then transferred back to the road. In other words, it is cheaper for them to pay the freight on the goods and the vehicles for transportation by rail rather than to meet the cost of road transport between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) reminds me, that system also saves a great deal of time. The standardization of railway gauges does not present an insuperable problem. Both the United States of America and the United Kingdom had to face the problem, and both countries had a greater variety of gauges than we have in Australia. The solution of the problem demands a national outlook and a government with sufficient foresight to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report which the committee completed recently. I sincerely believe that this Government will do something about the matter. On the ground of common sense, and as a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, it cannot afford to do otherwise. I wish to bring to the notice of the House matters which concern social services and repatriation. I have raised them with the respective Ministers, about whom I have nothing to say but good, because they have done their best. In my electorate of West Sydney there are two pensioners who, because they own a cabin at Wyong, are de-. barred from full pension rights. I have advised them, as did the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) when I brought their case to his notice, to sell the property and make themselves eligible for the full pension. Both pensioners are over 70 years of age. They have informed me-and I have no reason to doubt them-that they bought this block of land at Wyong, which is 70 or 80 miles from Sydney, many years ago with the object of building a home or a week-end house on it. At the present time, the land is valued at only £190. Actually, it was their children who built the house on the land, and for that reason they do not wish to sell the property. They feel that it really belongs to the children. Their daughter and two sons are all married, with families of their own, and it is as much as they can do to look after themselves, without assisting their aged parents. I wrote to the Wyong municipal council concerning the matter and was informed that the value of the property, which the owners had thought to be £850 had, three years ago, increased to £950, and that it probably would rise to £1,050 at a revaluation now due. Each time the value of the",31,Supply Grievance Day
80,Mr Minogue (West Sydney) [12.30].,"property rises, the owners lose some of their pension. They live in a rented home, for which they pay rent of £1 12s. a week. They receive no income at all from the property at Wyong. Even if it were physically possible for these aged people to visit the property, they could not afford to pay fares, lt is time that the Government considered the position of people of this kind, and in my opinion this is a suitable case for the exercise of the Minister's discretion. tion the fact that they have to pay rent ( might add that the rates and taxes on the property amount to approximately £14 a year which, of course, is a considerable sum for pensioners to pay. Because they own this property, these people are losing 14s. each a fortnight. As I say, they receive reduced the amount payable to them in no rent from it. I now wish to refer to another matter, which I took up with the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper). Although the Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Repatriation have not completely closed the door on these two cases. I seem to be making little headway. The repatriation case concerns a man who served for four and a half years during World War 1. and who lost the sight of an eye through a mortar bomb explosion. He receives a pension of approximately £2 17s. a fortnight for the loss of the eye, and I understand that his wife receives an allowance of 17s. a fortnight. In later years, he graduthe requirement of the act that they must ally lost the sight of the other eye and he is now blind in both eyes. For the last two months I have been making representations on his behalf to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper). The last letter that I received from the Minister stated that as the evidence stood at present he could do nothing to assist, but thai he was prepared to re-open the matter if further evidence were available. Two doctors have given certificates to the effect that they can find -o olher cause for this man's total blindness than the injury he suffered on active service which caused the loss of the sight of one eye. It is disgraceful that in a country like this there should be quibbling by Ministers or anybody else about the entitlement to a pension of a totally disabled man who fought for his country. This man's wife, who is aged, would accept employment, but cannot leave her totally blind husband unattended. They are living in poor accommodation. In another instance, two pensioners, who live in two-storied accommodation in Surry Hills, for which they paj 22s. a week, are, because of their physical condition, unable to go upstairs, and so sleep on stretchers inside the front door. They own a home which is revalued every three years, and the municipal council charges highet rates upon each successive revaluation, which reduces the net amount received from the pension. Taking into considerafor the premises they occupy, they are receiving virtually nothing from their ownership of property. However, because of the value of the property which they own, the Department of Social Services has pensions. 1 wish now to refer to the provision of homes for the aged. This Government may well take credit for its legislation on this subject. I was the first person in this House to congratulate the Government upon providing money for homes for aged persons, although I then said that £1,500,000 would not be sufficient to provide nccessan homes for aged persons throughout the Commonwealth. Experience during the twelve months operation of the legislation shows that organizations which care for aged persons are not able to comply with provide 50 per cent, of the money required for the construction of homes. It is of no use for the Government to say that it is doing something to provide homes for the aged, if it says to these organizations, "" You have to provide £1 for every £1 of proposed subsidy, before we give you anything at all "". The Sydney City Council is prepared to provide homes for the 5,000 or 6,000 pensioners in Sydney who need accommodation, if the Commonwealth will advance the money. It stands to the credit of the Australian Labour party and of its leader, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) that in the 1954 general election campaign he proposed the abolition of the means test. I feel sure that if the means test were abolished aged persons would be able to live in a greater degree of comfort. The very persons who oppose the abolition of the means test support child endowment and social services payments, but say that this Government could not pay increased pensions. ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. add to the many remarks that have been made this morning about railways in Australia. BeforeI proceed, I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the bairn), who has suffered a serious accident. For some time prior to that accident he acted as secretary of the committee of members of the Goverament parties which inquired into the standardization of railway gauges, and in that capacity he did a tremendous amount of work. Members of the committee regretted very much that he was prevented from continuing in the position of secretary. I wish to make only one comment on the meetings of that committee. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) paid a tribute to the Ministers and commissioners for railways in various States, and various private organizations and citizens throughout Australia for the co-operation and assistance we received. I think that all of the members of the committee concluded their inquiries with a sense of deep sympathy for Ministers and commissioners for railways in every State. Railways Commissioner, too. also, but at least he is in the fortunate posicompany competes with the State railways tion of being able to present a balance-sheet which shows a considerable profit and an increase in traffic whereas State commissioners for railways are in the unfortunate position of being faced with huge deficits and not knowing what to do for the future. It is apparent that a complete transition to diesel-electric traction will assist towards making the railways pay. The various States face other major problems, the solution of which will take extreme courage on the part of Ministers for Railways, because many of the proposed solutions will meet with certain political disfavour. I think that the time has arrived when State governments must be bold and have extreme political courage, if the future of the State railway systems is to be assured. In the few minutes remaining to me, I wish to mention that one private railway is operating in Western Australia, from Midland Junction to Geraldton, through the midlands area. This railway has been operated successfully for many years. There is a State railway line some 40 or 50 miles to the east, but the majority of the traffic through this rich agricultural area is carried by the private railway. During the war years it did a tremendous job, because a rather large Air Force training station, a service flying training school, was located at Geraldton, and the traffic involved by that station alone was immense. In addition, at one stage a very large force of Army personnel was stationed in the northern part of Western Australia, and all supplies and men for that force were carried on this line. At the conclusion of the war a very heavy rehabilitation programme was necessary, and since then the company has not paid a dividend, all profits having been devoted to the rehabilitation of the line and the renewal of rolling-stock. Now the company is faced with the need to provide dieselelectric locomotives. The company's purchases of these locomotives is subject to sales tax, which is not payable by the State railways. Applications to the Commonwealth Government for exemption from sales tax in the purchase of diesel locomotives have met with refusals from the Treasurer. In recognition of the company's efforts to rehabilitate itself and to continue to give service to a large section of the State, it should be brought into line with the State railways and allowed to purchase diesel locomotives free of sales tax. The under adverse conditions in respect of taxes of all kinds, and puts up a creditable performance. Surely it could be allowed some small remission of sales tax to allow it to continue to operate this private railway system in the best interests of a large portion of Western Australia. I do not think that a great amount of money is involved. Debate interrupted under Standing Order 291. Question resolved in the negative.

86,Mr Harold Holt,"I lay on theWith the concurrence of honourable members, I shall explain, very briefly, not the contents but what is involved in my tabling this report. diately? able members will be aware that recently the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) asked me whether I could make this report available before the House considered the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill 1956, which has been introduced. I have done that before I have had an opportunity to go into the contents of the report fully. I have also had prepared in the department a note on the report, which will indicate in summary form the principal items referred to in the report. Copies of both the summary and the substantial document are available to honourable members. Although it deprived me of the opportunity of going rather more carefully into the matter, as I normally would have wished to do, I thought it advisable that honourable members should have available the subject-matter of this phase of the report of the committee of inquiry for week-end consideration and before the debate on the bill is resumed. BILL (No. 3) 1956. In committee: Consideration resumed sented by the deputation gave all the facts from 24th October (vide page 1795). Clause 22The Second Schedule to the Principal Act is that the committee gave serious consideraamended by omitting paragraph 1 of PartI . , tion to the case. and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:""1. . . . That, at the end of the clause, the following the island have not and cannot get the paragraph be added:"" and (b) by adding at amenities that are available to many people, the end of Part II. the following paragraph:' 4.

The question of zone allowances has occuis impossible for residents to grow their pied the thoughts of this Government over own fruit and in many cases it is impossible a number of years. Many representations to grow even seasonal vegetables because have been made to it to alter the areas of the adverse wind conditions. Theredesignated by zone A and zone B. Legisfore, they must import most of their goods. lation for the zoning of areas for taxation Previously, goods were imported by sea, but purposes was introduced by the Labour because vegetables and fruit rotted while Government in 1945. It was intended to ships were waiting for favorable weather assist the development of outlying districts and to provide an incentive to people to go into those areas. It is most unfortunate that, at that time, the Labour Government did not give due consideration to many parts of Australia that suffer disability. ZoneB includes an area on the west coast of Tasmania, which is in my electorate. It also includes parts of Queensland, such as the three principal towns on the coastTownsville, Cairns and Mackay. There is no doubt in my mind and, I do not think, in the minds of honourable members in this chamber, that it is inequitable and unfair that some of those areas are included in zone B when King Island and the Furneaux Group of islands in Bass Strait are not included. The people of those islands have for many years suffered conditions which would not be tolerated by people on the mainland. This matter was referred to a committee on taxation by this Government. The committee met a deputation from King Island in Melbourne in 1952 and heard the submissions of that deputation, which sought to have the island included in zoned areas for taxation purposes. The members of the committee were Mr S. B. Holder, of Messrs. David Fell& Co., Mr Gordon Wallace, of Sydney, Mr J. A. L. Gunn, of Mr J. W. Hughes, Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Sydney. The case prethat the people could assemble for the committee at that time, and their case was very favourably received. I have no doubt Many factors are involved in this problem. The main points are isolation, cost even to those living in zone B to-day. Both force winds blow for most of the year. It",34,Stevedoring Industry Report

89,Mr Luck (Braddon) [2.17],"I moveof living and the fact that people onconditions to permit them to get into these islands, vegetables are now brought in by air. The islanders pay for this service freights between £40 and £60 a ton. There is no doubt that these points are known both to this Government and to the Tasmanian Government. Residents of King Island receive an allowance of £25 if they are Commonwealth servants or £30 if they are employees of the Tasmanian Government. The State also pays an extra 10s. a week or £26 a year plus a mileage allowance to its employees who use motor cars on the island. Fogs and mists, which blow across the island with gale force, cause cars to rust more rapidly than they would in other parts of Australia. The conditions of employment for Tasmanian public servants provide that fares are paid to Tasmania or to Melbourne, as the case may be, when the employees are on annual leave. That condition does not apply to public servants at Townsville, Cairns or other places included in zone B. I have no doubt that the case presented by the people of King Island warrants consideration. Part of the island is in my electorate and part of it is in the electorate of Bass. The island should definitely have been included in zone B when the legislation I mentioned earlier was before the Parliament in 1945. recommend? mittee's recommendation. 1 do not know whether it is available, but I have not received it. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) may be able to tell the honourable member what the committee recommended. The people of the island have asked for the taxation concession repeatedly, and the purpose of the amendment is to obtain it for them. port the amendment moved by the honourable member for Braddon( Mr Luck). This matter is of great concern to the residents of King Island, in the Braddon electorate, and to the residents of the Furneaux group of islands, in the Bass electorate. The inclusion of King Island and Flinders Island in zone B has been the subject of discussions between the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and myself on several occasions. Each time the Treasurer has informed me that the matter was being investigated by a committee on taxation and that its report would be considered at a later date. Apparently the report has not yet been submitted to the Treasurer. If it has, he certainly has not disclosed its contents to honourable members. All that has been said by the honourable member for Braddon about King Island applies equally to Flinders Island and the surrounding islands, such as Cape Barren Island and Babel Island. The honourable member, quite rightly in my opinion, mentioned some ot the places in northern Queensland which are included in zone B. 1 am disappointed that the Treasurer did not indicate why he considers places such as Townsville, Mackay and Cairns are more isolated than Flinders Island and King Island are. I hope that he will yet do so. This matter has been under discussion for several years, as 1 have pointed out in this chamber previously, and I believe the time has come for the Treasurer to indicate why he and the Government are not prepared to grant to the residents of King Island and Flinders Island the concession of being included in zone B for taxation purposes. I resided in Queenstown, on the west coast of Tasmania, for some years, and I know that residents of that part of Tasmania live in isolation and endure severe weather, but in my opinion their conditions are no worse than are those of the residents of Flinders Island and King Island. Yet one-third of Tasmania, including the west coast area, is included in zone B! The Treasurer should show the residents of Flinders Island and King Island the same consideration as he extends to the people of Mackay, Townsville and other northern Queensland centres. I do not say that in any disparaging spirit. It is perfectly true that Cairns is isolated, but my quarrel with this Government is that Cairns and the other north Queensland towns I have mentioned are no more isolated than Flinders Island and King Island are, as the honourable member for Braddon has pointed out. I propose to discuss Flinders Island particularly. After all, it is the one with which I am more familiar, and the honourable member for Braddon has explained the position relative to King Island. I shall state the position briefly. There has been considerable development of the island in recent years. It has been the subject of long discussions between this Government and",35,Income Tax And Social Services Sydney Mr R S Turner Of Adelaide And Contribution Assessment

92,Mr Barnard (Bass) [2.25],"I supthe Tasmanian Government, as a result of which a large war service land settlement scheme has been put into operation during the last three or four years. If this Governments wants to encourage ex-servicemen to settle on Flinders Island and King Island it should be prepared to give them the small consideration of allowing them to claim a zone B taxation deduction. I have raised in this chamber on several occasions the problems of transport to and from Flinders Island. The transport difficulties of the residents are one of the reasons why I suggest that they are more isolated than are the people who live along the coast in northern Queensland. The Flinders Island aerodrome, which is not an all-weather aerodrome, has often been closed during the recent wet season. This has meant that for periods of longer than six weeks the residents of the island have been virtually isolated because they could not travel by air. I have mentioned this matter on several occasions. The only form of transport when the aerodrome is closed is a thrice-weekly shipping service between Launceston and the island. The Government has refused to accept its responsibility to keep the aeroIsland in zone B, for which purpose the drome open. SoI hope it will be prepared to accept its responsibility to extend to the residents of the island the income tax concession for which they have asked. Both Flinders Island and King Island have a fine future. Their agricultural potential is great, and if we want people to settle on the islands we should give them consideration by extending taxation concessions to them. I say without hesitation that residents of those islands find it much more difficult to obtain transport to other places than do the residents of many of the centres of northern Australia which are served by good rail, road, and air transport services, and which are included in zone B. I do not want to labour the matter. I think the Treasurer, in fairness to the residents of Flinders Island and King Island, should say why the Government refuses to give them the taxation concession for which they have asked. If the report of the committee which has been inquiring into this matter is in the Treasurer's opinion unfavorableI very much doubt whether it is unfavorableI ask the Government to reconsider the matter at an early date with the object of giving to the people of these islands concessions which are already enjoyed by people in other parts of Australia who are more fortunately situated and who live in places included in zone B. Treasurer) [2.33] 1 think it is advisable to give honourable members the history of the zoning system as a basis for the discussion of this matter. When the Chifley Government introduced the zoning system Tasmania was entirely excluded from consideration. It was only as a result of strenuous representations by Dame Enid Lyons that Mr Chifley, as Treasurer, agreed to include a defined area of Tasmania in zone B. should now be as considerate. removed any part of Tasmania from zone B. 1 merely followed the excellent precedent that Mr Chifley established. This Government is extending zone A. Representations have frequently been made for the inclusion of King Island and Flinders honourable member for Braddon( Mr Luck) has proposed the amendment. In season and out of season the Labour government and its Treasurer rejected such representations. There is no formula or set of conditions according to which zones are determined. In accordance with the principles laid down by the Labour government, which set the precedent that I follow, special factors such as weather, living conditions, and transport difficulties are taken into consideration. In this bill the Government proposes not only to increase the allowances applicable to both zone A and zone B, but also to extend and re-orientate, as it were, the boundaries of zone A. Any member of this Parliament can advance an argument for special taxation allowances for a certain zone. When this. Government came to power originally, I. with the approval of the Government, established a taxation advisory board. I obtained the best taxation advice that was available at the time. All the arguments that had been advanced to the previous Treasurer, and to me, with regard to zone allowances for King Island and Flinders Island, were placed before that hoard, but the board did not recommend that the zone concessions",36,Income Tax And Social Services Sydney Mr R S Turner Of Adelaide And Contribution Assessment

I am as certain as I can be that if the Government had not generously increased the zone A allowance by 50 per cent., this argument for an extension of the allowance to King Island and Flinders Island would not have been raised. This whole matter has been considered and re-considered by the Government. There are many remote areas of Australia, the residents of which have a sounder claim for zone concessions than have the people of King Island and Flinders Island.

That control is not is justified, whereupon that government has purely a matter for this Commonwealth to convince the Commonwealth that the Parliament. A great deal of proof is increase is justified. The McCarthy Comrequired by the Commonwealth Governmittee established the principle that the ment before any increase in the price of Australian Sugar Producers Association and sugar is granted, and that proof is supthe United Cane Growers Association had plied to it by other authorities which must to get their experts to work to prove a themselves be convinced of the necessity case to the board for submission to the for an increase before they even approach State government, for further submission to the Commonwalth on the matter.

So if ever there was recalled that after the increase granted in an industry whose product was price con1952 a committee, known as the McCarthy trolled, it is the sugar industry. Committee, was appointed to investigate all the ramifications of the sugar industry and report on procedure relating to future applihighly organized industry in Australia.

In this instance, associated with the industry. The McCarthy of course, the growers were able to prove to Committee submitted a report of its findings the board that an increase was warranted, which dealt, inter alia, with the percentage and the board was able to convince the of profit to be allowed on assets employed.

Thereafter, any attempt to more than it was paying before 14th May, get an increase in the price of sugar was when the increase became operative. considered on the basis set by the McCarthy Committee in 1952. I realize that when this House handles became a white man's industry. For a long the appropriation of thousands of millions time the conditions in that industry were of pounds during the life of a Parliament such that no white man could hope to make an increase of Id. per lb. in the price of a living in it. It was a Labour government sugar may seem an insignificant matter; in Queensland which removed Kanakas but it is not insignificant to either the perfrom the sugar industry and replaced them sons who will receive the benefit or the with white men. consumers who have to pay more for their sugar. Legislation for an increase of the land that initiated the approach to the price of sugar is not just something dreamed Commonwealth to impose the embargo on up by the Government. The starting point the importation of black-grown sugar. of such legislation lies well in the past and From that day to this, there has been a ban far from Canberra. The legislation is the on the import of "" black "" sugar into this result of a process which starts right back country, and anybody who stops to conin the industry itself. Before any applicasider it for a moment can realize exactly tion may be made for an increase of the what that means. For example, we could price of sugar the sugar industry has to compare the living standards and the worksubmit its case to the Queensland Sugar ing standards of tbe employees in the sugar Mr George Lawson -It is the most I should like to explain, in passing, thai it was only after efforts made over many years that the sugar industry in Queensland It was a Labour government in Queens-",39,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
104,Cations For Increases Of Price. Mr Mr Edmonds,"That is correct. J-iidustry with the standards of employees n the industry in South Africa. If we did not have the embargo as part and parcel of the Commonwealth sugar agreement, we would not have a sugar industry in Australia. If we did not have a sugar industry in Australia, Queensland would not be the strong and virile State that it is-stron g jnd virile, I may add, despite the fact that it is starved financially by this Government. If it were not for the sugar industry and other associated industries, Queensland would be a very minor State indeed. When the occasion has presented itself I have never failed proudly to boast that 1 <im a socialist. Because of that fact, I get more than ordinary pleasure from the fact that the sugar industry is one of the most successful industries in Australia. Over recent years, with the new plant and machinery and more modern equipment that has been applied, not only to the growing but also to the milling of sugar, it has become an amazingly efficient industry. When one considers sugar production in other parts of the world, one sees that it is to the everlasting credit of those who are associated with the Australian industry that it is such an efficient industry. But it is completely and utterly socialized. wait a minute, I shall tell him why it is socialized. I say that it is socialized because one cannot grow a stick of sugar cane for sale without a permit from the Government or an instrument of the Government. One cannot get an assignment. That is to say, if one wants to grow sugar on a block of land, one can grow sugar to the heart's content, but it will not be sold index. So if the Minister for Primary Inunless it is assigned to a certain mill. member who hates socialism so deeply will wait, I shall answer his question. In Queensland, sugar is grown under State government control. When the cane is harvested and crushed, the sugar is taken over by an instrumentality of the Government. The government can issue a permit or refuse to issue a permit to grow sugar cane. The Government acquires for sale and distribution purposes the sugar that is made from the farmer's crop. The Government is responsible for the price that the farmer receives for his cane, not only for domestic use but also, in the main, for the exported product. Whether honourable members opposite like it or not the faci remains that it is a completely socialized industry. If the sugar industry were not as successful as it is, they would be delighted to claim that it was a socialized industry. It is completely socialized and it is one ot the most successful industries in Australia Now that I have finished the provocative part of my speech, I may be able to get somebody to listen to me for a change We will consider how sugar actually comes into being. The McCarthy committee of 1952 issued a majority report on this subject, which was subsequently adopted. The report stated that the committee took a production rate of 3 tons of sugar an acre for costing purposes. The industry has increased its efficiency since 1952 and I shall now state the case presented by the industry in connection with this matter. Since 1952. and in the calculation of present price requirements, a yield of 3.2 tons of sugar an acre has been adopted as normal. The yield of 3.2 tons of sugar an acre has been taken as equivalent to 23| tons of cane. So it takes slightly over 7 i tons of cane to produce 1 ton of sugar. When people talk about an increase of Id. per lb. in the price of sugar they should remember that the increase in the price during this period of inflation, when the price of ordinary household commodities has rocketed sky high, according to the C series index, is much less than all other increases in the price of items included in the regimen, or basket of goods, or the C series talking about socialization and the fact that the matter has come up rather belatedly, 1 can assure him that if he wants any assistance to answer the critics in connection with this matter, he can rely on me for m\ whole-hearted support. I have already mentioned the great efficiency in the sugar industry. That brings us to the question, not only of farming, but also of milling sugar cane. In a moment I shall say something about the very contentious subject of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee.

109,Dustry ( Mr Mcmahon) Will Forgive Me For,"the influence-if that is the suitable termthat the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has on the sugar industry. I want to make it quite clear that I do not purport to come out in defence of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I am quite sure that the company is quite capable of defending itself. I know that the company has a great monopoly, but if anybody has the idea in his head that the great wealth accumulated by that company has been gained from sugar, he should examine the history of the matter. He will find that sugar pays no more to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company than it pays to any other body that operates the sugar mills. I was an employee of the company for many years. I worked in one of its mills in the Ingham area for eleven years and I know something about its activities. It has been suggested that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will be the principal beneficiary from this increase just as it was suggested that the company would be the beneficiary when other increases were discussed in this House. I put it to the Parthey are able to use, in their manufacturing liament that that is a complete and utter fallacy. I will say, regardless of whoever I please or offend, that the sugar industry in Queensland has a tremendous lot to thank the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for, because that company operates as agent for the Queensland Government. It does all the initiating. It is a wealthy company. It arranges the sale and purchase of stocks. From all of those activities it derives small commissions, in addition to the income from its milling activities. It is true, of course, this canned fruit industry be subsidized? that the company owns seven mills, but I suggest that it receives no greater return from sugar than would any other organization which owned seven mills. I am not making these comments in defence of the company, because Heavens knows, it needs no defence by me. I am merely pointing out that those people who claim that they are to pay more for sugar so that the company may increase its profits are on the wrong track. I turn now to the complaints about the part that the cost of sugar plays in the price of canned fruits. Let me say at once that these complaints are neither real nor honest, because the canned-fruits industry is the one industry that is subsidized in respect of the sugar it uses. I say "" subsidized "" because, in the final analysis, that is what it amounts to. The industry is subsidized by the sugar industry in respect of the sugar content of the products it prepares for export. That situation has applied for a long period of years. 1 notice that honourable members who have spoken on this matter on previous occasions are in the House at the moment, and I assume that they also will have something to say on this occasion. Therefore, Mr Speaker, although my remarks may incite argument, if you will permit me to do so I shall get in first and answer their criticisms before they are made. Naturally, the fruit-canners and jammakers use a great deal of sugar. They export a considerable proportion of the products they produce. By special arrangement, under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement Act, they are able to purchase the sugar used in the products they export at a price equal to the lowest possible price at which sugar could be landed in Australia, duty-free, from any other country of the world. That means, obviously, that and processing, sugar which they obtain at a price equal to that which they would have to pay if we had no sugar industry in Australia, or if there were no embargo on the importation of sugar. Human nature, I suppose, is the same the world over, whether the people concerned are engaged in making jam, canning fruit or in any other pursuit. They are never satisfied, and they never have been satisfied. It might well be asked: To what degree should The Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee is composed of a representative ol the Commonwealth as chairman; a representative of the sugar industry, nominated by the Queensland Sugar Board; and a representative of the manufacturers of exported products containing sugar, nominated by the manufacturers. From month to month, the committee examines the position of the industry, taking into account all costs associated with canning, including freight and other charges. It must be remembered that this is the only industry in Australia that receives a subsidy in respect of the sugar content of its products. I know that honourable members opposite like to argue with me when I am on my feet, but I do not think that they will dispute thai there are many industries which rely, to H great degree, on the use of sugar in manufacture. It has never been considered that they should have the benefit of a rebate, or of assistance from the sugar industry. Yet, the canners of fruit and the jam-makers show their gratitude to the sugar industry by relentless and everlasting attacks on it. Whenever the question of increasing the price of sugar is raised in this place, we hear attacks on the sugar industry on the ground that the canners and jam-makers are not getting justice. I remind the House that there was a time when payments into the fund were suspended because the reserves had reached almost astronomical proportions. The sugar industry said, in effect, ""Why should we continue to put money into the fund, when the money in it already cannot be used? "" From memory, the sum in hand at that stage was approximately £1,000,000. The sugar industry decided, therefore, that no further contribuor the ban, on the importation of sugar. tions would be made until such time as the reserves had been halved. When that had been done, these subsidies, as I choose to call them, were resumed. This year, the amount has been increased from £216,000 to £370,000. The amount of subsidy is £2 4s. a ton. Yesterday, I heard some one say, ""The total funds increase, but the rebate is still their commodities on the world market. only *£2 4s. a ton, whereas at one time it was £6 "". rebate. The canners and jam-makers argue that the rebate should be greater because more sugar is being produced. More sugar is being produced because Australia recently was committed to supply 600,000 tons of sugar to Great Britain, 300,000 tons to be supplied at the stabilized price and the remainder to be sold on the open market. The millers have spent great sums of money on improving and modernizing their mills, and new land has been opened up. Those tion which the sugar industry gets by way of who know anything about sugar know that embargo? new land grows a great deal more cane than does old land. The fruit industry has said to the sugar liament's refusal to allow the importation of industry, in effect, "" You have nothing sugar grown cheaply with black labour, and to brag about because the amount of the its control of the price of the commodity. rebate has been increased from £216,000 to £370,000. You are able to do that because you have produced more sugar "". I submit that all the fruit industry should be concerned about is the amount of subsidy that it needs. There is no evidence that the canners and jam-makers are finding it difficult to meet the cost of the sugar content of their products. They claim, of course, that it is difficult for them to compete on world markets and that the cost of the sugar content of their products is responsible for that. I point out that South African canners produce much the same kind of products as do the canners in Australia. Incidentally, Australia has no reason to be ashamed of the price at which sugar is sold in this country, because I understand that South Africa is the only country where sugar is sold at a lower price than it is in Australia. That brings me, of course, to the history of the embargo, South Africa, with its cheap labour, which is reflected in the cost of freight, transport and other services, is able to produce sugar relatively cheaply. The processors of canned goods obtain sugar much more cheaply than do the Australian canners. But that does not mean that the sugar content in these canned goods caused the disadvantage which Australian canners suffer in selling the factories, too. labour in every section of production and manufacture. As it is the mickles that make the muckles, they can produce cheaper canned goods, because anything manufactured with the use of cheap labour may be sold cheaply. It is of no use to attack the sugar industry, which has played a magnificent part in assisting these manufacturers of canned goods. They are unique in being the only section which obtains assistance from the sugar industry. has one protection only, namely, this Par-",41,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956

On every occasion on which the price of sugar is discussed in this House, industry, whether they have belonged to we hear honourable members ask whether the sugar industry is pouring enough money into the coffers of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee for assistance to the canning industry. We are asked what amount is adequate. The sugar industry should be commended for the part that it has played. I know that the matter is tied up by agreement and that the industry has no choice, but let us not forget that these discussions would never take place were it not for the fact that the price of sugar is determined by agreement between the Commonwealth and the State, and that this Parliament must pass legislation to validate an increase in the price of sugar by even Id. In 1920, sugar cost 6d. per lb. Of all the commodities in daily use in the household kitchen, from bread to potatoes or onions, not one has increased in price by a smaller percentage than has sugar, yet we face a barrage of attack about the rise in the price of sugar.

Honourable members opposite cannot adversely affected, in the interests both not criticize production in this industry. of the economy of the nation and of those Whether one is a farmer, miller, cane cutter, or cane hauler, his work in the sugar industry is very arduous. Whenever there is talk about the high income of men engaged in the industry, one can be absolutely certain that they earn whatever they receive, irrespective of the capacity in which they are engaged. There is no easy work in the industry. These men work under extraordinarily difficult conditions, but there has been virtually no industrial trouble. It is true that this year there was a little disturbance, but it was smoothed over in a matter of days. I pay a tribute to all those persons, past and present, who have engaged in the the Queensland Cane Growers Association, the Australian Sugar Producers Association, or the Proprietary Sugar Millers Association, for the magnificent manner in which they have conducted themselves. Not least of all, I pay a tribute to the Australian Workers Union for its part in achieving industrial stability in the sugar industry in Queensland. The work of the union is not fully acknowledged. I was an official of the Australian Workers Union for a long time. The easiest job that a union official can have is not one which obliges him to tell the men that the executive has made a decision, that they will obey it, and that they will not strike; that is a hard job, but it is the way of the Australian Workers Union. I have no compunction in asserting that the easiest way is the way of officials of many other unions who, when a dispute occurs, go along to a job and say to the men, "" If you do not like it, down tools "". That is a simple task. The Australian Workers Union did not find the battle easy in the sugar industry, because conditions with every other section of the industry.

We support the bill, and we hope that honourable members from Tasmania and Victoria will be fair and just if they criticize the bill, as they are entitled to do. honourable member for Herbert( Mr Launceston at £82 Is. a ton for the next Edmonds), who has led the debate for the Opposition on this measure,finishedon the correct note, and that is where 1 start. He said that he hoped that although honourable members from Tasmania and Victoria might criticize the bill, they would be fair and just. I sincerely hope that we will be fair and just in our criticism of this agreement, because there are undoubtedly two sides to the argument. We do nor oppose the bill, naturally, because it seeks to ratify a very important agreement between the governments of Queensland and the Commonwealth, which involves the livelihood of thousands of workers in a big industry in Queensland, but it is only right that this House should know, also, the other side of the story. We, from Tasmania, feel that we have a right and a duty to put the other side of the story. As a preface to my remarks, I want to outline the factors before us in this agreement. The purpose of the bill is to obtain parliamentary approval to an agreement already made between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government to regulate the production and the marketing of sugar in Australia during the next five years1956 to 1961. The main principles of the bill have remained substantially unaltered since 1923, but the cost factor has altered considerably, especially in the last eight or nine years, as a result of galloping inflation Tasmania and Victoria, entirely agree with which has hit this industry just as it has hit that alteration to the agreement. It is most all industries. The contents of the agreement are, tion that the Fruit Industry Sugar Conbriefly, first, that the Commonwealth Gocession Committee in the last three years vernment undertakes to continue to impose expended £50,000 of its funds on an adveran embargo on the importation of sugar; tising campaign to help jam-makers sell second, that the Queensland Government their product on the Australian market.

It duced from cane grown in Queensland and also voted £73,500 for export assistance New South Wales; third, to make sugar on the 1954 jam pack to assist processors available in Australia at fixed prices; fourth, to market jams overseas. In the previous to control production; fifth, to accept reseason, 1953, the committee decided to sponsibility for any losses arising from the allocate an amount up to £75,000 to export of surplus sugar; sixth, to pay reguarantee Tasmanian berry fruit processors bates on the sugar content of goods exported; and, finally, to contribute to the funds of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. That is a broad outline of the contents of the agreement. I shall now give some ot the details of it. The Queensland Government undertakes to sell sugar in all State capitals of Australia, and Fremantle and five years. A retail price of lOd. per lb. will be charged for sugar throughout Australia, irrespective of where it is sold. This will provide a profit margin of 13J per cent, on the wholesale price. Prior to this agreement, the price of sugar was 9d. per lb. and £72 16s. a ton was paid by the users of sugar. This agreement provides for an increase of about £10 a ton on the wholesale price of sugar. Another part of the agreement-and this is an alteration of the condition contained in the sugar agreement of 1951-concern s the method offinancingthe Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. Previously, the Queensland Government paid this committee £216,000 a year, as my colleague the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) said. The reserve fund of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee at 1st September, 1951, was just over £1,000.000. but due to heavy payments on export sugar, rebates and substantial grants, to the processed fruit industry amounting to £240,427 in the last three years, the fund has been reduced to about £150,000. Consequently, the sugar industry contribution to the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee will be increased to approximately £370,000 as against £216,000 last year.

The last one was made as a result of constant pressure on the committee from Tasmanian members of both parties. It helped our berryfruit industry considerably, though it has not saved the industry. I am afraid, from disastrous decline. industry subsidize the fruit industry? has all the advantages. It has been protected. Not one pound of sugar will be imported into Australia under this agreement! The industry has the whole of Australia to itself. cheapest sugar in the world. cheapest sugar in the world. The Cuban sugar and African sugar is cheaper than -ours. tralia. The sugar industry enjoys special consideration. The sugar producers enjoy a monopoly of the Australian market through this agreement. The import of sugar is banned and as a result, the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government control the price of sugar to the consumer. I will not go into the other matters raised by the honourable member for Herbert on that point; I simply state the fact, and that answers the honourable member for Lillev( Mr Wight). So far I have spoken on the contents of this agreement. The sugar-growers, the mill owners, and all their workers in Queensland deserve, and must have, security and a profitable price; but I shall say something about the effect of this agreement on the manufacturers of jam, fruit processors, cordial manufacturers, the canned fruits industry and the growers of berry fruits that are canned for the home and overseas markets. Thousands of people in Victoria and Tasmania are affected by this agreement. Some very disturbing factors come before us. Over the last six years the production of jam, one of our biggest manufactures, has declined to an alarming extent. 1 admit that that has not been due solely to the increased price of sugar. The cost of sugar in home-consumed jams has risen 100 per cent, in that period of six years, but other factors that must be taken into consideration are the cost of tinplate, labour and freight charges, which affect manufacturing costs, lt would be quite unfair for us to sa> to the Queensland people that the increased price of sugar, great as it is, is the only cause for the decline in the consumption of jam in Australia. A definite buyer resistance to jam has been evident in this country in the last few years because of the increased price of jam and has caused grave concern to the Government and to the manufacturers of jam. I shall give some facts about that, and I shall show the way in which fruit processing costs have increased since 1950. In 1950. wages were fixed by the Arbitration Court at £9 3s.; in 1956 they were £12 18s., an increase of 41 per cent. In 1950, tins cost 40s. 8£d. a gross and in 1956, 58s. 5d. a gross, an increase of 43.5 per cent. In 1950. sugar cost £40 12s. 9d. a ton and in 1956 £82 Is. a ton, an increase of 100 per cent. Undoubtedly, the largest single factor in the increased price of jam to the consumer is the increased price of sugar. Let us not be unfair to the Tasmanian and Victorian people, either. The price of sugar to jam manufacturers has increased by 100 per cent, in six years and it is no good trying to wipe out that fact by airy fairy words. It is a fact, and it has affected the jam industry to an alarming extent, as I shallshow. that have gone up? Everything else has gone up. ( Mr Bowden) -Order! main factor, and tin-plate costs, which are another important factor, have increased by only a little over 40 per cent., compared with a 100 per cent, increase of the cost of sugar.

134,Mr Acting Deputy Speakek,,46,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
135,Mr Duthie,"Wages, which are theAustralia were restored to the 1948 level. In 1948, more than 65,300 tons of sugar were used by fruit processors. Of this quantity, 53,000 tons were used for jam alone. In 1954-55, the total quantity of sugar used had fallen to 53,000 tons, of which only 21,000 tons were used in jammaking. In the same period jam production declined by 60 per cent., despite an increase of Australia's population by more than 15 per cent. This is a very serious state of affairs. I do not know whether it has been taken into consideration by the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government in increasing the price of sugar by £10 a ton under the new agreement, which will operate for six years. I am not sure whether the price now fixed must stand for the full period or whether provision is made for it to be reviewed. The manufacture of jam in Australia has declined during the last decade. In 1948, more than 198,000,000 lb. of jam was produced, whereas this year the rate of production has fallen to only 78,000,000 lb. annually. That is a tremendous decline jn eight years. During the same period the cost of sugar has increased from £36 lis. 9d. a ton to £82 Is. a ton. In 1947, rhe sugar contained in a dozen 24-oz. tins of jam cost 3s. 7d., compared with 8s. to-day. Before the war the annual consumption of jam in Australia was approximately 11.4 lb. a head. In 1952-53, it had fallen to 8.5 lb. a head. It is no doubt even lower at the present time. In round figures, the consumption of jam has declined by 13,000 tons in six years. This trend must affect the sugar industry, which will eventually find that its sales in Australia are not as great as they were expected been increased since 1933. to be. The Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has tried to help the fruit growers with publicity. Tasmanian berry fruit-growers who travel in inland Australia, for example, in the inland towns of Victoria and New South Wales, find that many people have never heard of the jams produced in Tasmania. That is due to inadequate publicity. Two years ago the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee allocated £50,000 to advertise jams in Australia. That was a big help in boosting the popularity of Tasmanian jams, particularly the IXL brand. ber a Jones man? jams are made in Tasmania from fruit grown in the Wilmot and Franklin electorates, and the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) and I should do our best to promote the sale of Tasmanian jam on the Australian market. The great decline of the consumption of jam in Australia will eventually have disastrous effects on the sugar industry. Even our exports of jam have declined seriously. In 1949-50 we exported 29,120 tons. In 1954-55 we exported 3,059 tons. This is a serious reduction in only five years. There has been a big decline also in the areas devoted to the cultivation of jam-making fruits. The recorded reduction of the acreage devoted to the growing of berry fruits in Tasmania between 1952-53 and 1954-55 is 1,300 acres. That is a tremendous reduction of acreage in an industry in which the farms are usually only a few acres in area. Much of that 1,300 acres is now devoted to dairying and orchards. Berry fruit production declined from 8,369 tons in 1951-52 to 3,635 tons in 1954-55. These figures illustrate the alarming events taking place in the great jam-making industry. I propose to emphasize these events by reference to the domestic sugar rebate, which in the south is considered to be too low. The Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has many jobs to do. One of its tasks is to fix the domestic sugar rebate. It fixes the price paid for sugar by the processors of berry fruits also. The domestic sugar rebate, which is £2 4s. a ton, has not a ton, making a total of £26 4s. a ton. basic domestic sugar rebate, not export rebate, as stated in the new agreement at page 4 of the schedule to the bill. The Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has again approved a rebate of £2 4s. a ton. It has not been increased by Id. in 23 years, although the price of sugar has increased from £30 6s. a ton to £82 Is. a ton, or by £51 15s. a ton, in that time. That is our main criticism of the new agreement.",46,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956

139,Mr Duthie,"I am speaking of theThe domestic rebate should certainly be reviewed. It was originally investigated by a committee, which apparently sank into oblivion after fixing the rebate at £2 4s. a ton. That committee has never been heard of since. Another committee of inquiry should be appointed to consider the matter from the stand-point of the Tasmanian and Victorian fruit-growers. A committee was appointed by the Government to inquire into the costs of the sugar industry in Queensland, and quite rightly. That committee has presented its report. A similar committee should be appointed to investigate costs at the manufacturing end and to consider whether the domestic sugar rebate should be increased. That would be fair, and that is the proposal we are advancing. It is a one-sided process to maintain the domestic sugar rebate at the same rate year after year and repeatedly approve increases of the price of sugar. It is not fair to the Tasmanian and Victorian fruit growers or the manufacturers of products in which there is a substantial sugar content. Mr George Lawson -What about confectionery manufacturers? as also are the manufacturers of soft drinks. These people were complaining about the situation when we met them recently at a conference in Hobart, and this whole matter was thrashed out. It was one of the largest conferences dealing with such matters that I have attended. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) was also present. The representatives of cordial manufacturers attended the conference, but I cannot recall the details of the case that they submitted. I hope the honourable member for Franklin can remember them. They definitely made a case, however. It appears that, in the application of a certain formula that is being used, they are allowed no rebate. The application of this formula amounts to a splitting of straws. It deprives the cordial manufacturers of any financial assistance. For this reason, the formula should be reviewed. No users of sugar should be deprived of the advantages of this rebate. -the sugar industry itself? the past, through the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. a bit unfair! asked to agree to an increase of £10 a ton in the price of sugar, and I think we should support the claims of all the people who use sugar. 1 do not mean householders, or people who merely put sugar in their tea; I refer to people who use sugar in the manufacture of jams and cordials.

I drink so much raspberry cordial and lemonade during election campaigns that I am sure it rots my shoes. I feel that we should have some regard for the manufacturers of cordials. 1 come now to the question of the fixing of prices received by berry fruit growers. This matter is in the hands of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, which is a dictatorial body. It runs and rules the industry, lt decides how much is to be allowed in rebates, and how much the growers in my electorate, and in other electorates in Tasmania, will receive for their products. It has tremendous power. As a result of the decline in the price of berry fruits, 300 acres have gone out of production during the last two or three years. That land was previously used for growing loganberries, raspberries, gooseberries, currants and the like.

Tasmania produces 85 per cent, of all the berry fruits grown in Australia. I should like now to refer to the composition of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. The agreement provides that the committee shall be composed of one representative of each of the following:-The Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Sugar Board, the growers of canning fruits, the growers of non-canning fruits, the co-operative and State manufacturers of fruit products, and the proprietary manufacturers of fruit products. I believe that the Government should consider granting representation on this committee to cordial manufacturers. After all, the committee consists of only six members, and, as I said before, it is a very powerful committee. It exercises dictatorial powers within the industry, and wider representation on it would do no harm. Cordial manufacturers, who have increased in number during recent years, should be granted some representation on this committee. I wish now to cite somefiguresshowing have failed to stress.

I am the sugar agreement. The agreement really concerned, however, for the people who had its birth in 1915, and it was in 1923, depend on the jam-making industry, such when the price of sugar was raised to £30 a as the factory workers and the growers of tona very high price for sugar at that the berry fruits. In Victoria, every one time-that rebates were provided for the connected with the stone fruits industry is benefit of the fruit industry. That was one affected by this agreement. On behalf of of the qualifications. Between 1923 and those Opposition members who feel that 1930 various adjustments were made to there are two sides to this question, I put this case to the Government. 1 particularly the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee should be reconsidered. 1 also suggest that the domestic rebate on sugar should certainly be increased. It has been maintained at the same level, £2 4s. a ton, for 23 years. for Lilley( Mr Wight) says that it should be abolished. I am glad to say that honourable members on this side of the House have a wider outlook than has the honourable member for Lilley. The Opposition would not go so far as to advocate the abolition of that rebate. The price of sugar to domestic consumers is now £82 Is. a ton, less the rebate of £2 4s. The price, therefore, is still very nearly £80 a ton, which is a colossal price for a commodity which is so important in the manufacture of many products for home consumption and for export. I trust that the honourable member for Franklin, when he speaks on this measure, will fill in any of the gaps that I have left, and will emphasize any points that I has said, and in consequence will probably be commendably brief. In order, however,",48,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956

153,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [4.4],"both the price of sugar and the actual rebate, and it was as a result of a report on sugar in 1931. that the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee was formed. The first actual contribution to the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee by the sugar industry was an amount of £315,000, but in 1933 that was reduced to £216,000. It remained at that level until 1951, when the contribution was suspended. Latterly, of course, it has been reintroduced. Although it was argued that the contribution was suspended on the ground that the fund was being built up too greatly, I still say-and I have said this before-that it constituted a breaking down of the orginal agreement. I desire to make it as clear as I possibly real need will be able to make a case before can that sugar rebates are designed to give the Tariff Board, and that that case will be mutual assistance to both the fruit and the heard. sugar industries. There is, in essence, a form of partnership and the argument that one industry is attempting to live on the years. 1 think that that is why the two back of the other does not really bear governments involved have been obstinate, examination if one goes back to the basis inasmuch as the part that the fruit industry upon which the agreement was made, and will play ought to be considered in the light upon which it has been continued. As has been pointed out, the domestic Wilmot( Mr Duthie) has given figures, :eb:tc is £2 4s. a ton. It is paid to prowhich I would have given, to demonstrate cessors who comply with certain conditions, that during the last few years there has the major one being that they will pay prices been a drop of about 50 per cent, in the not lower than those fixed by the Fruit berry fruit acreage in Tasmania. One of Industry Sugar Concession Committee. the arguments that I have heard used in Theoretically it is a minimum price, below relation to the present rate of domestic which no processor may go, but in fact it rebate is that there is not much real need rather tends to become both the minimum for it because in tbe Goulburn Valley the and the maximum. The present rebate is growers are having a better time than they £2 4s. a ton. Originally, in 1931, when have had for years. Certainly, the major sugar was £36 1 Is. a ton, it was £6 5s. canneries are in the Goulburn Valley. The Only a year later, when sugar was £32 10s. berry fruit industry in Tasmania is not a ton, it was reduced to £2 4s. As I have the only pebble on the beach. But I am already said, it has remained at that figure told that the extremely wet winter has led ever since. If the relationship between the to extensive rotting of peach trees in the rebate and the price of sugar, which applied Goulburn Valley; that a very high proporin 1931, were maintained the current rebate tion of the trees will be lost and, that within would be £13 14s., instead of £2 4s. It has been argued so often as to become simple facts, it is obvious that the peachpublic property that in 1952, when there canning industry in the Goulburn Valley was a sugar inquiry, and subsequently will be in a serious position in a year or when cases have been presented by the protwo. For that reason. I suggest that what cessors and by the fruit industry, sufficient has happened very recently in the Goulburn facts, figures and financial information on Valley, or anywhere else, should not be which to base an increase of the domestic the deciding factor, but rather that we sugar rebate, have not been given. That is should look ahead over afive-yearperiod. a rather peculiar argument inasmuch as in the Department of Trade-formerl y the Department of Commerce and Agriculture fund which the honourable member for -on e can find all the information on the industry that one needs. The Department of Agriculture in Tasmania has, On several occasions, presented most carefully documented and detailed facts and figures supporting its claims. It would seem that the two governments concerned have become somewhat stubborn on this matter, and do not propose to alter the present rate of domestic sugar rebate. It is now suggested that if certain fruit industries experience real financial difficulty they might make application to the Tariff Board or some similar instrumentality. I have yet to receive an undertaking from any one that that is so and I hope that the Minister, in closing the debate, will give us a definite assurance that a fruit industry which is in The agreement is to operate for five of that period. The honourable member for a very short period, replanting will have to begin. IfI am any judge of those I am all in favour of the stabilization Lilley( Mr Wight) proposed by way of interjection. It would be worthwhile thinking in terms of raising the domestic rebate to a more reasonable level and contributing part of it to a stabilization fund. I besubsidize the fruit-processing industry and lieve that in that way something really good would be done. The honourable member for Wilmot referred to fruit-processing costs. 1 want to give a simple comparison of the change in processing costs since 1950. This tells the story clearly enough: In 1950 wages were £9 3s.; in 1956 they are £12 18s., an increase of 41 per cent. In 1950 sugar was £40 12s. 9d. a ton; in 1956 it is £80, an increase of 100 per cent. In 1950 tins were 40s. 8$d. a gross; in 1956 they are 58s. 5d. a gross, an increase of 43.5 per cent. So it is demonstrably clear that the major increase has been the 100 per cent, rise in the price of sugar. We are asked to approve an increase of £10 a ton in the price of sugar. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) was entirely wrong in suggesting that I had something against the sugar industry. It is entitled to a fair go, but the agreement is two-sided, and I do not think that the fruit industry, as such, is getting a proper deal so far as the domestic rebate is concerned. I do not propose to canvass the other aspect-the export rebate -becaus e I sincerely believe that the export was ever opened up at all. There is still rebate is now at a reasonable level, and that some of that virgin country to be seen in there is an extremely sound case for a real increase in the domestic rebate. speak on the merits of this measure is someit became apparent that the central and what like gilding the lily. So far, the measure has not called forth much opposition from honourable members. In fact, the two members from Tasmania who have spoken in the debate have made it clear that the Tasmanian fruit industry has had the benefit of very generous rebates from the for the cultivation of that crop, such as the sugar industry. Nobody could have made the position regarding rebates clearer than those honourable members did. Their only real contention-and it is a very natural contention-is that Tasmanian fruit interests the requirements for sugar-growing in resshould have the benefit of even larger rebates. But, obviously, if larger rebates were supply. For successful cultivation, sugar given the cost of production of sugar would increase, the retail price of sugar would have to be also increased and, presumably, the increase would be followed by another request for greater rebates-and so on. I do not think that there is another case in Australia-ther e may be elsewhere-of one industry subsidizing another industry to the extent to which the sugar industry the fruit-drinks industry. Nevertheless, when an industry asks for an increased price for its product it should have to show justification for the requested increase. That applies to both primary and secondary industry. Naturally, an increase in the price of any commodity produces an increase in the general cost of living and, in the light of that fact, the case in favour of the granting of such an increase, with the case against it, should established before the increase is granted. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) explained the careful method whereby, when a request for an increase in the price of sugar is made, a check of the costs of production in the industry is carried out. The sugar industry did not suddenly spring to affluence. The early sugar-growers in Queensland endured very trying conditions in an uncharitable' tropical country when they were establishing this industry. Anybody who saw in its virgin state the land that they had to conquer in establishing the industry would wonder how that land Queensland. Like many primary industries in the pioneering days, the sugar industry was developed in a haphazard fashion, progress in it resulting from individual and collective experiments. Later, north Queensland areas, and the northern rivers area of New South Wales, were the most suitable places in Australia for the growing of cane sugar. We know that sugar beet has been grown in Victoria but only cane sugar produced in areas suitable areas I have mentioned, can meet the requirements for sugar in a large country like Australia. Those three areas where sugar is grown are ideal in that they meet pect of type of soil, climate and water cane requires plenty of heat and plenty of water, and those prerequisites to the successful growing of sugar are present in central and north Queensland and in the northern rivers area of New South Wales.",49,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
154,Mr Bruce (Leichhardt) [4.15],"T oThe first sugar cane plantations in Australia were run by private companies, and the sugar was farmed on their behalf by men who were more or less share-farmers. These men were paid on weight of cane and not on sugar content, which was an unfair system that made it difficult for a man to make his living in that industry. Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties that they faced, these men helped to open up the country, and some of them-bu t very few-prospere d in the industry. 1 do not think it is necessary for me to say too much about labour conditions in the early days of the industry, because they were merely a reflex of the conditions of the workers in all industries at that time. Needless to say, they were deplorable. The bigger companies in the industry wanted to open up the country, and introduced Kanaka labour into the industry to work under conditions that were worse than those obtaining in United States of America during the days of the slave trade. I have met a few of the old-time blackbirders who provided native labour for the industry. They told me that if the boat trip from the island home of the Kanakas to the mainland was not too long, the Kanakas received no water to drink during the trip. They were battened down under the hatches and thirsted until they reached the mainland. In addition to Kanakas, large numbers of Japanese were employed on these plantations. The good sense of the Australian people led to the removal of the Kanakas, and most of them were returned to their homes. Japanese remained on the sugar fields for a long time, but their numbers gradually dwindled, and there are not many left there now. That is some of the history of how this industry was developed. The first sugar agreement, on which the whole organization of the sugar industry is based, was signed in 1915 by Mr Andrew Fisher, Labour Prime Minister of Australia, and Mr T. J. Ryan, Labour Premier of Queensland. It has been said, and it is worth repeating, that the sugar industry has the finest organization of any primary industry in Australia. Often when I hear members of the Australian Country party in this place arguing about conditions in the production of the various crops in which they are naturally interested, I wonder why the production of some of those crops has try, from a farming point of view. The not been organized along the lines on which sugar mills are very big and require very R -[74 ] the sugar industry has been organized. The splendid organization of the sugar industry could well be applied to other industries, both primary and secondary. I am sure that any honourable member who had the benefit of seeing the sugar industry in operation would admit that it is splendidly organized. The honourable member for Herbert said, and it is worth emphasizing, that there is no product in the community whose price is so strictly controlled as the price of sugar, no product whose cost of production is so carefully checked as is the cost of production of sugar, before any increase of price is granted. As the honourable member explained, the growers' organizations have to make out a clear case to the Queensland Sugar Board for an increase in the price of their product. If the board is convinced of the justification for an increase, a recommendation to that effect is made to the Queensland Premier, who refers it to the State Auditor-General, whose officers then make an exhaustive check on costs of production. If the State Government gives its blessing to the increase, the request is then forwarded to the Prime Minister, and presumably the Commonwealth Auditor-General also checks on the justification for the increase. The sugar producers must prove their case to the hilt before it is accepted that they require an increased price for their commodity. The sugar industry has been responsible for a large amount of employment in other States, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, and, to some extent, in South Australia. As far as I know, Western Australia is the only State which has not benefited in this respect. The production of sugar is worth £60,000,000 a year and of that amount millions of pounds are paid to the people who supply the machinery for the mills. Millions of pounds are paid to New South Wales and Victoria for farm machinery. All the cane is conveyed from the fields to the mills by trucks for which rails have to be purchased. Over the years, the millions of pounds which have been paid by the sugar industry, particularly to Victoria and New South Wales, have provided more employment in those States than would otherwise have been the case. This may be termed a very heavy indusheavy rollers and machinery. Those industries which use electrical equipment benefit from generous allowances for obsolescence because it is recognized that that type of machinery can go out of date very quickly. Very often, the machinery in the sugar mills becomes outdated because of the manufacture of new machinery but the mills do not benefit from an allowance of obsolescence equivalent to that which is applicable to electrical equipment. That is another ground on which these people could make an application for an increased price if they were hungry or greedy. A very large staff is employed in the sugar mills. Very often, there are three or four engineers in these places. During the slack season, the average number of men on the job it at least 100. They carry out repair work to the machinery and field equipment. These are all activities that have to be taken into consideration, not only from the growers' point of view, because sugar is their only crop, but from the point of view of the millers. The cost of milling forms part of the selling price of sugar. The mill constantly employs men and constantly repairs and replaces its machinery. When war broke out, Queensland, largely because of the sugar mills, was able to provide more ground staff for the Air Force than all the other States put together for the first twelve months of the war. Thereafter, Queensland supplied the same number of men per head of population as other States because of the number of engineers and apprentices that were engaged in the sugar mills. That fact was well known to those who were engaged in recruiting ground staff for the Air Force at the time. The old puffing-billies that were once used to bring the cane into the mills have been done away with. They have been replaced by modern diesel engines, bringing the transport section of the industry up to date. Many factors are concerned in the increase of costs. One of the greatest factors has been the introduction of what is known as gammexane. The sugar-growers used to lose a third of their crops through the inroads of the cane beetle. The introduction of gammexane practically wiped out the cane beetle, with the result that the rate of production has increased tremendously. I believe that the introduction of gammexane has been the greatest factor in increasing the rate of production in the sugar cane area. The sugar-growers fertilize their land extensively, and have to pay very high prices for fertilizer. They have to replace what is taken out of the soil, because cane is a vigorous grower. The amount of money spent on fertilizer is simply amazing to those who are used to ordinary farming. I told the cane-growers, years ago, "" If you have a few pounds to spare, take a few shares in a fertilizer company, and you may break even"". The companies that supply fertilizer are very big, and the price of fertilizer forms a major part of the growers' costs. Thank God they have gammexane, which has saved them from considerable loss. Generally speaking, prospects in the industry are now much better than they were. Sugar is an essential in the manufacture of soft drinks. The establishment of the sugar industry in north Queensland has enabled the huge factories engaged in the production of soft drinks, in New South Wales and Victoria, to obtain sugar at a reasonable price. That is of vital importance to the manufacturers of soft drinks. During World WarI . , Australia was unable to supply its own requirements of sugar. After the war, we had to pay up to £80 a ton for black-grown sugar. It will be realized that the establishment of the Australian industry has been an important factor in determining the price that we pay for sugar to-day. The late William Morris Hughes, after World WarI . , increased the price of sugar and assisted in the establishment of the sugar industry as it is to-day. In the early days, many men, both Labour and anti-Labour, took an active part in helping to establish the sugar industry. It is now an industry of which Australia can be proud. It contributes more than £60,000,000 a year to the wealth of Australia, and it enables other industries, such as the canned fruits industry, to exist. Naturally, the canned fruits industry seeks greater rebates in respect of the sugar it uses, but I suggest that it probably would not be able to continue to operate if we did not have our own sugar-growing industry, and if it were dependent on the importation of sugar from overseas, as was the case during, and for some time after, World WarI . The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) referred to the position regarding tin plate supplies. In this respect, we have the ridiculous fact that we sell our tin at low prices to other countries, which manufacture it into tin plate and send it back to Australia. I believe that Tasmania really has not a great deal to complain about regarding the sugar industry. The manufacturers of confectionery have established factories in Tasmania because they are sure of being able to obtain sugar readily, and also because of the availability of cheap electricity. I remind honourable members that the people of Innisfail, Babinda, Gordonvale and Cairns, where the sugar is grown, pay the same price for sugar as do the people of Perth, so that there is no bias against residents of particular areas. Naturally, those engaged in the sugar industry would like to have a refinery in the northern part of Australia, so that it would no longer be necessary to consign the initial cane products to the south for refining, and then have the refined sugar taken back to the north. But lhat is an incidental matter that is not possible to deal with at the moment. In relation to the position of the Tasmanian fruit industry, 1 had an interesting experience many years ago. The Jones company had, stacked in Melbourne, two years' supply of fruit pulp. When the Tasmanian growers asked the price that the company was offering for fruit, it told them so much a ton, and added, "" If you do not like it, we can make jam for two years and will not need to buy your fruit at all"". It seems to me that this firm profits most from the Tasmanian fruit industry. Naturally, if a company is established and is functioning efficiently, it is a desirable thing, but the point is that this company seems to have a monopoly of the hop industry, jam making and everything else. As I say, it seems to be getting much more from the canning industry than are either the sugar-growers or the fruit-growers. Unfortunately, Tasmania suffers many handicaps because of its isolation from the mainland. It may be possible for the sugar industry to do more for ""the Tasmanian fruit industry, although 1 think that, already, it is doing a very fine job for it. Apparently, apart from the desire for greater rebates, the fruit industry has no real complaint against the sugar industry. I believe that this bill will benefit be obtained elsewhere. Not only is it doing the suear industry. I refer, now to the bulk handling of sugar, which will save a great deal of money. Of course, large sums of money have been spent on the installation of equipment at the various ports in connection with the bulk loading of sugar. Although1 am familiar with the industry, I still find it remarkable that so much money should be spent in an endeavour to improve the industry, to increase efficiency, and to reduce costs wherever possible. I give the bill my blessing, and I hope that it will be possible to increase the rebate in the future. I believe that the amount of the rebate should be the subject of a special inquiry. If that were so, it might be possible to give satisfaction to a greater number of people. is rather sad, I think, that whenever this agreement comes before the House, honourable members divide into groups representing the northern and southern parts of Australia, irrespective of political parties. I think we should place this matter on a proper footing right from the start, and that instead of referring to the sugar industry as a great Queensland industry we should appreciate, in this national Parliament, that it is a great Australian industry which contributes substantially to the stability of the economy generally. It is all very well for the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) to argue that this Queensland industry should help the Tasmanian fruit industry, but not on the basis that it should do so because the Tasmanian fruit industry is a great Australian industry. I emphasize that the sugar industry is of national significance because it benefits every person in Australia. The agreement provides, in the main, for the continuation of the embargo on the importation of sugar into Australia, but we should acknowledge, at the present time, that that is not really necessary because there is not the slightest possibility of sugar being imported into Australia. The fact is that there is no surplus sugar in the world. If we did not grow cane in Australia, we should not be able to obtain sugar from any other country. Therefore, the Australian industry is supplying sugar to the people of Australia which could not that, but it is also supplying sugar at a",51,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
155,Mr Pearce (Capricornia) [4.42],"I tvery reasonable price indeed. The argument that the price of sugar in South Africa is approximately £9 a ton less than the price paid by fruit processors in Australia does not mean very much when we remember that we could not land South African sugar in Australia at the price for which Australian processors are able to obtain it under the agreement. The sugar industry, therefore, is supplying a commodity without which we should find it difficult to live, and it is doing so at to the honourable member. a most reasonable price, to the benefit of all members of the community, whether they are in Tasmania or in the northernmost part of Queensland. The agreement is a joint one between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government. Whilst the Commonwealth accepts responsibility to maintain the imposition of the embargo, the Queensland Government undertakes to do the six things enunciated by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr as honourable members are aware, the McMahon) in his second-reading speech. They are: First, it agrees to acquire all raw sugar produced from cane grown in Queensland and New South Wales agrees with that. Secondly, the Queensland Government undertakes to make sugar available in Australia at certain fixed prices. Thirdly, it agrees to control production; fourthly, to accept a responsibility for losses product. While it could be argued that the arising from the' export of surplus sugar; fifthly, to pay rebates on the sugar content of goods exported; and, sixthly, to contribute to the funds of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee. We must pay tribute to the part that various governments, both in Queensland and in the National Parliament, have played in the maintenance of this industry that serves Australia so well. I think of it more as a co-operative effort than as a socialist effort: though perhaps this is just juggling with terms. This co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government, in conjunction with the various organizations, has helped to establish a very efficient industry to-day which deserves praise from every quarter. The industry is unique in that the seller of the commodity, because of his efficiency, responsibility, not only of carrying out the is able to give through government chanterms of the agreement, but also of keeping nels to one section of purchasers, the prothe price of sugar to the Australian people cessors of jam and fruit, a huge concession which enables them to compete on the world markets and to keep down the price of their product within Australia. That an industry should grant huge concessions in the form of a rebate to processors so that they in turn may subsist and bolster their own industry is a unique development in the annals of primary industry in Australia. Mr George Lawson -Members of the Australian Country party are not listening of the truth of my statements that we may overlook that. It is not fair to the industry to say that the only concession which has been granted is a measly £2 4s. a ton by way of rebate to processors selling on the Australian market and an additional £24 in respect of exported manufactured goods containing Australian cane sugar, because, Export Sugar Committee calculates the rebate from month to month, and it is £26 7s. for the month of October. The rate of rebate is based upon variations in overseas prices and costs in Queensland. In the last three years, up to 31st August, 1955, the Australian fruit industry has received from the sugar industry no less than £929,000 in concessions, export rebates, and special assistance. No other primary industry in Australia makes concessions of that kind to purchasers of its price of sugar has increased in recent times, one must take account of the difficulties under which this industry has to operate. It is a tribute to the Australian sugar industry that to-day it is able to produce the second cheapest sugar in the world. The only competitor on world markets which can produce more cheaply is South Africa, which, as the honourable member foHerbert stated, on one of those rare occasions when I have agreed with him, has cheap black labour both in the fields and in the factories, and lower freight rates. Yet the Australian industry, with the exclusive use of white labour, is able to run second only to South Africa in producing the cheapest sugar in the world. The Queensland Government has the",54,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956

157,Mr Pearce,My socialist friend,55,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
158,Mr Pearce,"They are so well awareas low as possible. I am alarmed at the increased charges that have been levied on the industry by the Queensland Government. I am thinking in particular of freight rates. In Queensland the average distance over which cane is carried from farms to mills is about 20 miles. Adopting this mileage as a basis, we can gain some indication of the effect of increased freight rates upon the sugar industry over the last ten years, which increases, after all, are passed on to the Australian people in increased sugar prices. In 1955, there was a rise in the freight rate to lis. a ton of cane for 20 miles. This year, that rate has been increased by 5s. 3d., or about 50 per cent., to 16s. 3d. a ton. In the period from 1943 to 1946, when the freight rate was static, the freight on cane transported by rail for 20 miles was 3s. 3d. To-day, as I have said, it is 16s. 3d. I think that there were nine increases in the freight rate during the intervening period. An analysis of the figures discloses the interesting fact that the freight rate on cane transported from grower to mill has increased by 400 per cent, in ten years. In the same period the freight rate on raw sugar has increased by 208 per cent. While the freight rate on the cane, from which is manufactured a commodity the basic cost of which must affect every household in Australia, has increased by 400 per cent., the freight rate on manure, if I may make such a comparison, has been increased by 261 per cent. The latest increase in railway freight rates shows that freight on cane has increased by 5s. 3d., on raw sugar by 2s. l i d . , and on class A goods by only 2s. l i d . , the same as on sugar, and only about half of the increase applied to the transport of cane. This represents an imposition upon the industry, and I believe that it is brought about by the principle enunciated by the Queensland Minister for Transport and shown very clearly in practice, that the freight rates on the Queensland railways are governed by the competition that the railways receive from other forms of transport. As honourable members are aware, railway transport between the cane-fields and the mills is not subjected to much competition. The railways have a monopoly, and so the freight rates rise. This rise has contributed, in no small degree, to the increase of the price of refined R-175 ] sugar, legislative authority for which is sought in the bill which is now before the House. I ask the Minister for Primary Industry industry upon a stable and efficient basis, to endeavour to ensure that rises in freight rates, which perhaps are inescapable generally in Queensland, and 1 am not arguing against them, are spread evenly, because after all I cannot understand why freight on sugar cane should be increased by 400 per cent, when the freight on tenure is increased by only 261 per cent. There should be a levelling of freight rates, which would permit a reduction in the rate applied to cane, and would contribute to the future efficiency of the industry. Neither this Government nor the Queensland Government wishes to impose further burdens in the form of rising prices on the people of Australia, who are the main consumers of sugar. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) said that he was interested in the jam manufacturers but not in the domestic users of sugar. After all, the domestic users of sugar will feel the hardest impact, and we cannot go on indefinitely loading them with increased prices for a commodity that is indispensable in the family budget. Every endeavour must be made on all sides to keep the price of sugar stable, if possible. One way in which the Queensland Government can assist in this direction is by adopting an equitable scale of freight rates. The announcement that the freight rate on sugar cane was to be increased by 50 per cent, came as quite a shock to me, because the additional charge must inevitably be reflected in the price paid by the housewife for the commodities containing sugar. I hope that honourable members who have some influence with the Queensland Government'will be able to convince it without rancour-and I speak without rancourthat it should conduct an investigation so that the burden of increased costs, if they are inescapable, will be spread more equitably over all goods that are carried by the railways. The imposition of additional freight rates on sugar hits the whole of the Australian community in the long run and makes it difficult for this industry to survive. Although the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) and the honourable",55,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
159,"( Mr Mcmahon), In His Efforts To Keep This","member for Wilmot have spoken for their State-Tasmania-and the industries that are conducted there, I hope that the result will not be any difference of opinion between the users and the producers of sugar. We are proud of our fruit processors and fruit canners. They are doing a splendid job, and are producing a worthwhile commodity at a reasonable price for the households of Australia. At the same time, we must pay a real tribute to the sugar cane producers, the millers, those who handle the product and the governments that have co-operated in this scheme to produce a needed commodity at a reasonable price. Nothing is to be gained by remarks such as those made by my friend, the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth), who sneered at the sugar industry and said that Victoria needed cheaper sugar. I point out to the honourable member and to other honourable members that, if Queensland did not produce sugar, under present conditions we could not obtain sugar for Australia. There is no place from which we could purchase it, let alone purchase it at a cheaper price overseas. It is all very well to talk about the cheap sugar produced in South Africa, but by the time that sugar was brought to Australia, the price would possibly be about £10 a ton dearer than Australian sugar on the domestic market. We would be paying about 2d. a lb. more for it in the fair State of Victoria than we are Daying now. Let us put all those arguments to one side. Every one is getting the benefit of this industry, whether he lives in Tasmania, Queensland would not have been developed Victoria or Queensland. It is a worthwhile industry and by co-operation right through the piece this Government is able to play a part in giving a much-needed comsugar-producing constituency, has informed modity to the people at a reasonable price and at the same time contributing to the general economic stability of the nation. provides for the ratification of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government to maintain the to 1915, sugar was grown on large estates. stability of the sugar industry for another We had a kind of peasantry or share-farmfive years. We are dealing with the matter ing system in the industry at that time. The in retrospect because the increase in price Queensland Labour Government decided to was granted on 14th May last and has been apply its socialistic ideas to the industry, charged since that date. In the closing as far as possible, and resolved that tbe stages of this sessional period we are asked industry must be placed completely in the to ratify the agreement. The Government hands of the producers. That is to say would be very embarrassed if, by some means, the will of some Tasmanian members prevailed and the bill was rejected. But I think the common sense of most members will predominate and the bill will be passed. The agreement was first entered into in 1915 between two Labour governments. They were the Labour Government led by Mr Fisher, the Prime Minister, who represented the electorate of Wide Bay, a Queensland constituency, and the Labour government in Queensland led by Mr Ryan. The agreement was the basis for the stabilizing of this most important industry in Australia. It is the most important industry in Queensland and as an export commodity it is a great dollar-earner. I do not propose to follow the lead of other members who have spoken about the basis on which the price is determined, because I feel that so much has been said on that point that all members are completely convinced that the sugar industry is compelled to submit a watertight case before the Commonwealth will agree to increase the price of sugar. This great Australian industry is responsible for the settlement of large areas in tropical northern Queensland. It is the principal industry in northern Queensland and the production is valued at £60,000,000 in a year. It is a most efficient industry and takes advantage of all modern scientific developments in the growing and processing of sugar. Without this industry, northern to the same degree as it has been in recent years. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce), who represents a us-and he is competent to do so because of his long experience in the industry-of the role that the Queensland Labour Government has played in the development of In the early days of this century prior",56,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
160,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [4.58],"This bill this industry.those who produced the wealth in the industry must control it. That government was responsible for breaking up the large estates on which sugar cane was grown under the share-farming system and to-day many thousands of sugar-growers operate their own farms-eithe r freehold farms or farms leased from the Crown. The development of the industry was undertaken, first by Australians and British immigrants. At the conclusion of World WarI . a large number of Italians entered the industry. They have been most successful as producers of cane and as cutters and workers in the cane-fields. The operation of the industry has been most successfully carried out by Australian, British and Europeans in the cane-fields. I have said that the industry is an efficient one. It is also-and this is something of which Australian can boasta completely white industry. The Kanakas have been taken out of the industry. In the closing days of the last century, it was a black industry, and blackbirding was a common and profitable undertaking by many Queensland master mariners. The record of blackbirding is a very grave blot on Queensland's history. Blackbirding was the recruiting of black labour in the Pacific islands by force. The native labourers were brought to Queensland and treated as slaves. They were given only a miserable pittance as a reward for their labour. This practice ceased at the close of the nineteenth century, and although some of the descendants of these labourers still live in Queensland the sugar industry is conducted most efficiently, even in the tropics, wholly sive profits are being made by the sugar by white labour. The Queensland sugar industry is considerable, but they are no greater than trolled by the cane-growers, and all those those being made by other manufacturing engaged in it, whether producers or companies. Every one acknowledges that workers, receive a reasonable reward for profits are increasing, and that it is the their efforts. It is to the credit of the policy of this Government not to discourage trade unions in Queensland, particularly higher profits. That is one of the reasons the Australian Workers Union, that the infor the present inflationary spiral. The terests of the workers have at all times been sugar refining companies are making procompletely safeguarded. The unions take fits at the same rate at which other indusa very keen interest in all phases of the intrial concerns are making them. I hope 1 dustry, as we learned from the remarks of shall see the day when control by the the honourable member for Herbert( Mr growers will have extended so much in the Edmonds), who, prior to becoming a memsugar industry that the complete processing ber of the Parliament, had considerable of sugar, including refining, will be underexperience in the sugar industry as an Austaken either by co-operative establishments tralian Workers Union official in the or by plants owned by the Queensland Townsville area. Doubtless he is better informed about the sugar industry than is any other honourable member present today. It is something to be proud of that the unions in Queensland have adopted such a reasonable approach to this most important Queensland industry and bave shown so much concern for its welfare. The growers themselves own many of the mills at which the sugar cane is crushed. I suppose the best example of the cooperative system is to be found in the Queensland sugar industry. It is true that several mills are owned by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, and another by the Millaquin Sugar Company Limited at Bundaberg. But the processing of sugar from the .crushing of the cane to the brown sugar stage is undertaken largely in co-operative mills owned by the growers. I hope that this system will be extended. If the Labour Government continues to hold office in Queensland grower control and the co-operative system will be extended as the industry expands. Although processing up to the brown sugar stage is conducted largely in co-operative mills owned by the growers, the refining and marketing of sugar unfortunately is completely in the hands of private enterprise. I have mentioned the Millaquin Sugar Company Limited at Bundaberg and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, which operates throughout Australia and acts as agent for the Queensland Government in disposing of the refined product in various parts of the country. It cannot be said with truth that excesrefining companies. Their profits are conSugar Board or the Queensland Government. The growers have demonstrated their ability to control the industry in the initial Stages of production. As improved methods and scientific developments are applied to the growing and crushing of cane and the processing of sugar a great step forward in the interests of the industry and the consumers of Australia could be taken if refining were placed completely in the hands of the sugar producers. That proposition is not unreasonable, and I hope it will be put into effect as the industry grows and develops. In north Queensland, particularly at the port of Mackay, bulk-handling equipment is being installed to load sugar into ships. As the honourable member for Leichhardt has said, this is an important development which will be a major contributing factor in the reduction of costs. Bulk handling can cushion the increased costs which are common in all industries to-day. As I have said, the sugar industry produces £60,000,000 worth of sugar annually. This production is not only for home consumption, but also for export, and the industry is a major earner of dollars for Australia. The"" Monthly Bulletin of Oversea Trade Statistics "", issued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics in June last, shows that during the year ended 30th June, 1956, a total of £24,641,000 worth of sugar was exported from Australia. The United Kingdom bought £13,827,000 worth, and Canada, £3,491,000 worth. New Zealand also was a good customer, and bought £3,456,000 worth. Japan apparently wished to keep on side with us, and bought £2,051,000 worth. with Hong Kong, amounting to £1,039.000. Singapore purchased sugar worth £105,000. When we are considering an export industry closely supervised by the Queensland lhat sells goods overseas worth almost Agricultural Department. Every modern £25,000,000, we should realize the importscientific device that can be used in the ance of that industry to Australia. I shall now cite some figures from a are grown.

The industry will maintain this very The industry has grown rapidly in Queenshigh rate of efficiency, and so long as it land in recent years. In 1950-51, the area continues to enjoy the goodwill of the Ausof land on which cane was grown for crushtralian and Queensland governments it will ing amounted to 263,666 acres. By go from success to success. 1954-55, this area had increased to 367,640 acres. The increase in the amount of sugar sold has been really phenomenal.. In 1951-52, a total of 921,000 tons of sugar was sold. This had increased by 1954-55 to 1,327.000 tons. It is very pleasing to note that 44 per cent, of the sugar produced in 1950-51 was exported, while in 1954-55, the proportion had increased to 59 per cent. It can be seen, therefore, that production in the industry is sufficient not only fo supply the Australian market, but also to satisfy a considerable export demand. Other speakers in this debate have pointed out that the price paid by consumers in this country for Australian sugar is less than the price for which sugar produced anywhere overseas could be sold in Australia. It is true that SouthAfrica, by employing black labour under sorry conditions, is producing sugar at a cost less than that for which it is being produced in Australia. South African sugar, however, could not be brought to Australia and sold at a lower price than that for which Australian sugar is sold, even if it were duty free. That is because of the high freight charges that would be involved. The Australian consumer, therefore, is buying the cheapest sugar that it is possible for him to buy, even if the import of sugar into Australia were allowed. This reflects great credit on all those associated with the production of this most important commodity. It is true that the industry enjoys many advantages, and that the importation of sugar is prohibited. However, the industry has risen to the occasion and has done all that the Australian people expected it to do. It has demonstrated its appreciation of what has been done for it over the years by the The sugar industry is most efficient. It is industry is being used.

The consumption of rum in Queensland and, I take it, in other parts had it not been for the settlement of of Australia, has declined considerably. men cheer until I finish my statement. The consumption of rum has fallen because of the action of this Government in reducing the excise on brandy produced by South Australian grape-growers, while maintaining the high excise on rum. 1 understand, although again I cannot speak with authority and must be guided by those who can, that rum is a less harmful drink than brandy. gesture on the part of this Government to hostile to the way in which the industry place rum, a by-product of the sugar indusis organized.

Our attitude towards the great cases which were fought through the sugar industry has been the same the High Court and taken, ultimately, to through the years. One of the greatest the Privy Council, were all necessary in achievements in Australian history has been order that the industry should become the establishment of the sugar industry, organized. The Labour party, therefore, especially in Queensland and the northern favours the renewal of this agreement, on part of New South Wales, on the basis just terms, and after careful examination of of European labour. The struggle, of it has been made. We believe that it is course, is finished in one sense, but at one necessary in the interests of the industry, time in the history of Queensland there bility that the industry might not be established on the basis I have mentioned. It has been done, not entirely but very largely, Queensland of the Labour movement, and the pioneers representing other political points of view. It is quite obvious that the coast of Queensland, particularly of north Queensland, would not have been so secure as it was during the last war. Queensland, which in itself constituted a great contribution to the defence of Queensland, and which is inseparably connected with the sugar industry. Therefore, the development of the industry has been something of a romance, which has affected the whole of Australia. It has been very well organized. I can recall some of the struggles which led to the great contests in the courts of the land. The organized employees, at first, had great difficulty in maintaining their positions vis-a-vis the refining company, but gradually they came into their own.

169,Dr. Evatt,"That is so. From manyof overseas commerce, and of the development of the north of Australia, which is a vital element in our defence. I come now to the point which was, quite correctly, made by my colleague, the honourable member for Wilmot, and other honourable members representing Tasmania on this side of the House. It is not right that the subsidies, or grants, given to the processing industries should be linked in this way with the sugar industry, although sugar is, of course, the vital product. The Australian people want to see all primary indusfrom Queensland, the continuation of that tries successful. There is no need for this tug of war between two industries each year. The grant-in-aid should not be dependent upon the arrangement as to sugar, although, of course, sugar is the commodity in respect of which the ultimate aid is given. There is a false contest every year, and all Australians will agree that this apparent conflict should not exist. That is, I think, the point of view of my friend, the honourable member for Wilmot. These points are not made in any sense of opposition to the basic features of the sugar agreement. It is easy to introduce politics, as some honourable members are tempted to do, but both industries should be encouraged. Notwithstanding all this, the sentiment of Australians, and especially of the Labour movement, in regard to the sugar industry is long-standing and very real. We have, in Australia, something that. 40 years ago, would have been thought possiblea great sugar industry, with massive production, operating under strict organization and controls of the kind to which Government supporters opposite, and in the corner, normally object from beginning to end. Those controls are accepted without question because they are to the benefit of the people. That being the point of view of the Opposition, I thought it right, at the end of the debate and without interfering with any further comment that the Minister may make, to express it. The work of the pioneers in the sugar industry of Australia should not be forgotten. In Queensland, because Kanaka labour was used, there were disgraceful and terrible working conditions. Those who, with courage, foresaw that that would do injury to Australia, and to the sugar industry, were great men in their time and undertook a tremendous struggle. One has only to look at the Queensland press of those days to realize the attacks that these pioneers had to combat in order to improve conditions. The improvement in the industry has been brought out by men in public life who have represented a number of political parties, but it cannot be denied that among the pioneers were the earliest members of the Labour movement in Australia. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds), who has put the case for the Opposition, represents, with his colleagues tradition. General and Minister for the Navy) [5.30]. I was very interested to hear the final remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). He referred, quite correctly, to the great achievements of the sugar industry on the north-eastern coast of Australia, and to their great value in developing that area and increasing our defence potential. The honourable member described the history of the industry as a romance. As one who has been associated, ever since 1 can remember, with this particular romance. I feel that I can contribute something of value to the debate and can suggest to Tasmanian representatives who have been somewhat critical of certain aspects of the agreement, a way in which Tasmanian producers could derive much greater advantage than they could from the proposals that have been put forward on their behalf to-day. I was very surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that my colleagues of the Australian Country party should really be hostile to this proposal because the industry provides an example of controls and socialization. That is a theory that one hears expressed from time to time by people who do not understand how the sugar industry works. I suppose that I have been associated with the industry for more than 30 years. It is one of the finest examples of co-operative farmer organization formed for the purpose of looking after the farmers' interests. The controls, which have operated to such good effect, have, before their adoption, been discussed thoroughly by the rank and file, approved by a majority vote, and adopted in a way that is not socialistic, but democratic. Indeed, the great success of this co-operative effort, as compared with the results obtained",60,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956

Most of the reaction to this bill has not only been favorable.

Let us look, without question by the Parliament. The to begin with, at the relationship between sugar industry has voluntarily accepted certhe two primary industries, which have been tain obligations to offset the benefit it gains mentioned by both the honourable member from the fixed home consumption price for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) and the honorand the embargo on importation.

I shall not go into a lot of freight. In other words, the manufacdetail on this matter, but it is contended turers are able to obtain the sugar compothat as a result of the operations of the nent of the goods they produce at a price fruit industry the sugar industry has been competitive with the price paid for sugar provided with a very considerable market. by manufacturers in other parts of the world Well, we in the sugar industry value our who are producing the same kind of goods. markets. From time to time, we have had So the export rebate offsets the effect of some difficulties in respect of markets, but the embargo on the manufacturer. We let me assure the House that, as a result of in the sugar industry have no desire to the excellence of our organization, we have evade that obligation, and I shall point out always been able to market our product, in a few moments that the proposals in and would have been able to do so even the bill, which were suggested by the sugar without the support of the fruit industry. Another fact that is not generally known to improve the existing situation. is, that during the period from about 1943 to 1953, the sugar industry made available, by way of domestic rebates to the fruit industry, a total of approximately which some of the criticism uttered here £1,300,000 at a time when sugar sold to the to-day has revolved. The domestic rebate fruit industry for fruit processing could is entirely designed to assist fruit-growers have been sold on overseas markets at prices in the southern States. When this system from £10 to £30 a ton higher than those was initiated, I think by the honourable memreceived from the fruit industry. We do ber for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), it was not begrudge that loss. That was part of made plain that it was a temporary exthe economic set-up of the industry, but pedient only, and was not to be regarded the point should be explained in rebuttal as part and parcel of the economy of the of any suggestion that the sugar industry has fruit industry for all time. It was felt that gained a great deal from its association with the fruit industry required some assistance, the fruit industry. The economy of the sugar industry is was then in a parlous condition, could be based on the embargo on the importation of put back on its feet and enabled to support sugar, to which reference has been made, itself thereafter. The method of operation and on the fixed price for sugar consumed of the domestic rebate has already been in Australia. This bill proposes to extend dealt with at length, and I need not expand the embargo and to increase the home conmuch on the explanations already given. the present season. That arrangement, which has existed for many years, is now an important and integral part of export rebate in respect of sugar used industry, give ample evidence of the fact that the industry is prepared to do all it can Then there is the domestic rebate, around and that this was the right way to provide that assistance, so that that industry, which Briefly, it enables manufacturers using Australian fruit for local consumption to pay the fruit-growers a certain definite price, on the understanding that if that price, as determined by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, is so paid the manufacturers will qualify for the domestic rebate. As the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr The industry also suggested, in respect Duthie) has been ZZ 4s. a ton for many years, during which there has been no increase in consonance with increases of costs. There is no logical justification, I submit, for exthat the committee itself would not be in pecting one primary industry to support another primary industry in perpetuity. I repeat that the domestic rebate was initiated originally as a temporary expedient, lt has remained in existence because those who speak for the sugar industry have said that although the rebate was not justified they were willing that it should continue, but they were not willing that it should be increased. They told the Government that, whilst they would not seek a discontinuance of the rebate, there should be a new basis on which both the domestic rebate and the export rebate were determined. The Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has received from the sugar industry a statutory annual amount of £216,000, plus an ex gratia amount as determined from year to year by the Export Sugar Committee. I point out that the statement of the honourable member for Franklin that the total amount paid by the industry to the committee for many years was £216,000 is not correct. The statutory amount was £216,000, but for many years before the last war the sugar industry was required to make, in addition to that statutory contribution, an ex gratia payment. It is evidence of the desire of the industry to honour its obligations in this regard that it made this payment each year without any question. The sugar industry was, therefore, providing the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee with up to £300,000 a year. It is considered more desirable, from the point of view of the industry and for the sake of the simplification of accountancy problems in handling the rebates, that this system, in which the ex gratia payment has to be worked out at the end of the season, be altered. Therefore, the industry suggested to the Government that it, the industry, should contribute to the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee for the payment of the domestic rebate an amount of £120,000 a year. At the moment, the payment in respect of the domestic rebate is about £105,000 so the industry's suggestion means that it is willing to continue the present payments, plus £15,000. pointed out, that rebate of the export rebate, that it would be better if it undertook to pay whatever amount was required, as determined from month to month by the Export Sugar Committee, so the position of running short of cash and having to come to the industry for an amount not previously determined. As a result of that arrangement, which has been accepted by the Government, the industry under this legislation, will be committed to the payment of an estimated amount of £355,000 a year, with export prices as they are, as distinct from the statutory amount of £216,000 provided for in the previous agreement. I want that understood because that is the proposal of the industry itself, put forward in the usual fair and honourable way in which the industry generally puts forward its claims and proposals. I turn now to the position of the fruit industry. There is no doubt that the jam industry, as distinct from the canning industry, is not in a very happy or successful economic position. What is the reason for that? The reason is that certain costs have increased. We find that, in order to deal with this situation, the fruit industry is immediately flying to the sugar industry for help-probabl y as a matter of habit-sayin g that it is getting into a worse and worse position and that, as the sugar industry has given help for many years, it should give more help now. There is no logical justication for such an argument. Honourable members will find, if they go into the position, that the increases in costs, which have put the jam industry into this position, are not due solely to the sugar content of the product. Here is the actual position: Let us take a 24-oz. tin of plum jam and compare the price in Sydney in June, 1938, with the price in May, 1956, and let us compare the sugar component in that tin in 1938 with the present sugar component. I suggest that that is a fair and reasonable way of determining whether there is any virtue in the claim that the sugar industry should contribute more than the amount of £2 4s. a ton which it previously paid. In June, 1938, the tin of jam could be bought in Sydney for just over 9d. Now it costs about 2s. 6d. The cost of the sugar in June, 1938, was 32.3 per cent, of the price, but .by May, 1945, the figure had dropped to 24.3 per cent. The cost of all the other components rose from 67 per cent, in June, 1938, to 75 per cent, of the selling price. So it is not the sugar component which has caused increased costs in the jam industry. Therefore, the remedy does not lie in attempting to make some minor alteration to the sugar component cost while other components remain untouched. It has been suggested that if the sugar industry is to be called upon to make a contribution which will really help the jam industry, the amount should be of the nature of £13 or £14 a ton instead of £2 4s. That, in itself, indicates that there is some factor other than the sugar component in the price of jam which has to be tackled. What would be the position if the fruit industry were successful in its submissions and it was decided that the sugar industry must contribute more to the berry-fruit industry in Tasmania to enable it to operate successfully? Let me interpolate that nothing that I am saying now is to be attributed to any desire to see the fruit industry continue in a parlous condition. Certainly, as a primary producer, I want to see it prosper. But we must look at this position: If it were desired to help the fruit industry with a further contribution from the sugar industry, that could be done only by another increase in the price of sugar to the consumer, because the cost of assisting the fruit industry could not be taken out of the present return to the sugar-grower. This amending bill provides for an increase of Id. per lb. in the price of refined sugar. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, that increase to the sugar growers and the sugar-millers has already been taken up, practically, in increased costs. Therefore, as the figure determined by this Government has given only a fair and reasonable return to the industry, eating into that return by assisting the fruit industry could only result in a further increase in sugar production costs. Such an increase would mean that the' sugar industry would be required to put up the price of its product in order to enable another industry to obtain a greater return. In effect, the sugar industry would be blamed for increasing the price of its product when in actual fact none of the increased price of sugar would go to the industry. That would be an untenable position. Let me suggest to those who have been applying themselves to this problem that the remedy for this position lies in adopting the recommendation made about three years ago by the McCarthy committee of inquiry into the sugar industry. This was a committee which went very thoroughly into the conditions in the sugar industry and made certain recommendations. Representations were made to the committee by representatives of the fruit industry. The recommendation of the committee wasThat the amount and conditions of payment of the fruit industry rebate of £2 4s. a ton remain unaltered. That was the recommendation of an impartial body after it had made a very thorough investigation into the position of both industries. The recommendation of the committee continuedThat any request for an increase of the fruit industry rebate be referred to the Tariff Board or some other competent authority for full inquiry. I strongly commend to those who are desirous of helping the fruit industry that that recommendation should be put into effect now. The Minister for Primary Inthis way is open to the fruit industry, but I do not know of any real approach having been made by the fruit industry to the Government for the holding of such an inquiry. Certainly, I understand that representations have been made to the Minister from the fruit industry for further relief. But the Minister will confirm that no firm proposal, based on need, has been put to the Government for consideration. When the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) was speaking, he referred to this matter and said that the industry had been told to try this other method. He asked whether there was any guarantee that if such an approach were made the Government would consider it. In the first place, the responsibility is surely on the industry itself to prepare a documented case and",61,Sugar Agreement Bell 1956
171,Dustry ( Mr Mcmahon) Has Already Said That,"present it' to the Government. Secondly, 1 point out that this Government has never refused to give urgent and detailed consideration to any proposal that has been put forward authoritatively on behalf of any primary industry. From time to time, the sugar industry has presented to the Government a carefully documented case. It has argued that case, and has submitted itself to investigation. Finally, as a result of that action, it has achieved the result that it desired. The wheat industry, from time to time, has approached the Government. The dairy industry has approached the Government from time to time. The dried vine fruits industry, recently, through the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) approached the Government. Therefore, why has the Tasmanian fruit industry not approached the Government? What is there to stop it from approaching the Government? What other assurance does the industry need that its case will be given reasonable consideration than the history of this Government in dealing with primary industry organizations in the way that I have outlined? I sincerely believe that, by this method, the fruit industry would achieve something of far greater value than it would achieve by means of any request to the sugar industry to give it a bit more by way of domestic rebate. If such an investigation is held and if the case of the industry is sound and properly presented, I. feel that the report of specifically by the recent resignation of one any investigating committee would be of such a nature as to place that industry's economy on a far more sound basis than it is at present. It will not then be forced, as it is being forced now and has been forced in the past, virtually to go cap in hand to another primary industry and say, ""May we have some more support? "" put that to the House sincerely. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) should say to the people in the fruit industry, "" Get moving in a practical common sense way. Prepare your case and put it up to the Government for investigation by a board and the probable result will be that you will receive assistance, but not at the expense of a sister industry "". I commend that attitude to those who are sincerely tryservants, whom the original legislation ing to help the berry fruits industry. Question resolved in the affirmative.

176,Mr Nelson (Northern Territoray),"barred completely by this bill. At one time, it was thought that certain persons employed by the Northern Territory Administration were eligible for election, but as a result of the clarification of the position by the measure before the House they too will be debarred from serving on the council. The limitations placed in the way of those eligible to serve on the council in the past were somewhat peculiar. As was pointed out approximately three years ago, when the Government introduced legislation dealing with the matter, the act as it then stood debarred practically every resident of the Territory from seeking nomination for election to the council. For instance, the provision relating to contracts made it apparent that a person who held even a petty contract, such as a contract to maintain an aerodrome on a propertya job which, of course, only a person living on the property could do-for a payment of £20, £30 or £40 per annum, was automatically disqualified. Similarly, any person who held a Crown land lease in the north was disqualified. Any one who had contractual obligations to the Government was automatically disqualified. However, the resignation to which I have referred brought the matter to a head, and as a result, the Government decided to clarify the position by means of legislation. Honourable members on this side of the House would have preferred to see the range of qualifications broadened to include civil servants, because we feel that a civil servant should not automatically be disqualified simply because he is a civil servant. position of the Northern Territory LegislaAlthough the Minister stated, in his second reading speech, that the council would not be called together until after a general election had been held, no mention has been made of the date of the general election. The Opposition considers that an indication by the Government that an election will take place some time before the New Year would allow the various interested parties in the north to get to work and plan their campaigns, so that they would be in a position to start campaigning the moment the decision was made. If, on the other hand, it is not the intention of the Government to hold an election until after Christmas, that fact should be made known, because at that time of the year many people leave the north for holidays in the south, if they are sufficiently fortunate, and if an election were to be held immediately after the Christmas holidays, they might not be able to avail themselves of the opportunity to participate. When I said that the Opposition would not oppose this bill, I did not mean that we on this side of the chamber were satisfied with the present arrangement in relation to the Legislative Council. We believe that, in considering this legislation, it would have been opportune for the Government to say, "" A crisis exists in relation to the council at the present time, and we shall investigate the whole of its activities. We think that this is an opportune time to extend the scope of the activities of the council"". In this respect, the Minister stated, in the course of his second-reading speechIt came under notice that provisions incidental to the election of members had produced an unsatisfactory situation. It was desirable that this be remedied as early as possible. There has been no occasion for a wider review of the constitution, of the council, and no such wider review has been made. The council, as we know it to-day, has functioned for some eight or nine years. It has functioned under this Government since 1949, and we of the Opposition think that it is time that a positive step was taken to widen its functions with a view to allowing the citizens of the north a great deal more say in their affairs than they have at the present time. I do not think that it could be said that I am wasting the time of the Parliament to-night when I direct attention to the comtive Council. It consists of a chairman and thirteen members, of whom six are elected and seven are nominated. The Administrator is the chairman of the council and he has a casting vote as well as a deliberative vote, which, in effect, means that the Government, through its nominated members, exercises nine votes to the six votes exercised by the elected members. I feel sure that in those conditions nobody could say that the people of the Northern Territory have a real say in their own affairs. Let me suggest some means whereby the Government could enlarge the opportunities of citizens to participate in their own local government. At present, the representatives of the people are in the minority. There has been no attempt, in the nine or ten years of the council's existence, to increase the representation of the people. It is true that three years ago some minor amendments were made to the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, under which the Northern Territory Legislative Council is established, but those amendments were purely of a machinery character and did nothing to broaden the functions of the council or to improve its composition. It would be impossible for the Government to say that the elected members of the council have not discharged their duties with a sense of responsibility and with credit to themselves. The Government could not say that the elected members have acted irresponsibly, and therefore any suggestion that the people of the Northern Territory are not capable of looking after their own affairs and governing themselves cannot be sustained. When wider powers for the people of the guard, there would be a means of keeping north are sought, the retort always is that a check on the council, while allowing it the Australian taxpayers find the money a greater share of self-determination. required for the development of the north and so they must have the final say in the disbursement of those funds. We agree Hasluck), in a previous debate, strenuously that possibly the Australian taxpayers denied the suggestion that the Northern generally do find most of the money that Territory was governed by remote control is expended in the north, but we say that from Canberra, saying that there were 400 the expenditure by the Commonwealth of civil servants in the Northern Territory but money in the north is an investment, and only 200 in all sections of the Department virtually an insurance policy for the rest of Territories in Canberra and Sydney.

He has been over the country and he realizes the possibilities and acknowledges that we should at least receive the benefit of our own production. I suggest, in all seriousness, that the Government should consider widening the powers of the Legislative Council, even if safeguards to protect Commonwealth revenue are retained. The Government could now easily make the council fully elective or at least provide for the majority of its members to be elected, with the safeguard of a veto vested in this Parliament. This would give this Parliament an overriding power to veto any decisions which were not in line with Commonwealth policy, although I do not think that that power would be required.

181,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [8.25],"Th efarm, I can appreciate the value to the farming community of a measure of this kind. I, like many others on this side of the House, particularly my Western Australian friends, give full credit to Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited, in Western Australia, for entering the field of heavytype tractors against rather stiff opposition from bigger combines in Australia, and from some with associations outside Australia. I know that, during the last eighteen months, Western Australian members within the Government ranks have put up quite a fight to ensure that this firm would receive jams. We would then have a very nice a better spin than it has been getting. The tractor is almost entirely of Australian conbehalf of the Opposition. We fully supstruction.

I suggest that he and well as on tractors with 55 horse-power some other honourable members have not engines, as at present. In other words, the correctly interpreted this measure.

186,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [8.30],"It »workers, is situated in my electorate. J am closely associated with its operations, and I am naturally vitally interested in its future. I remind honourable members that the basic principle underlying the Tractor Bounty Act is that the bounty paid should help the company concerned to make a profit on its operations after years of struggling to become established. I am sure it is not necessary for me to-night to go over the ground that I traversed some months ago when I pointed out how desperate was the company's situation in its early months of operation. As the years have passed it has, understandably, accumulated an overdraft, which is so great that the Western Australian Government has had to come into the picture and support the company's operations in order to save it from collapse. The object of the act, as far as I can interpret it, is that the company should receive the bounty for every tractor it produces. I suggest that this is the logical interpretation. For what other purpose is the bounty paid except to ensure that a margin of profit shall be enjoyed by the company? Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited is a progressive company. 1 have previously referred to its struggle to become established. As I have said before, it will enjoy a slight profit margin if trie bounty is continued for the next, three years as has been arranged. Without the bounty it would have no margin of profit. Not only has this company made progress in its operations, but it is offering to primary producers and to any one who requires a tractor a most acceptable machine. The name of "" Chamberlain "" is known across Australia to-day, and honourable members who represent country electorates will agree that it has become recognized as the mark of a machine of excellent quality. The demand for Chamberlain tractors has naturally been most outstanding in Western Australia, but in Queensland, the State which is farthest removed from the Chamberlain factory, there is a growing demand for the various tractors produced by this company, which, as other companies have done, has once ' again proved the capabilities of Australian enterprise. Since its establishment the company has Board's report clearly showed to any one been conducted not as a government conwho was interested in the matter and who cern but as a private undertaking. There could intelligently read the report that that is now clear evidence of its success and of the high quality of its products. I emphasize that the Chamberlain company has naturally undertaken market research so that its production programme may be based on a clear understanding of the demand for tractors in Australia. This programme has been adjusted with the passage of the years. In the last twelve months or so the company has made every possible endeavour to reduce costs. Precision machinery has been installed for this express purpose and to enable it to produce tractors of even better quality. I should like to take the opportunity to tell the House something of the company's production programme, and what it expects to be able to do in the current financial year if it receives for every tractor produced a bounty of between £200 and £240. It expects, if the demand continues at the present level, to be able to produce during the next twelve months between 1,200 and 1,500 Champion model tractors of 48 maximum belt-pulley horse-power; approximately 200 55 D.A. model tractors of 55 maximum belt-pulley horse-power; and 120 70 D.A. heavy model tractors which exceed 70 maximum belt-pulley horse-power. The Tractor Bounty Act was renewed during the last sessional period for three years subsequent to the submission by the Tariff Board of its report of 14th October last year. The board had been requested to undertake its tenth investigation into the tractor industry in Australia, and to report to the present Attorney-General (Senator O'Sullivan), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, whether the Tractor Bounty Act should be renewed for another three years. In its conclusions at page 8 of the report the board statedthe Board is satisfied that the industry has not remained static. The evidence shows that the industry has already introduced, and plans further introduction of, new models: by incorporating diesel power units in its locally produced tractors it has kept abreast of the present tendency on the part of tractor buyers to favour diesel tractors. The local industry has been forced by competition to meet the demand that, it is claimed, exists for high-powered tractors of this type. When the Tractor Bounty Bill 1956 was under consideration in this Parliament I found that a careful examination of its provisions in conjunction with the Tariff oiu introduced two anomalies. I realize, of course, that the Tariff Board is a select committee of men entrusted with very great responsibility in their various investigations and reports in connection with Australian industries, and they were most deliberate, in the report from which 1 have quoted, in two respects. Their views on these two aspects of the matter have not been supported by the bill that the Government has introduced. One of the board's recommendations was as follows:That the Tractor Bounty Act 1939-1953 be bounty payment on tractors over 55 horseamended to provide for payment of bounty on tractors exceeding 55 m.b.p.h.p., when fitted power, and in my correspondence and my with an imported engine, of £200 per tractor. In its explanation to support that recomTariff Board report is there any reference mendation, the board saidNo provision is made in the Tractor Bounty Act most surprised, on examining the bill, to 1939-1953 for the payment of bounty on the production in Australia of wheel-type tractors of over 55 m.b.p.h.p. As the present tendency is altered by replacing the figure 55 . with the towards high-powered tractors the board considers figure 70. I suggest, therefore, that the thai a bounty should be paid on wheel-type tractors amending bill before the House, as it stands, coming within this category. The volume of sales will accomplish very little indeed. I might in the over 55 m.b.p.h.p. classification is relatively low by comparison with the sales volume in the well ask the question: What will this bill other five classifications and the board is of the accomplish? In very succinct terms, I sugopinion that it would be uneconomic to manufacgest that this is what the bill really does: ture in Australia the large high horse-power multiIn the first place, it removes the necessity cylinder diesel engines used as the power unit of these tractors. For this reason the bounty should to fit a governor to reduce the horse-power be extended to cover such tractors when manuof the larger tractor produced by the factured in Australia and incorporating importe-J Chamberlain company. engines.

This bill removes the necessity 'ractors exceeding 55 m.b.p.h.p., incorporating imported engines, should be £200 per unit. The cost of the engine would need to be excluded from calculations determining the percentage o' Australian content. \nother point of view expressed in the board's report, and which I believed was momalous when not incorporated in the Jill, was that the Tariff Board felt that a protective tariff was entirely warranted in order to protect the Australian tractor manufacturing industry. When these two points, which I recognized as anomalies, were not covered by the bill, and it was ecognized that the bill would merely enable he continuance of the subsidy payment on tractors below 55 horse-power, and that there would be no tariff protection, I made subsequent representations to the Minister. 3nd I expected that the amendment that is now before the House would be so drafted that at least one of those two anomalies would be adjusted. If any misunderstanding occurred in my contacts with the Minister and the discussions that I have had, I must claim that at least I understood that the larger tractor would be covered by subsidy when the amending bill was brought down. was dumped. then were primarily aimed at obtaining discussions I used the wording used by the Tariff Board in its report.

Is that right? What is it possible for me to do in this set of circumstances? I want to urge the Government most strongly to review the Tractor Bounty Act once again, and to provide for the following two matters-first , the removal of the limit of 70 horse-power in the table of bounty rates, and a provision that tractors of more than 40 horse-power should qualify for the bounty of £240; secondly, because of that recommendation of the Tariff Board which is material in regard to the larger tractors, I strongly recommend the exclusion of the cost of imported engines used in Australian-produced tractors when determining the percentages of Australian content for the purpose of qualification for subsidy. In other words, the cost of the imported engines should be excluded, so that the company may legitimately claim the subsidy on each of the heavy tractors that it produces.

I have inspected the Chamberlain undertaking in Western Australia on a number of occasions. I saw it more than three years ago when the question of a bounty was being canvassed.

I would import from abroad nothing that could be manufactured here. We are told that it is uneconomic to manufacture this or that in Australia. What does that matter? In war-time we did many things that were allegedly uneconomic. Who is to determine whether the production of a certain commodity is economic or uneconomic? Who is to be the final judge in this matter? the people will judge this and many other questions. When World War II . broke out we did not have an aircraft factory in this country. We had to start from the bottom. The argument against the manufacture of tractors in Australia is similar to that which is being advanced right now in regard to the manufacture of aircraft. We are told that, because of large-scale manufacture, aircraft can be obtained much more cheaply overseas, and that we ought not to continue our own aircraft industry in this country. I believe that we should encourage the manufacture of aircraft, tractors and anything else, as much as we can. If we do not do that how shall we fill the country; how shall we give people o employment; how shall we hold this continent of 3,000,000 square miles as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations? The Minister has a surfeit of the old free trade propaganda. He comes, of course, from New South Wales which, before federation, was the home of free trade, but which, when protection became our national policy, developed into out greatest State. from New South Wales, I have many fellow malefactors. advocate pre-federation free trade policies. It is an offence to Australian nationhood to advocate the sort of ideas that went out of date at the time of federation. What the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) said about the Chamberlain company is quite true. He knows the position at first hand because he represents that area. Those who have had the opportunity to go over the Chamberlain establishment and to see the number of people who are employed there feel that the Government, having appointed a Tariff Board, ought at least to carry out its recommendations. The Government should not act as a kind of super tariff board. What do Ministers know about tariff matters that would justify them in disregarding the opinion of the expert body that has been set up to advise them? board was always right. so seldom right that I am beginning to believe that when it disregards the opinion of the Tariff Board it can always be expected to be wrong. I know that the Tariff Board is not always right, but at least it is an instrument of this Parliament, and was set up for the purpose of protecting young and growing Australian industries. If the Parliament had no confidence in the board it would long ago have protested against its succession of recommendations. Every one acknowledges that the Tariff Board gives a dispassionate report on matters that it investigates. All of us at times would query whether the board is sufficiently adventurous in its recommendations, but if it recommends protection for an industry it ill behoves any government to say, "" No. We will not protect that industry. We will let it live for another year or two or three on a bounty "". not increase the price of tractors to farmers? not. Primarily, I am concerned with holding this country for western civilization. The farmers of Australia have done very well out of the legislation which, over the vernments to protect their interests.

228,Mr Pearce,"To o long!the honourable gentleman, and by the grace of God, and the votes of more than SO per cent, of the electors, I hope to remain the member for Melbourne for a long time yet. I do not want to see Melbourne and Sydney grow at the expense of the rest of Australia. I want to see development in other parts of Australia, and even in Papua and New Guinea. I want to see this industry encouraged in every way possible, and I do not think that a bounty for another three years is the tribute that this Government, which protests that it is out to help develop Australia, should pay to an organization that has run many financial risks in establishing itself. The company has done a very good job for Australia, and has produced tractors under Australian conditions. It has been able, with the help of the bounty, up to date, to compete against tractors produced overseas. accomplish? ment to Australians in Australia. It can help in the development of Australia. I am not a farmer, although my grandfathers broke virgin soil in this country.

Is it not because of the adverse trade balance that we have to suffer from import restrictions, credit restrictions and all sorts of other restrictions?

But the whole trade he should be able to take a more detached set-up is operating to our disadvantage. view of the matter now that he is Minister This may, of course, have some association with the Ottawa Agreement and imperial preference and all that sort of thing. AH I want to say is that under the Ottawa Agreement, as it operates at present, the United Kingdom gets advantages worth at least £100,000,000 a year and we are lucky if we get benefits worth £10,000,000 a year. It is time that agreement was revised. Perhaps, when the new agreement is brought before the Parliament we will be in a better position to judge the standing of the whole of our Australian industries. I support what the honourable member for Swan has said in favour of an industry in his electorate. I regard it as not merely an industry in his electorate but as an industry in some part of Australia. The Government is certainly deserving of all the criticism that the honourable gentleman has offered. Admittedly he has offered it with bated breath. He has been rather sparing in what he has had to say. He could have delivered a full-blooded attack on the Government for destroying something of value to Australia in his electorate. destroying it because it has not protected it. It is not destroying it outright, but is allowing it to die from inanition. have that effect. Minister for Air should get rid of a lot of his thinking. The old cry "" Sydney or the bush "" no longer applies. Let him go to Fremantle and look round there, and look at the rest of Australia and see what can be done to develop industries. Melbourne and Sydney are not Australia. They are not the only parts of Australia that count. The whole of Australia counts, and I support the honourable gentleman's advocacy of this industry.

244,Mr Leslie (Moore) [9.8],"The honortinuance of that very thing. In other words,under working conditions which are not comparable with those in Australia, the Government would, in efTect, be saying to the primary producer, "" Because we believe that those people are not working under suitable conditions you must pay the cost of ramming home to them that they should introduce a 40-hour week "". If it is desirable that the high standards of this country, which are so frequently abused, should be introduced into other countries and if we feel that it is our duty to assist their introduction in other countries, it is the responsibility of the whole nation to bear the cost of introducing our political and industrial ideology in those countries. For that reason, the provision of a bounty for the protection of goods produced in this country is desirable. So the honourable member, even on his own argument, loses ground in every respect. Apart from that aspect of the matter, it is obviously quite wrong continually to impose a burden on people who are compelled to use these goods as capital equipment. If a consumer article such as a shirt, tie, suit of clothes or pound of butter were concerned, I would not care what was done. But to impose a tariff upon capital goods which a section of the community that has to dispose of its product in unprotected markets is compelled to use, is obviously an injustice. Let me come to the proposals in this bill. eastern States have the market. Here is The honourable member for Melbourne was quite wrong when he said that this tractor industry had been established in Western Australia in war-time. The fact is that the industry was established in the post-war period. It took over a munitions factory, ft had not been a tractor factory. It was taken over by Chamberlains and converted into a proprietary company. The company has its faults. It has one very vital fault. that the standard of the goods it produces is too high. In all these mechanized industries the art of success, the art of achieving profits, the art of expansion, is to dispose of a product the users of which will be compelled to come back to the manufacturer for spare parts and to buy a new implement within a short period. The trouble with the Chamberlain enterprise is that its machines do not require spare parts. The life of the machine is far too long 'for it to be profitable to the manufacturer. Had the Chamberlain company descended to normal business practices and produced a shoddy article in order to make the buyer come back, time and time again, for spare parts, this factory would be one of the wealthiest in Australia and might be even bigger than General Motors-Holden's Limited. But it has been honest. Every farmer who has used machines made at this factory will admit that he has got value for his money. He will tell anybody that he does not have to go back to the factory for spare parts. He does not have to replace the machine after a short life on the farm. That is the trouble with Chamberlain Industries. Proprietary Limited. . Is it a bad one? Should we say to the company. "" You cannot be so efficient, and therefore, we will not encourage you""? The very thing that the company is doing deserves every encouragement from the Government and the people. In my opinion, it is a shame-a n injustice to this industry, to the goods it produces, and to Western Australia-that this company has not participated in the disposal of tractors and farm machinery to Asian countries under the Colombo plan. an opportunity to assist this industry. We all say, "" Let us be national in outlook. Industry should be decentralized and spread all over the Commonwealth "". If this industry were given an opportunity of disposing of its machines under the Colombo plan, it would be able because of the quality ol its manufactures, to establish a reputation for Australian goods that would stand unchallenged and unchallengable in any other country. In that way we could build up goodwill and a good name for our products in the countries with which we want to trade. It would pay the Government to give tractors away in those countries because it would know that, as more tractors were needed; the example set by the machines obtained from the Chamberlain company in Western Australia would induce them to buy further machines. But in view of the influence of the eastern States, perhaps that is asking too much. Like the",76,Northern Territory

I offer a meed of praise and gratitude for what the Government has done, but I conclude by saying that, nevertheless, the provisions of the bill are disappointingly inadequate. think that honourable members on both sides of the House will pay tribute to the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) for the fighting qualities that he exhibits. A l would be better to prohibit the importation though I do not always agree with his parochial attitude regarding Western Australia, particularly in relation to the federal ing the manufacture of tractors in Ausaid roads formula, I personally pay a tribute to his efforts on behalf of the primary producers. When he fights for the primary producers of Western Australia he also fights for primary producers all over this great continent. Therefore, sir, to have such a fighter behind me-h e now sits behind me in this chamber-is something of which I am very proud. He said many of the things that I would have liked to say, and he said them in an enthusiastic manner that must appeal to the people. He is an enthusiastic man, and that is a great thing. Some one has said that an enthusiastic man has had a visitation of the gods; the mind grasps certain facts, reason draws certain conclusions; and imagination binds them togeher like faggots into a torch and lights them at the fires of enthusiasm; in that genial glow the heart warms, faith and hope revive, energy takes command, mortal men become heroes, the impossible becomes possible, and the work of the world is done. The primary producers of this country will welcome the subsidy that is to be given, by means of this bill, to the Chamberlain company of Western Australia, because Australians like using tractors that are built in their own country. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) has remarked, in a very quiet interjection to which I am sure you, sir, would not have objected, that this debate is a great advertisement for that company. I think that that is right, because the name "" Chamberlain "" is to-night being broadcast all over Australia Timson) -Order! 1 must say that, during the last ten minutes or so, the company that has been mentioned has received quite sufficient advertisement, and I do not intend to allow it to receive any more. with you more, sir. I made that remark merely in passing. I wish now to reply briefly to comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member said that, if it were possible, it of such things as tractors, as was done in 1930. At the present time, we are subsidiztralia and also allowing other tractors and machinery to come into the country from overseas. The honourable member, however, has missed the real point completely. We are subsidizing the manufacture of tractors and helping to extend production, rather than clamping down in the way that would be necessary if the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne were adopted, and if imports were restricted to the degree suggested by him. He also said that we should not allow goods to come to this country from countries where a 48-hour week is worked, to compete with us because Australians have the advantage of a 40-hour week. What we have to remember is that if we are to make a success of the 40-hour week, we have to produce effectively, efficiently and in quantity comparable with that of the countries where the working week consists of 48 hours. After all, we are a unit of the great trading nations of the world. The isolationist attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne, in this respect, cannot be described by any other word than "" deplorable "". I appreciate the action of the honourable member for Moore in supporting the case for the primary producer, when the honourable member for Melbourne said-and 1 wrote it down-that the farmers had had a very good run with Commonwealth governments, through wheat stabilization, subsidies, and so on. expect honourable members from metropolitan areas to have any knowledge of these give them some, information.

What is the position of the dairyman in relation to subsidies? There is not the slightest doubt that when ihe honourable member for Melbourne used the word "" subsidy"" he was referring to the dairy-farmer. Actually, the subsidy is a consumer subsidy, because it keeps down the price of butter to the consumer. The dairy-farmers at the present time, as is evidenced by meetings of dairy farmers, are trying to tell the people that, at that he overlooked the fact that we must the moment, they are receiving only the bare cost of production. Therefore, the subsidy with which the honourable member for Melbourne found fault is really assisting considerably the people whom he represents in this Parliament, particularly those who live in the City of Melbourne. It is remarkable that members of this Parliament should make statements such as those made by honourable members opposite to-night. The honourable member for Melbourne said, in effect, "" Do not stay in the cities. Go out into the country and see what is happening in the wide open spaces of Australia."" I suggest that he should do so himself, because if he did, he would see what the farmers have to contend with. After all, the people in the cities are reasonably well protected, but if the farmer experiences a drought, a flood, a bush fire, or some other calamity, he may lose the whole of his production for the year. But he has to put up with that. The whole trouble with the honourable member for Melbourne is that he objects to people making a success of a private enterprise. He wants socialism. Dr. Evatt -No! says "" No"". "" Hansard"" of the night before last that the honourable member for Melbourne said, by way of interjection, "" l a m a socialist"". I support this bill and am pleased, on this occasion, to be on the side of the men from Western Australia. I had the great pleasure of viewing this tractor in the early stages of its production. There was a factory at South Melbourne at which the same kind of tractor was being, produced, and I was invited to go and inspect it. I am not suggesting, of course, that the project was not commenced in Western Australia, because the Western Australians would be up in arms if I did so. When the honourable member for Melbourne was speaking I interjected, "" You cannot always sell and never buy"", meaning, of course, that you have to buy, as well as sell, if you wish to take part in world trade. He immediately went on to say that our balance of payments in the United Kingdom had been depleted since this Government came to office. I suggest have imports because we, in this country, have a great developmental programme in hand. In my opinion, the way in which the country has been developed since Labour went out of office in 1949 has been almost miraculous: If this Government had continued petrol rationing, which existed in the days of .Labour and which throttled the progress of the country, of course our overseas balances would have been kept at a high level. But, on the other hand, we would not have had so many motor cars and so much machinery with which to increase production in the pastoral and agricultural fields. able member say something about the bill? find, when I get interjections of a hostile nature, that they come from members with city interests who sit on either side of the House, and when I make a plea on behalf of the primary producer, whether my interjector is a member of the Liberal party or the Labour party, if he is opposed to the man who produces the main commodities which comprise our national wealth, 1 invariably make an appropriate retort.

259,Mr Osborne (Evans,"Minister fortractors on which bounty is payable under the Tractor Bounty Act. I would not have believed that such a simple bill could have provoked a debate which would range so wide or produce so many interesting and varying viewpoints. I do not want to be taken as agreeing entirely and completely with everything that has been said by my friends, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) and the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie). They have put their hands on the essence of the criticism raised by the Opposition, and, indeed, raised by my friend, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver), who objected to the Government's failure to adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Board that a customs duty should be imposed on imported tractors. The two members of the Australian Country party who have spoken have pointed out the inevitable effect of the imposition of a customs duty on tractors in increasing the costs of primary production in Australia, because, whether the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr tially, the advice of the Tariff Board conCalwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, likes it or not, the fact is that most Australian primary producers are dependent on imported tractors, and any imposition of customs duty on. imported tractors would inevitably raise the cost of primary production in Australia. As this Government knows very well, and as I believe the whole House knows, though some Opposition members are occasionally reluctant to admit it, a prime function of government to-day is to do all that it can in keeping down the costs of primary production. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in an amusing speech, criticized the Government for not adopting the Tariff Board's report, and he ranged wide, in his imaginative manner, over the whole field of the Australian economy. I never listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, particularly when he speaks about an economic measure, without being profoundly thankful for the fact that we live in a democracy which enables the people, by their votes, to prevent him from applying his economic theories, because I think that if the theories only in relation to what the bill proposes to he advanced to-night were ever applied they would have some very curious and strange effects on the Australian economy. I might also be permitted to say that I never listen to him speaking on these measures without feeling somewhat envious of a member of the Opposition who can speak without any responsibility for what he says. He does not care what he says, because he knows that his policies will not be put into operation. He wound up, oddly enough, by supporting the bill, having spent most of his time criticizing it. The essence of his criticism seemed to be that we, in this country, had passed the time when any industry should be supported by a bounty, and that all industries should be supported by customs duties, which, to my mind, is an extraordinary proposition. The whole purpose of the adoption of bounty assistance is to support a single industry in its establishment stages without causing a rise in the whole scale of Australian costs through the imposition of a customs duty over a wide range of manufactures. He used, in his criticism of the Government, the fact that in this bill we have not followed entirely, or indeed even substantained in its report on tractors made on 14th October last year. He admitted that the Tariff Board is not always right, and then he criticized the Government severely for not always adopting its recommendations. I should have thought that his own experience in office would have reminded him that the Tariff Board has one function, which is to advise the Government within limited issue, but that the Government holds the whole responsibility for the effects of its legislation and its administrative acts, and that it is obliged to examine critically the recommendations of the Tariff Board in each report which comes to it, and would be irresponsible if it did not do so. The final responsibility lies with the Government. It cannot escape that responsibility, and it must exercise its own judgment on the reports of the board. The fact is that the Government, in the vast majority of cases, accepts the recommendations of the Board, in which it has the greatest confidence, but in this case it did not feel able to do so, and for very good reasons. A more serious approach to this bill, not do but also in relation to what the Government has not done in this matter, was made by the honourable member for Swan. I hope that he will not feel unkindly towards me if I say that I think his judgment has been affected by his concentration on the importance to the area he represents in the Parliament of the one manufacturer who is most concerned in this matter. I think that it might be said of the criticisms that he offered that in his zeal for the representation commercial profit-making standard and, in of his own electorate perhaps he did not give full consideration to the effect of the measures which he would have preferred the Government to adopt. In fact, the Chamberlain company is the only company which receives any benefit under the Tractor Bounty Bill. The company manufactures three different types of tractors, one large tractor and two smaller ones. The last amendment of the Tractor Bounty Bill provided, in effect, that a bounty was payable on all of the smaller tractors which the Chamberlain company produce. The bill was so drawn as to limit the payment of the bounty to tractors which had an engine with a capacity of between 40 and 55 horse-power. It was pointed out to the Government that the company was in fact using in these two smaller tractors an engine which was capable of developing more than 55 horse-power, and that it was embodying in the engine a governor to ensure that it did not develop more than 55 horsepower. The Government immediately recognized that the existing provision imposed a needless restraint on the company. It seemed unnecessary to require the company to embody a governor in the tractor to prevent the engine from developing its maximum horse-power, and so preventing the buyers of the tractors from enjoying their full capacity. So the act is to be amended to ensure that the bounty on the two smaller types of tractor which the company produces shall be payable, even though they develop their full engine power. That is all that this bill purports to do. The honourable member for Swan said that he was disappointed that the bill did not go further and, in fact, provide a subsidy for the larger tractor produced by Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited. The Government has considered that matter very carefully and has decided not to subsidize the larger tractor. I should like to tell the House the principal reasons for that decision. First, the company at the present time produces only about 100 of the larger tractors a year and the bounty involved would be approximately £20,000. Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited has been doing comparatively well in recent times. It has been getting nearer to a fact, is making a small profit. It is progressing satisfactorily with the three types of tractors it is making, and the Government does not believe that it is necessary to subsidize the larger tractor to keep the company afoot. The next point is this: In the larger tractor, which the honourable member for Swan hoped would be subsidized but which has not been, the company has been using an engine imported from America, on which it pays duty. That was one of the points mentioned at the Tariff Board inquiry, lt proposes very soon to change to an English-made engine, on which it will not pay any duty. The saving that will arise from the change to a duty-free engine from an engine on which duty was paid will be greater for each unit than the amount of bounty which would be paid. Dr. Evatt -No w repeat what you had to say about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. morrow. It lies within the power of the company-and we understand that it will very shortly so arrange-to make a saving greater than the bounty which the honourable member for Swan would like us to pay by using the English-made engine. The next point is that if the Government amended the Tractor Bounty Act in the way suggested to cover the tractors with target horse-power, the products not only of Chamberlain Industries Proprietary Limited but also of other manufacturers, who are manufacturing quite successfully without any bounty or duty, would become subject to bounty. The cost to the taxpayers would be enormous. never made such a tractor. member for Swan suggested, we had raised the limit on horse-power to enable these tractors to qualify for bounty, tractors manufactured by other companies in Australia would qualify for bounty, and those companies do not need that bounty.",79,Northern Territory

264,Mr Osborne,"If, as the honorableThe final argument that a customs duty should have been imposed has been effectively answered by my friends from the Country party, the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Moore, who spoke earlier. The Government does not believe that the costs of primary production should be increased by the imposition of a duty on tractors in order to assist one company producing, at the present time, 100 of those tractors a year. Another reason is this: The honourable member for Swan referred to the somewhat peculiar capital structure of the company in question. It is, in fact, supported very substantially by the Western Australian Government through its agencies. comes to a question of receiving government support, the company is already receiving considerable support by its favorable capital structure and is assisted by the Western Australian Government. I hope I have indicated to the House, even if honourable members do not agree with them, sufficient arguments to show that the Government has seriously considered this problem and, in deciding to go only as far as it has in adopting the recommendations of the Tariff Board, it has at least made a considered judgment and, I feel, the only reasonable judgment to which it could come. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. Message received from the Senate intimating that Senator Anderson had been appointed to fill the vacancy on the Public Works Committee caused by the resignation of Senator Henty. Message received from the Senate intimating that, until such time as the two vacancies for members of the Senate existing on the Foreign Affairs Committee were filled by members of the Opposition, Senator Robertson and Senator Vincent had been appointed to serve on the committee. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 24th October (vide page 1748), on motion by Sir Arthur FaddenThat the bill be now read a second time. This bill provides for a sum of £18,500,000 to be share among what are generally known as the claimant States in terms of the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as contained in its Twentythird Report, which was tabled yesterday. The commission recommended that the grant to South Australia be £5,800,000, to If it Western Australia £9,200,000 and to Tasmania £3,500,000, a total of £18,500,000. Measures such as this are becoming an annual event in this Parliament. That fact indicates the difficulty of obtaining the ideal revenues for the various States in a federal system if they are left to their own financial resources. The Commonwealth Grants Commission has directed attention to that matter in both the 22nd and 23rd reports. At page 19 of the 23rd report the commission states, referring to its previous reportJn paragraph 30 of that Report the Commission said"" It might well be asked, however, why the need for special grants persists so strongly when 1 other Commonwealth payments to the States have increased greatly, and when there is evidence of economic expansion in the claimant States at least equal to that which has occurred in the non-claimant States. In general terms, the reason is that costs of expansion of State services, of development, of undertakings such as railways and water supply, and of general administration are relatively heavy in the States of smaller populations. At the same time benefits to revenue arising from economic expansion do not flow directly to the State Governments."" I suggest that that statement epitomizes some of the difficulties that occur under OUT federal system. As the report indicates, there are disparities in population between the States-disparitie s which have arisen largely out of the original disposition of economic forces. Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia suffer from these disabilities peculiarly, and the scheme provided for in section 96 of the Australian Constitution has been arranged to attempt to redress the balance in their favour to some extent, and, in terms of the canons that have been evolved by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, to see that they",81,Northern Territory
265,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [9.49],"are put in a position to function at a standard which is not appreciably below that of the other States. In other words, the surplus of the revenue derived by the Commonwealth from its taxing machinery is used to redress the balance in favour of certain of the States. I submit that that is a worthy principle. Nevertheless, the machinery that has sometimes been adopted to obtain this objective has certain difficulties attaching to it. The reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission are always very interesting documents. They contain a comprehensive summary of the position, not only of the claimant States, but also of the other States, during the financial year to which they relate, and I suppose they contain the most up-to-date information available. In the 23rd report we are given the latest information available in relation to the finances of the States, in some instances up to the end of the financial year 1954-55, and in others up to the end of the financial year 1955-56. As was indicated yesterday something like £211,000,000 out of a total revenue of £325,000,000 received by the States comes from Commonwealth grants of one kind or another. The grants provided for in this measure are of a particular kind paid only to the three claimant States. But they are a significant factor in the financial position of those three States. If one reads the twenty-third report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission carefully, one can see that it indicates the tenuous basis on which the solvency of those States depends. By way of example I refer to paragraph 7 of the report at page 12, in which the commission deals with Tasmania in particular in the following terms:. For that year all States, non-claimant and claimant, except Tasmania, had large deficits. That highlights the earlier reference to the difficulties of the States in obtaining the revenues needed to enable them to meet their commitments. They have to resort to all kinds of devices in trying to bridge the gap. The Grants Commission states that Tasmania was the only State that did not have a large deficit. To illustrate the chance factors on which the finances of a State may depend I point out that the report continuesTasmania closed the year with a surplus, although in the early part of the year the State Treasurer had budgeted for a deficit. The improvement resulted from a substantial increase in lottery revenue which could not have been foreseen when the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the year were presented to the State Parliament. In other words, Tasmania was more fortunate-althoug h in this instance to only a comparatively small degree-solel y due to the chance factor of people in that State and in other States investing more in lottery transactions in Tasmania than had been expected. The report does not go on to contemplate whether Tasmania's good fortune was enjoyed at the expense of the other States. Tbis is an example of the chance events upon which the States nowadays depend to balance their budgets. It would be regarded as absurd if the Commonwealth had to go to similar extremes to secure its financial solvency. As1 pointed out yesterday, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I think it is characteristic of our federal system of finance that the Commonwealth still has at its disposal reasonably large revenue surpluses. It can choose to spend money in a certain way because it has available a million pounds or so, whereas the States have not the same capacity to manoeuvre, to improve, and to develop services which they nevertheless are still constitutionally obliged to provide. That rather delicate position presents the States with considerable difficulties in balancing their budgets, and it is extremely hazardous to their future development. As we all know the States still have considerable constitutional powers. The comprehensive tables embodied in the appendixes to the Commonwealth Grants Commission report indicate the kind of functions that the States are still called upon to perform. They are those which most intimately touch the daily life of the individual citizen. It is interesting to note the variations of expenditure on various activities among the States. These variations indicate that some of the States, all of which are sovereign in their particular fields, choose to spend more on education and less on health than do others. I do not at this stage argue the merits of the federal system of government, but it seems to me, taking a reasonably long-term view, that we shall have a federal system for a considerable time to come. I for one believe that so long as the federal system exists, and the States have their present powers, it ought to be within their province to allow for these differences of expenditure. They may freely choose to spend so much out of a given revenue in one way rather than in another, and that is the kind of choice that faces every individual in the community. Out of a given income one may buy this or that; one cannot always buy this and that. Governments and individuals alike face this choice. I submit that the heads of power mentioned in the appendixes to the report indicate the importance of the functions still retained by the States. Education includes primary and secondary education, kindergarten, university, technical and agricultural training, libraries, and the training of the highest expenditure, being 49s. 6d. We the deaf, dumb, and blind. All those activities come within the province of the States under their educational functions. The average per capita expenditure on education throughout Australia is 148s. 9d. per annum. The annual per capita expenditure varies widely from State to State. In New South Wales it is 157s. 8d., in Victoria 141s. 5d., in Western Australia 173s. 9d., and in Tasmania 178s. 5d. These figures do not necessarily indicate that greater expenditure ensures better education. They do indicate the difficulties with which the States are confronted. Western Australia, with its large area and comparatively small population, may not receive as much for £1 spent on education as some of the other States would receive. The Commonwealth Grants Commission attempts to take such circumstances into consideration, and to make adjustments accordingly. Admittedly, it is a very difficult task but, nevertheless, the commission does attempt to do it. I do not wish to argue about the effectiveness of the machinery. I merely say that the commission attempts to reduce all these services to a common standard. A similar system is adopted with regard to health and hospital services. Under this heading is included provision for mental patients as well as for other sick people. The care of mothers and children is also provided for. The Australian average expenditure is 91s. 5d., but it is as high as 100s. 6d. in Western Australia, and as low as 82s. Id. in Victoria. I repeat that the value of the services does not necessarily depend only on the amount of money expended, because Western Australia may not receive as much in the way of these health services for an expenditure of £1 as would be received by one of the more closely populated States. Similar remarks apply to law and order enforcement, although in this field I believe we see a more uniform pattern, and this fact, perhaps, strengthens my argument. The average expenditure in Australia on law and order enforcement and public safety, including the administration of justice, police and gaols, is 43s. Id. The variation as between the States is not so great as it is with some of the other services. In South Australia the expenditure is 33s. 8d., which is the lowest. Whether that means that South Australia is an orderly State1 do not know. Tasmania has do not see the same variation in expenditure as between the different States under this heading, which would seem to indicate that a more uniform service is provided in the various States. The point that does need to be considered is that the States, out of the revenues at their disposal, have not evolved a uniform pattern of expenditure. Some spend rather more, relatively, on education, and less on health. I think that Queensland tends to spend a higher amount on health than do some of the other States, because the Queensland Government has different social ideas regarding its hospitals, and is to be commended for those ideas. It is noteworthy, however, that the States choose to exercise their sovereignty in different ways, and I believe it to be a good thing that the States are still allowed this degree of manoeuvrability, as it was called yesterday, which, however, is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve because the States must look round for meagre sums of from £50,000 to £500,000, whereas in the Commonwealth budget an amount of £50,000 does not appear to loom very large. While £50,000 may not appear a very large amount in a budget of £1,230,000,000, any one with a sense of financial responsibility would not regard such a sum as small. I am sure that my esteemed colleague, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) would agree with me that sometimes persons charged with the responsibility of spending money tend to see it not for what it can achieve in itself but for how it appears in relation to the whole. The substance is sometimes lost sight of in the very small shadow that it seems to cast in the whole picture. When that kind of attitude is adopted, we detect a lessening of financial responsibility. I believe that in many cases greater value could be obtained for the community by the States spending £50,000 or £60,000 on services that are still State functions than not be penalized because of their geoby the Commonwealth spending a similar amount on functions controlled by the Commonwealth. The States have to cast round for small amounts, while the Commonwealth is able to say, "" That is not a very large amount, and we will devote it to this purpose or that purpose"". The purpose chosen may well be a worthy one, but it is impossible to decide whether the amount has been wisely spent, having regard to the overall national needs. It is because this situation obtains to-day that the State governments tend to be regarded in some quarters as little more than glorified local councils. I do not wish to be understood as disparaging the functions of local councils, but we are tending to think of a kind of hierarchy of government, with local councils being of slight importance, State governments a little more important, and the Commonwealth Government most important of all. In thinking along these lines I believe that we pay scant regard to the fundamentals that underlie our federal system of government. We have ordered our system of government in such a way that each of these governing bodies exercises its peculiar responsibilities in administering to the needs of the citizen, whether he. be regarded as a citizen of the shire of Cooroorooke, or a citizen of the State of Victoria, or a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has needs in each sphere, and it is the responsibilty of government to provide for those needs, and to provide for them as well and as economically as possible, in terms of the moneys that are expended. I referred, yesterday, to the activities of library development and adult education in Victoria, and showed how, with an additional £100,000, we could greatly improve our services. The State, however, says, ""You cannot have £100 for this purpose, because we have not nearly enough money to meet the day-to-day needs of our growjng population for ordinary education facilities "". Because of this, our national development, particularly on the social and cultural side, is languishing. As I have said, this bill really relates only to the three claimant States. However, according to the theory followed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, it helps to allow all States to function at what might be called a national overall minimum level, so that certain States will graphical position or a limitation of their resources. For this reason, the measure is worthy of support. However, as I mentioned earlier, it does indicate the man\ difficulties that beset us, in a federal system, in trying to equate responsibilities to financial resources. I , for one, do not believe that we can ever reach a stage in a federal system-and we certainly have not reached it in Australia-a t which every unit of government can be made responsible in the sense of raising the revenue that it is called upon to spend, l t cannot be done, because of diversity of resources. I have never subscribed to what economists, when I was a student, used to call the vicious principleI am sure that the honourable member for Warringah knows what I mean -of one government spending what another government collects. Certainly, we have had to depart, in Australia, from the practice of governments spending only what they collect, and I believe that the fact that, nowadays, we scarcely ever hear the phrase "" vicious principle"" used in this regard indicates that, in the general analysis, it is no longer regarded as an accurate description of the practice to which it was formerly applied-althoug h my friend, the honourable member for Warringah, may be one of the last die-hards who would urge at least a partial return to what was formerly regarded as a sound principle. Debate (on motion by Mr Lawrence) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.9 p.m. The following answer to a question was circulated:Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Mr Bryant asked the Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs, upon noticeWill he make available evidence of the contravention of Article 9; 13, sections 1 and 2; 18; 20, section 1; and 23 of .the Universal Declaration of Nations on 10th December, 1948, by a vote of Human Rights by any of its signatories during the 48 in favour with two absent and eight abstentions, years 1955 and 1956? Sir Philip McBride -The answer to the peoples and nations. Therefore, it is clear that honourable member's question is as follows:there The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does which fall below the principles stated in the not constitute a binding obligation and is not declaration, there are, as far as I am aware, no open to signature. The declaration, which was official compilations from which the information adopted by the General Assembly of the United requested could be extracted. is properly speaking a statement of principles which can be regarded as a common goal for all cannot be any formal contravention of the declaration.
