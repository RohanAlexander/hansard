M.r. WATT shown myself familiar with the situation to which the honourable member refers, in regard to which I have answered more questions than on any other subject that I can recollect. I endeavoured to ascertain yesterday whether actual official effect had been given to the arrangement which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was able to make in London, and I was informed then that, so far, no official in struction in the direction stated had been issued by the British Shipping Controller. attention to the probable effect of a new the Postmaster-General, to give preferregulation issuod under the War Precauence of employment to returned soldiers, tions Act, which requires the written conall things being equal?

Nothingi n the Public SerI have since received a communication vice Act, so far as I am aware, interferes f r om the solicitor to a building society, with thiB policy. who points out that building societies and land companies erect houses for sale, and fears that. this regulation is meant to apply to such buildings.

It does not apply to the erection of houses for homes, as a cursory examination of it would make plain. The classes of buildings for thc erection and construction of which the written consent of the Treasurer is needed are these(o) Tramway or tramway building or office; jo) market or market building; (c) building to be used for a club, library, art gallery, school of art, mechanics' institute, museum, or exhibition of Is the honourable gentleman animals; (d) ball or building to be owned or controlled by a friendly society or other society, association, or organization; (e) church or building to be owned or controlled by an organization connected with a church the cost of which exceeds f1,000; (f) building in which intoxicating liquors I think that I have are to be sold; or (o) additions or alterations, involving an expenditure exceeding £250, to a worH or building of any of the classes specified in this regulation. The only home -affected is possibly the home of the man who sells intoxicating liquor. The regulation does not apply to the construction and erection of homes for ordinary citizens.

33,Mr Watt,"Afte r a .conversation Iand the .agricultural authorities of the States this morning, to ascertain the exact position so far as they are able to tell it to me. It appears that the market is suffering from a great deal of fearI speak of the Victorian market for mutton and lambs chiefly-that drought conditions will force sales, and that there will be no possibility of either shipments or cold storage. That, as it appears tq me, is almost an obsession on the part of many producers. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is in the cold stores of Victoria a total theoretic available capacity for 1,600,000 carcasses, "" as we at present store them in cut condition. There is roughly a fourth of that space, representing 400,000 carcasses, occupied, leaving three-fourths, or space for about 1,200,000 carcasses, unoccupied. So far as the authorities of the State of Victoria are able to ascertain, that is being filled, or will be filled in the next month or so, if conditions continue as they are, at the rate of 160,000 carcasses per week. It is estimated, therefore, that, if no relief in shipment takes place, the-stores will be filled by about the middle of December. The shipping arrangements are such, according to promises already made of insulated space for this part of Australia, that that time may be extended by shipping relief to about the middle of January. That is as far as we can see ahead now; but, after considering all the facts elicited by my inquiries this morning, I have cabled to the Prime Minister asking him to do two things-first , to ascertain if it will not be possible in Britain to get more insulated space for Australia, in view of the seasonable and possible drought pressure; and, secondly, to see whether it is not possible to get mutton sent to Egypt. I do not know whether honourable members quite appreciate the difliculty in this connection. So far, we have been able to ship only beef, which is the ration for the British Army. It seems extraordinary that men reared on sheep should be compelled to eat beef; and I see no reason why mutton should not .form a part of the rations in Egypt and Mesopotamia. If Mr Hughes is able to do what I have suggested, it will relieve the situation a great deal, without prejudicing the beef districts of Australia. I expect to get the Prime Minister's reply inside a week. Later: Mr ""WATT I caused further inquiries to be made shortly before lunch, and I now have information to the effect that the calculation of 160,000 carcasses per week, upon which the date to the middle of December is based, is in excess of the actual capacity; that is to say, the killing capacity of the trade, in Tespect of both labour and space, will be much below ""that figure. ister is speaking of Victoria alone. an attempt would be made to put into cool store 160,000 carcasses per week. It is plain that that number cannot be slaughtered and dealt with, and that will mean an extension of the calculated date by possibly a month or more. That should give further assurance to the holders of stock. newspapers, meat is coming down in price, and I should like to know whether arrangements can be made by which the consumer, and not the salesmen, may get the benefit? fixed the maximum price for meat. It was not intended to follow the market in every fluctuation, but to fix twice a year a maximum price between given dates in the export and non-export season. Pending the co-ordination of frozen and canned prices I do not anticipate any adjustment of existing maximum rates. gency of the question, will the Acting Prime Minister agree to a vote being taken on the subject of war-time prohibition of the liquor traffic ? the honourable member has had upon the business-paper a notice of motion relating to that matter, but he has never given notice of any question on the subject. He heard my answer the other day as to the attitude of the Government, and I ask him to give notice of any further inquiry.",24,Export Of Meat Mutton For Soldiers

Most supply undertakings constituted under a State law are not allowed by such law to discriminate, but no breach of the law is involved in this case, as the War Precautions regulations legalize the actions taken under them. The autliority given under the War Precautions regulations to the chief engineer enables him to conserve existing unused capacity ( if any), and any capacity resulting from the installation of new plant during the continuation of the regulations for purposes of national or economical importance. In the case of refusal to connect, an appeal to a Director of Munitions is provided for in the regulations, and in this way it is felt that no industry really essential is likely to be reasked the Acting Prime The regulations, as far as is known, have not in any way increased the difficulties of the Sydney Council, as is implied by this question, but it is known that for a lengthy period before the War Precautions regulations wer.e passed on the 18th September, tbe Sydney Municipal Council, of its own accord, had refused to connect a large number of consumers owing to shortage of power, plant, and essent i a l apparatus. ' In fact, the shortage in Sydney was one of the determining factors which led the Government to give powers of discrimination under the War Precautions regulations, so that industries which should get power would not suffer at the expense of consumers who could, without serious inconvenience, dispense with additional connexions. The Sydney Council, not having had for a considerable time sufficient generating plant, and having, long before the incidence of the regulations, imposed of its own accord restrictions on new connexions, it is not understood how the War Precautions regulations can either inconvenience or hamper the industries of Sydney, as their sole object is to enable a supply to be given to essential industries. Generally, in connection with the whole matter raised by these questions, it is desired to point out that a conference of the supply engineers of the six capital cities was recently called, and, as a result of that conference, a schedule of requirements for new plant for a period of about two years was drawn up, ""and",28,Destitute Person S

Does the Minister consider that the count r y press is adequately represented? honourable member's questions are follow:1. Each section of the industry is being invited to form such committees, State and Federal, as may be deemed necessary to advise their representative on the Commonwealth Advisory Board. The members of the Advisory Board are as follow:Mr Jas.

Mr ""WISE -Yesterday the honourable member for Wide Bay{ Mr Corser) asked:Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that twelve duplicate copies are required to be handed in with any request for permission to import goods from Great Britain containing steel, and does he not consider it a gross extravagance, in view of the fact that paper is so scarce, entailing on Government Departments in Great Britain the necessity for using small memoranda, which often have writin g on the backs of them, and also entailing, in many cases, the use of the same envelope twice? I have received the following report from .the Director of Munitions in connection with this matter:Twelve, copies of each application for priority certificate arc required to meet the requirements of the British Ministry of Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions, through the High Commissioner, asked that four copies of each application should be forwarded, together with a duplicate set by second mail, in case the first set was lost. This makes eight copies. One copy is filed in the office of the Director of Munitions, nnd three copies axe sent to the applicants. The High Commissioner bands three of his copies to the Ministry of -Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions endorses the decisions on the application and disposes of the three copies,as follows:One duly endorsed copy is filed in the office of the Ministry of Munitions. One duly endorsed copy is returned to the High Commissioner. One duly endorsed copy is sent to the agent, manufacturer, or buyer in Great Britain. The four duplicate copies are forwarded to the High Commissioner by second mail, in case asked the Assistant the original mail has been lost in transit. Of the three copies returned to the applicants, one is for their file and two for forwarding by successive mails to the manufacturers or to their principals or buyers in Great Britain. The application forms take the place of letters between the Directorate of Munitions and the High Commissioner, between the High CommisT h e answers to the sioner and the Ministry of Munitions, and beas tween the Ministry of Munitions and tlie buyers or agents in Great Britain. There is, therefore, really a considerable economy in paper. The fact that duplicates have to be sent by the second mail accounts, of course, for five of the copies. the honourable member for N e w E n g l a n d ( L t O o l o n el A b b o t t ) asked t h e f o l l o w in g questions:1.

TION AND DISEMBARKATIO N : MILITARY EX-NUPTIAL' SONS : EVICTIONS OF DE Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supplyproposed. [ 3 . 6 ] a matter that I wish to bring before the House, but I feel t h a t ' it is my duty to do so. We are expecting a number of ANZACs to arrive in Australia, very shortly, and the community are considering what shall be done to afford them a fitting welcome'; but if the arrangements are anything like those for the reception which has hitherto been accorded to men who have returned from the Front, the ANZACs w ill not have very strong feelings of regard for those who receive them. An individual named Commander Brewis is in control of the embarkation and disembarkation of soldiers. He has carried out this task for some time, yet he is the most unsuitable man who could be in charge of it. Unfortunately. the position is complicated by reason of the fact that the Commander is controlled by the Naval Department, whereas the soldiers with whom he is dealing are controlled by the M i l i tary Department. When one endea-vours to secure better facilities for welcoming soldiers on their arrival he is met by the dual control of the two Departments. I admit that the Departments have endeavoured to meet my representations, but I have never been able to get any redress from the autocratic and i m becile actions of this individual who is in control of embarkation and disembarkation work. Finally, I have had to appeal to the Acting Prime'Minister, and the reply I received from him was that nothing could be done. Naturally my request was forwarded to Commander Brewis, and equally naturally his reply was that no better arrangement could be made. I advise honourable members to go to Port Melbourne on a day on which soldiers are embarking or disembarking. There is always an enormous crowd of wives, children, and other dependants, as well as A.W.L/s: ORPHANS OF friends and relatives, of the men, and it OF LIVING : MEAT is not an easy matter to make proper aralthough a great improvement could be effected by using a little common sense. -The people all gather in one long row, and they remain seated there for hours. land the soldiers at St. Kilda? would .arise there. The people take their I am diffident about approaching meals with them, and sit down and wait for hours unti l the soldiers disembark. I have been at Port Melbourne on two occasions when boats leaving for the Front got away before the friends and relatives of the men could get down the pier, but this, we are told, cannot be avoided. On one occasion I saw two vessels leaving the wharf at the same time. The friends of the departing soldiers had no information as to the particular boat on which they would find their dear ones, and when the gates were thrown open women and children rushed pell-mell down the wharf in a f r a n t c effort to locate them.

We all recognise that, hut my contention is that more common sense might well be displayed in carrying out the arrangements.

Iri that assertion he displays his own lack of ability. It may be said that I am taking an unfair advantage of this man, suice he cannot reply to me; but I am not dealing as unfairly with him as he deals with the friends and relatives of soldiers leaving for the Front. Even the Kaiser could not outdo Commander Brewis in his treatment of these people. of? cer "" of the' British Navya British"" Johnny,"" who was sent out here, and has no conception of Australian ideals. To illustrate the attitude he takes up, I would mention that quite recently a deputation of ladies, representing the Port Melbourne Reception Committee, waited on me to complain that, although they were temperance workers, he had charged them with taking, intoxicating liquors to the men. These ladies, who are doing a magnificent work, were naturally indignant. They do their best to deliver as quickly as possible to the soldiers as they come ashore the little comforts they have for them; but no proper provision is made for their convenience. These ladies are not all supporters of mine; many of them for years have voted against me, and no doubt will continue to do so. I recognise, however, that they are doing good work, and it is up to me and to Commander Brewis, as well as others, to assist rather than to retard their efforts. They have spent thousands of pounds in providing comforts for the soldiers. They are placed in a sort of enclosure distinct from that in which the friends and relatives of returning soldiers have to wait, but when the rush takes place their catering arrangements are completely upset. They -asked to be given a place where they could avoid the rush, but this request was refused by Commander Brewis. They provide comforts for the returned soldiers of every State, and it would ' be an easy matter for this "" Kaiser"" to provide them with better facilities to carry out their work in connection with the disembarkation of our troops. treate'd well by them, and owe them a lot. doubt of that. These ladies leave their home duties, and wait hour after hour on the wharf to welcome returning soldiers. Very often a vessel does not arrive at the advertised time, but the ladies remain onduty ready to provide the men with small comforts, and to give them a welcome home. My attack is not directed particularly against the present Government j the same trouble existed when the Labour party were in power, and even then I co'uld secure no redress. Senator Pearce, the present Minister, was also Minister for Defence in the Labour Administration.. I do not know why he has not taken, this matter in hand, but I shall avail my^ self of every opportunity to bring it before the House. If this trouble occurs every time a fewmen return, is it not likely to be accentuated when large bodies of troops are returning week after week, and, perhaps, day after day? We shall have to obtain the Services of another disembarkation officer when the troops are returning in numbers, because I am satisfied that Commander Brewis will not be able to cope with the work. He has, indeed, shown noaptitude for it. I admit that without control of the crowd there would be absolute chaos, and it is possible that up to a certain point the authority rests, not with Commander Brewis but with others. If that is so, he should tell us; but knowing him by repute as well as by experience ' I throw upon him the responsibility.

All that her relations, who are now looking after the children, are allowed to keep them is 30s. per week, or 10s. per week for each -child. There is no one in Australia who -can keep a growing boy of thirteen years of age, feed him', clothe him, and house him for 10s. per week. the woman WJO has taken charge of these boys has naturally some feeling for them as a relation, but she.has other obligations of her own to meet. t h a t the Government of this country should ask a woman to assist in keeping the children of a soldier who is fighting for us at the Front? stances, if all the wives of men at the Front were to die, the Government would snake money out of their deaths. not say that' the Government approached the consideration of this matter from that stand-point, but that is the actual ppsi-tion all the same. to look after these children should receive the same amount as the mother received to look after them. every application of the kind has been granted. honourable gentleman that I have made such applications in thirty different cases, and not one of them has been granted.

A sergeant of police and his wife reared a son of the wife's late sister from six weeks old. When he grew up, he was in a bank at Donald, Victoria, earning enough to keep himself decently. He went to the Front when the call came, and was there three years. Twoyears after he left , the foster-father died. The GoThe lad then began to assist his foster-mother. There had been no need for tliis before, although he had always lef t certain money to be drawn by her, which she had been banking for him. When her husband died, she found that her financial position was not as good as she had expected, and she had to use the money allowed by her foster-son to live on, instead of banking ifc for him. He was killed, but because I have made complaints on the subshe was not dependent on him when he w.ent away, she can get no pension.

The Acting Prime Minister forwarded to the Premier of Victoria a copy of a circular letter which he had addressed to the Premiers of the other States on the subject, and it is such an interesting and self-condemnatory document that I crave the indulgence of honourable members while I read it in its entirety' I desire to inform you that, consequent upon representations in the Victorian Parliament, the Premier of Victoria recently, communicated with me, and asked that a definite pronouncement be made as to whether the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for providing for the dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force who are absent without leave. The present practice of the Defence Department as regards soldiers absent without leave from the Australian Imperial Force Camps in Australia is to stop payment of allotment and separation allowance on and from the day on which the soldier is reported r.s absent without leave.

When the soldiers left these shores, they went to fight, and possibly the relatives consented to their going. Their wive3 and relatives were dependent for their subsistence upon the allotment money which 'they were to receive, and the present Government, who made that promise, which was mainly responsible for their winning the election, now turn round and state deliberately that it is the practice of the Department to stop the payment of allotment and separation allowances on and from the day on'which a soldier is reported as absent without leave. for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) in what I consider a theatrical manner, intezTupts speakers on this side with asseverations that the present Government are not responsible for the stoppage of allowances. The honourable member, if he is in his senses, if he is not acting a part, must know that the present Government are responsible for this action. The circular letter continuesIn thc case of soldiers absent without leave front the Australian Imperial Force oversea the practice is as follows:-Afte r a soldier has been absent without leave for twenty-one days, a Court of Inquiry is held, and declares the man an "" illegal absentee."" Twenty-eight days after tlie man is declared an illegal absentee, which is forty-nine days after he was first absent without leave, the Chief Paymaster, London, advises the District Paymaster concerned by cablegram to cancel the allotment. The Government are in such a hurry that they do not wait to give the unfortunate relatives the advantage of any delay thafc would be caused by communicating by letter, but they must cable instructions to stop payment. charged with not being in a hurry at all. not in a hurry to do good, but they seem to be in a terrible hurry to do wrong. I ask any reasonable man whether it is not wrong for the authorities in London fco cable to Australia a cancellation of fche allotment payments. The letter continuesThe District Paymaster immediately notifies tbe allottee of the date on which thc allotment will be cancelled, allowing for a period of at least .thirty days from the despatch of the cablegram from London. This means that the allotment is cancelled seventy-nine days after the member was first absent without leave. If the soldier is apprehended, the allotment, if to a dependant, is reinstated at the minimum rate. It must be borne in mind that when a member is absent without leave he forfeits all pay, and, consequently, tlie amount of the allotment paid to the allottee constitutes an over-payment, which is recovered from the soldier on apprehension. Mark the ingenuity of Ministers! Their action reminds one of the practices of the Spanish Inquisition. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, points out that at the time of enlistment these men and their wives and families were subject' not only to the laws of the Commonwealth, but also to those of the State; and, further, that there are State laws ih which some financial -provision is made for the sustenance of wives and families of deserting husbands. If on the The honourable member desertion of the soldier his dependants were entitled to claim support from the Commonwealth Government, that would be putting a premium upon desertion, and practically placing the dependants of the soldier who deserted in a better position than the dependants of the soldier' who, having completed his contract with the Government, Js discharged -"" Services no longer required."" In the one case all claim ceases, whereas in the other the soldier would be rewarded for deserting by the Government accepting the responsibility for the support of his dependants for the rest of their lives. Such a condition of things would be disastrous in ' its effect on the discipline of the Forces. That is a specious and contemptible argument. Honourable members have heard the honourable member for Ballasoldier, speaking about the A . W . L . ' s . I presume that the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), knows the truth pf what the honourable member for Ballarat says, namely, thafc in this terrible war men are subjected to such fearfu l shocks on tlie battlefield that their mentality is disturbed, and many of them are not responsible for their subsequent actions. There are a hundred different ways in which a soldier may become absent withare generally out leave, and. he ought not to be held criminally responsible u n t i l deliberate desertion isproved. Yet the so-called Win-the-war Government, apparently after f u l l consideration, deliberately set' out to deprive the wives and mothers of soldiers of the allotment money they ought to get. It will be observed that due care is taken to see that the dependants are notified before action to terminate payments is taken, and that sufficient notice is given to enable tbem to make other arrangements, or, if necessary, to apply to the State authorities for assistance in the same way that other persons similarly situated have to apply.",43,State Meat Control

The answer depends partly on the result of the war, on which Mr Hughes is a pessimist Though he is staunch and strenuous about fighting t ill the Germans are crushed, he does not believe in his heart that this can be accomplished militarily. We could not adopt the Australian tariff and Australian legislation against alien emigrants without checking Great Britain's progress and diminishing her population, foreign trade, and mercantile marine, and inflicting enormous hardship on the masses of her people.

Can such a method, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as making for uniformity? For the Senate elections, electors are to adopt the existing system of voting, but for elections for this Chamber they are to employ a sort of win-and-place method. TheB ill further provides that where there are only two candidates for an electorate, and the elector has clearly indicated his choice, no matter by what means that, object has been achieved, his vote shall be regarded as a formal one. This w ill be seen by reference to one of the provisions to clause 134, which readsProvided that in elections for the House of .Representatives at which there are not more than two candidates, the voter's preference for one candidate shall be deemed to .be sufficiently indicated in the case of a ballot-paper marked so as to indicate the voter's first preference only.

I believe fchat the Electoral Commission, of which the honourable member for Moreton was chairman, and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith), and the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) were members, recommended the adoption of a uniform system of voting at elections for this Par-. liament. But this B ill gets away from that ideal. It provides that, in connection with Senate elections, the existing system of voting is to be adopted; whilst at elections for the House of Represen ta-tives, the preferential system of voting is to be employed.

There was some such occur? rence in the electorate of Wide Bay, in which tlie hoD orable member representing that constituency ( Mr Corser) was closelyinterested. A t one polling booth there were over 200 papers concerned. Possibly, it was a matter of ignorance on the part of the officials or of their becoming mixed between the requirements of the different Acts. but we had to go to Court to get those votes accepted? 1 have in mind, and it was only right that since there was no faul t on the part of the electors' concerned,their votes should be treated as formal. In Victoria, the practice is to initial, ' and to number, but in some of the other States, including New South Wales, I believe, they do not initial at all. Well-trained men are not easily obtainable at election time, because, as a rule, well-trained men are partisans. Thus -we may get a man who has .been trained in one system, and who fails to initial a paper, as the result of whicli an elector is disfranchised through no faul t of his own That sort of thing can become very serious.

That being the case, the .number of divisions ought to be reduced to seventy-four, some State other, than Tasmania losing a representative. Probably, every honourable member is hoping that his electorate may not be' affected, and so long as the middle is not cut out of the Yarra electorate, I shall be satisfied. The limitation of electoral expenses has been provided for in our electoral legislation from the beginning. I have always been able to keep within the limit , and on many occasions have spent less than half the amount allowed, having a compact electorate, and a splendid l o t of voluntary workers. But it is farcical to limi t electoral expenditure without compelling organizations to furnish returns.

A provision of which I aporove is that which prevents canvassing witliin 20 feet of the entrance to a polling booth,the entrance, I suppose, meaning the door. Hithertoi t has been l e f t to the police to say whether canvassing is taking place too close to a polling booth. The Government has placed a number of safeguards in the postal voting section. An y elector who wishes to vote by post must declare that he or she is ill , not that lie or she may be ill . We know what happened on the last occasion that postal voting took place. In Committee, I shall give some figures conWestern nected with the exercise of tlie postal vote in the past. In the Kooyong division, the number of postal votes recorded was ten times the number recorded in theYarra division just across the river. These postal votes were not all cast by mothers of newly-born children, or prospective mothers, because the birth-rate of Kooyong is only about half that of Yarra. In my opinion, if voting is to be allowed outside a polling booth, it should be done before an electoral official. We make the Electoral.

376,Mr Tudor,"I do not want anytliat I am not in favour of preferential voting. We have the fact that, under the auspices -of this Government, there have been conferences of electoral officers with a view to uniform rolls, and so forth, and yet this new system is proposed. In Victoria, at the present time, there are three systems of voting in operation. There is marking with the cross in the case of Federal elections; preferential voting for the State Legislative Assembly, and crossing out undesired candidates at municipal elections. I do not know whether preferential voting applies to the Legislative Council of Victoria or whether, indeed, there are any elections at all for that body. last timet over."" As a matter of fact, at the present time many persons think that, because they are on the State roll, they must necessarily be on the Commonwealth roll, and vice versd, clearly showing that uniformity, and not further diversity, is what is necessary. I am reminded by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) that, under present circumstances, names may be struck off the roll at any time; and I notice that the Bill proposes to give the Divisional Returning Officer and the Registrar greater power in cases where names may have been struck off by mistake. I suppose most honourable members have had cases of error brought under their notice. I know of one in which a young lady got married, and it turned out that her Christian name and married surname was the same as that of her mother. The young woman applied to the Department for registration of her new name, but the Department, to make sure, struck off not only her name, but also that of her mother. This was only found out by the parties concerned at election time; but even if it had occurred twelve months before, we know that very often the printed roll is two years old, while there may have been 75 per cent, of alterations. roll used at the last referendum ten months ago was the one used when we were elected to this House. vision made in the Bil l to meet such cases ? will be back from the war before there is one shall be struck off once the writ is issued. In my own electorate a letter[260] carrier, who, in consequence of the war, had, unfortunately, suffered mentally, was the means of striking 300 names off the roll; not one of these names ought to have been removed. On the matter being brought under the notice of the authorities, the whole of the names were reinstated; but we can understand what might have occurred in a more sparsely-populated constituency. These names were struck off after the writ had been issued, when it is impossible for a person to have his name placed on the roll. If , after the writ is issued, it is impossibleto place a name on the roll, it ought to be impossible to strike a name off. after the issue of the writ on an objection. inform the Minister that there are really no objections raised to-day by individuals, the whole being official objections. even on an official objection names cannot be struck off, but there may be some manifest errors that should be corrected. that no names should be removed unless there is the power to reinstate them. case of error. that on the day of election a person whose name has been struck off may make a declaration to the effect that the striking off is a manifest error, and may vote, his vote being put on one side for verification. I take the ground that this B ill ought not to have been introduced at the present time. The Government have said that while the soldiers are away there shall be no redistribution of seats, and they should have gone further, and declared against any alteration in the electoral machinery. The amendment of the Electoral Act is, I think, recognised by all as being no party question. I am at a loss to understand why this Bil l is brought before the ChamThe printed ber at this particular time. It would have been better to wait until later on in the life of this Parliament, for, after all, there is no immediate prospect of an election; in all probability most of our boys another political contest.

The only question of importance in the Bill is that of preferential voting. The Act at present in force is, I think, giving were to be threatened with opposition every satisfaction so far as the conduct of from a member of his party, he would elections is concerned. I am not sure that the introduction of a new method of voting will not complicate the position for right to oppose him. the voter My own idea is that we shall find a largo number of informal votes. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has pointed out, the Government have, talked about the necessity for uniformity in the rolls, and yet they seek to introduce a new system, which, so far as I can see, can result in nothing hut confusion at the ballot-box. will be asked to vote, as in the past, for three candidates for the Senate, and, at the same time, he will be asked to vote, not by making a cross opposite the name of the man of his choice for the House of Representatives, but for one, two, three, four, or more candidates, as the case may he. informal votes at present. avoid informal votes as far as possible. .1 cannot see any benefit in the new system, and it would be far better to allow the electors to make their choice of the candidates offering as in the past.

The honourable member does not contend that under this Bill parties will not continue to select their candidates as in the past? not do away with the necessity of party selection ?

If the honourable member feel hurt, and would appeal to his organization as to whether that person had a knows very little about me. about human nature to believe that that would happen. It is quite unnecessary, at the present juncture, to interfere in any way with the existing Act, especially by the introduction of preferential voting. There will be . a good deal of discussion on the subject of postal voting. On the occasion of the last amendment of the Electoral Act there was a very keen debate on this .point. I claimed that it was essential to provide every facility for all electors to record their votes, and in Committee I proposed an amendment which I thought would meet the case, as far as was legitimately possible. I do not believe that the postalvoting system is in the best interests of the country. Beyond doubt it was abused in the past, and, that being so, I feel confident that it will be abused in the future. before tlie ' Electoral 'Commission was overwhelmingly in favour of the postal vote. And some of the evidence came from the honourable member's .party. Committee of the Senate reported adversely upon the postal vote. ber gave a-postal vote to the seaman, but not to the man in the bush. give a vote to the man in the bush.

Xt really is a Bill for consideration in Committee; and if honourable members give the necessary attention to it, and conscientiously strive to make it as perfect a measure as possible, some tangible result may be forthcoming from the effort of the Minister( Mr. Glynn) to amend the present law. Some of the provisions of this Bill are incomplete. It would not have been produced had it not been for the adoption of the principle of preferential voting by the party sitting on this side of the Chamber; but the principle as incorporated in the measure is very incomplete and ineffective. If it is to be at all complete and effective, there should be no bar, handicap, or impediment in any shape or form to any person going to the poll who believes that he is capable of securing the support of the most of the people in a given constituency; but there is nothing in the Bill imposing a penalty on organizations who conduct in advance a pre-selection which robs the special preferential provision of its efficacy. There is nothing to prevent either party represented in this House, from setting out in advance of an election to hold a pre-selection, and put the hall-mark upon a candidate ; and that is . a most effective bar against other candidates going to the poll.

459,Mr Rodgers,"We all know thatby fche electors, if some other individual is chosen at the pre-selection ballot? Let us face the position earnestly. I would rather not see the provision in the Bill than have it there without proper safeguards; and at a later stage I propose to test the feeling of the House on the matter by submitting an amendment seeking to impose a penalty on any organization setting out ""in advance of elecam anxiously awaiting a statement from * tion day to pre-selecfc a candidate, and thus cTefear other persons from entering the field. If we are sincere in our effort to provide an open field for all candidates, then no person should suffer the handicap that, in advance, his claims have been tested and rejected by his party. member's proposal is merely an attempt to destroy the organizations, without which poor men would not be able to enter Parliament. question about this. We must either give a clear, open field for candidates to go to opportunity. the poll unhandicapped, or permit the continuance of the practice that has long prevailed on both sides of fchis Chamber, by which the two great parties in this country set up their organizations and machinery, and utilize their funds with the object of determining in advance of an election what candidates shall run in their interests. I maintain that no man .should go to the poll having his chance predetermined against him by his party. This point was prominently before the country at the election at which the honourable member for Elinders( Mr Bruce) was returned. There were three candidates in the field, and at the eleventh hour a promise was given that preferential voting would be enacted.. the Government long prior to that. was the settled policy of the major section of the party on this side of the Chamber,. but a definite promise to introduce the policy previously agreed upon was announced just prior to that election. believe that the honourable member for Flinders would have-won the seat against a dozen candidates, and I was one who personally objected to the announcement which was made, but at any rate the events surrounding that election gave an indication of the disabilities suffered by reason of the fact that the preferential voting system was not in force'. The Government, in accordance with their promise, have come down with a Bill which is designed to remedy that state of affairs, but they have absolutely failed to provide the one safeguard needed, and without which the Bill will not be effective. I the Minister. already said that this Bill will do away with the necessity, for pre-selection. ber knows perfectly well that his party will continue to predetermine the chances of candidates. I am not sufficient'of a humbug to say that this is a preferential voting measure, which will provide a free and open field to all candidates. What is the object of the measure? fails to provide it. He has already shown that there are two great parties in this country possessed of the machinery for controlling elections, and part of the practice of both parties is to predetermine the chance of their candidates at elections. the adherents of the two parties are morally bound to support the candidates upon whom the pre-election choice has fallen. In those circumstances, what chances have other candidates of being elected? Therefore, we do not secure free electoral opportunities. I am quite conscious of the fact than any person can go to the poll after paying a deposit, and get enough electors to sign his nomination paper. prevent pre-selection, or prevent a man being labelled Liberal or Labour? pre-selections by declaring them illegal, I and providing a penalty.

I understand that the electoral officers in charge of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and the States met in Conference, and submitted recommendations for a uniform system. a uniform roll. tralia. They also made other recommendations for the conduct of elections. Before bringing down this measure, the Government should have conferred with fche States, and have arrived at an understanding with them that legislation should be introduced in all fche State Parliaments to secure a unified electoral system.

I approve of the restoration of the postal vote with adequate safeguards, and the tightening up of electoral machinery, so that on election day those whose names have been improperly l e f t off the rolls will have an opportunity to vote if they can satisfy the officers that they should have been enrolled. In many respects fche Minister, by means of this B ill , proposes an improvement on our present electoral machinery; but I do not think that the provision for preferential votinsr will be effective, or that it will achieve the object that the Government have in view. [8.52] I agree wifch those who have said that the most important part of this B ill is that providing for preferential voting. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr. Rodgers) suggests that we should p u t a stop to the practice of pre-selection of candidates by parties. If that system were abolished, it would do away w i th a have not had a lot of trouble for some people, and many associations which now send oufc to canSome didates circulars asking whether they are in favour of prohibition, and various other matters, would find themselves no longer able to take such action.

Some of them, perhaps, have changed their views, but the great majority will vote as fchey d i d before they went to the Front. I do not believe that there will be a returned soldiers' party as such. Some may attempt to form such a party, but if it is formed, it is a certainty that ifc will attach itself fco the most Conservative section.

The day of the independent candidate has gone for ever, and rightly so, because the independent man was always ahle to look after his own personal interests. Where the Ministerial and Opposition parties were almost evenly balanced, the independent member could claim, what he wanted. Parties were formed to enable policies to be created. There could be conceived ideas of policy. In the old days, the Prime Minister, or some great leader whom many people believed to have a monopoly of the brains of the community, was left to formulate a policy for the people; but that system has also gone. The people know that in Australian politics to-day there are only two parties. If there is to be no preselection of candidates, men will be returned to this Parliament without any opinions, and we shall have a most curious House, consisting of seventy-five men, each with a separate policy.

That is why I am against it. I remember an election that took place in South Melbourne for the Legislative Oouncil about six years ago. Two well-known men, both Conservatives, were the candidates. At 7.30 on the night of the election I heard one man say, "" I voted eighteen times,"" and another said, "" I voted nineteen times.""

I did not blame the candidates so much as the very energetic and tricky electioneering agents who were running the election for them. Where there is political corruption on one or both sides, honourable members will agree that it is well to prevent it if we can SoI say that, although we will lose many genuine votes by not having postal voting, that is better than the corruption which takes place under the postal voting system. If arrangements could be made to prevent corruption under the system, I should he glad to accept it. One thing that would obviate the necessity for voting by post would be to have a greater number of polling booths -its adoption has been proved to lead to number now that there were a few years ago. There are over 8,000 now. number has been increased, and that the Electoral Officers have always been quite willing to consider the creation of new polling places when they have been applied for. I am quite satisfied with the conduct of elections by our electoral officers. Our principal electoral ofiicers and deputy returning ofiicers must hold some political opinions, but I believe they are animated generally by a desire to perform their duties impartially. Wherei t is pointed out to them that polling booths are necessary, they are prepared to consider their establishment, but they are restricted by the consideration of expense. In my own constituency there is one section where the people have to go nearly a mile and a half to record their votes. miles in my electorate. some of the country constituencies people have to take a holiday to go to the poll. I quite recognise the disadvantages which country electors labour under, but environment must be taken into account, and whilst people in the country think it noth-. ing to ride, drive, or walk 2 miles to the nearest neighbour, it is not so in the city. It is remarkable to find that postal voting was availed of to a greater extent in cities than in country constituencies. It is strange that in Western Australia, with its enormous area, there was less voting by post than in Tasmania. postal votes recorded were 1,200, and in Western Australia 900. tralia there were 1,900. there were only 900 postal votes recorded in Western Australia, but in view of the difference in area, assuming the honourable member's figures to be correct, there should have been many more postal votes recorded in Western Australia. I do not object to the facilities afforded by postal voting. My objection to the system is that corruption. I want to say something about Deputy Returning Officers. It is remarkable how some men, when vested with a little authority, allow their partisan feeling to influence their actions. On one or two occasions I have had to complain of certain officers. I consider it the duty of an electoral officer to assist in every way he can to secure a poll with as few informal votes as possible. To secure this end political parties issue voting cards, showing how supporters of their respective parties should vote. Some people believe that that practice is wrong, but I can see nothing wrong in it. I know that one deputy returning officer tried to prevent people taking these voting cards into the polling booth with them, and he stopped some voters from doing so. That man was interfering with the rights of people. It is actions of that sort which bring about informal votes. When people get into a polling booth they ought to be 40 given all the assistance possible to"" enable them to vote as they wish. I am",67,Smith I S He Going To No Sound Legislation Without Some Pre

The Minister has on several occasions reiterated his desire for uniformity. 1902 he spoke in this House as follows :I look forward to the time when, through delegation of powers solicited by the Federation, and granted by the States, we shall have in the Commonwealth and States one Electoral Act and one principle of division, involving, as they will, one suffrage, one set of officers, one roll, one mode of election, and one code to secure the purity of elections.

The National party are not in earnest with regard to the pledge which they gave only a ' few months ago in connection with the Plinders election.

In was offered in order to give the honorahle member for Elinders( Mr Bruce) a square cut against the Labour candidate was proportional representation. The party machine, well oiled, ran smoothly, and, notwithstanding a good deal of tribulation, anxiety, and worry, a satisfactory arrangement was eventually arrived at. The Labour party had no wrong impression as to what was going to happen at that election. Nor has it any wrong impression as to what is going to happen in Western Australia. The same thing will happen there as happened in connection with the Elinders election.

If he will read that policy he will find that the pledge to which I was broken immediately this Bil l was introduced That circumstance, however, is nothing new. Many pledges have been broken by the Government during the past few months. There are several features in this Bill which are objectionable from my stand-point. The proposal to restore postal voting opens the way to the same corruption as existed when that 1911, when a referendum was about to be taken in connection with certain proposed constitutional alterations as applied to industrial conditions, I happened to be shearing on a station above Brewarrina. There were some twenty of us working in and about the shearing shed. We applied for our postal ballot-papers, and in due course received them. The station manager was also a justice of the peace, and after the mail had arrived one evening he sent us word that everything was in order, and that we could go and record our votes. I was about the third or fourth man to record my vote, but prior to entering tlie room I was informed that I would probably be asked which way I intended voting. When I did enter the room I was handed a blank ballot-paper, and was just about to mark it, when I was asked by the station manager how I intended to vote. but his question was merely a prelude to an argument or request.

But the Ministry did not, as a whole. forefront of the party programme of honourable members opposite. The electoral machinery of this country should not be altered until the men now fighting have returned. There are vital alterations proposed here, and before they are carried out the promises of the Government should be kept. I propose to touch upon one or two points which have been raised during the debate. I have voted on both sides with regard to this question. When I was in the Labour party, at the time when the subject was before it, I supported compulsory voting. We abolished the system of postal Voting. That was never satisfactory to my mind, nor is the system of compulsory voting. I do not see how it can be brought about in Australia, because there is no strong opinion outside of Parliament in favour of it. It is all very well, for honourable members who represent close and compact constituencies, such as that I represent, to advocate any proposal that would be eminently satisfactory to those constituencies. But we should not lose sight of that great section of the Australian people who are doing the best work in all the land-the pioneers in our out-back country. Consistency does not worry me vastly upon a subject such as this. We must frame an electoral system that will deal justice to settlers in our outside country. Eacilities should be cerview of the future, and naturally would tainly provided for these people, and I do not see how it is possible except under some system of postal voting. My honourable friend, the member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has always consistently advocated the giving of an opportunity to vote to the sick and infirm, and this, I achieved by means of the postal vote, any difficulties in connection with [261] which oan be overcome at the Committee stage. I am not wedded to the provisions in the Bill relating to this matter, but I intend to see that some such facilities are provided. I admit that there is always an element of corruption about the postal vote, but I think that if the consideration of the matter is approached in a non-party spirit, we shall be able to so safeguard the principle as to reduce any possibility of corruption to a minimum. with a party aim. been in favour of the system requiring a deposit from candidates. I do not think it has ever kept a poor man out of Parliament, because if a man has any chance of election, and is respected, he is bound to have plenty of friends ready to put money up for him. If a man cannot provide a deposit, in nine cases out of ten it is because he is a fanatica man who thinks that the world will never be right until he gets into Parliament. So far as possible we ought to safeguard a constitutency from the possibility of having an election forced upon it by men who have no earthly chance of election. I note that, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) is somewhat dissatisfied with the measure because the Government do not intend to make preselection an electoral offence. As a matter of fact, I think myself that preselection will go on, and ought to go on, because I have always been a strong party man. In the English-speaking world there has always been party government, and there always will be. Gambetta, the celebrated French statesman, said that party government is government based on the formation of men's minds. One man, by education, birth, environment, and position, may not take a very hopeful be of a conservative temperament, while another man, under the same conditions and circumstances, would take a hopeful view, and would always be in the front rank of the advanced political party. This principle applies all over the world, and, according to Gambetta, is the origin again point out, can only be of the party system.

There has always been the reform or advanced party, and whenever the people have got tired of it, that party has gone out, and another has taken its place. But the secret of the success of our party government lies in the fact that a succeeding party Government never reverses the progressive legislation to which party govern.ment has given effect. In this is to be found the secret of the strength and solidarity of the British Empire, and in deed, of European civilization. able members, if they are well informed on this subject, must realize that the doctrine of projected efficiency w ill do more for the future than anything else. these reasons, I stand for party government and party organization.

The Government is merely casting dust in the eyes of the people. the honourable member recommend? to suggest to Ministers how they shall govern the country. life to help lame dogs over a stile. member recently objected to being termed a dumb dog. I was about to remark, when this unruly representative of the capitalistic' class interjected, that if honourable members opposite desired to give the people true representation, and to establish political Democracy, they would not ask us to waste our time with a measure such as this. Had they proposed the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall, they would be entitled to the credit of attempting to give the people a political Democracy. The Government would be selected by the representatives chosen by the people, and the people would have the power to recall such representatives as failed in their duty. now exercise the right of recall every three years. orable member does not wish to have that right exercised more often. is the only minority representative in the House. a minority representative, but actually we on this side represent the majority of the people; it is honourable members opposite who represent the minority. But why should I mind the taunts of honourable members opposite? I represent the interests that I wish to represent. Eveni f I was chosen by a minority-and that is not certain-wha t does it matter? Other members have beenfirst sent to Parliament by minorities, and have remained there for many years. minority vote. a believer in the representation of giving a total of, I think, about minorities ? representation of majorities, of those who produce the wealth of the country.

What is proposed is that which has characterized parliamentary institutions since their inception. The British House of Commons is known as the Mother of Parliaments, and in the development of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire and elsewhere we have seen a gradual transference of political power from one class to another. That has gone on from the time of William III . , when party government was instituted, and Ministers were first introduced into the House of Commons. By extensions of the franchise, power has been shifted, first from the aristocratic to the commercial and moneyed classes, just in proportion as they acquired that economic power which determines political power. The various Reform Bills from 1832 have, as I say, transferred the power from the landowning classes to the commercial and moneyed classes, and then the Bill of 1867 enlarged the franchise, and gave power to the lower middle classes. So the process has gone on until, when the war broke out, there were something like 12,000,000 voters, who, as Carlyle said, had the right to a one-thousandth part of a talker in the national palaver. It is now proposed in Great Britain to add 20,000,000 or 22,000,000.",76,Smith I S He Going To No Sound Legislation Without Some Pre

I understand that, it is her have a house of five rooms, and to the desire of honourable members to adjourn, and, therefore, I ask leave to congone. I thought that this landlord might tinue my speech. Leave granted; debate adjourned. That the House do now adjourn. I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) the terrible stress which tenants.are sufis over seventy years of age? W ill you, befering at the present time hy the unjust claims made upon them by certain landlords. The House will remember that on a previous occasion I spoke of one Jewish gentleman who owns many houses in the community, and who, when I represented the difficulties of the people during waT time, agreed that he would not increase the Tents of his tenants. There is another type of landlord, however; and the case I now desire to mention is that of an old lady about seventy years of age, who, by letting a few rooms, manages to obtain her own shelter for nothing. Her landlord, John Anderson, of Elizabeth Street, Coburg, raised her rent 10s. a week, and a few weeks afterwards raised it by another 10s. Honourable members, I am sure, will forgive me if I call this rack-renting man a scoundrel. I find that he has broken the law, and I intend that he shall be prosecuted, because tomorrow I shall forward the necessary information. He raised the Tent by still another 10s., although this old lady had been his tenant for fourteen years. have seen her rent-book, and I have found that the man, as I say, has broken the law. She endeavoured for a time to pay the £3 a week, and then she came to me in her trouble. I sent her to a legal gentleman, who, in his sympathy, advised her nqt to pay the increased rent, but to go to a magistrate and explain that, although her lodgers would accompany her, she could not get another house. Any honourable member who has experience of this large city knows that, at the present moment, it is most difficult to rent houses. One agent kindly said that he could let that house the unfortunate old lady has be a Christian, and I wrote the following letter to him:Your action to Mrs. Meyer has-been brought under my notice. I understand this lady has been your tenant for fourteen years, during which time you have received your rent regularly. I now learn that you have raised her rent by an increase of 10s., and then in addition to this another 10s., and a further increase of a third 10s. I do not know if you are a Christian or not, but you w ill feel mighty mean when you die and face your Maker. I know this unfortunate lady has tried to find another house, but she cannot, and it w ill be absolute ruin if you go on your way. Are you aware that she fore I take further action, tell me what youT intention ie T This is not an isolated case. It is unfortunate that in a community such as this the authorities, in their efforts to do good by condemning houses and pulling them down, create a scarcity by not providing other houses. However, there is no justification in war time for such conduct as I have described on the part of a landlord, and I ask that, under the War Precautions Act, there should be a regulation to carry out what was suggested by the Jewish gentleman to whom I have re-' ferred, namely, a law to prevent landlords raising their Tent, so that it should not be necessary for private persons to request them to do what the State should compel. We have passed about 292 laws this year, and surely we could pass another to deal with these exploiters and enemies within the gates? The action of this landlord is not that of an honourable man, hut that of a rack-renting brute. I have no hesitation in saying that such exploiters who I raise the cost of food and living generally are more despicable than our open enemies, who, at any rate, are man enough to stand in front with a rifle. TomorrowI will bring the action of this John Anderson under the notice of the State Government in the hope that they will prosecute and punish him for having broken the law.
