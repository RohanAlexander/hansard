We are debating two bills today and I An inquiry into the 2010 federal election would like to briefly discuss the provisions was recently conducted by the Joint Standing of each bill. Firstly, there is the Electoral and Committee on Electoral Matters, with Referendum Amendment (Maintaining numerous electoral matters inquired into and Address) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend subsequently reported on. The Labor and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Greens committee members recommended amendments provide for the details of an that eligible electors be put directly on the elector to be added to the electoral roll when electoral roll through the introduction of the commissioner is satisfied that the elector automatic enrolment.

An inquiry into automatic electors must currently update their own enrolment in New South Wales made details and the onus is on them to ensure that reference to this issue, stating: they do so. However, I am concerned about One of the concerns about receiving data from proposed changes which will permit personal trusted agencies for the purpose of automatic address details of individuals to be changed enrolment or automatic update of electors is that by the government, on the individual's any address data sourced from these agencies was not gathered for the purpose of collecting behalf, without their knowledge or consent. electorate information. The Australian Electoral Commission's website talks about the importance of the The Electoral and Referendum Amendment right to vote and actually states: (Maintaining Address) Bill 2012 will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to The right to vote is one of the privileges of living in a democracy-you get a say in who runs your change elector address details by country. determining what are 'reliable and current data sources'. I could not agree more with this point. The coalition has concerns about this In their dissenting report on the conduct of provision. It does not take into account the the 2010 election, the coalition members of fact that the address provided by some the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral electors to particular government agencies is Matters noted that Australian citizens have merely a point of contact rather than their four duties in relation to their enrolment: actual place of residence.

I mentioned previously, the only way to The Gillard government does not have faith ensure this information is accurate and to in the Australian people to maintain these maintain the electoral roll's integrity is to responsibilities. It should not be seeking to continue to give the responsibility of dilute these duties. These are not obligations updating these details to the individual and that are too onerous for Australian citizens not to a third party. and electors.

I believe this is also closely with government agencies will guarantee the linked with the issue of individual accuracy of their electoral details. This is a responsibility of electors, which I have direct dilution of an elector's responsibility to already discussed. The basis of my concern compulsorily enrol. is straightforward: if an individual updates their electoral details, details which they know are accurate and appropriate to them, it was found that only 64.3 per cent of those then the accuracy and therefore the integrity electors who were automatically enrolled for of the roll will be ensured. However, if this the first time turned out to vote. responsibility is taken away and given to the Based on the New South Wales Australian Electoral Commission, there is a experience, the high non-participation rate much higher chance that an error will occur, indicates that the information used to put particularly if this change of address is made new electors on the roll is unreliable. This without the knowledge of the elector. We also means that, because incorrect address must remember also that there are many details have been used on the electoral roll, people who have multiple places of some electors will be issued with a fine for residence and, if their enrolled address is not voting when it was in fact their changed without their knowledge, there is information that was incorrect in the first clearly a high likelihood that an error will place. Does this sound like a ringing occur and they will be automatically enrolled endorsement for automatic enrolment?

These are the key concerns that the coalition has previously highlighted in its coalition members of the Joint Standing dissenting reports to the JSCEM inquiries Committee on Electoral Matters raised in into the 2010 federal election and the their dissenting report.

My greatest concern prosecute cases of alleged fraudulent voting. is that the key elements of these bills have In the dissenting report it was highlighted by the capacity to weaken rather than strengthen the coalition members that they had some the integrity of the electoral roll.

In particular, there was an example of ridiculous array of restrictions on our a priest from a country town who was activities under nanny state laws and written to by the AEC asking him why he regulations that send the message that people had voted three times in the electorate simply cannot be trusted to accept McEwen. He wrote back to the AEC and responsibility for their own actions.

Imagine what a real government could budget cuts and exactly what this new have done from the position this economy commission of audit constitutes in terms of was in when Labor took over. For a start, the opposition's policies. there was money in the bank, not a record The opposition have for almost 18 months debt. Thanks to Labor's reckless spending, gone about this place calling themselves an Australia is now forced to pay $6 billion a alternative government, trying at every year in interest on the debt they have created. opportunity to find a seat on the government Coincidently it is estimated the National benches of this place. Yet, when they are Disability Insurance Scheme, which we asked to provide very basic details about support, would cost around $6 billion a year their economic policies, very basic details to implement. Labor is trying to create this about costings and very basic details of what illusion that it is going to fund the NDIS and they do stand for, they go back to being the the coalition is not. Well, if Labor supported opposition. They go back to being not it it would be in its budget this year. On this accountable and they go back to indicating side of the House we support the NDIS, and that they will reveal this in due course, that it we have the ability to fix the economy so is somewhere off in the distance and that at that it can become a reality. In asking for some point in the future they will provide transparency we ask for truth, because we information for people to be able to put their have had a very, very long time where we finger on what the opposition represents in have had exactly the opposite from this terms of job cuts and cuts to health and government. education budgets-all of those things that Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (16:20): I am we inevitably see whenever any conservative pleased to speak on this matter of public government comes to power. I am certainly importance. I am a bit astounded that this is very familiar with that because we have an MPI that is being put by those opposite, recently been the beneficiaries of the Baillieu because I would not have thought that one government in Victoria. We see very clearly from the opposition benches would be that while in opposition members of seeking to raise matters about either conservative parties are very reluctant to transparency or concern about the business provide specifics about their economic community at a time when two very policies and to provide appropriate details significant issues are facing them. When they about what their priorities are, and when they come into this place they are clearly get into government, as is the case in opposing the interests of those they Victoria with Ted Baillieu, they sit on their repeatedly propose to represent by opposing hands, they do nothing and they allow the tax cuts for companies and for small state to stagnate, or they decide to slash and business. They have shown themselves to be burn. We have certainly seen that in previous very emphatic on those points. It is governments at a federal level and very extraordinary that they are coming in today certainly at a state level, in my state. So it is extraordinary that today we are being invited natural disasters. He, as a member who has by those opposite to talk about issues of been directly affected by natural disasters, transparency and support for the business should know very well about the economic community when they so obviously fail impacts that people in his own electorate repeatedly on both counts. must have felt and must continue to feel as a I am however very pleased to speak about result. He must know that there are realities this government's track record of for our economy which must be faced as a transparency in relation to our economy and result of those natural disasters. So it is in relation to our support for the business utterly ludicrous for the people who have community. I am somewhat disappointed to stood here this afternoon, seemingly talking have heard the member for Goldstein, who about transparency and support for the brought this matter before the House, reflect business community, to be denying the on the events of the global financial crisis. realities of pressures being felt by our So regularly as individual members, when economy and denying the reality that this we go to our electorates and see the benefits government is responding to those financial of construction projects in schools and pressures. housing developments, we hear of the It is absolutely extraordinary that the benefits for ordinary people as a result of the opposition are speaking about transparency stimulus spending put in place by this and accountability, because we have heard government.

We have House are incredulous about this so-called heard denial of the global financial crisis as a 'audit constitution' is that the understanding reality which affected the world several of members of the opposition and indeed the years ago and is continuing to be felt by shadow Treasurer of what it means to countries around the world. We saw denial conduct an audit and what an audit of the benefits of the Building the Education represents was made pretty clear at the last Revolution by the member for Murray. I can election. Seemingly audited accounts were confirm that the 68 schools in my electorate revealed to have an $11 billion hole in them. which have been the beneficiaries of this We know that on ABC in August 2010 the government's economic responsibility at a shadow Treasurer said that their accounts very difficult time are very thankful for the had been audited. He said: commitments we made-the $110 million You know what? If the fifth-biggest accounting spent across my electorate. firm in Australia signs off on your numbers it is a We heard denial from the member for brave person to start saying there are accounting Dawson about the financial impacts of tricks. I tell you it is audited. Apparently they said that there were savings heard today from the Treasurer about the of $11.5 billion that the coalition had practical realities of what the coalition's identified as part of their audit. This audit is proposals for company tax and small an extraordinary thing because we now know business tax reform that we are undertaking, that not only has it been revealed through and that they are opposing, would mean. We appropriate scrutiny of those accounts that know that they oppose the tax cut for there was indeed an $11.5 billion hole in this companies. In fact, they want to increase supposed audit but that the ICA's appeal company tax by 1.5 per cent. We know that tribunal found that the audit the coalition had this means an estimated $392 million cost to organised was not an audit at all. So industry the manufacturing sector. We know that it bodies are aware of exactly what they mean means an estimated $270 million cost to the by an audit. The Australian public and the retail sector. Quite frankly, if you are going Australian Treasury are certainly aware of to come into this place and put up a matter of what they mean by an audit. So in terms of public importance about support for the transparency the opposition have a little bit business community, it would be worthwhile of form about what it is to conduct an audit. not adding to their costs through your public They have a bit of form about whether or not policies. This is an extraordinary motion and their audit can be relied on. one which should not be supported by the So it is with incredulity that all of us on House. which they propose to set up to be able to speak on this matter of public importance identify cuts to services, cuts to budgets-the about the urgent need for government to inevitable things that conservatives do when deliver budget transparency to the business they come to office. All Australians have community. Let me start by talking about the come to know that. They are certainly fact that transparency requires honesty, coming to know that in my state. I expect integrity and openness. I think the Australian that when the appropriate scrutiny is applied public demands that of us. When I walk to those opposite, their audit will reveal itself through my electorate and meet with small to be exactly what it was at the last business owners and with other people, they election-a sham. ask why we do not put things up front for By contrast, we have been absolutely clear them so that they can understand the with the Australian people about our support implications when it comes to the financial for small business and for the business management of their businesses, including community in general.

It is not hard to provide numerous business community generally and examples of gross ineptitude by the undermining small business that they so government in demonstrating budget heartily profess to support when they come transparency. to this place, when they are out on the IfI were to do an analysis of all the hustings, when they are back in their answers that the Treasurer gives in this electorates indicating that they have done chamber to questions around budget and their very best to support small business, fiscal management, then I would find that despite the fact that they inevitably will vote there would be very little in the way of against cuts to taxes for small businesses and transparent answers, as opposed to attacks on they vote against company tax cuts.

Wednesday, 21 March 2012 RAAF Medical Air Evacuation Transport Units formidable and extraordinary women whose stories have not often been recorded in our history books, but who nonetheless played an important role in Australia's war history. The nurses of the RAAF Medical Air Evacuation Transport Units, known as 'the Flying Sisters' were an incredible group of young women who volunteered their services, and in some cases gave their lives, to ensure our young soldiers injured in combat or held as prisoners of war during World War II were evacuated from the front line and brought home. The 25 courageous young nurses recruited to the special RAAF unit flew into remote areas of the Pacific which were defended by Japanese troops. The Flying Sisters were responsible for the loading of C-47s from ambulances on the ground amongst the rugged terrain and in a major theatre of war. Exposed to scenes experienced by our men fighting on the front line, the Flying Sisters performed their duties with tenacity, valour and resourcefulness. The mother of Jennifer Ballard, a resident of Winmalee, was one of these extraordinary Australian women. At just 20 years of age, Joan Loutit volunteered as a Flying Sister, serving in the New Guinea campaign. Stationed at Morotai from 1942, Joan and several sisters flew nonstop until after the war was over in 1945 to evacuate 'their boys' from battlefields in New Guinea so that they could access medical attention back in Darwin. Now 90, Joan recently reflected on her time as a Flying Sister with her daughter. She remembers: A typical working day for an air evacuation sister began at 3 am. Breakfast at 3.30 am. First flight was at first light over New Guinea before the heat of the day. Two hundred and fifty thousand POWs, servicemen and civilians were evacuated. It is incredible. And she states: I was very proud to be a member of the RAAF Nursing Service Flying Unit. Joan, Australia is extremely proud of you and we are grateful for your service and for the service of all of the Flying Sisters. In the lead-up to ANZAC Day this year and the commemorations of the centenary of ANZAC in 2015, it is so important that we share stories like Joan's and the Flying Sisters so that we may honour and recognise the service of outstanding Australians. The young men wounded in action identified the Flying Sisters uniform as a symbol of safety. Today, we recognise the Flying Sisters with unrelenting gratitude. Their service saved the lives of thousands of Australians. Though not formally recognised with wings or a flying badge of their own, I take this opportunity today to formally recognise the service and acknowledge the uniqueness of the Flying Sisters and honour them and their legacy.

259,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (09:30,"I rise this morning to honour a group of courageous,Walsh, Mr Sean Francis Morrough Crouch, Mr John Radisich, Ms Jaye Amber, MP (09:33): In my capacity as the member for Perth, it is my sad duty to make some remarks today about the recent passing of three stalwart members of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. In recent weeks, Western Australia has lost three fine citizens and the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party has lost three great contributors: Sean Walsh, John Crouch and Jaye Radisich. I take this opportunity to extend my condolences to families and friends on the tragic passing of these three colleagues. They were all of different ages but all of them died way too young. They all made a substantial contribution to the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. I have known them variously over the years as the Principal Private Secretary of the Attorney-General of the state of Western Australia, as the State Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party and subsequently as the member for Perth. I have known Sean Walsh since 1984. We were both ministerial officers together in successive state Labor governments. He made a substantial contribution to government in Western Australia and a substantial contribution to the Western Australian Labor Party. He finished his career in government, and with the Labor Party, as Chief of Staff to the Premier, Geoff Gallop. There could be no greater commendation or greater recommendation of Sean's contribution, his integrity as a person or his standing, than the regard with which Geoff Gallop held him, and Geoff made a fine eulogy at Sean's recent funeral. I have known John Crouch since 1976. He was a long standing, devoted servant of the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. He had aspirations to ensure that Western Australia, and Australia generally, became a better society. He was interested in renewable energy and climate change long before it was fashionable to do so. He was a long standing delegate to the state executive of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, and also served with me as a member of the party's administrative committee. He completed his contribution as a long standing electorate officer to Ed Dermer, one of our upper house MPs. My condolences go to his family and to his long standing friends: Sue Neacy, Graham Connell and John Cowdell. Finally, Jaye Radisich was a former member of the state parliament, of whom a lot has been said publicly. I will make a couple of remarks about Jaye. She was born in 1976, the year that I met John Crouch. She died tragically at the age of 35. She was the youngest woman MP of the state parliament of Western Australia. She won her seat on two occasions quite miraculously-with swings of 11 per cent and then three per cent. She was a woman of great courage and she has the eternal admiration of all of her state parliamentary colleagues and Western Australian federal parliamentary colleagues. Again, my condolences to the family and friends of the three concerned. 100th Anniversary of the Farmers and Settlers Association anniversary of the establishment of the forerunner of the Nationals: a Farmers and Settlers Association was formed on 28 March 1912 in Perth. A year later the association carried a",174,Constituency Statements
260,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth,Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House),175,Constituency Statements
261,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of The Nationals) (09:36): Next week marks the 100thresolution to establish a political party, to be called the Country Party. In 1914, the Country Party contested the Western Australian election, winning two seats in the Legislative Council and eight in the Legislative Assembly. That the Country Party, which became the Nationals, has for 100 years played a pivotal role in ensuring that the voice of people living in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia is heard in parliaments of Australia, is remarkable. This party, which I now have the honour of leading, has served on federal government benches for longer than any other political party in Australia's history. It is a tradition and legacy not lost or forgotten by myself or any of the 17 Nationals that currently take up the cause of regional people every day in this place. Over these long years, the Nationals have produced three Prime Ministers: Sir Earl Page, Sir Arthur Fadden and Sir John McEwen, all towering figures within the Nationals. Like them, our philosophy is country-mindedness. It is just as important today as it has been at any point in our history. Farmers across Australia began promoting themselves in loose associations from the late 1800s to promote their interests and combat the growing strength of the unions of rural workers. One of the first was the Amalgamated Farmers Union formed at Wagga Wagga in New South Wales in 1890. Many of these groups developed a pledge to work together for greater recognition of farmers' interests by governments, politicians and the wider community. For instance, in Queensland in 1895, 12 country members of parliament met and agreed 'to watch over, encourage and endeavour to develop agricultural interests generally.' Farm organisations elsewhere soon followed the Western Australian example. They sponsored country parties in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, and in New South Wales in the form of the Progressive Party. Almost universally, these parties were derided by their opponents, with predictions they would quickly become extinct. In fact, Melbourne's Argus famously predicted the demise of the Country Party in 1922. Well, we are still here, but the Argus, I note, closed its doors in 1957. The voters responded. They recognised that it was important that there be people who would stand up for those who live in regional Australia and we have succeeded because we have delivered over these 100 years. Today, we mark with pride the formation 100 years ago of the Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association as the nucleus from which the Country and National parties have developed, and we commit ourselves to continuing to effectively represent the people who live outside the capital cities. World Down Syndrome Day acknowledge that today is World Down Syndrome Day. The reason that 21 March is World Down Syndrome Day is that 21/3 represents the three copies of chromosome 21, which is unique to people with Down Syndrome. It is estimated that there are seven million people with Down Syndrome worldwide, and it is the most common and recognised form of learning disability in the world. This day in 2012 marks the seventh anniversary of World Down Syndrome Day and it is the first year that World Down Syndrome Day will be officially observed by the UN, following the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly in New York in December 2011. The Australian government co-sponsored this very important resolution. On",175,Constituency Statements
262,Mrs Elliot (Richmond,"Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (09:39): I rise today to this day, Down Syndrome International encourages supporters and friends all over the world to choose their own themes, activities and events to help raise awareness of what Down Syndrome is, what it means to have Down Syndrome and how people with Down Syndrome play a vital role in our lives and our communities. I would like to speak about a young woman in my electorate who plays a very vital role within our community. Her name is Shona Robertson, and she is actually in New York at the moment. Shona has Down Syndrome and she is one of the very few advocates from around the world who have been chosen to address the United Nations. We are very proud of Shona. She said that her message will be: 'Everyone deserves their own rights and opportunities. It's about people with Downs living in a real community. It's a free country, people should be able to do anything they like.' Shona is truly an inspiration. She volunteers in my office and she is a wonderful addition to the office. She also works for the Gold Coast City Council. She comes into my office one day a week. She has a really strong work ethic and a strong commitment. She brings a lot of humour to the office and a lot of political advice as well, which we greatly appreciate. We love having Shona in the office. My staff and I find that she is a great addition and a great help to us. Shona lives independently in her own home. She is engaged to Andrius, which is very exciting; they are getting married soon. Her strong independence is attributed in part to the commitment of her parents, Derek and Penny Robertson. Penny is the chairwoman of the London-based Down Syndrome International. They both provide great support to Shona, which is fantastic. I would like to finish by quoting them. They provided a description about Shona and her life, and they said: Shona is happy with her achievements to date and considers a house, a dog, a paying job and a fiance as the right of any young woman of her age. How true that is. Congratulations to Shona on her remarkable achievement in going to New York, being able to speak about all of the great opportunities she has, and her achievements today on World Down Syndrome Day. Forrest Electorate: Busselton Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (09:42): I am proud to announce that my electorate of Forrest is home to Western Australia's newest city. The future of the city of Busselton shines very brightly. When Busselton officially celebrated its milestone on 21 January this year, I was very proud to attend that proclamation. The south-west is one of Australia's fastest-growing regions, and Busselton's city status is indicative of this. Located 220 kilometres south of Perth, new residents are attracted to Busselton by the magnetic pull of diverse employment opportunities, a family-friendly lifestyle, and one of the best coastal settings in the nation. As a destination for any sort of change-sea change, life change-that is what Busselton is. The city approved 522 new residential buildings in the last financial year, worth $170.7 million. A population prediction for Busselton released by the state government last month estimated that its current population of about 32,000 will swell to more than 55,000 in 15 years time. So people are going to keep coming. The city has not and will not rest on its laurels and is actively pursuing the title 'events capital of regional Western Australia'. City leaders and the community should be commended for making the city a cultural hub of sports, music and the arts. Residents and thousands of tourists enjoyed 82 events on the calendar last year, several of which I am very proud to support, including one called Art in the Park. Among the major events which draw thousands of participants are the WA Iron Man, which now attracts an international field, the Southbound two-day music festival, the CinefestOz film festival and the Busselton Jetty Swim around our iconic jetty. At 1,841 metres, the jetty is said to be the longest wooden structure in the Southern Hemisphere and the third-longest wooden structure in the world. The first section was opened in 1865 and it is a marvel that is still standing. It has been restored and now has an underwater observatory and an interpretive centre. It amazes me to think of what John Garret Bussel and his pioneering family would think of what their settlement has become since they opened up the Vasse region in 1832, only three years after the Swan colony was established. Bussel had seen the potential of the region, which has now come of age. Local industries now include tourism, viticulture, dairying, market gardening, manufacturing and creative industries. It also boasts a growing regional airport with the capacity for jet aircraft. Busselton is one of the oldest settlements in my state but it is also a youthful town with an average age of only 38 years. I hope that its current and future residents build on the wonderful success of the pioneers and thousands of others who have made it the attractive, vibrant city it has now become with a great future ahead of it. Kempsey District Hospital Redevelopment hospitals in this 43rd Parliament than ever before from the Commonwealth, lobbying is now in full swing within the mid-North Coast local health district for funding related to Kempsey District Hospital. It is technically outside the seat of Lyne but is one of a range of hospitals that service many people within the Lyne electorate and the mid-North Coast community. It is very much a partner in the hospital network between Port Macquarie, Wauchope and Kempsey in particular. This is an opportunity to advocate for funding support through the next round of the Health and Hospitals Fund for Kempsey District Hospital, which is a major contributor to community life within the Macleay and, as I have said previously, an integral part of the concept of one hospital on three sites-the relationship between hospitals at Wauchope, Kempsey and Port Macquarie; all within 40 to 45 minutes of each other. This is the only submission that has been put forward by the local health district to the Health and Hospitals Fund on behalf of these mid-North Coast hospitals. It has been submitted for an expanded redevelopment of Kempsey hospital. The money is going to include building costs, furniture and fittings, consultancy, surveying and engineering. The Health and Hospitals Fund was established in 2009 by the Australian government as part of its Nation Building Program and in this 43rd Parliament specific rounds for recognition of regional and rural capital works for hospitals have been an important part of this parliament with one more round to go. This is an application that is relatively unique. Normally communities fight each other town by town in communities on the mid-North Coast and North Coast of New South Wales-in fact, everywhere; everyone seems to hate the next biggest town-but this is an application strongly supported by key stakeholders from Coffs Harbour through to Port",176,Constituency Statements
263,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (09:45,"Thanks to more money going to regional and ruralMacquarie. Up to 60 key letters of support from stakeholders, who all agree that the redevelopment of Kempsey hospital is the No. 1 capital priority, have been received. I strongly support this application. It is needed for the broader health network, and I will do what I can to lobby and advocate for this successful application. I understand the round is being assessed now. Whether in the May budget or before, I hope there is success with the Kempsey District Hospital application. McPherson Electorate: McPherson Community Achiever Awards McPherson Community Achiever Awards which I hosted last year and am hosting again this year. It was one of my top priorities upon my election to each year acknowledge those exceptional locals on the southern Gold Coast who have selflessly given their time, energy and so much more to our community. These community achievers are individuals who contribute to the local area by giving up their own time to charities, churches, veterans' groups, sports clubs, surf clubs and various volunteer organisations. It is a great experience to have the chance to read the stories of our nominees and winners of these awards and understand exactly what they have achieved and done for others. Last year the McPherson Community Achiever Awards ceremony was held at the southern end of my electorate at the Currumbin RSL. At this ceremony I had the great pleasure of presenting 23 outstanding individuals with an award for their wide-ranging efforts in supporting the community in the areas of neighbourhood watch, surf lifesaving, Lions, veterans support, schools, supporting at-risk youth, sports, helping the homeless; seniors and aged care, as well as medicine. Each recipient of these awards received a certificate and a special medallion recognising their contributions to our community. I would like to acknowledge again each of those recipients: Merve Rose, Reverend Colin Batt, Joe Gates, Mark Goodwin, Les Brodie, Natalie Tree, David Smith, Aruni Abeywardena, Bobbie Matheson, Ian Grace, Katrina Casaclang, Marea Ryan, Ron Martinenko, Ena Slyp, Toula Singer, Cynthia Munro, Neville and Dulcie Free, Norma Wright, Violet Langan, Antoinette Badenoch and Phil and Doreen Barnes. This year, on 18 April, the awards ceremony will be held at the northern end of the electorate, at the Burleigh Waters Community Centre. Already there have been many nominations-they have been coming in thick and fast-and I have no doubt that the 2012 McPherson Community Achiever Awards will have more nominations and more recipients than we had last year. The nominees this year are again being nominated for a diverse range of community contributions and, to name several just briefly, these include volunteer work for Crime Stoppers Queensland, assistance with local ANZAC Day ceremonies, special needs education and, once again, surf lifesaving. Recognising the achievements of exceptional locals should not go unnoticed and I believe that, through the McPherson Community Achiever Awards, many of these individuals will receive the accolades that they well deserve. Clarendon Vale Child and Family Centre Ms COLLINS (Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (09:51): I",178,Constituency Statements
264,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (09:48,"I am very pleased to speak today about thewould like to talk about an opening that I attended in my electorate last Friday with our Premier, Lara Giddings. It was the opening of the new child and family centre in Clarence Plains, in Clarendon Vale. This wonderful project has been jointly funded by the Tasmanian and Australian governments. It is a $5.5 million project, with $1.5 million from the federal government and with the remaining amount from the state government, and it will provide parental support along with health and education services for young children. It is actually located in a hub next to the neighbourhood house and the primary school, so there is all this hub of activity for families and community members in the centre of what was previously broadacre public housing estates. It is a fantastic new facility providing some essential support services to local families, particularly early support systems. For instance, a mum who has a new baby that cannot sleep at night can go into the centre and can get some support during the evening and the night as they try to help their baby to sleep and get into a routine or pattern of sleeping. So it is important that these services are provided in local communities, such as this one, where transport to other services is normally a big issue, particularly and obviously at that time of night. It is a really important part of community infrastructure. Part of the funds also went to the refurbishment and relocation of the neighbourhood house, which I have had the real privilege of having an association with over many years of being a federal member. I am constantly impressed by the resilience and local community spirit of people in local communities and the work that they do, mostly on a voluntary basis, in trying to get some support for their communities and in trying to instil some pride in their local communities, which have traditionally really been up against it when it has come to other community attitudes outside of their local area. It is so wonderful to see these brand new facilities and to have a tour around them to see the cots and the children's play areas. It has just been fantastic. I am really proud to be part of a government that has committed this money to this wonderful project. As part of our commitment to that suburb and that area, we have also committed $3.5 million to an urban renewal program for the area which is about affordable housing lots for private people to buy into the local area at a reduced cost. All of the works are being done with federal government money and then the land is being sold to private people to build on. So it is great to see that mix of all that public and private and social housing that is now in that community and the wonderful local facilities. It is all making a real difference to the way the community feels about itself and, more importantly, the way that people outside of the community view that local community. It is really terrific to see. I want to really congratulate the local council, the state government and those volunteers that have been working so long and so hard on the consultation process to make sure that they got the right facilities in their local community. (Time expired) Bennelong Electorate: Pollie Pedal event, sponsored by a great Bennelong business. The annual Pollie Pedal is a cycling event started in 1998 by several federal and state politicians, led by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. The purpose of Pollie Pedal is to raise money for a variety of charities whilst at the same time providing the opportunity for many small regional communities to meet with members of parliament. The Pollie Pedal has raised nearly $2 million for organisations such",179,Constituency Statements
265,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (09:54,"I rise to speak about a great Australian charityas the Poche Centre for Indigenous Health, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Ronald McDonald House, Youth Insearch and the Paralympic Games, as well as funding towards medical research into childhood leukaemia, diabetes, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Pollie Pedal 2012 will commence this Sunday in Geelong and conclude in Canberra one week later. Funds will be raised for Carers Australia, the national peak body representing Australia's 2.6 million carers. In the Bennelong electorate there are 2,300 recipients of carers allowance, yet thousands more provide care to the people they love without recognition or financial support. The primary sponsor of Pollie Pedal is Amgen, the multinational biotechnology company that has its Australian headquarters in North Ryde. I congratulate Amgen's Managing Director, Ian Thompson, and Executive Medical Director, Dr Mark Tennyson, for their unflinching generosity and support for these great causes, and also the many community programs they run in and around Bennelong. I will be delighted to visit Amgen on Friday to launch the Pollie Pedal coinciding with the National Ride to School Day. I will also be visiting Meadowbank Primary School to celebrate these two events and promote messages of health, fitness and preventative medicine. Amgen employ approximately 17,000 people worldwide, including 160 people in Australia, marketing eight products and generating domestic revenue of around $210 million. Amgen Australia invests between $30 million and $35 million in local research and development each year, which is amongst the highest contributing countries to clinical trial activity across Amgen's divisions worldwide. Just last year Amgen Australia conducted 74 different clinical studies at over 390 sites involving about 1,200 patients trialling their innovative medicines. With a nod towards yesterday's condolence motion for Jim Stynes, Amgen has currently announced a world's first clinical trial to treat a form of brain cancer known as AMG 595. Approximately 1,400 Australians are diagnosed with malignant primary brain tumours each year, a statistic that brings us back to the dire need for carers in our society and the generous commitment from both Amgen and the Pollie Pedal to raise money and awareness for this great issue. Petrie Electorate: National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (09:57): I rise today to congratulate the students and teachers of Southern Cross Catholic College at Scarborough, who on Friday joined with me in standing up and saying 'No way!' to bullying in our schools. On Friday 740 students and 55 teachers of Southern Cross Catholic College, along with Bracken Ridge McDonald's owner Ron Chiapello and I, dressed in orange T-shirts to represent ending bullying in our schools and took to the sporting fields of Southern Cross Catholic College to support the National Day of Action against Bullying and Violence. This national day, implemented by the Labor government, is about raising awareness of the impact that bullying has on kids and taking a stand against it. Friday was an important opportunity for schools, parents and local communities to come together and say, 'We will not tolerate bullying in our schools, online or in our community.' Too many of us know the serious impact bullying has on the safety and happiness of our kids and the lasting impact it can have on them well into adulthood. We know that one in six students is bullied weekly and one in four students is bullied at least once over a period of a few weeks. Furthermore, research by Edith Cowan University, which looked at students between year 4 and year 9, revealed that around 10 per cent of school students are bullied most days. These statistics are horrifying. As adults we would not tolerate this sort of behaviour in the workplace, and I believe strongly as a parent and in my role as the federal member for Petrie that our kids should not have to go to school every day, every week, afraid of what is waiting for them when they get to the bus stop or when those lunch bells ring. I would like to read a quote from a student leader of Southern Cross Catholic College, Captain Brittney Govender, who, when asked about bullying at her school, said this: It would be naive to say bullying does not happen at our school, but we wanted everyone to be reminded that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter what our differences are. Brittney is right. Our kids should not have to tolerate bullying in the playground, online or anywhere else because everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. As a government, Labor has worked hard to address these issues that go to the core of who we are and who we want to be as a nation. I believe Australia is a nation of tolerance, acceptance and diversity, and these core values begin in the home and in our schools, where the experiences of our kids shape the adults and leaders they become. Labor is working with the states and territories to implement the National State Schools Framework, which will support schools to take a proactive approach to developing safety and well-being policies such as addressing bullying and cybersafety. We have already launched the Cybersafety Help Button-a free desktop application for kids which provides information about counselling services, reporting abuse and dealing with online risks such as cyber bullying-on top of committing $125.8 million over four years to develop the cybersafety plan. In closing, I would like to especially thank Southern Cross Catholic College principal Greg Myers; Majella Thompson, from Southern Cross Catholic College, for her outstanding support and assistance in bringing the event together on the day; Bracken Ridge McDonald's owner Rod Chiapello, who always goes above and beyond in the fantastic work he does; and school captains Ravneel Sharma and Brittney Govender. I would like to say a special thank you to Daniel Szabo, a year 12 student who approached me a week and a half ago wanting to take action on bullying.

Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",180,Constituency Statements
266,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke,"Order! In accordance with standing orderto which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give further consideration of the bill and of the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 until after the Government has tabled for the bills a Regulatory Impact Statement which has been assessed by the Office of Best Practice Regulation as compliant with its requirements."" and how advisers obtain the renewal notice in relation to their ongoing financial advice. The bill also provides additional grace periods if a client inadvertently opts out by not responding to the renewal notice. The disclosure notice is an important supplement to the renewal requirement and supports fee transparency. It includes fee and service information about the previous and forthcoming 12 months and assists clients to understand whether they are receiving a service from their adviser that is commensurate with the ongoing fee that they are paying. The measure is about the focus being on the client and what is in the client's best interest. Advisers need to ensure that they are in regular contact with their clients if they are charging them regular fees-not unreasonable. Not only is this a fair thing for the client but it is also professional best practice. There has been a lot said about the cost that this measure will impose on financial advisers and, with this, a variety of estimates of the cost. For advisers, on a pure fee-for-service basis-that is, per hour or piece of advice-the renewal measure will impose no cost whatsoever. Secondly, the bill enhances the capacity of ASIC to supervise the financial services industry and protect investors. Providers of financial services must be licensed by ASIC as part of facilitating investor confidence that those persons are competent and of good fame and character. Licensees also have representatives who act on their behalf. ASIC has powers to protect the public, including applying a variety of administrative remedies against a licensee or its representatives that breach the law. During the PJC inquiry, ASIC raised concerns about its ability to protect investors by restricting or removing unscrupulous operators from the industry. A number of factors were impacting on the exercise of ASIC's powers, including decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating to when someone will breach the law; the difficulty with removing individuals, given the focus on licensees in the Corporations Act; and the lack of scope for ASIC to remove licensees in certain circumstances such as where they are not of good fame and character. The changes include the PJC's recommendations and will strengthen the gatekeeping function of the licensing regime and extend ASIC's power to remove unsatisfactory persons from the industry. The changes to the licensing and banning thresholds include that ASIC can reduce or cancel a licence or ban a person where that person is likely to contravene-rather than 'will breach'-the law. ASIC may also remove representatives if they are not competent and of good fame and character or if they are involved in the licensee's breach of the law. The changes generally align the thresholds for licensing and banning with similar provisions under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, which ASIC also administers. As with the exercise of any administrative powers, an ASIC decision will be based on the individual circumstances of each case but would generally take account of factors such as the",182,Bills
267,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (10:01,"As I was saying, there is flexibility as to whennature and seriousness of the misconduct, the internal controls on the licensee or the person and the previous regulatory record of the person. Existing review rights in relation to ASIC decisions about licensing and banning continue to apply, including to the AAT. These changes should result in ASIC exercising its administrative powers more efficiently and effectively to protect investors. In summary, the measures in this bill support the key public policy objectives of FoFA to improve consumer trust and confidence in the financial advice they receive, and to improve professional standards. As I said at the outset, it is not unreasonable, in my view, that if you are going to charge a fee for a service then you get permission for charging that fee. If you have conflicts of interest then you should disclose those conflicts to those people to whom you are providing a service. Finally, if a person's life savings are at stake then the government and the advisers should tread with great care. On these principles the proposed bill succeeds and I commend the legislation to the House. of Financial Advice) Bill and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill of 2011. These are important bills because they go to an issue that affects the community at large: the ability of people to provide for their retirement. There is no doubt that one of the principal channels that enable people to provide for their retirement is well-informed advice over a long time about what they should be doing with their money to best equip them to live as comfortably as possible for as long as possible. In that respect, financial advice and the responsibility that financial planners have to their clients is tantamount. Good government policy should create an environment that maximises the opportunity for people to obtain good advice and that ensures there is in place a legislative framework with appropriate safeguards to ensure that consumers-the clients of financial planners-are not adversely affected by, for example, conflicted remuneration. In this respect I think it is important to deal with the fact that historically in large this has been an issue with in many respects bipartisan support, with the bona fides of all sides of government and opposition to deal with the issue. In 2011 the former coalition government made a whole host of reforms with respect to financial planners and financial advice. I had the good fortune, as a very new member, of sitting on the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in the latter stages of that round of reforms, and hearing from an array of different stakeholders in the industry who provided their input about the reforms that the coalition was undertaking then. There has, of course, been much water under the bridge since then. One of the biggest issues that have afflicted the world since then is what is referred to as the global financial crisis, the GFC. There is no doubt that the GFC shook to their core very many people in Australia-literally millions-and around the world hundreds of millions of people, if not billions, who thought they were approaching an age when they would be well equipped and well established to live a life in retirement drawing down on the funds that they had set aside for exactly that purpose. The GFC has seen significant erosion in asset values and in returns from financial investments. This has raised the level of anxiety, not only in the Australian community but",183,Bills
268,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10:06,"I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Futureglobally, among people who thought that they were well equipped for their retirement but now find themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars short. This is coupled at the same time with a very real erosion of government ability to provide pensions to what is a growing, ageing population. These two events have culminated, effectively reaching a crisis point in many countries, where there is an inability of the state on the one hand to provide for their citizens in a way that many citizens thought they would be and on the other hand an erosion of the very real balance that people had provided for their retirement. At that point it is little wonder that there has been a very high level of scrutiny on the financial planners who are working in the community and who are ideally partnering with their clients as they undertake life's journey by providing for their retirement funds. Mindful that that is the context in which the community finds itself looking at the issue of the advice provided by financial planners and mindful that there is a requirement for financial planners to provide good advice-not conflicted advice, but bona fide advice-that does ensure that the clients' needs are met by the investment protocol that they take, there has been a further round of analyses, examinations and now recommendations to ensure that financial planners do the best things by their client. In 2009 the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll, undertook as chair of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services an inquiry into what was happening in financial planning. It was commonly referred to as the Ripoll inquiry and it looked very closely at all the issues that I have just touched upon. It examined the best legislative way to ensure that clients had the best opportunity to match their investment profile with their particular needs. Obviously the needs of someone who is 55 years of age, has a paid down mortgage and has adult children who have left home would be radically different to a person who is 25 years of age and maybe recently married-someone who is at the very beginning of the journey of paying down their mortgage and someone who might be expecting to have children in the foreseeable future. The needs of both of those clients are very different stages of their lives, but ultimately they culminate at the point where they are hoping to be in a position at their retirement where they can live a comfortable and well-funded existence, one that ideally does not need to draw upon taxpayer support and one that ensures that those people can have an adequate retirement they are comfortable with. Mindful of those differences, it is crucial that financial planners know their clients and are in a position to provide advice that accord with their respective needs. The Ripoll inquiry looked at this in great detail. Importantly-and this is perhaps the most significant point-the inquiry found there was not a legislative lacuna; there was not a problem with the regulations and the legislative framework that applied to financial planners, where there were examples of failure of financial advice for clients. Rather the Ripoll inquiry found that the problem was that there were financial planners who operated outside of the legislative parameters and did not do the right thing by their client. There was not a problem with the legislation or the regulation, rather there was a problem with those operating outside it-in other words, the issue of enforcement. That is not to say that the system was perfect, but just to say that there was no glaring or obvious example of widespread failure in regulatory oversight. That notwithstanding, the bills before us today attempt to address some perceived shortcoming in the financial legislation and regulatory oversight such that a raft of new regulatory burdens will be imposed on the financial planning industry at the behest of this particular government, at the behest of this particular Labor minister and on the basis of the arguments put forward-that is, it is in clients' interests. It is the coalition's view, and I certainly subscribe to this, that this is simply not the case. The Ripoll inquiry, I would remind the chamber, was headed by a Labor member. The Labor member in that particular example did not find a massive shortcoming in regulatory oversight. One of the principal and most contentious initiatives that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation is undertaking is the decision, through legislation, to enshrine an opt-in provision. This is an example of massive regulatory overreach. This is an example of bad practice when it comes to red tape and additional compliance burden on the industry. Optin will require clients, on a regular basis, to opt back in to obtain financial advice. In other words, financial planners will be required to constantly go back to their clients to encourage or ask them to sign back on with them for a further period. Where did this idea come from? We know that opt-in does not apply anywhere else in the world. We know that opt-in was not a recommendation of the Ripoll inquiry. Perhaps a bulk of submissions to the Ripoll inquiry said that opt-in would be one of the panaceas to ensure good financial advice. The reality is that that is simply not the case. Only one submission dealt with opt-in-and that was from the Industry Super Network. The Industry Super Network was the only group that called for opt-in. And, lo and behold, the minister for trade unions, the minister with a strong backgroundappropriately. You will use hisreasonswilling to use my 15-minute chuck from the chamber. Find his right title or we may sit you down. services. He is the person who took the decision that opt-in was in the best interests of financial planners and their clients. It is, to say the least, farcical. This particular requirement will significantly add to the red-tape burden that financial planners face. This significant initiative will add a great deal of extra complexity and extra burden on financial planners. It is not just the financial planners; it is also their clients, who will now be constantly harassed to re-sign with financial planners. But it is more than that. There is the implementation date that the government is attempting to roll out. This again underscores the shambolic and, I would argue, incompetent manner in which the government has approached these particular reforms. The minister seeks to have these reforms commence on 1 July this year. That is less than four months away. The notion that we could have such significant reform to a sector, commencing in four months, is ludicrous. For some time the coalition has been calling for the reforms not to commence until 1 July 2013, which incidentally aligns with the introduction of MySuper, knowing full well that rolling those two out concurrently provides maximum opportunity for a more thorough",184,Bills

272,Mr Ciobo,"For protocol reasons I will refer to the minister as the minister for financialapproach to be adopted by industry and more time for systems to be put in place. But, again, the government has not listened. The government insists that 1 July this year will be the start date. I note that, because of the widespread angst in the financial planning community about the consequences of the government rushing headfirst into this and trying to do it within four months, the minister has now indicated that there will be, to use his words, a 'soft launch' of the reforms on 1 July-whatever that means! I believe that the minister has foreshadowed that there will in fact be, as part of this soft launch, further legislation that comes into the parliament in the winter sittings to deal with this issue. An area on which we can agree-I will touch upon this and conclude on a good note-is the implementation of best interest duty. It is the view of the coalition-and we support the Labor Party on this-that the implementation of a fiduciary duty with respect to the relationship between financial planners and their clients is a positive step forward. We note that the financial planning community itself agrees with this point. It is good that we have consensus. It underscores the bona fides of the coalition in arguing the case that, where good policy is rolled out, we will support it. Where good policy can be implemented, we will not stand in the way; we will do what we can to assist. For that reason, we think decisions to implement the best interest duty is a step in the right direction. That said, of course the devil is always in the detail. In that respect, the first exposure draft that outlined the provisions that would apply to the best interest duty were convoluted and it was not clear to industry or to consumer advocates how it would work. There will be impacts as well with respect to the opportunity for scalable advice-that is, a need for clients to not have to adopt a whole-of-life plan if a client does not want that. If a client goes to a financial planner and seeks only to have financial advice on one discrete area, the coalition's view is that it is ludicrous to argue that that should not be available. We think it is without basis to say no, that it should only be on a whole-of-life basis, on a know-yourclient basis, to such an extent that effectively you achieve overservicing as a consequence of the government's reforms. My final point is with respect to regulatory impact assessment. We know the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation said that they did not have adequate information to determine whether the FoFA changes and their impact on business and consumers were appropriate. We think that is a great shame. We are committed to less red tape. We are committed to less complexity. The reality is that the amendments the coalition have put on the table are good amendments that should be supported by the government, recognising not only that these are going to be appropriate safeguards for consumers but also that the sector should not be unduly and inappropriately burdened with additional compliance costs. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (10:21): Following the contribution from the member for Moncrieff, I also rise to stand up for my constituents in Brisbane and speak on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. These bills are the latest exhibits in the 'how to totally destroy the process of reform' presentation being put on by the Gillard government. I have many financial services practices in my electorate that employ many thousands of people. Many of them are small and medium financial businesses. I have received an enormous amount of correspondence about these bills. Overwhelmingly, the feedback from the industry has been hugely critical of these bills. An email I got from Mr Brian Mallon, a financial planner in Ascot, says: This bill, as currently drafted, will have a catastrophic impact on my business and that of many, small, independently owned, financial planning firms like mine, that cannot afford the additional and unnecessary administrative burden this legislation will demand and will place the cost of obtaining professional and objective advice from an independently owned adviser, out of reach of the average Australian family. Another email from a planner in the CBD states: After advising for 30 years can I say, the proposed reforms will remove financial planning advice away from ordinary Australians and make it unaffordable. I can advise the House that to date I have not received one positive piece of correspondence supporting these bills-not a single, solitary positive letter supporting these bills. Ms Hall interjectingMs GAMBARO: The member opposite can argue with me all she likes, but the coalition believe in a strong and vibrant financial services industrywill be silent. Ms Hall interjectingMs GAMBARO: This is hurting them. They know that these bills are flawed. They know that these billsMs GAMBARO: I am happy to stick to the script. These bills are a shambolic set of bills. The coalition believe in a strong and vibrant financial services industry and we made improvements to ensure this when were in government. However, we recognise that in any industry and in any regulatory structure there is always room for improvement. But the way the government have gone about trying to reform the financial services and financial planning industries leaves a lot to be desired. If implemented in their current form, these changes will hurt industry, jobs and consumers in my electorate of Brisbane and across the nation. In particular, the small and medium financial services and financial planning businesses will suffer the most. As a consequence, we can only support these bills if they are amended appropriately by the government accepting the coalition amendments. Australia is renowned for a number of things. One of the things it is really renowned for is having one of the best financial services industries in the world. A lot of credit must go to the former Howard government for this. According to analysis-not by me but by the Parliamentary Library-the financial and insurance services industry accounts for 9.7 per cent of GDP and employs about 418,000 people nationwide. In Queensland alone, 66,600 people are employed in this very vital industry, and I believe a large majority of them would live or work in my electorate of Brisbane. The genesis of these bills stems from the Storm Financial collapse and the desire to find out what went wrong and find ways to prevent the terrible catastrophe. The parliament then asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct an enquiry, which was chaired by the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll. This became known as the Ripoll inquiry, which reported back to the parliament in November 2009. This report",186,Bills

274,The Deputy Speaker,"The member for Brisbane should stick to the script.made some very, very sensible recommendations and provided a plan for reform which the government could have implemented-again, with bipartisan support. It is interesting to note that one of the findings of the report was: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations. However, as per usual, the government allowed the FoFA reform package to get hijacked by vested interests and instead decided to introduce new regulations as opposed to enforcing existing ones, as the Ripoll inquiry stated. These bills were introduced into the House and referred to the Joint Committee for Corporations and Financial Services which received submissions, held hearings and handed down its report. The coalition members on the committee handed down a dissenting report. I must commend all the coalition members of that committee, and in particular the shadow minister, Senator Cormann, for the superb job they did on that committee and the comprehensive report that they produced. One of the key outcomes of the inquiry was the concern from many, many stakeholders regarding the excessive regulation that these bills would impose on the industry. They will make Australia the world champions in red tape for the financial sector. Through the opt-in, best practice and fee disclosure requirements in these bills the regulatory costs to industry have been conservatively estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars. What Labor members have never understood is that more regulation on business means that those costs are ultimately passed on and borne by the end users, the consumers. In fact, the Office of Best Practise Regulation noted to the committee that an adequate regulatory impact statement, or RIS, was only provided for one of the proposed FoFA changes. At one of the committee hearings Mr Jason McNamara from the OBPR stated: separate RISs in that area. But we found those RISs not yet adequate. They had not met the best practice requirements. Senator CORMANN: … My question is: why? we would pass. So here have these expert witnesses providing this incredible evidence to this committee. But what happens? That is unacceptable, and the government should ensure that regulatory changes of this magnitude go through the proper process and comply with the requirements of its own Office of Best Practice Regulation. But it is not doing that. NowI turn to the opt-in provisions of these bills. The opt-in requires all clients and financial planners and advisers to re-sign their contracts and engagement paperwork every two years. Given the amount of paperwork and documentation required in this process it is a huge regulatory burden on the industry. This measure alone is estimated to cost between 100 and $120 per client per annum. So a very small financial planning firm in my electorate, which might have, say, 500 clients, will bear an extra $50,000, some of which-or most of which-will be borne by the consumers. There are also penalties that apply if a payment is received after 60 days if the re-signing has not occurred. The much better option would have",188,Bills

276,"Mr Mcnamara: In Regard To Those Riss, Essentially The Impact Analysis Was Not At A Standard That","been the opt-out model, where it would mean the clients take the proactive step to terminate the relationship with the advisor and would eliminate the possibility of a client not responding to requests to re-sign because they are too busy and therefore accidentally terminating the relationship. It is very interesting to note that there is only one submission to the Ripoll inquiry that advocated for opt-in, and that was the Industry Super Network, ISN. It is not a recommendation from the Ripoll inquiry and was rejected by almost every other stakeholder. It is quite ridiculous that this massive increase in red tape should then be included in the FoFA reforms. But we know that the ISN is a resting ground for former union officials, so I guess this demonstrates once again how the relationship between the Labor government and the union movement can adversely affect government policy. Compounding this is the fact that there is not one other country around the world that has this sort of requirement. There were repeated requests put to Treasury during the inquiry into these bills and they could not point to any other example were opt-in has been successfully introduced. All it does is create unnecessary regulation that will not add one iota to the quality of the advice received by consumers. These bills also put in place a requirement for advisors to produce an annual fee disclosure for clients every year. We support this in principle; however, we do not support the making of annual fee disclosure retrospective. A practical example of this is a constituent of mine who runs a very small financial planning business out of his home in Clayfield. He has approximately 350 clients. He has advised me that with the opt-in requirements and the annual fee disclosure requirements he will have to employ another person to deal with the extra administration that this bill will impose on his business. So that is an extra $60,000 a year that this small business in my electorate is going to have to cop. And of course he is going to have to pass that extra burden onto his clients. The second concerning area of these pieces of legislation is the definition surrounding the 'best interest duty requirement'. The coalition supports the introduction of a statutory best interest duty for financial advisers; however, it is really important to get the drafting and the definitions right. It is very clear that the government has failed to come up with an appropriate definition for what is 'best interest duty'. One wonders how it will in fact police this. The coalition also have serious concerns around the catch-all provision contained in section 961B(2)(g). The Law Council of Australia has also raised serious concern about this clause. We believe that the best interest duty should be amended to permit clients and their advisers to agree to limit the scope and subject matter of the advice. These bills also ban what is known as the 'conflicted remuneration'. The coalition supports the banning of conflicted remuneration structures such as product commissions, and we commend the industry for taking proactive steps to abolish such structures. However, I do wonder what the point of it is when the best interest duty and the annual fee disclosures already ensure the appropriate and ethical conduct of financial advisers. I am not sure how conflicted remuneration will impact that best interest requirement and vice versa. These bills also put a cap on the amount of non-monetary benefit that can be received by an adviser from a product provider. An example of this might be the product provider taking an adviser to the rugby, to dinner or to the races et cetera. The current drafting and the explanatory memorandum indicate that this limit is an aggregated amount of $300 per company, but we believe it should be $300 per adviser. The bill and the explanations should reflect this. I also note the concerns by the tourism industry, the timeshare industry, which will be caught under the conflicted remuneration provisions of these bills. I hope that the government will adopt the recommendation contained in the main report of the committee to exempt or carve out this industry from the requirement. In conclusion, these bills are an exercise in reregulation. The way to keep an industry strong is not to regulate the life out of it. Our financial sector did not become one of the best in the world by bearing the burdens of excessive red tape. The industry and many constituents in Brisbane will be hurt by this bungled reform. The government need to go away and start again or, at the very least, amend these bills, addressing the points I have just mentioned. Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 as well as on part 2 of this compendium, the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. These bills are intended to be the culmination of the reform process, kicked off following the Ripoll inquiry into financial products and services. They deal with such matters as introducing a requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of clients; banning conflicted remuneration such as commissions, volume payments and soft-dollar benefits; requiring advisers to obtain client agreement to ongoing advice fees; mandating greater disclosure of fees; and giving ASIC greater powers. In the time that is available to me, I want to make three points. Firstly, the key recommendations of the Ripoll report are uncontentious. To the extent that the bill adopts the uncontentious recommendations, we welcome them. Secondly, this bill, somewhat surprisingly, includes many changes which were not canvassed in the Ripoll report and they appear to be there largely because they were asked for by the Industry Super Network. Given the very cosy relationship between the parliamentary Labor Party and the industry super fund sector, the minister appears to have been very eager to respond to the policy agenda of the Industry Super Network. Thirdly, the implementation arrangements for this substantial package of reforms are hopelessly impractical and, once again, reveal that we have a government which has, amongst its key figures, people with virtually no experience of the practical complexities of running a business. Let me turn firstly to the point that the key recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry are uncontentious. We are all agreed that the financial services and advice industry provides a very important service, helping Australians with their financial health and well-being. We also know that there have been some very unhappy episodes in recent years with the collapses of companies like Storm Financial, Trio and Westpoint. Emerging from these collapses, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services was asked to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services. The inquiry reported in November 2009. In the view of the coalition, the recommendations of the inquiry, in the main, were well considered and are sensible. The key recommendation, the centrepiece recommendation, is to introduce as a matter of law a fiduciary duty for financial advisers, requiring them to place the interests of their clients ahead of their own. It is very interesting to note that the inquiry did not recommend the introduction of a large and detailed set of complex new regulatory measures. Quite the contrary, the inquiry in its final report",189,Bills
277,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (10:36,"I am pleased to speak on the Corporationsspecifically noted that it was not an absence of regulation that was the problem, rather an absence of enforcement. Let me quote: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations. There was a very clear direction from the Ripoll inquiry that the solution to the problem was not the introduction of a complex new superstructure of detailed, prescriptive microregulation. This brings me to the second point I wish to make to the chamber. There are very detailed regulatory changes contained in the bill which were not canvassed by the Ripoll inquiry at all. Let me mention three of them: retrospective fee disclosure, banning of commissions for insurance inside superannuation and what are colloquially known as the opt-in provisions. The retrospective fee disclosure provisions impose a requirement to introduce additional annual fee disclosure. The important point to note is that clients already receive regular statements provided by financial services product providers. There is now to be an additional requirement to produce an annual statement. It was initially understood that this would apply to new clients, those who became clients of the financial services adviser or provider post the implementation of the legislation. But at a late stage it emerged that the intention was that this requirement would apply to all clients. This greatly increases the cost and complexity of implementation. If a product is 10, 15 or more years old, the consequence of this measure is that there will be a need to open up the legacy IT system which supports that product. As anybody who has had any exposure to IT systems in large corporates would know, that is always a risky, expensive and deeply fraught process. This is a regulatory measure which imposes substantial costs for very little public benefit. It is entirely typical of the kind of thing this government does again and again, because this government, the Rudd-Gillard government, is composed of people with zero practical private-sector experience. Naturally the last thing it would ever think about is the complexities of implementing updates to a sophisticated information technology system. I turn to the question of the banning of commissions for insurance inside superannuation. Many people choose to obtain life and income insurance, and total and permanent disablement insurance, through their superannuation fund. It is a cost-effective way to obtain this important insurance because they are able to pay with pre-tax dollars. Typically they do this based upon advice from a financial adviser. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, on which I serve, heard from the Corporate Super Specialist Alliance, which comprises financial advisers who specialise in this area. They had this to say: Our major concern is that CSSA members will not be able to be remunerated for the work they perform once FoFA is implemented, as commissions are to be banned on both Superannuation investment and Group Insurance within Superannuation. There is no proposed model for fees to be charged for services provided on a group basis, and we believe that this needs to be addressed. This measure will effectively discouraged the operation of an existing and proven distribution channel under which many people today are educated about the most cost-effective means to obtain insurance-that is, via their superannuation fund. Given that Australians are seriously underinsured, what is the possible policy logic for a measure which is likely to reduce rather than increase the number of people taking up insurance via superannuation? The third area that I want to focus on is what is colloquially known as 'opt-in'-that is, the requirement contained in this legislation for every financial adviser to obtain written confirmation from a client every second year that he or she still wishes to retain that adviser. In substance, this is a restriction on all Australians, who are now to be barred by law from contracting with a financial adviser on terms that the contract stays in place until such time as the client determines otherwise. Instead, they will be prohibited by law from contracting for more than two years. This is an extraordinarily intrusive burden being placed upon both financial advisers and those wishing to retain financial advisers. It has been done at the request of only one organisation, the Industry Super Network, which is the lobby group for industry superannuation funds, the biggest of which is the $43 billion Australian Super. ISN provided to the original Ripoll inquiry the only submission arguing in favour of opt-in. It is very interesting to reflect on the cosy ties between the parliamentary Labor Party, Australian Super and the Industry Super Network. The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, who has carriage of this legislation, is a former director of a predecessor organisation of Australian Super. So are two other current members of the Labor Party, Minister Combet and Senator Cameron, as well as the failed Labor candidate for Melbourne in the 2010 federal election, Cath Bowtell. So it is perhaps not surprising that this legislation is so responsive to the specific agenda of the big industry funds. But in so doing this legislation will bring substantial harm to financial advisers and their clients. Let me give two examples, provided to me by a financial planner in my own electorate. He told me of a client, in his mid-60s, who had just retired. When the adviser called his client for the annual review, the client said that his focus was on competing in the Bosphorus cross-continental swim between Asia and Europe. All his efforts would be going into training for that swim and that that would be his personal focus for a long period. He did not want to be distracted by his finances. He asked the adviser to manage his affairs, as he had been doing for some years. Only after the swim had been completed did the client want to come in for a more formal review. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this period of training, given the nature of the swim, extended to more than a year. As a consequence the adviser was essentially left with carriage of the client's affairs throughout that period. Under the proposed FoFA opt-in rules, contained in this draft legislation, the financial adviser would have been barred by law from doing this, even though it was his client's specific request, because the consequence would have been that he would have gone for more than two years without seeing the client. Let me give a second example, provided to me by the same financial adviser. He has a client who is in her early 50s, who has recently been divorced, moved cities and changed her job. To compound her troubles she was then diagnosed with breast cancer. She called her financial adviser and gave him very clear instructions. She did not want to worry or even think about money for the foreseeable future as her only focus, which is perfectly understandable, was on dealing with her cancer and getting through it. In the end the cancer turned out to be a severe one. The surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and then other complications took some two years to work through. If the opt-in rules had been in place the financial adviser-my constituent-would not have been able to respond to his client's specific request. This is a disgraceful piece of policy. It is a transparent attempt by the big industry funds, on a competitive basis, to nobble independent financial advisers, and it is disgraceful that this government has agreed to it. In the brief time that is available to me I wish to point out that yet again, as with just about everything this minister brings forward, the implementation arrangements are a complete mess. They are hopelessly impractical. The consistent theme from every stakeholder in the financial services sector to whom I have spoken over the last six months-and I have spoken to a very large number of them, because they come and see people who are members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services-is that the implementation time frame proposed by Minister Shorten is wholly unrealistic and completely fails to understand the complexity of the task of refreshing and updating the very complex IT systems that are required to support products which may have several hundred thousand or even millions of customers. This is compounded by the fact that the FoFA changes were originally intended to take effect from 1 July 2012, and the MySuper changes, which affect the same group of stakeholders and involve another major round of IT changes, were due to take effect from 1 July 2013. It is true that just last week the minister at last saw sense and announced that the implementation of the FoFA measures will be voluntary until 1 July 2013. But it is quite extraordinary that it took him until 15 March this year, slightly more than three months before the implementation date, to make this announcement. In the meantime, financial institutions have been facing huge pressures as they have tried to devise IT change programs without even knowing what their precise legal obligations are going to be. Even with this decision, the time frame that has been allowed is highly unrealistic. In conclusion, the original recommendations in the Ripoll inquiry are widely accepted, but this bill expands greatly beyond those original recommendations and it is hard to avoid the suspicion that a key objective in this bill is to advance the agenda of one section of the superannuation industry. The interests of those seeking financial advice have come a distant second. (Time expired) comments of the member for Bradfield, who obviously is in touch with his electorate on this matter. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011. This bill has been widely anticipated by the industry but is considered with increasing concern. What should have been a considered approach to preventing potential financial disaster for this government has turned into nothing more than an attempt to destroy an entire industry while rewarding union mates for their support of the Labor Party. If this is the future of financial advice, then the future is pretty grim. The original intent behind this bill was commendable. It was necessary. The Storm Financial collapse during the global financial crisis was a huge blow to the industry and an absolute financial catastrophe for the families who lost their life savings. In some cases, seniors lost all their life savings and their family home and are now in debt. What happened with Storm, with Trio and with Westpoint provided an opportunity to review the industry and an opportunity to create a regulatory framework to prevent the same thing happening again.",191,Bills
278,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (10:51,"I associate myself wholeheartedly with theThe unfortunate outcome we have is the result of a Labor government with absolutely no understanding of any business or any industry and which is completely out of touch with the real world. At least, I hope that is their excuse, because the alternative reason is that they have deliberately constructed legislation that will condemn an industry to the scrap heap and condemn low-paid Australian families to a poorer financial future. Under the pretence of preventing situations like Storm, the Labor Party have managed to throw the baby out with the bathwater. As baby boomers transition to retirement, the government have focused more and more on encouraging individuals to take responsibility for their own financial future and retirement. That being the case, we have millions of Australians in need of financial advice to ensure they get the best value out of their savings. They are not financial experts; they are plumbers, welders, receptionists, farmers, miners and perhaps even doctors and lawyers. Any regulations introduced today will deny these people access to expert financial advice or make it unaffordable, or even less affordable. It is a direct hit on the hip-pocket of tomorrow's retirees. There was originally some good intent behind this legislation, and I hope those opposite will appreciate the benefits to all Australians of the amendments to this bill that the opposition are proposing. If the government just come out and say no to those amendments, as is their custom, they are admitting that the damage they are doing to the industry and to the future of Australian workers is actually intentional. An attack on the financial advice industry is an attack on professional people who provide an important service. There has been considerable regulation of this industry already and what we are looking at with these amendments are regulations for the sake of regulation. They do not serve a purpose other than making life difficult for individuals and the industry. I invite this government and any members considering supporting this bill, or planning to vote against the coalition's amendments, to ask themselves a question: what are we doing this for? If the bill does not make the industry better, if the bill does not protect people from disasters like Storm Financial, then why are we interfering? If we fail to identify what went wrong and if we fail to create regulations to prevent things like the Storm collapse happening again, all we are doing is killing off an industry. That is much worse than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. As Martin Lambert, a local in my electorate from Stamford Financial in Mackay, says, 'The proposed changes would not have prevented things like Storm.' So this is actually throwing out the baby and keeping the bathwater. This situation arises because the government refuse to listen to advice from the industry. This is what happens when the government's actions are driven by their need to do anything but what is advised, what is needed and what is proven to work. Why would the government take the recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry and throw them out the door? One of the key recommendations from the Ripoll inquiry was: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulation, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations. The Ripoll inquiry tells us that new regulations are not the answer. More red tape is not the answer. More onerous regulations that grind business to a halt and drive Australians away from getting expert financial advice is not the answer. We in this place find ourselves-and the Australian people generally-asking the same question, again and again: How do the government manage to get things so spectacularly wrong? It boils down to the same old thing: they refuse to listen. They have taken the recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry, which on their own were worthy of support, and they butchered the entire blueprint. This government has deleted the good bits, changed what was left and then added some rubbish to produce the most negative outcome it could possibly contrive for the financial industry. One of my constituents, Nigel Thomas, from Avalon Financial Services in Mackay, likened the process to the transformation of Medusa in Greek mythology. Medusa was a beautiful maiden and priestess in Athena's temple. She attracted many suitors but her tryst with Poseidon caused the jealous Athena to transform Medusa's beautiful hair into a crown of snakes and made her face so ugly that onlookers would turn to stone. Mr Thomas points out that this is what is happening with financial planning. He writes: Once a beautiful thing, which attracted many suitors (advisors) to the industry to assist with clients' needs, FoFA now seeks to transform the industry to something less attractive to advisers to practise and more difficult to access for most people, creating a generation with ill-informed financial understanding. Unfortunately, the government has allowed this process to be hijacked by vested interests who stand to benefit from making the industry as ugly as possible. Part of this bill is designed to ban commission on risk insurance. I can understand imposing a ban on conflicted remuneration, such as product commissions in the financial services industry. But commission on advised risk insurance is a different kettle of fish. The Ripoll inquiry did not say to ban these. I wonder why there was an inquiry in the first place? This ban would increase costs and remove choice, making people worse off, especially small business owners who manage their own superannuation. This measure is nothing more than a means of distorting the market in favour of the superfunds and industry superfunds. In effect, this regulation encourages people to enter into risk insurance, inside superannuation, with no advice. This regulation discourages people from getting expert advice. I received a letter from another financial adviser who points out the effect that the ban will have on the industry. Mark Dunsford writes: The Labor Party is making a deliberate push to get money into union funds by deliberately legislating through ridiculous reforms. After advising for 30 years, can I say, the proposed reforms will remove financial planning advice away from ordinary Australians and make it unaffordable. The massive underinsurance problem we have in Australia will not be remedied by removing commission from the product. The is 99 per cent of our clients still want us to be paid via the product, rather than writing out an additional cheque. Another financial adviser, Brian Mallon, put it a little more bluntly, saying the proposed legislation was: … a thinly veiled corroboration between trade union controlled industry superannuation funds and the trade union controlled federal government to create, for the Industry Superannuation Network (ISN) a monopoly in the superannuation industry. Similarly, Mark Kerr does not mince his words in telling how it is. He says: It does absolutely nothing towards protecting investors but goes a long way in giving a 'free kick' to the Minister for Financial Services' buddies in the union movement and the industry super funds. It is interesting to note just how much weight the Industry Super Network actually carries with this bill. The network provided the only submission to the original Ripoll inquiry that argued in favour of opting in, and that inquiry rejected the proposal-rejected it! The government, despite being unable to cite an example anywhere in the world where this kind of regulation actually exists, went against the expert advice to introduce a mandatory requirement for consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial adviser on a regular basis. This move defies all logic and smacks of another grubby deal between a grubby government and the union grubs that they answer to. The union based super funds know that forcing this red tape down people's throats will encourage them not to opt in. The government knows red tape will encourage people not to opt in. The people know it also and they are desperately waiting for the opportunity not to opt into another term of this government. Mike Goggan from Australian Capital Financial in Mackay told me: The opt-in is insane; in my opinion this will be the decline of the financial planner-adviser industry, which will cause a bigger under-insurance problem than exists now. There are three more areas of this bill that I would like to focus on. The first is about implementation. The bill sets out an implementation date of 1 July 2012-that is about 100 days from now. Given that we are only now starting to debate this bill, and knowing that passage through this place and also the other place will take some time, we are looking at a very tight lead time. I might provide some assistance to the government by pointing out what should be obvious-and this is why it keep stuffing things up: if you let a bad government implement bad policy, you can expect bad outcomes. When you do all this in a rush, you are destined for disaster. Poor government and rushed implementation is what gave us the pink batts debacle, with houses burning down; the school halls fiasco, where tuckshops cost a million dollars or more, and a long list of other spectacular failures. It is almost as if this government is in a hurry to see what it can stuff up next. The people who work in the financial advice industry are the next ones who will pay the price of a bad government in a hurry to stuff things up. The working families who will be denied the benefit of expert financial advice are the ones who will pay the price of a government desperate to ignore sound, expert advice that it itself sought. If this government had the slightest bit of business nous it would move to delay the implementation by a year to align with the changes to MySuper. Another point on timing is this bill's requirement for retrospective fee disclosure statements. There is no benefit to be derived from this whatsoever. It was not recommended by the Ripoll inquiry. It was not part of the consultation process. It was not even in the government's plans until the last minute. According to the Financial Services Council, the cost of fee disclosure statements will be $54 per new client and $98 for existing clients, for no benefit and on no-one's advice. What is the point of having a consultation process if the government is just going to make things up on the spot? The final aspect of this bill that I would like to address is the introduction of a best interest duty for financial advisers into the Corporations Act. While I do believe that looking after the best interests of the client should be a matter of course for any service business, I have no problems with the concept being enshrined in legislation. Unlike other components of this legislation, the best interest duty can be introduced without a huge cost and without the introduction of huge amounts of red tape. However, there is some scope for improvement. The coalition is concerned about the uncertainty for clients and advisers that would be created by the catch-all provision in clause 961B(2)(g). Removal of the clause would improve the introduction of the best interest duty provisions. I would like to make one further comment on how this bill could be altered to provide better outcomes for people. With reference to what happens in the real world-what real people with real financial situations actually need-financial advisers must be able to offer scaled advice. The current wording of the best interest duty does not allow financial advisers to offer a specific service that the client needs at an affordable price. It should not be necessary to provide a full financial plan if a client neither requires it nor can afford it. To avoid putting expert advice out of reach for many families this legislation should allow advisers to limit the scope of their advice to a series of discrete areas identified by the client. These are concerns that have been raised with me by financial advisers, many in my electorate of Dawson. They include people such as James Wortley from Magnitude Financial Planning, Damien Arboit from Progressive Wealth Solutions, Kim Evetts from Whittaker Macnaught, Gareth Hall from Lifestyle Financial Services and Kerry Neyland from RBS Morgans. If the government were serious about genuine reform it would be listening to these people, it would be listening to the industry. If the government were serious about genuine reform it would address all of the participants in Storm, including ASIC, the banks, the insurance companies, the producers of investment products, the fund managers, the investment industry, accountants, auditors, the legal profession and research houses. This is the very advice that was given to the Minister for Financial Services but it simply was not taken. Perhaps the minister should have chosen to opt in on that advice, on what people were telling him, for the sake of this industry but also the sake of the government's own credibility. (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the related bill. When I first saw this bill I thought it was an oxymoron, or an interesting juxtaposition, for a Labor government, with its current handling of the economy, to be trying to give financial advice. Look at the financial advice given by our Treasurer when it comes to trying to forecast deficits and surpluses. You need look back no further than the MYEFO documents for 2010-11, when the Treasurer forecast a $12 billion deficit. And in the budget papers last year he forecast a $22 billion deficit for the same period, and that was recently adjusted to a $37 billion deficit. So, this government has no credibility to advise the financial services sector on how they should best be conducting their operations. The coalition cannot support the future of financial services bill in its current form. However, the legislation can be significantly improved if the government accepts a series of amendments to be moved by the coalition. Only when those moments are supported will the legislation be worth supporting. As it currently stands, the bills are unnecessarily complicated. They are likely to cost about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million annually to comply with. Most significantly, they are likely to cause an increase in unemployment as the burden is put on the financial sector. For Australians seeking financial advice it will mean increased cost and decreased choice. Could anything be more Labor than that? You can see it in most of the bills that come through this House. It is about extra layers of bureaucracy and compliance. It normally has an associated price tag which at some time is going to come out",194,Bills
279,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (11:05,"I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendmentof the pockets of mums and dads. This is just another example of how Labor does its business. The coalition will be moving a series of amendments which will require: most importantly, that the government table in the parliament regulatory impact statements assessed as compliant by the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation; that the opt in be removed from FoFA; that the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement also be removed; that the drafting of best interest duty be improved; that the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and that implementation of FoFA be delayed until 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper. These are good and necessary reforms and I urge both the minister and the members of the crossbench to support them. The financial services and advice industry provides an important service helping Australians with their financial health and well-being. In doing so, financial services providers deal with other people's money, which is why it is important to have an appropriate, robust regulatory framework in place. Quite obviously the goal of any legislation affecting this sector should be to balance effective consumer protection with access to high-quality financial services that are both accessible and affordable. Subjected to stress-testing of the global financial crisis, the Australian financial services industry performed well overall. While there is no doubt that Australian financial services reforms, legislated in 2001, provided a solid regulatory foundation for the industry there is always room for improvement. However, in pursuing regulatory change, the parliament needs to focus on making things better, not just making them more complex and more expensive. One of the things we must avoid is regulatory overreach, where additional red tape increases costs for both business and consumers while providing little or no additional consumer protection benefit. In the wake of the global financial crisis there was a number of high profile collapses of financial services providers across Australia-the well-documented Storm Financial situation in North Queensland, Trio and Westpoint are cases in point. Following on from those collapses, it was important for policy makers to assess what went wrong and what we could do better in the future to prevent-or at least minimise the risk of-such collapses occurring in the future. This is why in February 2009 the parliament asked the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australia's financial products and services. That inquiry, known as the Ripoll inquiry, reported back in November 2009 and made a number of well-considered and reasonable reform recommendations. The centrepiece of the Ripoll inquiry was the recommendation to introduce a fiduciary duty for financial advisers requiring them to place their clients' interests ahead of their own. The report's recommendations provided a blueprint the government could have adopted with bipartisan support. One of the key observations of the Ripoll inquiry was: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Instead of implementing the recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry, the Labor Party allowed its Future of Financial Advice reform package to be hijacked by vested interests. Over the past two years there have been constant and completely unexpected changes to the proposed regulatory arrangements under FoFA, right up until the introduction of the current legislation. Invariably, this was done without proper appreciation or assessment of the costs involved of any unintended consequences or of implications flowing from the proposed changes. Important reforms have been delayed by more than two years so the government can press ahead with a number of contentious issues. In pursuing regulatory changes, government must rigorously assess increasing costs and red tape for both business and consumers. It is incumbent on the government to conduct a proper regulatory impact assessment to a standard which is consistent with its own best practice regulations requirements. According to the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation, the government did not have adequate information to properly assess the impact of FoFA on business and consumers or to assess the cost benefit of the proposed changes. This is highly unsatisfactory, given the complexity and the costs associated with contentious parts of the proposed FoFA changes. Furthermore, the current implementation time frame of 1 July 2012 is completely unrealistic, given that the proposed commencement date is less than four months away. It would make more sense to implement FoFA and MySuper simultaneously. These two major changes require significant changes to the same financial services provider of IT systems. It is symptomatic of the government's chaotic approach to this area and its lack of understanding of practical business realities that it seeks to impose two different implementation dates involving significant and costly system changes in relatively quick succession. The coalition believes that these bills, if amended, should not commence until 1 July 2013. Opt-in imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. This is a significant increase in red tape and costs for both planners and consumers. It will make Australians world champions in financial services red tape. We will lead the world when it comes to red tape within the industry. Opt-in was not part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations and it is important to note that the only submission to the Ripoll inquiry which argued in favour of opt-in came from-guess wherethe Industry Super Network, which is top heavy with Labor's union mates. More often, we are seeing legislation put through this House that has union fingerprints all over it. It is also important to note that the Industry Super Network proposal for a mandatory opt-in requirement was not accepted by the inquiry. The government have been unable to point to another example anywhere in the world of a government that has sought to impose a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. With the best interest duty in place, appropriate transparency of fees, charges and an ongoing capacity of clients' financial advisers to opt out of any service relationship at any stage, the coalition believe there is adequate consumer protection without the need to impose additional costs and red tape for both business and consumers. The Ripoll inquiry made no recommendations to introduce an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided by financial services product providers to their clients. Retrospective fee disclosure adds absolutely no additional consumer protection benefit and it will almost certainly cost. In the FoFA consultation session, it was the industry's clear understanding that the government's proposal to impose an additional annual fee disclosure statement would be prospective-that is, it would only apply to new and not existing clients. The Financial Services Council estimated that implementation of the fee disclosure requirement will cost approximately $54 per client prospectively for new clients and $98 retrospectively for existing clients. This is yet another example of a very poor and deeply flawed consultation process engaged in by the government in relation to FoFA. The government must be held to account for the commitment it made during the consultation process that these additional annual fee disclosure requirements would apply prospectively only. The best interest duty is an important central part of the FoFA changes. The coalition support the introduction of a statutory best interest duty for financial advisers under the Corporations Act. However, to avoid confusion and minimise the risk of future disputes, it is important to get the drafting right. It is obvious that the government have struggled to come up with an appropriate definition of best interest duty. The version of best interest duty was included in the draft exposure of what became the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011, but was hastily removed from that version of the bill when it was ultimately introduced into the parliament. The current version of the proposed best interest duty included the subsequent second FoFA bill and it is certainly an improvement to the version, including the exposure draft. However, the coalition remain concerned that the catch-all provision contained in clause 961B(2)(g) will create uncertainty for both clients and their advisers. We therefore recommend that this clause be removed from the best interest duty. One of the ways to ensure that clients are able to access affordable financial advice would be to allow advisers and their clients to limit the scope of the advice to a series of discrete areas identified by the client rather than to mandate a full financial plan in everyone's case. This concept of focusing advice on areas specifically identified by clients has become widely known as a scalable service. Numerous submissions to the committee expressed concern that the wording of the best interest provisions in the proposed legislation does not allow for scaled advice to be provided. The legislation should allow the provision of scalable advice where the request for such limited or scalable advice is instigated by the client. This would allow many people to access advice more frequently and it would be a very good starting point for clients to seek financial advice for the first time without being required to undertake a costly and sometimes unnecessary complete financial plan. The coalition will amend the best interest duty to explicitly allow for clients and advisers to contact for such scalable advice. The coalition committee members support the banning of conflicted remuneration structures such as product commissions within the financial services industry and commend the industry for moving proactively and effectively to abolish such conflicted remuneration structures. However, we do not consider that commissions paid on advice on risk insurance, they may be within policies or individual policies outside superannuation, are conflicted remuneration structures. We agree that the Australians who receive automatic risk insurance with their super fund without accessing any advice should not be required to pay commissions. However, those Australians who require and seek advice pursuing adequate risk cover, whether inside or outside of the super fund, should have the same opportunity to choose the most appropriate remuneration arrangements available to them. colleagues who have covered many of the issues that I will touch on. One of the reasons that I was keen to make a contribution to this debate is that, in my travels as the shadow minister for",198,Bills
280,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11:20,"I rise to support the very eloquent comments of mysmall business, financial advisory businesses right across the continent have expressed outrage at the nature of some of the changes proposed in the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and related legislation. Their input in consultation processes has been ignored at best and, in some cases, the government has chosen a pathway that directly opposes the considered advice that the small business financial advising community has provided to government. Another point is that, wearing my hat as the shadow minister for consumer affairs, while these bills masquerade as being of advantage to consumers they actually provide a number of risks for consumers that the government has not properly considered or evaluated. The idea about proper evaluation and assessment is an excellent starting point for a debate on this legislation. The government proclaims widely that it has outstanding regulatory impact processes. I have listened to and read carefully the accounts of world's best practice, which is the statement made by the department of finance and its officials involved in the Office of Best Practice Regulation. Some of the action steps that agencies and departments are expected to go through seek to address what the legitimate alternatives are for addressing that public policy problem, and evaluate how effective alternative courses of action would be and what the costs are in implementing those changes. That is a worthwhile decision support framework. It is such a shame that this whole package of measures has progressed without any great connection to that very worthwhile decision support framework. At the heart of the coalition's objection to these bills is that there has not been a proper impact analysis, a regulatory impact statement, tabled for these bills. They have not been evaluated against the Office of Best Practice Regulation benchmarks and requirements as compliant. For those reasons alone this legislative package is poorly conceived. It has not been properly considered. It appears to many, me included, as a knee-jerk reaction to the very devastating impact of the collapse of particular investment vehicles-Storm and Opes Prime are some that are regularly referred to-where in reaction to the financial losses that many incurred the government seems to think it has carte blanche to do whatever it might think it wants to do. What it thinks it wants to do seems to be overwhelmingly skewed to advance the interests of union controlled industry superannuation funds. There appears to be no other justification for some of the measures that are contained in this bill. Even, as my colleague the previous speaker referred to, in the consultation process absolutely nobody was advocating for some of the measures that are in this bill except for the MySuper industry superannuation group. Apparently, on the strength of just one self-interested advocacy group, the government thought that was a good enough reason to go with what they wanted and ignore all the other submissions about why some of the proposals they are contemplating are not well conceived and actually run against the interests not only of the consumers and investors but also many of the small business advisory firms that have established a very positive reputation amongst their clients and that know that, if they are not providing value for money, the clients will go somewhere else. SoI do not know why we are here debating things such as the opt-in requirement, one of the most pointless bureaucratic interventions that no-one thinks is a good idea, save and except the superannuation industry network. Not even the government controlled Ripoll inquiry thought it was a good idea. I hope Mr Ripoll, who is now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, has some influence within Treasury over the direction of these changes and that the so-called future of financial advice is grounded in the considered work of his committee and the very sound recommendations that earned bipartisan support. I say that for a number of reasons. Firstly, they were well thought through. They were not contrived to advantage a particular sector of the financial advice industry-that is, the industry superannuation funds. They were also tested by a rigorous process of committee inquiry, of hearings, of evaluation, where the parliament as a whole could bring forward a bipartisan report that would give confidence to people involved in this industry that there was not going to be some unilateral change to the arrangements under which they operate. By going down the pathway the government has with this legislation, they are far from building confidence and certainty in the financial services sector because they are actually pursuing changes that no-one else seems to think are a good idea. At some point down the track either Mr Ripoll in his new role within Treasury or, if there is a change of government, an enlightened, pragmatic, evidence based evaluation of these changes is likely to see them changed again because they are not well developed and they have not been properly evaluated. Look at some of the things that have happened.. Let us look at the global financial crisis. There were some very high-profile cases of investment vehicles hitting the wall and that represented extreme financial hardship for those investors. A number of those investment vehicles were by their very nature more vulnerable to the changes in the global economy and the impacts of the GFC than others because they were offering returns at rates more attractive than other investment options and the risk-return ratios were understood by most. But when hardship arises that is a very difficult time for all involved. My heart goes out to those people who have seen their life savings and their investment nest eggs dissolve through the GFC. Overwhelmingly, the Australian financial services and advice industry stood up very well during the GFC. It stood up very well because of the changes that the previous Howard government had put in place. So you look at the carnage in investment value and in wealth destruction that happened around the world and, whilst we had some setbacks, they were nothing of the scale experienced by virtually any developed Western market in the world. Mr Van Manen: They had nothing to do with the advice. provided-as my twin brother and my friend and colleague interjects, and I thank him for that interjection-nothing to do with the quality of the advice. If you are going to handle or address these public policy concerns in a sober, evidence based way you should actually look at what the causal factors are of the hardship that you are hoping to avoid-what is the evil you are hoping to address? To understand what has caused it then gives you an insight into what action you might need to take. This whole package is free of that analysis and instead we see some propositions that the government cannot even defend themselves because they are so incoherent. The coalition again puts forward the framework that was agreed through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services which said these things should not go ahead in their current form. It said that they lacked some key characteristics that would represent a positive",201,Bills
281,Mr Billson,"Those changes also had nothing to do with the advice that people werestep forward for the industry and for the investors that rely upon the advice that they are given. They represent a great deal of red tape and compliance imposition for no good reason. I recall my travels to Gladstone. I had a nice flight up there to meet with all the financial advisers in Gladstone. There is a community providing quality financial advice to a number of people not only to the immediate Gladstone community but to quite a lot of fly-in fly-out people and other people earning quite staggering incomes in the mining sector. So the quality of their advice is very important in setting up those people for their future. They all came to me and said, 'Bruce, this opt-in idea: where on earth did that come from?' I was able to point to the industry superannuation funds. The collective groan in the room said to me: 'Well, that'd be right. Here's another regulatory and red tape imposition championed by a very narrow section of the financial services sector to advantage its own interests.' They described to me the example of someone who had been out on a mine for three or four weeks and would fly into Gladstone. They had some time to themselves or they might want to catch up with family and friends. They walk into their place of accommodation and find a mountain of mail you could not climb over. They described to me the things that person would be looking for. Imagine that you are that person: would you be looking for the bills you have to pay? Probably, so you can make sure the phone was not cut off and the power was there. You might look for one that has a sweet scent; that one might be a note from your sweetheart. But if you saw something from your financial adviser, would you know what it was? Given the relationship you have with your financial adviser, who is servicing your interests well in an open and transparent way, you might think this was probably another newsletter with the latest update on what the government is mangling in another area of the policy. That could be it, and you would probably think: 'Gee, I see enough of this dysfunctional and divided government. I'm back and I don't want to be depressed even more about government incompetence affecting my interest and the national interest.' So you put that to one side. You might then have a lovely few days in Gladstone: you might do some fishing or you might catch up with your sweetheart. You might just go about your life and then fly out again without looking at the letter from your financial adviser. Under these changes, that would be: uh-oh, end of relationship, because you have not opted in again. You have not opted in again because you were bewildered by the burden imposed on you and your financial adviser, even though your relationship has served you well, is open and transparent on fees, the quality of advice and the frequency of engagement and makes sure that your interests as an investor align with the advice being provided by your adviser. Then suddenly, because you have not sorted out some bureaucratic renewal within a 30-day period, the relationship is over. What happens then? What happens with the advice that you hoped you might get while you are out at the mine site? What happens with your investments? This is just one very practical example where this is likely, according to some in the industry sector, to cost $120 per client. It will eat away at their investment nest egg for no good reason and to no demonstrable benefit. If you look at other areas you will see that certain products with trailing fees and the likeeven where they were entered into with full knowledge by the parties involved-will be prohibited under these changes. What will you do? You will have to change them, get out of them or have those arrangements restructured. I read an impassioned plea from a small business financial adviser who points out that not only is he 'being branded a hellraiser out to pillage their clientele because of events involving Storm and Opes Prime over which they had no influence whatsoever', he is 'somehow being victimised and used as a scapegoat for consequences that weren't any of their making'. That is how he starts his presentation to me, and I think he is right on the money. He goes on to talk about what would happen with the trusted relationship he has where, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out-the key tenet is 'no surprises', is how I would characterise it-the advisers are acting in the best interests of the client, there is transparency in the fees, there is an understanding of what support is being provided for those fees and the client can opt out whenever they choose. They can just go if they are not happy. What is wrong with that? Instead we have this very odd set of recommendations. We also have an example where the government is failing to address the impact not only on small financial advice businesses, but also on consumers. On the trail ban that is being proposed: what happens if you have a client who is in such a product but now cannot be? You will have to go to that client and say, 'I'm sorry, even though you fully understood what you entered into and what the cost structures are, even though the product may be performing very well for you and regardless of what any industry superannuation fund advocate may be stating, you have to hop out of it.' What is the cost of exiting that product, of having it restructured or of trying to materialise the asset value, which you know has taken a hit through the GFC? You would do your money. So in this example, the recalibration that will be needed if you are a Centrelink client, the risk to your capital of materialising a gain or loss, the fact that there may be costs involved in shifting into another product, all seem to have not been taken into account by the government. This is why these bills should not proceed. The industry is not supportive of them and most fair-minded people looking at the measures cannot see a connection between then and what the government proclaims it is trying to do. The lead-up time frame is too short, there are too many uncertainties about the detail of these reforms and the financial services industry is wary of the government that has blamed them for plenty, even though it has not been their responsibility. They deserve to be taken more seriously. (Time expired) Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (11:35): I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and cognate bill. The financial services and advice industry is an essential service of the modern era, protecting and enhancing the financial health and well-being of millions of Australians. For people planning their retirement or supporting their children's future, good financial advice is often on a par with shelter and energy as a basic requirement. In this time of global economic volatility, this service has proved to be even more important to Australians seeking to better manage financial risks at the same time that they seek to maximise those financial opportunities. Australia, as the member for Forde would be aware, may well be a physical island but it is definitely not a financial island. For instance, the instability in Europe in particular means that investors and financial advisers alike are watching the markets extremely closely so that they can provide that advice. Given that financial service providers effectively deal with other people's money, it is important that we have an appropriately robust regulatory framework in place to provide effective consumer protection-and we do have so. As we heard from the shadow minister, that is the case. It is because of the work done by the previous coalition government in 2001. The dual purpose of protection and promotion comes with the need to ensure that financial advice is not only high quality but also readily available, accessible and affordable. We should not lower standards of service; however, it is important not to price it beyond the means of every day Australians-those who are struggling and working towards financial independence. The House should note that most of these investors are not, as the government seems to claim at times, billionaires-those who are so demonised by the government. Most investors are hard-working aspirational Australians. They could be individuals, they could be small to medium business owners from all walks of life and all backgrounds, including as I said those raising their families and needing to invest in safe but productive investments. In so many cases they are simply self-starting small business people not relying on superannuation alone to get them through. They can see clearly that average superannuation, given the time they entered the workforce, will not be enough to sustain them in later life. Investors are also retiring small business owners who have sold their businesses, be it a cafe, a retail store or a farm. People are prepared to live off those assets in their later life. And it does include that very important group that the government does not value, the self-funded retirees. It is these people who literally save the government millions in pensions and who save and work for their own future. They also need to be considered in this discussion today. The shadow minister for finance, Senator Cormann, met a group of financial advisers in my electorate when we were discussing the implications of what the government was planning. They are extremely concerned. Like so many other financial advisers in the industry, they act in the best interests of the client. They provide long-term professional services. There may be some who do the wrong thing but what they do know is that trust is critical. Financial advisers in my electorate know that they are in a regional area where clients can vote with their feet any day of the week. If they do not like the quality or level of the advice, if they are not satisfied with it, they can literally walk out the door and find a new financial adviser. Clients do two things: they walk and they talk-and this is particularly relevant in rural and regional areas. I would say to any financial adviser: word of mouth circulates very quickly in regional communities. Financial advisers in my part of the world are very well aware of this, but they are determined to act in the best interests of their clients. Their clients often become their friends, people they care passionately about. So they want to provide quality, effective and affordable advice, and their service reflects this. Under this legislation, if one of my constituents fails to complete a renewal notice in the 30-day period, they will now be left without financial advice. That is where they will find themselves. We have heard the shadow minister for small business talk about the fly-in flyout workers and where they will find themselves. I have over 5,000 of those in my electorate. For these people and others-ordinary people, farmers, people in small business, people living in rural and remote areas and even just very busy individuals-that 30-day period carries extreme implications. For instance, if you happen to do your accounts once a month, where could you be left? For small to medium sized business owners, the 30-day period has some pretty significant implications. One of the key observations of the Ripoll inquiry in 2009, which the coalition committee members continue to support, was: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulationsthat needs to be stipulated strongly in this Houserather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations. That is why I really support the concerns of the opposition. The legislation in its current form is unnecessarily complex, and this has been articulated quite strongly in this place. In large parts, it is unclear. We have heard that articulated. Nobody knows what is ahead-how it is going to work. It is expected to cause increased unemployment in the sector and is legislating to enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst most advice providers, inappropriately favouring a government friendly business model-the big players. It is likely to cost about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum to comply with, according to conservative industry estimates. We have suggested some amendments, and I support those. They are sensible in trying to improve what the government has put before us. We will move that the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement, something that has not happened. It is just extraordinary that you would introduce a bill of this nature and yet there is no regulatory impact statement. Mr Van Manen interjectingMs MARINO: As the member for Forde says, it is a breach of the government's own requirements. It needs to be assessed by the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation. We will move that the 'opt in' be removed. We know the problems with opt in. We will move that the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement also be removed. We have heard from the shadow minister just what this is going to do in practical terms. We will also move that the drafting of the best interest duty be improved, that the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined and that the implementation of FoFA be delayed to 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper. Should the government not agree to these amendments, I fear that it will be even more apparent that the primary consideration of the Labor government with this legislation is to increase the union management-the industry superannuation funds. Unfortunately it will be apparent that that is the driving force behind the government's agenda with this legislation. The parliament should note the current debate about openness and accountability in superannuation funds. I think we would all remember who said, 'Let the sun shine in.' That is not what we are seeing with this bill and it is certainly not what we are going to see with the failure to provide a regulatory impact statement. The Financial Services Council, which represents retail super funds, has proposed new policy which requires boards of super funds to appoint an independent chair-they are out there on the front foot-and to have a majority of independent directors defined as those not employed by the company or the fund. These are sensible proposals. The proposals would also require the disclosure of directors fees and wages of senior management and would prevent directors from holding multiple directorships in different super funds-very practical and sensible recommendations. Retail funds will apply these rules, but I wonder whether industry funds will do the same. Will industry funds apply the same level of accountability and transparency? It may come as a shock to the many union officials supported by industry super funds, but it really should be a minimum standard for accountability, and we will see whether that prevails. I ask the House to note the recent case of the power struggle between the New South Wales and Victorian branches of the Electrical Trades Union. According to the Australian, the Victorian boss of the Electrical Trades Union, Dean Mighell, is suing ETU's New South Wales head, Bernie Riordan, to reclaim more than $1.8 million in fees Mr Riordan allegedly received while serving on four boards connected with their superannuation funds. It would appear that Mr Riordan's ETU annual wage of $133,000 plus super was allegedly supplemented with as much as $264,625 a year in board sitting fees. The dispute allegedly is that according to Mr Mighell the board sitting fees should be funnelled back into the union coffers instead of Mr Riordan's. That is what is happening with regard to some of the sitting fees, which does raise some questions about the content of the bill before us. We will see what the government genuinely intends. The Australian financial system, including the value of financial advice, was tested, as we have heard, during the 2008 global financial crisis. In that time of extreme stress, the Australian financial services industry did perform overall very well. Quality advice and timely advice was provided to people at that time. That in no doubt was due in part to Australia's financial services reforms of 2001 that provided such a solid regulatory foundation for our financial services industry. I believe that was well recognised around the world. Not that we should be resting on this because there is more that can and should be done, and we are seeing the industry getting on the front foot and taking even greater responsibility. Our focus should be on improving the process not adding more complexity, more cost and more red tape, because this will amount to higher costs. We know that Australia is already overburdened by regulatory red tape and that results in increased costs for both businesses and consumers, and often for little or no additional consumer protection benefit. As we know, these bills are supposed to be as a result of a number of high-profile collapses. As the member for Forde frequently says, it was not as a result of advice. I know that the reform recommendations from the Ripoll inquiry to introduce a fiduciary duty for financial advisers require them to place their clients' interests ahead of their own. Whilst the current bill seeks to address this, it does so in a clumsy and heavy-handed manner. Unfortunately, this seems to be a constant theme of this government: to find the wrong answer to whatever question and issue is before the parliament or the government. I note that the Ripoll inquiry observed that the committee was of the general view that a situation where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice is more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations rather than regulatory inadequacy. This goes back to the heart of the issue: advice and regulation. I repeat: where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequence of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulation. That was what was said in the Ripoll inquiry. The wider community, including financial advisers, agree with the principle of applying a best interest duty, and if those financial advisers whom I meet in my electorate are not doing so on a consistent basis then their clients can and do walk out of the door and go to an alternative source for that type of advice. (Time expired) (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the cognate Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I join with my colleagues in making it very clear that the coalition will not support the bill as it currently stands. My colleagues have gone",203,Bills
282,Mr Morrison (Cook) (11:50,"I am pleased to speak on the Corporations Amendmentinto great detail as to the failings of this bill. BeforeI similarly do so, I think it is important to acknowledge what is really at the heart of these measures that are being put forward by the government. The government and the Labor movement have always been interested in closed shops. The government have always sought to vilify those who have a difference of view-to vilify them in their statements, to demean their motives in the public view and to basically drive them out of being in any form in competition with their preferred business model. It is no surprise that the unofficial head of the union movement, the current minister responsible for industrial relations, decided-I suspect demanded-that he retain responsibility in his portfolio for these matters. There is an absolute, unequivocal linked agenda in the union motives of the Labor Party between superannuation and industrial relations more generally. This is an industrial issue for the union movement, being led by their key industrial advocate in this place, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This minister is pursuing the unions' agenda not only in his own portfolio of workplace relations but also in this matter, as he did previously when he was Assistant Treasurer. The coalition has always seen through the government's motives. We have always seen what they are up to and I think the Australian public is also seeing this. What we are standing for here are some basic principles of choice, some basic issues of transparency and a lack of complexity which will enable Australians to make good choices and decisions about where they want to put their money for their retirement. We want to enable them to have the support and advice to do that in a way that helps them make those decisions, not to have the government impose those decisions on them by default and without any other alternative. Whether it is the government's decision to try to channel more money into industry funds, forcing businesses to pay for additional superannuation by increasing the levy, or whether it is at the other end by narrowing the funnel to ensure that all of those moneys flow into uniondominated funds, that is the agenda of this government. We need to bring that under the spotlight, it needs to be exposed and people need to know what the agenda is. The package of future of financial advice bills before us today is yet another example of Labor's corner-cutting and heavy-handed regulation. The coalition will not support these bills in their current form. This legislation could be substantially improved if the government were to accept the coalition's amendments and were willing to listen. As the bills stand before us today the package is unnecessarily complicated and convoluted. At best, these bills are obstructive and unhelpful. At worse, they threaten jobs, businesses and consumer choice. The regulatory burden they seek to impose will not afford greater protection. All this legislation will do is tie businesses and consumers up in red tape, strangling competition and choice while driving up costs. It will upend the level playing field our financial advisers have previously had, tipping the balance in favour of a government-friendly business model: the union model. Financial advisers help hard working people to better calculate and manage the risks they encounter and maximise their opportunities to provide for their own retirement. Advisers also play a very important role-as a business in my electorate has stressed to mein helping the vulnerable, including the elderly and the ill, to make sound financial decisions. I received a letter from a gentleman who lives in Sylvania Waters and works as a financial planner. He writes that 'our industry is based on trust and relationships-the trust is earned and then a relationship builds'. He makes the point that financial planners go above and beyond the call of duty to provide quality service and support to their customers, often investing additional hours of work that are not clocked. This is a fundamental issue that I think the government overlook. They overlook the bond of trust and the relationship and also the service that flows from that trust to the consumer. This is a value added service. It has a real value, it is valued in particular by those who demand it in their most significant time of need. The financial advisers I know turn up for their clients and go above and beyond the call of duty, above considering any payment they may have ever received, to honour the commitment and trust they have formed in that very special relationship. That trust is tested at the most difficult and strenuous time in their clients' lives, whether it is through the loss of a lifetime partner, whether it is through some horrific event that has caused that loss or whether it is a debilitating and tragic illness or something of that nature. At your weakest time you need to rely on someone to look after you and your interests and to ensure that what you have invested in will be delivered to you. Your advocate in that case is not some backroom bureaucrat whom you do not know-thankfully, if you have a relationship such as this-but is the financial adviser who has advised you, supported you and counselled you in a decision and is there to turn up to be your advocate when things are really required. I note the member for Forde at the table. In his professional life before coming to this place, I am sure the member for Forde could list any number of people-hundreds of people, if not more than that-with whom he has been able to establish that bond of trust. I know that is the same bond of trust that the member for Forde now has with his electors and constituents because he understands the issue of trust and I commend him for it. One of the clients of the man from Sylvania Waters who wrote to me is a lady with advanced multiple sclerosis. She is fiercely independent and still lives on her own but has to budget carefully to meet the costs of medicines that are not covered in her treatment. Shrewd economic management is very important to enable this lady to maintain her independence. My constituent's financial advice assists her greatly in that capacity. He told me: … the product will pay us-she can't afford to. We will be paid about $800. Currently I have spent six hours on this job and it will probably get to ten by the time. I am finished-my accountant would charge $3000 for this job. Of course, in these matters there are fundamental elements of trust involved. Advisers are paid to handle the hard-earned pennies of others and there must be transparency and accountability in all aspects of these processes. And it is critical that the industry continues to operate with a regulatory framework that is robust and accountable. But it is crucial that above all a level playing field is maintained for big and small businesses alike and for industry super funds and banks to ensure that competition can thrive, these important services can remain affordable and consumers can retain that all-important choice as to who they entrust with their money. I do not want to see the situation where someone who does not have the means to pay big fees upfront, to get the sort of advice they have been able to access for years, is denied that opportunity because of the passage of this bill. But I believe that will be the result. The bill before us today pretends to give consumers further protections by requiring advisers to act always in the best interests of their clients. Yet it falls short of achieving that very outcome. It is just another smokescreen for this government to cover yet another union agenda. Excessive red tape will only stifle business, driving up costs for operators, which will inevitably be passed on to customers. My constituent fears: FoFA reform is going to sanitise our great industry. Australians are already under insured and FoFA in its current form will worsen that position and make the ever increasing social security burden even greaterwhile at the same time, I note, driving up the value of the funds controlled by the unions. Another financial adviser in the shire agrees that without amendment: FoFA will cause financial ruin to many advisersand individual Australianswho have helped Australia survive to this point in tough global economic times, through their knowledge, skill and experience advising their clients to act rationally and not impetuously as the current Government has actedin the way it has spent taxpayers' dollars. The dual goals of FoFA should be to improve transparency and improve access to advice for all. The bill before us will not achieve either. In 2009, the Ripoll inquiry was conducted in the wake of the collapse of Storm Financial, Westpoint and Trio to identify ways that risks could be better managed. At the heart of the Ripoll inquiry was the recommendation that a fiduciary duty be introduced to require advisers to place the interests of the client ahead of their own. However, the committee also noted that situations: … where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. The report sketched out a comprehensive blueprint to enhance our financial services and the frameworks that govern them, a plan the government could have adopted with bipartisan support. But, instead, decisions on important reforms have been delayed by more than two years and hijacked by the union-dominated industry super funds. My constituent complained that the FoFA consultation process has been influenced by 'powerful institutions who only worry about this year's profit and their bonus'. The government has held off on sensible reform to bluster on with contentious changes like the Industry Super Network opt-in proposal. This treading water has only produced profound confusion, uncertainty and upheaval for our financial services. At the end of two years in the wilderness, the government has presented a cobbled-together package that manages to be both unnecessarily complex and vague. Evidence before the parliamentary joint committee inquiry into FoFA has confirmed the legislation in its current form will be detrimental to consumers, devastating for financial advisers and damaging for the industry. The government's explanatory memorandum to the bill itself admits FoFA will drive the loss of almost 7,000 financial adviser jobs. There will be reduced choice, reduced competition and reduced diversity across the sector. I suppose they are the objectives that the government are seeking to meet-and it would seem they are right on track. Industry estimates suggest that FoFA has a price tag of $700 million to implement, plus $350 million per year for compliance. Worryingly, the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation has given evidence before Senate estimates that the government has failed to properly assess the impact of the bills. Jason McNamara said the regulatory impact statements did not contain enough information about the potential impact and cost for the government to be able to make informed decisions, especially in relation to the opt-in proposal. The coalition does not believe it is unreasonable that the parliament should insist on a proper impact statement. It is imperative that regulatory changes of this magnitude go through the proper process. If the government is not willing to follow best practice of its own volition, it should be incumbent upon this place to insist upon it. The coalition has no problem supporting sensible and considered reforms that would bolster trust and confidence in our financial services industries. We value initiatives that increase transparency and competition and allow consumers the greatest choice. Unfortunately, these bills do not meet those objectives. I have met with financial planners in my own electorate of Cook to discuss this matter over the course of the government's process. They are understandably angry at the time it has taken since the Ripoll inquiry to make any headway, and even angrier with the tranches of bills that are before the House today. One said to me: If passed without amendment, FoFA will adversely affect all Australians and their choice, as is their democratic right to quality advice … and create a monopoly for advice because only the large financial institutions (Banks and Fund Managers) and Industry Union controlled superannuation Funds will be able to afford the cost of compliance and cheap advice. That is called creating a closed shop on these issues, something the Labor Party and the union movement have had at least a century of experience in doing. The concerns that advisers in the shire have raised with me centre around four components of these bills, and their fears have been echoed en masse by their colleagues across Australia. I will focus principally on one of them in the time remaining. The proposal of having to opt in every two years is troubling. There is no other country in the world where a government has sought to impose mandatory requirements on consumers to re-sign their contracts on a regular basis. They say there are two certainties in life: death and taxes. I would argue there is a third under this government, and that is increased compliance and paperwork. Ask anyone on the street; they will tell you the last thing they need is to have to wade through another mountain of paperwork every two years. We should not be turning small businesspeople into compliance officers for a regulation-hungry federal government. We should not be turning consumers into compliant drones of the Labor Party and their union dominated policies, which want to make their financial choices for them. That is why these bills should be opposed. of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. These bills seek to introduce a framework for financial advisers to ensure they provide Australians with accessible and affordable financial services and advice. The purpose of these bills is to require those persons who are providing personal financial advice to retail clients to act in the best interests of their clients and to give priority to their clients' interests. In addition, the bill applies existing regulatory mechanisms under the Corporations Act in a more direct manner to individual advisers as well as to licensees. Furthermore, the bill seeks to amend the Corporations Act to enact a ban on the payment and receipt of certain remuneration by those persons providing financial advice, where a potential to influence that advice exists resulting from certain financial products.",208,Bills
283,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (12:05,"I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (FutureThere are two bills making amendments to the Corporations Act to implement the FoFA reforms announced by the government in 2010. The first is the Corporations Amendment (FoFA) Bill 2011, which was introduced into the parliament in October 2011. Back in February 2009, the parliament asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services following a number of high-profile corporate collapses, such as Storm Financial, Trio and Opes Prime. The first bill seeks to improve the disclosure requirements in respect of fees and services connected with the provision of ongoing financial advice. Additionally the bill seeks to strengthen the powers of ASIC pertaining to financial advisers. Furthermore, this bill seeks to put in place a new obligation on financial advisers, which is that they are to act in the best interests of their retail clients and to put a future ban on conflicted remuneration structures. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services reported on these bills on 29 February 2012. In a dissenting report, coalition members of the committee discovered that Labor's FoFA proposals will unnecessarily increase red tape and the cost of financial advice and will reduce consumer choice and competition if passed in their current form. Coalition members of the parliamentary joint committee concluded that the FoFA bill in its current form is unnecessarily complex and unclear. The financial and advice industry is the provider of valued products in terms of a service which helps Australians to manage their financial health and well-being. Financial advisers assist by helping Australians through the mire of financial risk and seek to maximise financial opportunities. In reality, they deal with other people's money, which is why any changes in the financial and advice industry must be supported by an appropriately robust regulatory framework. However, we the parliament must be mindful of the need for change-change to improve the existing landscape, not change which makes industry more complex and costly for all involved. The financial advice industry is in the Northern Territory no less than anywhere else in this wide brown land. More and more, the average Territorian is required to seek out the services of this sector, which are necessary to manage and obtain the very best long-term advantage for the management of their own futures. Home loans, insurance and super are all basic commodities in this day and age, which most of us just assume are provided with our best interests at heart. I am by no means full bottle on the products I use. I rely upon services of the financial services sector to steer me in the right direction and keep me on the correct path. I have a background in business and am familiar with financial systems. Sadly, I have learnt the hard way about conflicted remuneration structures. If, with some level of business acumen, I have difficulty, then how is the average person expected to understand without the assistance of exponents within the financial services industry? The review undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, the Ripoll inquiry, made a raft of well-considered and reasonable reform recommendations, providing a blueprint for the government to move forward. However, over the ensuing two years the value of these recommendations has been usurped and clear direction has been lost. As a result, we find the bills currently being debated today a piecemeal offering and, unless amended, untenable legislation which would seek to increase costs and red tape for both business and the consumer. It is disappointing that such delays have occurred, particularly for an industry that has such an important function to perform within our society. This legislation has the potential to reduce consumer choice and competition if approved in its current form. The coalition cannot support the FoFA bills in their current form. Therefore the coalition will be moving a series of amendments with the express purpose of addressing some of the current flaws. Our initiatives include a recommendation that the parliament be resolute on the preparation of a proper regulatory impact statement that complies with the government's own best practice regulation requirements. The RIS must be compliant with the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation and be tabled in the parliament before the legislation could be further considered. The coalition would also recommend removing the government's opt-in proposal. This addition is outside the recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry and proposes to impose a mandatory requirement for all consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis-a measure that will have the likely result of significantly increasing red tape and costs for both planners and consumers. The coalition is also recommending an amendment to the current draft of the bill relating to the best interest duty, to improve clarity and certainty about its application. Further, inclusion of this measure in the Corporations Act is supported, but this must occur following the correct drafting necessary to remove any confusion and ensure understanding. Proposed section 961B(2) of the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 defines a set of comprehensive steps designed to provide guidance to advisers, yet its subclause (2)(g) allows for any other steps that would reasonably be regarded as being in the best interests of the client. We believe that, if other steps exist, then they should be included in the legislation, not left as a point of confusion or misinterpretation. Without change, this amendment creates uncertainty-uncertainty that will result in test cases before the courts. The coalition also recommends the removal of the retrospective fee disclosure statements. There was no reference to this in the Ripoll inquiry that recommends the introduction of an additional annual fee over and above the current regular statements already provided by the financial service providers to their clients. The coalition concludes that in this instance retrospective fee disclosure adds no additional consumer protection benefit and will introduce further increased costs, ultimately costs that will be passed onto the consumer. It is estimated by the Financial Services Council that the implementation cost will be around $700 million; the council has suggested that the cost per client for fee disclosure would be halved if it involved only new clients and summary information. Inevitably, any costs associated with implementation of any amendments will be passed on to consumers. The current piecemeal approach is yet another example of the very poor consultation process engaged in by this government. What started out in such a positive manner has devolved to a point where, unless further amendments are made, this suite of proposed changes cannot be supported. In terms of superannuation, the coalition recommends that, until further refinements are made, a ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super should be in place. Coalition committee members support the banning of conflicted remuneration structures-for example, product commissions within the financial services industryand we praise the industry for taking a proactive stance to abolish such conflicted remuneration structures. However, it is our stance that commissions paid on advised risk insurance, be they group policies or individual policies, inside or outside superannuation, are conflicted remuneration structures. Banning commissions in this instance has the potential to increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off-especially small business people who selfmanage their super. We the coalition further recommend the implementation of FoFA be delayed from its current due date of 1 July 2012 to 1 July 2013. The existing time frame of now four months is manifestly inappropriate and untenable for industry. Projecting the commencement date of any changes to 1 July 2013 or at very least legislating an introductory time frame to give industry the opportunity to implement change over that comparable time frame is paramount. This date also aligns change with the proposed MySuper. It would make sense to implement FoFA and MySuper simultaneously. FoFA involves significant and expensive changes that would result in large changes to IT systems and adviser training. Rushing the implementation and putting pressure on the industry to act will result in mistakes and inefficiency, which longer term will result in extra costs that are ultimately borne by the customer. We therefore commend to the government that to overcome the potential difficulties with adhering to a manifestly inadequate time frame, this bill, once amended, should not commence until 1 July 2013. Like many of my colleagues, I have received correspondence and calls from constituents who are practitioners within the financial advisory sector over the past few weeks. The calls from each and every one have been the same. This legislation has fundamental support in terms of intent; that is, to improve the level of transparency within this sector and to broaden access to financial services; however, those in the industry that have contacted me do not support this bill in its current form and without critical amendments. I have been reminded, as a result of these contacts, that the Prime Minister is on the record as saying a key priority for the government is to slash red tape. NeedI say any more? We know she does not have a good track record with keeping her promises. This bill, however, will see added complexities, paperwork and red tape for the sector, ultimately resulting in increased cost which will be passed on to the consumer. In conclusion, the coalition agrees to move amendments to the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 consistent with the 16 recommendations made in the dissenting report of the coalition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. We will oppose the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 if these amendments are not carried. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (12:21): We have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who have said repeatedly that 'lifting productivity is essential to the nation's prosperity'. Yet in the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 we are debating yet another set of government bills that will increase administrative burdens, increase compliance costs and, consequently, decrease productivity. You must always look at not only what the government says but what the government does through its actions. We on this side of the House, as has been so eloquently put by many of my colleagues, have some serious concerns about this legislation. There are five key areas in which we think the legislation is flawed. Firstly, the legislation is unnecessarily complex and, in many parts, unclear. This in and of itself leads to uncertainty and increased compliance costs. It contradicts the government's claims of a productivity agenda, because, in being so unclear, it will lead to many unintended consequences. The Association of Financial Advisers have identified proposed sections 961B(2)(g) and 961E as creating uncertainty with respect to the best interest duty. They are concerned that the legislation is so unclear that it will inevitably have to be tested in the courts. This will lead to increases in professional indemnity premiums and, as they point out, 'lead to uncertainty in the application of the transitional agreements that will negatively impact on the value of advice practices'. Obviously, with any increase in professional indemnity premiums, any uncertainty will lead to increased costs for consumers who use the advice of financial advisers. We think it is very important that Australians be given the very best financial advice. When we were in government, we believed very strongly that consumers needed a strong and transparent set of arrangements that would provide them with the information that they required to make decisions about their own financial future and the products that they purchased. Financial advisers are very important to the well-being of so many Australians who rely on their expertise to be able to make decisions about their future and the future of their families. We want to arm Australians with the ability to provide for themselves and for their families. So to put financial advisers out of reach of so many consumers by increasing the cost seems to make very little sense. Secondly, for a government that says it is all about jobs, jobs, jobs, it is pretty clear that the changes as a result of this legislation will lead to massive job losses in the financial services industry as firms try to adapt to the increased costs. The parliamentary joint committee heard testimony from Mr Craig Meller, Managing Director of AMP Financial Services, that these measures could result in as many as 25,000 job losses in the industry. Mr Richard Klipin, CEO of the Association of Financial Advisers, was even more pessimistic, estimating that up to 30,000 job losses would result. Yet this is not something we have heard about from those on the government benches. This does not seem to be a consideration for them. We cannot forget that many people who are involved in the financial services industry are themselves small business men and women who have risked their own capital to set up a business, to use their expertise, to employ others and to provide advice. This legislation, as I have said, could result in many significant job losses, which does concern us on this side of the chamber. Thirdly, the bill will legislate what many describe as an unlevel playing field amongst advice providers. As the dissenting coalition report suggests: … the disproportionate increase in costs to the industry and consumers, the reduction in the number of financial advisers in Australia, the associated additional job losses and the further concentration of financial advice services providers will have detrimental impacts on the cost, availability and accessibility of financial advice across Australia. Financial advisers have themselves said that they are concerned about the potential decrease in competition in the industry-and competition, as we all know, is incredibly important for consumers. It is through competition that consumers are able to get the best deal and it is through competition that many advisers have to ensure that they are providing the very best advice and service for those consumers. The fourth point I would like to make today relates to the opt-in provision. We are concerned that the opt-in provision is seriously flawed and not based on any logical or empirical evidence. In the dissenting PJC report it was noted that there was only one submission to the Ripoll inquiry, from the Industry Super Network, arguing in favour of the opt-in provision. The Ripoll inquiry then refused to accept that recommendation, yet the government, in its infinite wisdom, decided that it would defy those findings and set a worldfirst precedent. This does concern us. I would like to directly read into my speech today a letter that was received by me from a financial provider in my electorate, who specifically notes these concerns. I will quote directly from him. He says: 'A particular concern to us is the direct cost that the opt-in obligations will have on our business. In April 2011 our business was unable to replace a departing employee due to the ongoing contribution of the GFC to our operations. With over 600 active clients, we are now faced with an annual cost to administer opt-in, which has been estimated at up to $120 per client per annum. This could potentially be an additional cost to our business of $72,000 per annum.' This drives up the cost of advice and reduces the opportunity for many within our community to access professional advice services which would otherwise enhance their years in retirement. Noting the increased cost, as I have said before, is something that concerns us and it is something that we think the government has not fully thought through. We think, like so many of the government's pieces of legislation, like so many of the announcements made by this government, they have a thought bubble which they then legislate on. This is no different. Fifthly, this legislation will greatly increase compliance costs, with evidence given by the Financial Services Council that suggest it will cost up to $700 million to implement in the first year alone followed by $350 million in each additional year. This is, indeed, a massive increase and is completely in contrast to the Prime Minister's calls that she will be addressing red tape and regulation through her belated formation of the so-called deregulation forum, which I note follows a deregulation task force announced by Tony Abbott in December last year, of which I am a part and which is led by Senator Arthur Sinodinos AO. I have some advice for the government: if you want to reduce red tape then it is very flawed to introduce bills such as this. It is yet another example of the government saying one thing and doing something completely different. This seriously flawed legislation needs immediate attention before it is put to a vote. The coalition, led by so capably by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, has outlined many vital recommendations that need to be adopted before the passage of this bill should be contemplated. This bill must undergo a full regulatory impact statement that complies with the government's very own Office of Best Practice Regulation. According to the dissenting report: According to the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation, the government did not have adequate information before it to assess the impact of this bill on business and consumers or to assess the cost-benefit of the proposed changes. This is a pattern that has formed with this government. It does not assess the impact of the changes that it is making and it is ultimately the consumer, the everyday Australian, who pays. When quizzed at a Senate estimates committee, the executive director of the OBPR, Jason McNamara, admitted that the government did not have an adequate regulatory impact statement in front of it when it made the changes. We know that the minister, Bill Shorten, has admitted that the commencement date that he was trying to force the industry to meet was completely and utterly flawed and he has had to admit this failure and push it back. As we have argued consistently throughout, we believe the commencement should be at the same time as the My Super changes, and that the rushed introduction of the bill simply did not allow industry sufficient time to adjust to the changesagain, adding to administrative costs. The opt-in provisions must be removed. There is no other marketplace in the world whereby an opt-in process is implemented. Forcing customers to consistently re-sign contracts is not only cumbersome to the customer but adds huge levels of administrative cost to financial providers. There is no doubt that the increased regulatory and financial burden of opt-in mechanisms far outweighs any supposed benefit it may provide. It simply cannot be explained why, if this is such a brilliant measure, we are the only country that is contemplating introducing it. We are also incredibly concerned about the retrospective nature of this bill. As it stands, the annual fee disclosure statements would be applied retrospectively, again adding huge administrative costs with very questionable consumer benefits as outcomes. As a principle, we on this side believe that an incredibly high threshold needs to be met to be able to apply legislation retrospectively. We think, as a matter of principle, or as a rule of thumb, this should not occur for fairly obvious and good reasons. Yet this is a very common occurrence with this government-that it seeks to impose retrospective legislation to implement its program. I have much more to say about this bill, but let me simply conclude in the time remaining by saying we are very keen to ensure that consumers have appropriate financial advice provided to them. We are very keen to ensure they have appropriate transparency. We do not think that this bill will in fact assist without significant changes. We think it is inherently flawed and we think the minister himself is responsible for bringing forward a very flawed bill. contribution about the flaws in the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 facing the chamber today. Fifteen minutes is certainly not enough time to go through the problems that the sector will face with the proposals the government has put forward today. It does, however, follow the precedent set by this government, as the member for Higgins pointed out, of not consulting and embracing the sector which they are seeking to regulate. The government is not listening to their suggestions, not taking account of their concerns and not providing a reasonable framework for the sector to be able to have input to the proposals of government. This is a dangerous way to do legislation. I have spoken about this in this place before. Sector after sector in the economy today is asking, 'Why won't the government speak to us about the legislation that they're proposing?' Here, with these Future of Financial Advice bills we see before us, again the sector are saying that they are not satisfied in any way with the legislation, that the time frames are completely unreasonable, that the implementation of it will be unworkable and that it will have serious detrimental effects on the operation of their sector-par for the course, under this government. Whenever this government has the choice between overregulating or letting off",212,Bills
284,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12:36,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Higgins's finemore lightly, it overregulates. If the choice is between more complex or less complex, it says, 'Let's be more complex.' The complexity of this particular set of proposals before us is substantial. When smart financial advisers and operators tell us they cannot understand what the proposals mean, how they will operate and whether they will be effective or not, I take it very seriously. In my electorate of Mitchell, in the Norwest Business Park, I have hundreds of financial service based businesses, mostly small and medium businesses advising small numbers of clients. These are the businesses coming to see me with great concern about how these proposals will not only threaten the viability of their business, potentially putting them out of business, but also favour the big players. It is another theme we see under this government. It is another narrative that is building-favouring big players in every sector, crunching small businesses and crunching the ability of a business to go from a small to a medium to a large business. It is very much what will happen under this legislation, which is complex and, in large part, unclear. My colleagues have commented on many of the flaws in the proposals, but I would like to point to something that I have spoken about in this place before and that is the concept of financial literacy. Financial advisers have a key role in this domain of increasing and enhancing financial literacy in Australia today. We see from this government continued proposals that undermine the concept of making a person more financially literate and more responsible for their own finances from a younger age right through their lives to an older age following through to superannuation. This bill, which will remove the ability of an adviser to fairly operate, will lead to lower rates of financial literacy. People will seek less advice; people will be underinsured; there will be greater rates of underinsurance. The very things that a government should be seeking to enhance and expand, this bill undermines. These broad themes are very important for the parliament to understand. That is the feedback we are getting from the sector. That is the feedback I am getting from the businesses in my electorate. We ought to be taking measures to enhance financial literacy and education and that should be a focus of this parliament, not overregulating and overburdening the sector with unnecessarily complex proposals and regulations. We know that these proposals come out of the 2009 Ripoll inquiry and report which followed a series of financial collapses, of which Storm and Westpoint are examples. We know that in 2009 a series of recommendations were made. WhatI think is a fine dissenting report was put together by the committee's coalition members. Indeed, Senator Sue Boyce, Senator Mathias Cormann, Mr Paul Fletcher and Mr Tony Smith are to be congratulated on what represents a very substantial dissemination of the flaws in the two bills that are before the chamber today. It is not just a matter of the costs referred to in their report-the $700 million of implementation costs, the $350 million per annum compliance costs-although these increases are of course very substantial. It is the basic nuts and bolts of the proposals that the government has in these bills, including opt-in requirements, that I think are completely unworkable. An opt-in requirement is something that has not been tried in any other major market in the world today. With the mining tax we have seen an experimental form of taxation that most tax experts said, 'This is a radical experiment, a departure from all normal forms of taxation'. Now once again we have the government experimenting with a radical model of opt in for the financial services sector that nobody is calling for and nobody is recommending. Indeed, it has the potential to lead to some very undesirable outcomes when customers who have not responded and who think they are covered by advice, after the 30-day period will no longer be covered under an opt-in requirement if they do not respond. SoI do not see why we would proceed down such a radical and experimental path when there is no call from any major sector for us to be doing such a thing. When you look at more than the nuts and bolts you will see other problems with these bills. The member for Higgins spoke eloquently about the retrospectivity aspect, requiring in essence all businesses in this space to go back and seek permission for things that they have already done and advice they have already issued. This is a bizarre notion. I have spoken here about the principle of retrospectivity in law where it is not to the benefit of people or industry sectors, and I think that we should not be requiring this sector or these customers to take retrospective action without a very good reason. Once again that principle appears to be missing from what the government is doing to justify this legislation. It goes back to what we have heard throughout this debate, in which the industry sector has said that there will be thousands of job losses from this legislation, that compliance costs will be immense. Why are we not listening to the very sector that we are seeking to make regulations about? Why are we being punitive and heavy-handed? Why, in relation to government legislation and the government's approach, are we using the stick all the time and not the carrot? I have received a lot of correspondence from businesses in my electorate, from financial sector services around the country and from various associations, including the Association of Financial Advisers. Their comment is very interesting to note, and I want to read it into the record: Our view is that FoFA, as it is currently drafted, delivers neither improved transparency or increased access to advice. Minister Shorten has stated on a number of occasions that FoFA is a growth strategy for the financial advice industry and also that there is broad industry support for FoFA. In fact, the financial service industry has many concerns with the current draft of this legislation, much of which has been recognised and addressed in the coalition's dissenting report. That is from the Association of Financial Advisers, so is why Minister Shorten telling the public that he has broad industry support for this legislation when clearly he does not? Even listening just to the small and medium enterprises in the sector in my electorate, it is obvious there are real, justifiable and graphic concerns with the proposals that the government is outlining. They are concerns that should be addressed by the government and not by the constant Orwellian doublespeak from ministers that, 'Oh well, everything is going to be great, businesses will be better off and we have the support of the sector'-which clearly they do not. Another aspect of the FoFA legislation before us that was not recommended by the Ripoll inquiry, but which somehow has got in, is those retrospective fee disclosure statements that I have mentioned. I have a big concern with this because, when we were speaking about what the association and the industry expects, the government said specifically to the sector that they would not introduce retrospective disclosure statement requirements. It was a commitment, a promise, and we have heard much made of this in recent years. Again, this is why the opposition is so vehemently opposed to this legislation as currently drafted. You cannot provide business certainty when you tell the sector that you are not going to do something and then you go ahead and do it anyway, regardless of what you have said that you would do and regardless of what the sector wants. In relation to retrospective fee disclosure requirements, the government gave their intention: they said they would not do it. It crept into this legislation, and before us today we have retrospective fee disclosure requirements. If you are operating a business in this sector, you do not have that certainty that you need to operate your business. You are facing now, I think, onerous and complex legislative burdens that will not only add to your compliance costs but also undermine the relationship between client and adviser which is so critical in this financial services space. We have heard from many coalition speakers about that relationship. This is an enterprise that is built largely on trust between the financial adviser and client. The government's overregulation here is seeking to undermine that essential component of the success of these businesses. Why? We hear that there will be thousands of job losses. When you remove the concept of trust from these relationships, it is difficult to see why someone would take financial advice-when they have to continually opt in to a service, when they have to constantly be advised. No-one is suggesting here that there should not be regulation in this space or that there should not be quality and valuable regulation. In fact the industry itself accepts it. But what we are saying is that this legislation, in the way it is drafted, is not adequate. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that when you see that the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation said that this was not adequate and not up to its own standards of compliance. That is the most damning feature of all. The Office of Best Practice Regulation said that it was concerned about the ability of this legislation to meet the government's own standards and rigorously assess increasing costs and red tape for both business and customers and that the government did not have adequate information before it when it drafted FoFA. That ought to be of concern for the government. They ought to pause there and say: 'We have already delayed the implementation of this legislation to date. We now have unrealistic time frames built into this legislation that the industry say cannot be met.' John Brogden said that it does not matter when the parliament passes this legislation; they cannot under any circumstance meet the 1 July 2012 deadline. The government ought to pause and re-examine this legislation and consider the opposition's amendments which Senator Cormann has put forward, I think very realistically, to improve the quality of this legislation and limit the damage to this vital sector for our economy. We know that the 1 July 2012 time frame is completely unrealistic, and there is another issue that is related-that is the changes proposed here by the FoFA legislation and MySuper. It would make sense, you would think, when you are talking about businesses in a serious sector like this, to implement such massive technological changes and complex regulatory changes at once, to limit the amount of expenditure that businesses would have to make. It is symptomatic of this government's chaotic approach to legislation and to handling different sectors of the economy that they are seeking to ensure these dates are not together and that these very substantial implementation changes are not going to be done concurrently. It is completely sensible that the coalition is calling for the implementation date of this legislation to be put forward to 1 July 2013, and we are seeking those amendments genuinely. Listening to the sector, that is only reasonable and rational. The industry cannot meet the deadlines imposed by this legislation, so it ought to be amended and redrafted. But what you tend to get from this government, as we have seen time and time again with its legislative approach, is that it does not matter if a piece of legislation is weak, if it is drafted inadequately or if it does something bad to the sector, it says: 'Let's just push it through parliament and we'll come back months or years later to try to fix it, add an amendment or do something later.' This is the stage at which the government should be listening to the industry. Any small or medium sized financial business in the country today would tell them this legislation is unworkable, complex, chaotic and unnecessary. It will deliver high regulatory costs to their business and limit their ability to provide financial advice to their customers and clients. If the government were serious it would look at these amendments seriously and adopt them. We know that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is not serious about improving transparency and the quality of financial advice in Australia today. We know that he is the minister for unions and is acting in the interests of unions at the expense of small and medium sized enterprises around this country. Thousands of small businesses will tell you they will suffer increased costs and job losses under this retrograde legislation. I thought was an outstanding contribution to this debate on the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and cognate bill. Like him, I have had numerous small businesses-the people those on the other side do not like to hear about-contact me in the last little while to make the point that this is flawed legislation and should not go ahead in its current form. They have also made the point that the amendments proposed by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann, should be considered by this parliament because, like much of the work Senator Cormann does, these recommendations are based on the reality of the situation, not just the political vested interests which the minister responsible for this is constantly and forever in pursuit of. The 'Minister for Vested Interests' is all about making sure that people in protected positions in this industry-namely, the industry super funds-are the best looked after. And the protections put in place by the minister in this legislation will increase the cost for consumers. It will be under the basis of 'being fair and protecting people'; it will be under the usual Labor Party pretence that they are trying to look after the small guy. But this legislation will make it much more expensive and difficult for consumers to get the advice they need. The member for Mitchell eloquently outlined the importance of financial literacy in Australian society. Financial advisers, particularly those small businesses based in communities and accessible to the consumer, get access to that financial advice from people who are expert in the field and are able to provide that advice. What the Labor Party and this minister will have you believe is that somehow a piece of government legislation will protect people from making a bad financial decision. They will have you believe that you can create legislation which protects people always, that you can protect people against a bad employer, that you can protect people against a bad financial decision. This is the nanny state at its worse. Ultimately, the terrible examples that we have seen where people have lost money have occurred because they have been given inappropriate advice. The Ripoll inquiry in 2009 observed that: The committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations.",218,Bills
285,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (12:50,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Mitchell and whatThat is absolutely spot-on, because ultimately this legislation is based on the premise that a piece of legislation can stop people from making the wrong choices. Therefore we see this massive overregulation, which was outlined by the member for Mitchell quite well, on which even the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation, which is a bit of a joke term in itself, made the comment that in their view this was inappropriate legislation and far too great a regulatory burden. It is a regulatory burden particularly to those small businesses out there who are trying to help their local communities and their consumers understand their financial future better. We need Australians to better look after their financial future. We have significant cost pressures coming at government services, which was so well outlined by the best Treasurer this country has ever had, Peter Costello, in the Intergenerational report, where he highlighted the details of how much extra spending will be required for the Commonwealth and the states to deal with the ageing population. He also made the point that the revenue implications of a reduced workforce as the baby boomers retire will make it harder for governments to meet what they should do and do well at a minimum. That is why ensuring that Australians have their best financial interests at heart and are planning properly so they can be sustainable in their retirement is such an important goal. There should not be legislation that makes that harder. There should not be legislation which operates under the premise of protecting people from themselves while making it more difficult for that to occur. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that this bill inevitably-and it is the case with so many of the superannuation bills before the parliament-is designed to favour people the minister is more particularly inclined to agree with when it comes to these matters. It is no coincidence that the Prime Minister ensured during the last ministerial reshuffle that she kept employment and workplace relations together with financial services and superannuation under the same portfolio. You might wonder what the connection is. It is unusual; it has not been done before. Financial services has usually been in a portfolio outside of workplace relations. This time they have been combined. You can see that this bill, like two other bills before the House at the moment, is about ensuring that the protected and privileged position of industry super funds in this space continues. There are provisions in this bill which make it much better for the industry super funds at the expense of the small providers. We see it with other pieces of superannuation legislation before this parliament. And you know it is true because these issues were raised last week by the Leader of the Opposition-appropriately, because it is something we will be pursuing if we are fortunate enough to be elected to government. This close link between industry super funds, unions and the Australian Labor Party needs very close examination. There will beMs Rishworth interjectingabsolutely. through the chair. The member for Kingston! push because there is a sensitivity. You know there is a sensitivity because, on the very day",222,Bills
286,Mr Briggs,"No, there is the old industrial club. There are employers organisations,",223,Bills
287,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Grierson,"Order! Member for Mayo, refer your remarks",223,Bills
288,Mr Briggs,"I make no deference in that respect. This is an issue we will continue to that the Leader of the Opposition made some very calm comments, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was out there trying to blow up the whole thing. It is a very sensitive issue when it comes to what these people are doing with other Australians' superannuation entitlements and how it will affect their financial security in the future. This bill makes it worse, it has to be said. The provision which needs to be closely examined, and Senator Mathias Cormann has done some very good work in this respect, is the opt-in provision. This is where the favour is returned to the industry super fund network. We know that because the only people during the Ripoll inquiry who argued for opt-in were the industry super network. They were the only group of people who argued for it, but somehow they became a major base of the legislation. They became a major point in this legislative reform. Somehow this opt-in provision, which, of course, benefits big advisers to the detriment of small advisers, became part of this reform. This has to be changed, absolutely. This is one of the major reasons the coalition will oppose this bill, unless the Labor Party and this minister wise up and adopt our proposed amendments. Our amendments will make this bill workable. They will create a reasonable piece of legislation, which is what the industry wants. I am sure many members have received their small business financial advisers' views on this, and they are one and the same. They all say, 'Please, don't tie me up in this red tape. Please, don't drag me down and try to stop me from doing the job that I have been pursuing as an entrepreneur, as a small business person and as a skilled artisan in this field, helping fellow Australian consumers understand their financial obligations and opportunities better.' This piece of legislation does the exact opposite. It seeks to favour the big over the small. It seeks to favour friends over those who are not friends of the Australian Labor Party. It is a real shame that this piece of legislation has come to this parliament in this way. That is why we oppose it. That is why we say there is a better way to deal with this in the future. But, as I said, this is so consistent with what the Australian Labor Party is doing in government. For instance, we see a start-up date, as the member for Mitchell and the member for Higgins so rightly outlined, which is far too quick. With the industry screaming and saying, 'We can't possibly do this. We can't possibly achieve this start-up date,' this legislation, at the very least, should be put off to take that into account so that the industry can deal appropriately with the red tape nightmare that is being thrown their way. I say again that the coalition opposes these bills. I congratulate Senator Mathias Cormann on the great work that he has done in this area. I urge the minister, who has so many vested interests, to reconsider the pursuit of this and the pursuit of small business which is making it more expensive for Australian consumers and putting at risk their financial security in the future as it becomes harder for them to get advice. This is too important an area to play politics with, and that is what this minister is doing. It is a great shame. The bills should be opposed. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:02 to 16:00 Judges and Governors-General Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Governors-General Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2012 I do so foreshadowing that the coalition intends to send this to a Senate committee. We are in this chamber because there will be not an opposing vote in this chamber. However, there are many things of concern about this bill that I think we need to address. The first one is the constitutionality point-that is, it is provided in the Constitution that a judge-and that is federal, of course, because that is what it covers-cannot have their remuneration diminished during their continuance in office. The remuneration is a widely read term and refers to all financial emoluments associated with that office, including pension rights. In respect of the Governor General, you could say it is in violation of section 3 of the Constitution, which prohibits alteration of the Governor General's salary during his or her continuance in office. Those points are serious points and need to be made right at the outset, but it is also just as important to draw attention to the precedent that this seeks to create by having a special family law provision for a separate class or, indeed, a subset of a class of individuals within our community. Many of us who have been involved in discussions over superannuation and the status that it should have in reference to family law were concerned that superannuation was left out for decades after the passage of the act and was not considered to be marital property. Therefore, it was outside the purview of the court and the act and was not dealt with. Then whilst we were in office we brought in a provision which legislated for superannuation to become part of marital property and that is the situation for all citizens of Australia. This bill proposes to create special laws for judges who are federally appointed judges and the Governor General. I suspect that the Governor General has been thrown in to make it look good because it certainly did not come from that office that this bill be generated, nor am I aware that it came from particularly the Federal Court or the High Court. I do understand that it is almost a bill to meet an anomaly of a particular former Family Law Court judge and a dispute with his spouse. That is no way to make law. I am very concerned that we could have a situation where the federal parliament would make a law specifically for federal judges. It would not cover state judges and I am reminded that, with regard to defined benefits, there is a qualifying period for judges just as there is for members of other defined schemes. I can cite examples of other people in defined benefit schemes who have been divorced prior to their becoming eligible to receive a pension and they had to raise sufficient money to pay out the spouse. Should they not in fact qualify for the pension it was in terms just 'bad luck'. So it is totally unfair that there is a carved-out niche for a particular group of people, whether it be judges or accountants or school teachers or policemen or any other category of people. I think it is important that these laws are universal laws and apply equally to people across the board. Even though there will be no voting against this bill in the House, I am flagging that we will seek to have a Senate inquiry into the bill so that some of these issues can be flushed out and evidence can be taken, and we can see properly perhaps what motivates the bill. I think the concerns of many need to be assuaged.",223,Bills
289,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (16:00,"In rising to speak to the Judges andLegislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2012. The member for Mackellar has no idea what she is talking about on this issue. This is a case of making sure that governors-general and judges are treated the same way as every other citizen in this country with respect to section 79 and section 75(2) of the Family Law Act. That is what this legislation purports to do. The Constitution makes it very clear that the Commonwealth parliament has the power under section 51 to make laws in relation to matrimonial causes and divorce, and that is the basis upon which we have made laws under the Family Law Act-and it was a reforming Whitlam Labor that brought family law up to date in the mid-seventies with the Family Law Act. In this legislation, we are making sure spouses and partners of judges and governorsgeneral are treated in the same way as any other citizen of this country in the states and territories. The changes in this legislation go back a little way and I will explain that to the House. When someone separates in a marital relationship or a de facto relationship, or a same-sex relationship as a result of the laws we have passed, under part VIII of the Family Law Act they have the right to bring an application for property orders in the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court, in exercise of its power, can make a property order under section 79(1) of the Family Law Act and take into consideration the factors under section 79(4), which talk about the financial and non-financial contributions made to matrimonial or cohabitation type property. And the court looks at other factors under 75(2). The situation with respect to superannuation has always been a vexed issue in family law. In fact, it was often the case that the courts engaged in quite unusual tactics to get around the situation that superannuation, whether a defined benefit scheme or an accumulation fund, was a source of income or an asset to a person's benefit. In the case of Coghlanv Coghlan of some years ago, judges referred to superannuation as another species of asset and not really a matrimonial asset. This has always been a vexed issue. It is often wives who are disadvantaged in these circumstances. If they have been together for a long time and the husband has a large amount of superannuation and there is a matrimonial house, a car, a bit of savings and property, it is often wives who have been disadvantaged by the non-treatment of superannuation whereby it is considered to be an asset. Under this legislation, we are making sure that the partners and spouses of judges and governors-general are treated in the same way as every other Australian is treated if they separate, and avail themselves of the right to seek an order for property settlement under part VIII of the Family Law Act. The member for Mackellar raised the question of what the situation would be with a serving judge. If a judge is serving and is not yet qualified for a pension, at the time of the split the adjustment of the benefit would be based on the proportion that has accrued at the time of the split. With respect to property settlement, even if the person has not yet, say, qualified by reason of age for the superannuation, the trustees of the superannuation fund can adjust the superannuation by way of order or by way of a binding financial agreement. I have been involved in casesMrs Bronwyn Bishop: There is no fund; it's consolidated revenue! heard in silence. She will extend the same courtesy to the member for Blair.",225,Bills
290,Mr Neumann (Blair) (16:05,I speak in support of the Judges and Governors-General,226,Bills
291,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Kj Thomson,"Order! The member for Mackellar waspoliticians, judges, military people, accumulation funds, defined benefit schemes. This legislation makes sure that everyone is treated equally. We want to make sure that the current arrangements happen as every Australian would expect them to happen. If the member for Mackellar has a look at the current arrangements for family law, she will see that, on that issue in relation to judges and governors-general, they are inconsistent with the idea that they should be treated in the same way as every other Australian. Does the member for Mackellar think that judges and governors-general should be treated in another way? That is not the case. We want to make sure that, when this bill is passed, the former spouse will be able to receive his or her share of the superannuation benefit as a separate interest benefit. I have done thousands of these types of cases involving Australian citizens, and I have been involved in lots of cases involving very senior figures in this country. I am not going to start mentioning individual people that I have acted for or their spousesMrs Bronwyn Bishop: I should hope not. politicians in relation to family law cases-or their spouses, including people in chambers all over the place. I am not going to start naming them. It is a long time since the member for Mackellar has practised in the area of family law. She should have a good look at the law and what we are doing in this regard. This is a necessary undertaking. The fact that the coalition cannot bring themselves to just get rid of this anomaly goes to show the extent to which they will say no to everything-even to good law that actually fixes up irregularities and eccentricities. This legislation does that. It is a sensible piece of legislation that will make sure the family law splitting arrangements on superannuation are the same for all Australians. We on this side of the House do not believe that Australians should be treated unequally, even if those opposite believe that that is the case. Integrity) (16:12): I thank all speakers on the Judges and Governors-General Legislation Amendment (Family Law) Bill 2012 to date. The bill will implement new family law arrangements for the federal judiciary and governors-general by amending the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 and the Governor General Act 1974. The new arrangements will allow for a former spouse of a judge or a Governor General to receive his or her share of a superannuation benefit as a separate benefit at the time of a family law split. This is consistent with family law, which aims to provide separating parties with a clean break. Under the Family Law Act 1975, superannuation interests for part of the property of a married or de facto partner can be split between separating parties at the time of a property settlement. However, the current family law arrangements for judges and governors-general are inconsistent with the family law policy of a clean break. The arrangements are also out of step with other Commonwealth defined benefit superannuation schemes, which have since 2004 provided separate interest benefits to former spouses of scheme members in a family law split. For judges, the current percentage-only arrangements mean that any split of the pension of a judge in a family law settlement only occurs when pension payments are made to a retired judge. Payments to a former spouse do not commence until the judge retires and cease upon",226,Bills

293,Mr Neumann,I tell you what: I have acted for more Tory politicians than Labor,227,Bills
294,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and the judge's death. There is no certainty as to the overall quantum of the benefit that the former spouse is entitled to receive. For governors-general, there are currently no scheme-specific separate interest arrangements in place to cover the splitting of superannuation pensions. The bill will address these issues by putting in place scheme-specific arrangements for judges and governorsgeneral which provide a separate interest benefit in the event of a family law split of a superannuation benefit. As well as bringing the arrangements into line with the family law policy and with other Commonwealth superannuation schemes, the new arrangements will give the parties greater control over their respective individual benefits. The proposed changes do not mean that the Commonwealth will be determining property settlements. The Family Court or the separating parties will decide whether the superannuation benefit is to be split and, if so, the amount or percentage of the split. The arrangements in the bill will operate when a splitting order or an agreement is made in relation to a superannuation interest in the scheme. The interest of a judge or Governor General in the superannuation scheme will be valued at the time of the family law split and a separate interest for the former spouse will also be created at this time. If a pension is not payable to a judge or Governor General at the time of the split, the pension of the former spouse will be deferred. The deferred pension will become payable when the former spouse reaches his or her retirement age or before this if he or she is certified as permanently incapacitated. Once the judge or Governor General retires and commences a pension that pension will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred from the former spouse. If at that time of the family law split, a pension is being paid in respect of the judge or Governor General, the pension for the former spouse will be payable immediately and the pension of the judge or Governor General will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred to the former spouse. The bill also includes transitional provisions to cover existing family law cases in the Judges' Pensions Scheme. The transitional arrangements provide the former spouse with a separate interest pension from the date the legislation comes into force, based on the splitting percentage in the court order or agreement. There are also safeguards to make sure that there would be no unintended consequences for the parties arising from the proposed new arrangements. These reforms proposed by the bill are an important step to align the family law splitting arrangements for judges and Governors-General with family law principles and to bring consistency to the family law arrangements across the Commonwealth defined benefit superannuation schemes.

New terminology has had to be created for this specific category of people.

It is not even all judges; it is only the three courts created in the federal jurisdiction-the High Court, the Federal Court and the Family Law Courts. As I understand it, it is to accommodate a problem that arose for a particular Family Law Court judge and his ex-spouse. That is not the way to make good legislation.

Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 seek to address the obvious need for reform within the financial advice industry, as highlighted by the collapse of Storm Financial in 2009. Most financial advisers would agree-indeed, as ASIC found-that Storm Financial acted recklessly and not in the best interests of their clients. The fact that Storm Financial collapsed leaving thousands of clients destitute and bankrupt highlights a need for a stronger regulatory framework within the financial advice sector. However, this legislation in its current form does nothing more than increase red tape and regulatory costs for businesses and in turn pushes financial advice products out of the reach of the ordinary consumer. This legislation will deliver little to no additional protection to consumers and will make the cost of providing quality financial advice to consumers more expensive and cumbersome.",229,Bills
304,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (16:26,"The Corporations Amendment (Future ofThe coalition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services made 16 recommendations in their dissenting report which address many of the shortfalls of this legislation. These recommendations have been positively received and supported by a number of key industry groups and associations. It astounds me that, despite going through a rigorous committee process, the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 are still unnecessarily complex and unclear in a number of parts. It is of no surprise to me that the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation, the OBPR, has issued a damning assessment of these FoFA proposals. I support, as do my colleagues in the coalition, sensible reforms to financial advice and the financial services industry. However, when these reforms create unnecessary complexity and produce unclear and convoluted regulations, the result is the creation of a barrier rather than an incentive to more consumers receiving quality financial advice. For the best interests of consumers and industry alike, the parliament should adopt the first recommendation of the dissenting report and defer consideration of the FoFA legislation until the government provides a full regulatory impact statement in relation to the legislation currently before the parliament. Moreover, this regulatory impact statement must be compliant with the requirements of the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation. Anything less is an insult to those thousands of professionals practising in the financial advice sector and will let down millions of Australians who seek professional and quality financial service. The FoFA reforms are going to completely restructure the financial advice industry. It is only common sense that the government does its homework now on how these reforms will affect the industry and consumers. Specific industry concerns regarding the FoFA reforms include high implementation and compliance costs as well as a reform package that favours larger, concentrated financial advice service providers. Last year, industry bodies warned the government that the FoFA reforms in their current form would cost jobs. We are already seeing a watershed, with jobs going out of the financial advice sector as firms prepare for the pain of more red tape and the extra cost caused by these reforms. Conservative industry estimates place the cost to implement these reforms at around $700 million, with a further $35 million a year for compliance. One of the most contentious aspects of the FoFA reforms is the mandatory opt-in requirement, under which consumers must re-sign contracts with their financial advisers every two years. This requirement removes from clients' control when and how they terminate their relationship with a financial adviser. This will significantly increase red tape and costs for financial planners and consumers involved in long-term financial advice relationships. The creation of the opt-in requirements also takes away key protection mechanisms for advice and dispute resolution schemes. It is very important to remember that in 2009 the parliament asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services-the Ripoll inquiry. This very comprehensive inquiry received a vast number of submissions and made a number of recommendations. However, instead of implementing the recommendations made by the Ripoll inquiry, which would have resulted in bipartisan support as well as industry support and approval, this government has allowed its own self-interest and the vested interest of the Industry Super Network to hijack the FoFA reform package until it is almost unrecognisable. As a number of my colleagues have noted, the Industry Super Network provided the only submission to the Ripoll inquiry that advocated a mandatory opt-in requirement. Its proposal was not even accepted as a recommendation by the Ripoll inquiry-that fact should be well noted. Yet now this unworkable provision is being thrust by a vested interest into an incredibly important reform agenda to the detriment of the industry, the consumer and the economy. I cannot even begin to express how frustrated and angry financial advisers are about the constant changes and last minute additions, along with the overt political interference and policy reversals that have occurred during the creation and passage of these FoFA reforms. Financial advisers provide professional advice to Australians about how to better manage financial risks and maximise financial opportunities. This legislation sends the wrong message about the professionalism of financial advisers and presumes that clients are not in a position to make an educated decision about their relationship with their financial adviser. Until this legislative reform package, payments for financial services have been flexible and accessible, especially fees paid by commission from a customer's superannuation. I have canvassed the views of a number of financial advisory companies in the Macarthur electorate about their thoughts on the proposed FoFA reforms, especially with regard to the practical workings of the legislation. The common theme that has arisen in my conversations is that this legislation will create a number of key problems for businesses and clients and will fail to deliver the intended protections and benefits to their clients. However well intended the FoFA reforms may be, making the financial advice industry over-compliant will push up fees and in turn make this important and valuable product unaffordable for many hard working Australians. This is especially true in my electorate of Macarthur, which has a very high proportion of young families who are mortgaged to the hilt and who often do not have available finances for additional financial products, especially for risk insurance outside their superannuation. The government clearly has not given enough thought to the complexity of, and costs associated with, many of the initiatives within the FoFA package. The government has already failed its own standards with this reform package and it is creating a legislative nightmare for smaller financial advice businesses. While the government has at least decided to adopt the coalition policy of allowing commission payments on risk insurance products outside of superannuation, it is still stubbornly pursuing a ban on commissions inside superannuation. That will increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off, particularly small business people who self-manage their super. The government's decision to draw a line in the sand, and ban commissions on risk insurance inside superannuation, will cause pain to the consumer. It will limit consumers' choice and the flexibility of remuneration options. In fact, just two years ago the United Kingdom went through this same process of banning commissions on risk insurance. They have discovered that banning has not worked. The UK have learnt from their actions and they recently reversed that decision. That has hardly got a mention in this chamber. We should learn from that experience, as opposed to putting our financial advice industry through the wringer. Australians are already underinsured. This legislation will greatly exacerbate this significant problem. Another failure of these bills is the last-minute addition by the government of the additional fee disclosure statements for both existing clients and new clients. These additions occurred after the minister assured industry groups that this last-minute addition would not be retrospective. This legislation will require financial advisers to report to each client, whether the adviser had a relationship with the client before the reforms or not, with a detailed outline of every service performed. While this may not seem onerous on paper, in practice it will result in financial advisers sending reams of paper to clients outlining every phone call, transaction, decision, meeting and inquiry made on the client's behalf. This is especially burdensome as fee disclosure obligations already exist for advisers and product advisers in disclosing to the client the fees paid. The government's addition of overly prescriptive fee disclosure statements will dramatically increase administrative costs and red tape. I urge the government to accept recommendations 4 and 5 made by the coalition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. In their dissenting report, they call for the government's prescriptive fee disclosure statements to require a summary of fees to be given to clients annually only and for these fee disclosure statements to not be applied retrospectively. These recommendations strike an effective balance between the need for transparency and accessible information of financial advice services by not placing an overly prescriptive legislative burden on the industry. The last point I make about these two bills is with regard to the best interest duty that will be established by this legislation. The Ripoll inquiry made a number of recommendations regarding the duty of financial advisers to provide advice in the best interests of their clients rather than the adviser's own financial interests, including that of their providers and wholesalers. This is an important provision and one that I am glad the government has chosen to adopt. However, in its usual fashion, the government has failed to provide a robust and well thought out framework for this new duty. I urge the parliament to adopt the coalition's recommendations 6 and 7, which will resolve much uncertainty within the industry about the practical operation of duty and facilitate the provision of scalable advice. One of the firms in my electorate, Macarthur Financial Planning, has expressed concerns about the future of scalable advice under the FoFA reforms in their current form. Change is good when it brings improvements, efficiencies, transparency and better value for consumers. With the recommended amendments to this legislation, the FoFA reforms could deliver a balanced result for the financial planning sector and their clients. However, this legislation in its current form is unnecessarily complicated and unclear. In particular, the opt-in renewal measures of the legislation create a number of significant barriers rather than incentives to people receiving quality financial advice at an affordable price. Even on conservative industry estimates, the changes these bills seek to legislate will cause job losses in the financial services industry. They are likely to cost the industry around $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum for industry to comply with many of the onerous requirements. These amounts will surely be borne by the consumer. This legislation will enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst financial advice providers and will increase red tape, an additional cost for both businesses and consumers, with little to no additional benefits to protect the consumer. Today, I urge the House to accept the coalition's amendments to this legislation. They will improve this legislation and turn around a good intention that has been poorly executed into a piece of legislation that will bring positive change to the industry. But it wants and needs real reform rather than pandering to the whims of the minister's mates. amendments to the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. The shadow Assistant Treasurer and shadow minister for financial services and superannuation, Senator Mathias Cormann, is doing a terrific job on this. The words in the previous sentence are not mine, although I wholeheartedly agree. They are in a comment from highly regarded Wagga Wagga financial adviser, Australian Financial Services authorised representative and Australian Credit Licence credit representative Gary Langtry. I have known Mr Langtry for many years. He, like me, hails from the Marrar district, and is a straight talker. He will look you in the eye and tell it as it is. It is the best way to be, particularly in his line of work. Clients know where they stand. That is important, crucial, essential. Mr Langtry was pleased Senator Cormann was holding the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation to account on this issue. The bill as it stands 'feeds beautifully into the hands of the union controlled superannuation fund network', Mr Langtry observed. How very true. Mr Langtry sent me a paper compiled by the Association of Financial Advisers on the key recommended amendments and impacts of these bills, which have been described by the association as 'the biggest change to the industry in a generation'. Now that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has put in a dissenting report, the association is correctly and understandably railing against the legislation, which includes elements that are anticonsumer, anti-adviser and anti small business. Its paper says: The key test for FoFA, which the AFA has continued to support, has always been: 1. improved transparency and 2. increased access to advice. Our view is that FoFA, as it is currently drafted, delivers neither. Minister Shorten has stated on a number of occasions that FoFA is a growth strategy for the financial advice industry and also that there is broad industry support for FoFA. In fact the financial services industry has many concerns with the current draft of this legislation, much of which has been recognised and addressed in the Coalition’s dissenting report. Why is it that it seems everyone outside of the government can see what the Labor government is doing wrong and how it will affect Commonwealth coffers, businesses, regardless of size, families, farmers and everyday people juggling a household budget, yet those on that side of the chamber seem to be oblivious to it all? There are none so blind as those who will not see. The association's paper is a damning denunciation of the government's proposals. It takes up five key issues related to the bills. First, retrospective fee disclosure is a huge cost burden to the financial services industry for information consumers already receive. The Financial Services Council has estimated implementation costs of $700 million. We heard the member for Macarthur just a few moments ago talk of the job losses that the financial services",230,Bills
305,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (16:40,"The coalition has sensible and timelyindustry would have to endure. We on this side of the House do not want to see any further job losses in any industry, let alone the financial services industry, which plays such an important part in our economy and for small business, which, as the member for Macarthur would also know, is the engine driving our economy. Further, the council has suggested the cost per client for fee disclosure will be halved if it only involves new clients and summary information. As with everything when a government introduces overbearing, onerous-and that was a word that the member for Macarthur used well too-and unnecessary legislation, someone has to pay. Invariably the cost is borne by those at the end of the line: the consumer, the customer, the client. Second, the opt-in obligation is an issue of concern because it will add costs of about $120 per client per year. Unintentional failure to opt in could result in a possible risk for consumers, as they could miss out on the receipt of adviser-initiated important advice, according to the association. Access to advice will, according to the association, reduce as advisers reposition their offer upmarket. The association argues that it is better to strengthen opt-out provisions. As with so many of Labor's policies, the ones who will suffer most will be clients in the regions, clients in country areas of this great nation of ours. Third, proposed section 961B(2)(g) creates uncertainty, and, if enacted, could well eventually need to be tested in the courts. Then we have the question of who pays for the court to decide what is right and what is wrong. Is it the government, aka the taxpayer? Is it the customer, the client, the consumer? Is it the financial adviser? Whichever way, someone is going to lose, and generally the person who loses will be the one who can least afford it, possibly the taxpayer. This uncertainty with respect to the best interest duty could lead, the association says, to a rise in professional indemnity premiums. The association wants to adequately ensure that the ban on conflicted remuneration is not applied retrospectively. Fourth, the government has repeatedly pledged that its proposed legislation will not be applied retrospectively, yet the transitional arrangements fundamentally fail to ensure this. We have heard that word 'transition' used so often by the government. They are always transitioning something, and it is a transition from something that is decent and good and working to something that is not decent or good or working. The word is 'transition' or 'transformation'. That is the government's way. It is the Labor way of doing things-no thought whatsoever. Any change to the law should still allow an adviser to sell their business or a book of clients without triggering a retrospective loss of property rights. This will have an adverse effect on the value of advice practices, and again that is so crucial in regional Australia. Finally, the association has called for a delay in the start of the legislation until the industry is adequately prepared-1 July 2013 has been mooted. FoFA involves expensive and lasting changes. This will require significant system alterations and adviser training. For these companies, particularly in regional Australia, adviser training is often an expensive and onerous thing. Sometimes they need to go to metropolitan areas, and that involves aeroplane fares, accommodation and people being away from the business at busy times. When these things are brought in, they always hit regional Australia in the neck. Rushed implementation will cause errors and inefficiency, which the industry does not need, given the fact that it is dealing with people's money-in some cases, people's lifetime investments. Given the ongoing legislative uncertainty, 1 July 2012 is an administrative impossibility. But we have seen so many things that the government are rushing through, so many things that they want to get done by 1 July 2012Ms Hall: Absolutely, and you're trying to prevent democracy. democracy, and I am sure a lot of members of the public agree. I will take that interjection. The association's demands are not unreasonable. Any reforms in this area must find the right balance between suitable levels of consumer protection and the need to safeguard the ongoing accessibility, affordability and availability of high-quality financial advice. This needs to happen not just in metropolitan areas but also in regional Australia. Labor has failed to accomplish an appropriate balance with FoFA because it did not meet its own internal process requirements around best practice regulation. There is nothing surprising there. The government falls short in so many areas. It probably thinks, 'Why should financial reform be any different to any other policy area?' Labor's mismanagement of this legislation was exposed by the damning assessment of the FoFA proposals by the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation. How utterly embarrassing for this government. This government has been embarrassed so many times in recent weeks and months. The trouble is it is always the voters-the people who are paying this government's way with their hard-earned taxes-who are being caught out, being penalised. These Labor reforms are just another example of that. They are a sad and terrible indictment, given the complexity and associated costs of the proposed changes, especially the highly controversial and contentious aspects of these bills. There is no precedent in the world for introducing the sort of additional red tape which will follow the government's opt-in proposal. There is no precedent in the whole wide world. But have we not heard that before? To my mind, it sounds similar to the Clean Energy Bill-the carbon tax-where Australia will set the benchmark and our citizens will be poorer because of it. We hear all the time that it is a carbon pricing mechanism. I beg to differ; it is a tax. The people out there know that it is a tax and Labor in here know it is a tax, but they refuse to call it what it is. It is not carbon pricing; it is a tax. The coalition has made 16 recommendations-reasoned, well thought out, industry backed proposals-as to how the current FoFA amendments can be improved and strengthened. The 16 suggestions are consistent with those in the dissenting report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. They make good sense. They will help customers, Mr and Mrs Average, who use financial advisers to help them with their savings and investments in these challenging times. They will help the industry, which plays such an important role in Australian society today. The Labor government just needs to take them on board. (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the cognate Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. The financial services and advice industry provides a very important service to many Australians. It helps Australians with their financial health and well-being. Financial advisers help Australians to manage financial risks and maximise the financial opportunities available in today's economy. But we must always remember that financial advice, like any other form of advice, is only an opinion or a",234,Bills
306,Mr Mccormack,"Well, I find that your government is all hypocrisy and no",236,Bills
307,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (16:52,"I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendmentrecommendation offered as a guide. No financial opinion or recommendation can ever be perfect. For example, look at American economist Mr Alan Greenspan, who served as Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board from 1987 to 2006. He was a man credited with masterminding the postwar boom, who had a track record of demonstrating that there was hardly anyone else in the world more qualified to provide financial advice. But, following the GFC, Mr Greenspan admitted that he had been partially wrong. He said: … I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is, but I have been very distressed by that fact. When questioned further about his ideology and his opinion of the economy and economic advice, he said that his ideology was not working. … that’s precisely the reason I was shocked, because I had been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well. That reminds us that even the most qualified economists and financial advisers give just that-advice, which sometimes may not be in the best interests of their clients. The coalition recognises the role that financial advisers play in helping Australians to better manage the financial risks and to maximise the financial opportunities. In providing this service, financial advisers actually deal with other people's money. That is the reason why we must have an appropriate robust regulatory framework in place to ensure effective consumer protection and to ensure that high-quality services can be made available at a low cost and that they are accessible and affordable. The financial services sector came through the GFC in reasonably good shape. But, like anything, there is always room for improvement. In pursuing any regulatory change, we must focus on making things better, not just more complex and not just creating more red tape and not just making it more costly for everyone. We must avoid any regulatory overreach where increased red tape increases costs for both business and consumers with no additional consumer protection or benefit. But, sadly, like so much we have seen from this government, this is flawed legislation, arising from a flawed process. The reform package was simply hijacked by vested interests after more than two years of unnecessary regulatory uncertainty and upheaval for our financial services industry. Confidence in our financial services industry requires that there be transparency, choice and competition. Unfortunately, these bills provide absolutely none of those three. We need to also make sure we are striking the right balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection-but again these bills fail. I would like to quickly go through a few areas where the coalition believes that these bills fail. Firstly, they are unnecessarily complex and in large parts unclear. Secondly, they are expected to cause an actual increase in unemployment. Thirdly, they legislate to enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst advice providers, inappropriately favouring a government friendly business model against the interests of small business in the financial planning area. Fourthly, the reforms in this legislation are likely to cost about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum to comply with, and they are conservative industry estimates. I come to a few specifics about the impact of these bills on financial advice. Industry participants have expressed serious concerns about the detrimental effect that this legislation will have in its current form. The committee that investigated these bills received evidence from the Financial Services Council that the government's proposed changes would cost the industry $700 million to implement upfront and $350 million every year thereafter. I think the comments from Mr Richard Klipin, the chief executive officer of the Association of Financial Advisers, are worth reading. He suggests that the total job losses resulting from this legislation could exceed 30,000. He states: In conclusion, FoFA, as it stands, will decimate the financial advice profession. Over 6,800 adviser jobs are at risk and over 30,000 jobs in total. This excludes the businesses they support in the communities they serve and the clients they service. A piece of legislation that inflicts this amount of damage is unacceptable. He is exactly right. He continued: FoFA as it stands will also increase the cost of advice to consumers. He goes on to say: This committee has already had evidence that FoFA will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to comply with-and this is just for the product providers at the big end of town. It will also decimate the provision of financial advice to clients in the bush and the regions. Advice will … become a service for the wealthy, and working families and lowerto middle-income Australians who really need advice will be priced out of the marketplace. That comment alone shows why this legislation should at least be put on the backburner. I further offer some comments about financial advisers from AMP, who have expressed concern that these reforms would actually increase the concentration of players in the market and lessen competition. A representative of AMP stated: … I think there is likely to be a migration of advisers to large players like AMP. So, despite the fact that we think there is some competitive advantage in the advice industry for this legislation to companies like my own, we do not believe it is in the broader interests of the financial advice industry that there should be what we think is likely, which would be a consolidation of advisers. Further, Mr Grahame Evans, the Group General Manager of Professional Investment Services, stated: Australia did not get to be the No. 1 financial services hub in the world and respected by everybody else because we were anticompetitive. I think this is an important aspect of FoFA. We have to make sure that, in our rush to protect the consumer, there is a balance between the objectives of being able to give the consumer appropriate protection and not reducing the competition that is out there in the marketplace. We have seen the dangers of increasing market concentration in many sectors of our economy and we have learnt from the mistakes. We have seen the problems our supermarket sector and we have seen the problems in the trucking industry all relating to increasing market concentration. Unfortunately, that is what we see these bills doing. We see an increasing market concentration in the provision of financial advice whereby we risk creating financial planning services that are too big to fail. Australia simply did not get to be the No. 1 financial services hub in the world and respected by everybody else because we were anticompetitive. I think this is an important aspect. We have to make sure that, in our rush to protect the consumer, we create a balance between the objectives of being able to give the consumer an appropriate level of protection and not reducing the competition that is out there in the marketplace, so not resulting in increasing market concentration. That is simply another reason why these bills in their current form should be opposed. Another reason why these bills should be opposed is the unrealistic implementation time frame. As it stands, this legislation will actually become effective on 1 July this year, a little more than three months away. The current implementation time of a little more than three months is completely unrealistic, creating great uncertainty for the industry. Businesses will need to change processes, they will need to change software and they will need to train advisers-all before business has even seen the regulations. Three months is simply too short a period of time. A few interesting comments concern the problem that it will all create. If we try and bring this legislation in and enforce this on our financial services industry in three months, we will create havoc. There will be mistakes made. It will all cost the industry likely even more than the $700 million estimate of implementation. What we should be actually doing, as the coalition has recommended, is this: even if the government thinks this legislation in its current form is the right way to go, its implementation should be postponed to 1 July 2013 so the changes are synchronised with the start of MySuper. In this way, it will make it much easier for the industry to work through these changes, to accept them and to make sure they are implemented on the lowest cost basis. Another great problem with this legislation is the opt-in provisions. These opt-in provisions will add unnecessary additional costs and create red tape. The government's proposed twoyearly opt-in provisions will make it questionable whether they actually provide any consumer benefit. There is simply no precedent for these opt-in provisions and this increase in red tape anywhere else in the world, yet this is what this government is trying to do. Evidence received during the inquiry expressed concerns about the negative consequences which may flow to consumers who do not opt in within the required 30-day period. That is even though they may have intended to continue with their financial advice relationship and may even have assumed that the relationship was ongoing. Even where the lack of opt-in is inadvertent, clients are automatically deemed to have ended their financial advice relationship. In its submission, the Financial Planning Association expressed its concerns as follows: Unfortunately, the legislation in its current form does not provide adequate protection to financial advice clients where 'the disclosure obligation' or 'renewal notice obligation' is not satisfied by the financial planner/licensee. This is because, by virtue of the default, the client will no longer be considered to be an 'advice client' if the planner does not receive the client's opt-in renewal notice within the 30day period. This may be completely contrary to what the client understands may be the relationship and could have significant ramifications at a later date when the client attempts to seek compensation from their planner for not advising them of changes to the law or market movements that may affect their financial position. This also affects many of the small business financial planners out there. It affects the value of their business. They may have built up a business with customers, built up a personal relationship, but if this automatic opt-out provision is there, where another form needs to be sent out, it diminishes the value of their business, because those clients automatically fall away from being their clients if that customer fails to fill that form out. I'm sure that we all know the number of forms that we get through the mail to fill out every day. If this legislation goes through, by simply failing to fill out one of those forms, which often a consumer would put aside and think was unnecessary, they are automatically be opted out of that financial planner's advice. This is simply another reason why this bill should be opposed. Another problem is with the retrospective fee disclosure statements, because these were not part of the government's proposed changes until the very last minute. It was a last-minute throw-in that was done without any consultation with the industry, without any discussions of the ramifications or the unintended consequences that would result. Mr Richard Klipin, Chief Executive Officer of the AFA, told the committee investigating this bill: Fee disclosure statements were never part of the conversation and never part of the consultation. They jumped in at the last minute and are retrospective. They are a redundant item and will just cost endless amounts of time and money and will be one of the reasons why a lot of advisers will focus on the higher value clients at the expense of low and middle income Australians. This is why this bill is deeply flawed. Financial planning and advice is a very complex area. To throw in such late changes at the last minute, without proper consultation with the industry, without consideration for their consequences, simply is a reason why we have ended up with such a flawed bill. There are many other problems with this bill. The coalition has put forward 16 recommendations. We ask the government to use common sense and reason and at least hold this bill off for another 12 months. Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (17:07): The Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011, which is before us and is being debated cognately with the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011, has been considered in the short time we have had to go through the bill as it stands. Whilst the bill has some merit, it definitely does need not tinkering but major changes to it. In fact, we have come up with 16 amendments that we wish the government would consider. If they were to consider these amendments, we would have no hesitation in supporting the bill through the House. In its current form it is an extension from 2001, where the government of the day-John Howard's government-provided a solid regulatory foundation for our financial services industry. Since then a lot of things have changed. We admit that changes need to be made and there is always room for improvement. If the coalition's amendments go through and are adopted into the bill it would be great for the people in the industry. In my seat of Flynn there are many financial advisers. There have been many financial advisers living with the communities in the business world that have been there as a normal part of doing business. A lot of people rely on financial services because they do not have time to go through all sorts of legislation and investment advice. When you have been out mustering cattle all day or out branding you might be away from the homestead for many days. The last thing you want to do is come back to your home to do paperwork. That is what country folk have had to base their business on over the years. They have had to become more and more astute with government policies and legislation. People in the financial services sector are there to help them, and a lot of financial advisers are very concerned about what is in store if we were to disrupt this type of business. The bill was first mooted over two years ago and only came to the House's attention in February this year. That does not give anyone too much time to scrutinise the bill, to go through it to see what changes have to be made. As the member for Hughes has just said, software staff have to be trained. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, we are flat out getting staff in the Central Queensland area. It is very difficult for these businesses to get new staff and to train them on updates to software packages. We strongly suggest that the whole bill not come into force until 1 July 2013 along with the MySuper policy. It makes sense to us on this side of the House that the two acts commence on 1 July 2013, not 1 July 2012. We need to set up hotlines to help these people through the changes. March has nearly gone and that does not leave much time for industry as a whole to make these vast changes to the regulations. Reform is going to be bogged down in red tape and it is also going to be costly. It is estimated that the cost will be $700 million in the first year of these changes and $350 million each year after that. You can see it is not going to be expense-free for the government or for industry. If we could spread it out over a little further time and adopt these 16 amendments it will serve everyone in Australia much better. We do not want to see what happened in the Storm Financial disaster-there were some other companies involved in that too. The company was based in Townsville and people from Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Gladstone took the brunt of that loss. I know many people in Rockhampton and Gladstone who were hit and lost their life savings. It was a very bad thing. Nonetheless, it has happened and we are still going through why it happened and what can stop it from happening again. That is why this bill is important and it is important that we get it right. We will probably have to face job losses if the financial companies have to wind back. While those people in our area can soon get another job it is different for other people around Australia. They might find it hard to get jobs in the financial world if the banks cut back their services, as they are. The banks are starting to lay off people. If financial advisers start to lay off their staff, there could be a crisis in that particular area of employment. As the member for Hughes has said, will it favour the big companies and not the little guys? Under this bill, we think there will be inequities and the smaller players will be bowled over and will have to leave the market, and that the big guys will be favoured. We think that will be a tragedy for our area. There are not too many with the big corporate companies in our area. The playing field will be uneven, and I would not like to lose the smaller players from the financial services sector. It is good to pick up the phone and call someone you know in your home town and have a good yarn about what is happening in the financial world, what is happening in the share market, what to invest or what to divest and so on. It is day to day for these guys. But with large corporations you do not have the ability to pick up the phone and say: 'Hello, Tom. How are you going? What should I be doing? ShouldI be investing in gold? ShouldI be investing in silver, the metals or the share market, or just keep the money in the bank?' The trouble is even if you do not have any wealth, you still need them. For young people it is difficult to get finance for housing. Once upon a time, if you had a good bank account or good cash flow, you could get a bank loan. Now there is a more serious approach and you need a good job and you need to be investing in a good business or a good asset. The banks will no longer take just one of those; they need both. They require a good cash plan and good assets to back up the loan. This is where the financial adviser comes in. A young person might even have a good education, but they still need financial advisers and providers to help them through the maze to get finance for their new home or small business. At the moment, small business is on the nose with the banks. I would like to see this changed. The help of financial providers can point young people in the right direction. The implementation time frame is 1 July 2012 and there is inadequate information available. It has not gone through the House yet, so the financial advisers will not be left with much time to make some very important decisions for themselves, their businesses and the people whom they service. Who knows when this bill will go through. We do not sit for another five or six weeks and that takes us another month or so closer to 1 July, when this legislation will take effect. That is why we say that we want to put it back at least 12 months to 1 July 2013. We oppose the opt-in section. It was not even a recommendation of the Ripoll inquiry, but the government wants to bring this opt-in clause into the act straight away. We do not support that. It is one of the 16 things we want changed in the legislation. The retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirements is another thing we would like changed. We would also like to see improvement in the drafting of the best interest duty. The ban of commissions on risk insurance also has to be further refined. There needs to be much more clarity for financial providers. That is all I have to say, but I plead with the government to delay the implementation of this bill a further 12 months and to take up all 16 of our recommendations. Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 are sound. They aim to improve the quality of financial advice while building trust and confidence in the financial planning industry through enhanced standards which align the interests of the adviser with those of the client and reduce conflicts of interest. The bills aim to facilitate access to financial advice through the provision of simple or limited advice. They also aim to create a requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of clients and a ban on conflicted remuneration. Many of those are very sound principles. Our concern is that the government, in putting forward a package to try to meet these objectives, has gone too far. As it currently stands, the legislation will lead to increased costs and reduced choice for Australians seeking financial advice. So we have put forward a number of amendments, and it is these amendments which we would like to discuss today. Our amendments seek to get the balance right, with a sensible regulatory framework providing appropriate levels of consumer protection while ensuring financial advice remains available, accessible and affordable. This is because we recognise the important service provided by financial advisers helping people to improve their financial health and well-being. The reforms we are debating today have their origins in the 2009 Ripoll inquiry. This inquiry into financial products and services made a number of well-considered and reasonable reform recommendations. The pivotal point was to require financial advisers to put their clients' interests above their own-a very sensible point. Had the government proceeded in this direction and just agreed to the basic recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry, I think the bills would have received bipartisan support. Some of the recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry included making the cost of financial advice tax deductable for consumers; getting ASIC to work together with the industry to form a professional standards board that advisers would be required to join; giving additional powers to ASIC; and having the government investigate options for a last resort compensation scheme.",236,Bills
308,Mr Tudge (Aston) (17:21,"The objectives of the Corporations Amendment (Future ofAll the industry bodies supported the committee's recommendations in the Ripoll inquiry and, as I said, had the government limited its legislation to matters which were recommended in the Ripoll inquiry then this legislation would have received bipartisan support. But it did not do that and that is why we are here today putting forward a number of amendments which we believe will improve the legislation. These include amendments for: the government to be required to table a regulatory impact statement; the opt-in to be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement to be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty to be improved; the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super to be further refined; and the implementation of FoFA to be deferred a year until 1 July 2013, to align it with MySuper. I do not want to go through every single one of the 16 amendments. I want to focus on three of the more important ones. The first is the amendment which requires the government to undertake a regulatory impact statement. We believe that is important, given the very heavy financial cost imposed on the industry by the proposed changes and the associated potential for job losses. As an absolute minimum, there should be a regulatory impact statement done on this, which would comply with the government's own best practice regulation requirements in other areas. The parliament should insist on a proper regulatory impact statement before dealing with any of these bills. Based on the evidence provided to the committee, the coalition committee members concluded that this legislation would lead to increased costs and reduced choice for Australians seeking financial advice. In pursuing regulatory changes, the government must rigorously assess increasing costs and red tape for both business and consumers. The second issue is the opt-in provisions, which we believe should be removed, and one of our amendments would implement that. The coalition does not support the government's push to force people to re-sign contracts with their financial adviser every year through a so called opt-in process. This would add an unnecessary regulatory burden, imposing too much additional cost for both small business and consumers, for questionable additional benefit. It would create additional red tape. Financial advisers would have to spend an inordinate amount of time chasing up contract renewals. According to Treasury, there would be increased costs for the average financial advisory firm of about $100,000 every year if the opt-in provisions go ahead. It will be small businesses and individuals who pay the cost. The move will add to the Australia-wide problem of underinsurance, and a large proportion of people may well miss out on advice at a time when they need it most. The third area is the proposed ban of commissions on risk insurance. We do not support the ban. Our view is borne out by the experience in the UK when they went down this path. They have since reversed the move. Like opt-in, banning commissions on risk insurance would make the problem of underinsurance in Australia worse, as access to risk insurance would become much more expensive upfront. I have been approached by a number of concerned constituents from the industry in relation to that provision in the draft bill. One of them, Garry, puts it well when he says: When I provide advice to my clients or would be clients, they are not required to pay for the advice received. If they proceed with the insurance recommended, and an application for insurance is accepted, then we receive a commission. This covers my costs and provides my remuneration. In the service I provide, I do not discriminate, be it a large client with significant needs, or a smaller client whose needs and ability to pay premiums are modest, the service provided is the same. The bigger client has needs and if asked would be able to afford a fee for my time, the smaller clients whose needs are just as important to them, may struggle to obtain advice if a fee had to be paid. Garry illustrates his point with an anecdote which, to my mind, characterises best practice with regard to fees and commissions. He reports: Last year a client of mine died in tragic circumstances at work. We assisted his widow with all of the necessary paperwork for the claims process. This was made much longer than was reasonable as the coroner was delayed in handing down a final decision due to delays in obtaining toxicology results. Despite this, with constant and regular follow up by our office, we were able to obtain a release of the much needed life Insurance proceeds, enabling her to own her home and get on with her life and care for her young children. The client paid no fees at all for our work and nor should she. It's our job. Being paid commissions for new sales and on renewals of existing insurance we are able to offer a high level of service to all our clients, and when assistance is needed we are able to do so. I think that is a very good anecdote. It illustrates the type of service that would be at risk if were to go down this path of banning commissions on risk insurance. There are a number of other issues which we have identified with the draft bill. We on this side have pointed out that it is unnecessarily complex and many parts remain unclear. We have pointed out the problem that it may lead to underinsurance in the industry. We have pointed out the problem that it may lead to further job losses, something that we do not need at this time of job insecurity. The amendments which we have put forward are sensible amendments. There are 16 in total. I have emphasised three of them today and other members on our side of the chamber have emphasised other amendments. We believe that they would make some sensible improvements to the draft bill. If those amendments were agreed to by the government, then we would support the bill. If those amendments, on the other hand, are not agreed to by the government, then it would be very difficult for the coalition to support the legislation as it is, due to the problems which I and my colleagues have outlined. We are always prepared to consider sensible proposals to improve the regulatory framework for financial services. However, to get the coalition's support, proposed changes have to be focused on addressing genuine issues, be practical and make things better. We simply ask that the government put its legislation through the proper scrutiny and deal with the clear and obvious problems by taking on our sensible amendments. Then we will support this legislation, but in its current form we are unable to do so. Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation for the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I have only one complaint, and that is about the English used. It says: Platforms should be incentivised to put the most appropriate products on their menus. 'Incentivise' is not a word and never has been. As members have pointed out today, this is a really important issue. Mr Tudge has just said these are important issues for Australian people; they are important for people who are heading towards retirement and for people in the earlier years of their lives as well. When we use a word like 'incentivise' or 'incentivisation', we are bastardising the language to the point where it offends me greatly. Having got that off my chest, I will now talk about the legislation.",242,Bills
309,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (17:32,"I have just read the second reading speech of theThese issues are a matter of extreme importance to this parliament. They are a matter of importance to both sides of the House. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' work and report were excellent. The opposition has put forward some very reasonable recommendations, not with the intent of opposing whatever the government is doing but with the intent of making in a bipartisan way this legislation better for all concerned, both for the financial advisers and their clients. That is what these amendments that the coalition is putting forward are all about. Having described that situation, it is important now that we discuss why this all came about in the first place. Every one of us knows somebody who has lost nearly all their savings after getting some inappropriate advice. Did they take that decision on their own? Yes, they did. Did they receive that advice and therefore take the risk? Did they perhaps go for a rather higher interest rate than was being offered by the banks or the general market? Yes, they did. Is it our own fault sometimes when we are greedy? Yes it is. Having said that, we genuinely want to go to people who have the knowledge and the ability to point us in the right direction as to how we can maximise our retirement benefits, our income at the time or our savings. As parliamentarians, when something goes wrong, people say: 'What did you do about it? What are you doing about it? How could these people possibly lose this money in this country? How could the financial advisers do the things that they did without the knowledge of the client?'-as in the Storm collapse. As I understand it, even some of the Storm clients did not know they were reinvesting at that rate. I am not a financial expert, but I know that things went badly wrong to the point where people lost everything. They did not just lose their savings that they had invested; they lost the houses they had been put up as the basis for their loan. The government and the parliament have responded through our processes. For those who are listening, the process is that there was an issue of concern about the prudential status of financial planners and the way they went about their work. That needed to be addressed in some way, so the parliament addressed it through a committee of inquiry. There was an extensive inquiry with submissions from all over the country and from everyone who had possibly been involved in the process. That is how parliament works. I note that there was a dissenting report by the coalition members on that inquiry, who thought there should be further emphasis on other areas around the issue. That is part of the process of what we do too. You can have a dissenting report by saying, 'I agree with most of what the committee has put up, but we are going to make a dissenting report on these areas,' which I may outline in a moment. The coalition have said that we support the fact that we need to address some of the issues on behalf of the people and we need regulations therefore to protect the consumer. Yes, we must bring in regulations that protect the consumer, but they must not cost them in the long run and we should not put more red tape into the system, making it more difficult and more expensive for the provider of the service and the receiver of the service to go through the process. We should never remove the flexibility from the client, not the service provider, to access part of the services and not the whole package. Under this legislation, I understand they have to go through a whole financial package. The client should be able to access just parts of the service, especially if it is the first time they have gone to a financial planner. Quite often people go to a financial planner and are overwhelmed by a need for a huge financial plan for their family when they only went there to get some advice on a specific investment. We should allow flexibility and I do not think this legislation allows enough flexibility. There has to be a pathway for people who have not had this advice before to go to a financial adviser without any sort of commitment, get advice and pay upfront. It is clear and open, and they know what it is going to cost to get some advice or to have one or two hours with the financial adviser. We are concerned that it may be that the financial adviser pushes a product-and this has happened in the past-that may be beneficial to the financial adviser unbeknown to the client, where the client thinks they are getting the best advice. It does not matter whether we are looking at real estate agents or lawyers; we like to know and trust that those people are absolutely working on our behalf as the client. This parliament wants a focus on the consumer that says, 'To the best of our ability as a parliament-not necessarily as a government or as an opposition-we will try to give you the regulatory framework so that you can get the best advice in this country, and Australia then becomes a world leader in this process.' I think the emphasis behind what the government has done here is right. They are really trying hard to get this framework right for the benefit of the client and those who are providing the service. The opposition has said, 'We support your bill as long as you have a look at and address the amendments we have put forward.' That is not a big ask. Because this is such a complicated area, the amendments are listed as to what we would like considered. I am sure the minister would be prepared to consider those arrangements if he felt they were beneficial and improved the legislation. These amendments are not put in to make the legislation poorer or less safe; they are put in so that the system may work better on behalf of the clients represented here. Remember, we are not talking about a few hundred people. We are talking about nearly everybody across the nation. People are always looking for advice on financial planning: 'How can we do this better? Where are there areas that I am not involved in that I could be involved in that may be beneficial for the existing wealth that we share now and perhaps the generations that I will be passing my wealth on to?' I do not want to say, ever, that there is not a group of people out there who do not need our support-our helping hand. They will always be there and we, as members of parliament, acknowledge that. There are others who have worked very hard and have accumulated some wealth. They would like some advice as to how they might use that wealth. We recognise that too. From that point of view, if you drive anywhere in this country, especially up the far north, you see people who have done very, very well. In this last 10 to 15 years, wherever you go, you see beautiful developments and people doing quite well, as opposed to those who may be struggling. We recognise too that we have people who struggle and we do our best as a community to benefit them in ways such as through the taxation system and our welfare system. We look after them as best we can but we can do better. But the nation's wealth overall has improved dramatically. I do not care where you go in this country, you will see that Australia-as compared with the rest of the world-is a very wealthy nation with individuals who are very wealthy. I would like to think that the government will look at these amendments from the opposition, takes them seriously, address itself to these issues and see if we can work together to get the best outcome on this legislation that we possibly can. In the end, the bottom line is that we want to leave this place with legislation that is better than when we came in. Whoever is in government, there is an underlying intent that we do the best for the Australian people that we possibly can, and this is one of the best examples I have come across. If we can get this regulatory framework right, we can benefit family after family, generation after generation. It is not a big ask that we work together to get the best outcome here. We will never, ever, protect ourselves from a shyster but at least we can put together the best framework we can to stop the shysters. There are a lot of very good people across this nation working as financial advisers and they have benefited thousands upon thousands of people and their families. All we ever hear of are the worse examples of advice. Even in the minister's second reading speech he says that we cannot stop every failing of the system. All we can ever do is to give it our best shot. He does not actually say that in those words, but he is virtually saying that we can give it our best shot. SoI would like to see in this legislation that we give it our best shot to get the best arrangements we possibly can, and I would ask in that process that the government look at the opposition's amendments without threat and just ask 'Can these amendments be accommodated?' because it would be one piece of legislation that I would like to see go through the parliament with bipartisan support. I think that is all I need to say. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (17:45): As stated by the government, the purpose of the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011, which is being debated cognately with the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011, is to tackle conflicts of interest within the financial planning industry in an effort to restore the confidence and trust of retail investors following the fallout from Storm Financial, Opes Prime, Westpoint and the like. The key test for the success of FoFA, supported by the coalition and peak industry bodies, will be improved transparency and increased access to advice as a consequence of these reforms. In its current draft the first will be achieved but the bill will fail to deliver the second. Advice will come at a higher cost and be provided to fewer people. This legislation is unnecessarily complex and unclear, is expected to increase unemployment and legislates unfair advantage to certain service providers, inappropriately favouring a government-friendly business model. It would be incredible if fewer Australians received advice because of these reforms. The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has stated on a number of occasions that FoFA has broad industry support. This is largely the case. However, the coalition, and indeed the financial services industry, hold many concerns, addressed comprehensively in the coalition's dissenting report. Evidence before the recent Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in its inquiry into this legislation confirmed our view that the legislation in its current form would be bad for consumers, bad for small business, bad for small business financial advisers and bad for the industry as a whole. It would unnecessarily increase red tape and increase costs for business and consumers while reducing choice, as well as reducing competition and diversity across the financial services industry. In February 2009 the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services conducted a comprehensive inquiry into Australian financial products and services. The centrepiece of the Ripoll inquiry's report was the recommendation to introduce fiduciary duty for financial advisers, requiring them to place their clients interests ahead of their own. The Financial Services Council of Australia welcomed this report and has welcomed the majority of the reforms these bills offer. The industry already strives for higher standards for financial advisers, embraces a best-interest duty and wants the end of remuneration structures that have the potential to distort advice. These elements of the FoFA bills are important for the customer but also significant for the future growth and stability of the industry. Very constructively, the coalition has made a series of recommendations on how FoFA can be improved and progressed from here. The coalition will be moving a series of amendments, including that the government be required to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA consistent with the government's own process requirements. This must be done before anything else. Given the magnitude of the changes and the costs involved, it is imperative that a proper regulatory impact statement with a proper cost-benefit analysis be completed. According to the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation the government did not have before it adequate information to assess the impact of FoFA on business and customers-or, indeed, adequate information to assess the cost-benefit of the proposed changes. This simply is not satisfactory, given the complexity and costs associated with the contentious parts of the proposed changes. The minister must remove the contentious elements of this legislation and proceed with the important and widely supported FoFA reforms. The minister must remove the opt-in obligation, as it imposes unnecessary additional red tape and costs that are not reflected in any other industry or country. The imposition of a mandatory requirement on customers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis is unreasonable and incurs costs for both planners and consumers. Remember, opt-in was never a part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations. And the government has been unable to point to another example anywhere in the world where a government has sought to impose a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. The coalition is strongly opposed to this element of the bills before the House. The inclusion of the best interests duty and the ban on conflicted remuneration address any factors that may have driven the inclusion of this clause. They offer appropriate transparency of fees charged and an ongoing capacity for clients of financial advisers to opt out of any advice relationship at any stage. This offers adequate consumer protection. Left without amendment consumers face increased costs and reduced access to appropriate advice as advisers reposition their offerings to the market to maintain turnover and productivity. Consumers will stop receiving advice or not seek advice at all. In relation to removing the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement, again, the Ripoll inquiry made no recommendation to introduce an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided to clients. This requirement in fact infringes on existing contractual arrangements and information that is already provided to clients. Failure to amend these measures will see a huge cost burden on industry for information consumers already receive. The Financial Services Council estimates that implementation of the fee disclosure requirement alone will cost approximately $54 for each new client and $98 for each existing client-an annual cost to the industry of $375 million. Like all costs these will be passed straight to the consumer. The government must be held to account for the commitment it made during the consultation process that these additional annual fee disclosure requirements would apply prospectively only. Regarding improving the drafting of the best interest duty, the coalition supports the introduction of a statutory best interest duty for financial advisers into the Corporations Act. This is a central and very important part of the FoFA reforms. However, to avoid confusion and minimise the risk of future disputes it is important to get the drafting of the best interest duty absolutely right. Peak industry body the Association of Financial Advisers also support the best interest duty. But they too seek greater clarity and certainty for financial advisers. It is obvious that the government has struggled to come up with an appropriate definition of the best interest duty. The coalition remains concerned that a catch-all provision will create uncertainty for both clients and their advisers. Proposed section 961B(2) defines a series of steps that are comprehensive in their definition and provide unambiguous guidance to advisers. However, paragraph (g) allows for any other steps that would be reasonably regarded as being in the best interests of the client. If there are further steps the legislation must clearly state so. They should be included in their entirety and paragraph (g) removed. Left as is, this section creates uncertainty that will eventually be tested in the courts. And, again, this section will lead to higher costs to the customer as ambiguity is likely to result in an increase in professional indemnity premiums. Regarding further refining the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside superannuation, the coalition supports the ban of conflicted remuneration structures such as product commissions within the financial services industry and commends the industry for moving proactively and effectively to abolish such conflicted remuneration structures. However, we do not consider commissions paid on advised risk insurance inside or outside superannuation to be conflicted remuneration structures. Again the government's own Ripoll inquiry did not make any recommendation to ban commissions paid for by risk insurance products. Banning such commissions will increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off, particularly small business people who self-manage their super. To treat commissions on all risk insurance inside super differently from insurance outside super will also create inappropriate distortions which will fail to be in the best interests of customers. We agree that those Australians who receive automatic risk insurance within their super fund without accessing any advice should not be required to pay commissions. However, those Australians who require and seek advice to ensure adequate risk cover, whether inside or outside of their super fund, should have the freedom to do so. We must also ensure that the ban on conflicted remuneration is not applied retrospectively. We must delay the implementation of FoFA to 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper. The current implementation time frame of 1 July 2012 is completely unrealistic given that the proposed commencement date is less than four months away. Given the ongoing legislative uncertainty, implementation by this time is surely impossible. These two major changes require significant and expensive changes to the same financial service provider's IT systems and adviser training. It is the government's lack of understanding of practical business realities that sees it attempt to impose two different implementation dates involving significant and costly system changes in relatively quick succession. It is symptomatic of the government's chaotic approach not only to this policy area but to all legislation. Ultimately, the government must see that consumers' best interests must determine the timing of these reforms. Dante De Gori of the Financial Planning Association of Australia told the Senate Economics Committee that his organisation supported a one-year transition and implementation of the scheme, emphasising the reforms had to be 'implemented accurately, while ensuring they are workable'. A one-year transition will 'allow all financial planners the time needed to implement these reforms in a transparent and efficient way'. The coalition agrees with this observation and, if amended, these regulations should not commence until 1 July 2013. At a time when our population is ageing, growing superannuation balances mean Australians will need more and better financial advice. We must ensure that the implementation costs of these bills do not come at the expense of product development, in particularly post-retirement products. But the current regulatory change makes it hard for companies to allocate budgets to these projects. Over the past two years there have been continual and unexpected changes to the proposed regulatory arrangements under FoFA right up until the introduction of the current legislation. Companies are keen to develop better retirement products, but they cannot spend money on that if they have to spend money on FoFA. The current draft of this legislation will significantly and negatively impact not only customers but, most importantly, older and retired customers. The Australian financial services industry performed very well in the stress test of the GFC. When it comes to providing financial advice in our region, the Australian market is considered best practice, with established industry bodies and licensed advisers with specific training. And efforts to professionalise financial advice and planning in Australia go back many years. There is no doubt that financial services reforms legislated in 2001 provided a solid regulatory foundation for our financial services industry. But there is always room for improvement. The financial services minister and cross-bench members must seriously consider the coalition's amendments and support them. The original intent of the FoFA reforms should be adhered to, ensuring that all financial advice is in the client's best interests and financial advice should not be put out of reach of those who would benefit from it. Our goal must be to balance effective consumer protection with access to high-quality financial services that are available, accessible and affordable. We must avoid regulatory overreach that increases red tape and costs for both business and consumers with little or no additional consumer protection benefit. I call on the House to adopt the coalition's constructive recommendations and amendments to allow these important reforms to pass in a form that is beneficial both to industry and to the customer. Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I start with a note of thanks. This is a highly complex area, highly important. So many thousands of people's lives are affected by this decision, not only those receiving advice, most importantly, but also those that are giving the advice.

310,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (18:00,"I rise to contribute to the debate on the Corporationslike to begin my comments with a vote of thanks in particular to John McInerney, who is a financial planning consultant from Bentley and has given me enormous assistance, with invaluable, informed advice and insights from the coalface. He organised some 60 fellow professionals within the financial planning profession locally to gather with our shadow minister, Mathias Cormann. We had a 2½ hour session on the impacts of the legislation on their services and on the way they interact with their clients. It was a most valuable exercise. John has been in the financial planning industry since 1988, and before that spent 23 years as an educator, so he is a person with the sorts of qualities to be very effective, as he has been in providing advice to clients. He has also been an active participant in raising the standards in the profession, as a member of FPA's Towards Professionalism Task Force, and has assisted the Securities Institute of Australia to develop its financial planning course amongst the profession. I feel I had some very good guidance locally, meeting so many of them from the southern suburbs in Melbourne. It is certainly something that has greatly exercised the sector, and this legislation is very important. They are very proud of the profession that they are part of and the service that they give to individuals. I suspect that the one-on-one nature of the profession is something that elicits from so many of them a great desire to assist and ensure that the quality of life and the opportunities of their clients are maximised. You would expect that they are 'people people', and they are professionals who take great pleasure in seeing the success of others, because, if that happens, that means they have been successful. The coalition cannot support the future of financial advice bills in their current form. This is very unfortunate because, as we all know, a cross-party committee-the Ripoll committee-did some very solid work, coming up with a list of comprehensive, balanced recommendations that had the support of both sides of the House. Sadly the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, after several months of being influenced by other vested interests, has materially changed some recommendations and added other recommendations which we find unnecessary and in fact counterproductive and in particular serving the interests of one part of the industry-the industry funds. This reflects the continuing bias of the minister for workplace relations. I see him as the minister for unions in much of what he does. This is a very unfortunate development. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 18:26 to 18:40 House when there were quite wild and ridiculous assertions being made of undue influence, here we have in this very bill tonight a concrete example in legislation. A very strong bipartisan position has been derailed by the decisions of the minister, who has been quite clearly and unduly influenced by former colleagues and cronies within the union movement. It really is an unfortunate state of affairs that we have here a piece of such significant reform legislation which has been so sadly derailed, one which was agreed on by those who are very experienced and well credentialled on both sides of the House on these issues. Their agreement had laid out a series of comprehensive and quite effective measures that would have been dealt with in a bipartisan way. If this legislation were to be amended along the lines put forward by the coalition, we could return to a position of bipartisanship, instead of a",250,Bills

312,Mr Robb,"As I was saying before the division, it is a bit ironic that after a day in the position that will quite clearly benefit a certain sector of this industry in a most unfortunate way and will impact dramatically on the lives, the profession and the businesses of many thousands of people who are so strongly experienced in this sector. Unfortunately, the FoFA package of legislation in its current form is unnecessarily complex and in large part still quite unclear. It is expected to cause increased unemployment and it is legislating to enshrine what is really an unlevel playing field amongst advice providers while inappropriately favouring a government-friendly business model. It is likely to cost about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum to comply with, according to conservative industry estimates. To go from a position where there was industry and bipartisan support for a range of measures to one with all of those faults is quite unacceptable. I can understand what has happened but, for the life of me, I do not know how the minister can stand there with a straight face and support the measures he has now made decisions on. In some cases, as I have said, they are decisions which are still unclear about how the measures would operate-and I am not sure that he knows either. As it currently stands, the legislation will lead to quite significantly increased costs and reduced choice for Australians seeking financial advice. The coalition will be moving a series of amendments, the most important of which are that the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA which has been assessed as compliant by the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation. The level of regulatory impact of this bill is just beyond the pale. In the last 3½ to four years we have seen the greatest growth of government in our lives, and that includes the Whitlam era. This place is now awash with legislation despite the hand-on-heart commitments given by former Prime Minister Rudd, when in opposition, about one regulation in and another one out. I think it is currently something like 16,000 pieces of regulation in and at most 200 or 300and I think I am being generous-pieces of regulation out. We are awash with regulation and this bill will add another bucketful to the industry and massively increase costs. The opt-in arrangement should be removed from FoFA. It is something that was not part of the bipartisan agreement. The opt-in arrangement imposes a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. Not only is this a significant increase in red tape and cost for both planners and consumers, it will make Australia the world champion in financial services red tape. It was not part of the initial Ripoll inquiry recommendations. In this context it is important to note that the Industry Super Network provided, not surprisingly, the only submission to the original Ripoll inquiry, arguing in favour of opt-in. The proposal for a mandatory opt-in requirement was not accepted by that very comprehensive inquiry. The minister has been unable to point to another example anywhere in the world where the government has sought to impose a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. On our side of the House we strongly oppose Labor's push to force people to re-sign contracts with their advisers on such a basis. If you know anything about the nature of the industry and what functions within some of these Industry Super Network organisations you can see that they will have a very clear advantage. This is what it is there for: to siphon customers away from small business people who have spent a lifetime developing relationship and expertise and giving independent advice. They will be siphoned off into industry funds because of these sorts of arrangements. The industry funds can absorb a lot of this complicated procedure and they have other benefits that the small independent players may not such as connections with different policies and all the rest those things that will come into play. Again, all of that is within organisations-these industry funds-where there is no transparency about the directors who run the organisations and the salaries they get. These are the sorts of things that are commonplace within the corporate world. They are multibilliondollar industries and organisations that are responsible for billions in funds. We have this extraordinary situation where they are able to pull the levers of influence and not have any transparency. We had a day in the House on transparency and here is another perfect example where there is no attempt for real application of it. Yet one of the major recommendations of the Cooper inquiry was to shed some light on the inner workings of the sector so that there is more competition. When there is competition you get self-regulation in many respects, because the consumer is able to make their own judgments and they will discipline organisations by taking their business to where they see they will get the best opportunity. Amongst these amendments the coalition has moved-and for which we are looking for support-we also see proposals that the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement be removed; the drafting of the 'best interest' duty be improved; the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined; and the implementation of FoFA be delayed until 1 July 2013, to align with MySuper. Minister Shorten and the crossbench members should seriously consider these amendments. This industry provides important financial services and advice. It helps Australians with their financial health and well-being. Australians are becoming far more financially literate and far better able and prepared to seek advice and have an informed view themselves to balance up the advice they get from these advisers. The services are dealing with other people's money, which is why it is so important to have an appropriately robust regulatory framework in place. The framework worked satisfactorily through the global financial crisis. We think there is room for further improvement and that is why within the very comprehensive Ripoll committee inquiry we agreed to a raft of changes on a bipartisan basis with those on the other side of the House. Certain elements of it have been turned on their head for no good reason. There has been no justification. You just get an assertion from the minister that this is the way it is going to be, and you will cop it. Well, we are not going to cop it. If we do not get these amendments in place we are going to oppose these things so that we can protect the livelihoods of so many thousands of very strong and professional people(Time expired) Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and the Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011. I would like to emphasise this immediately: no-one in the coalition is saying that the financial services industry does not need regulation; of course it does. However, the Australian financial services industry was subjected to the stress-testing of the global financial crisis and performed well overall. There is no doubt that Australia's financial services reforms, legislated in 2001, provide the solid regulatory foundation for our financial services industry. Therefore the coalition believes that, with the existing legislature in place and increased resolve to police it, improvements can be made. This point of view was one of the key observations of the Ripoll inquiry in 2009, which stated:",251,Bills
313,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (18:49,"I rise to oppose the Corporations Amendment (Future ofThe committee is of the general view that situations where investors lose their entire savings because of poor financial advice are more often a problem of enforcing existing regulations, rather than being due to regulatory inadequacy. Where financial advisers are operating outside regulatory parameters, the consequences of those actions should not necessarily be attributed to the content of the regulations. This is an extremely important point to make from the beginning and it points to the philosophical differences between the coalition and the Left of Australian politics. When times are tough, when money is tight or when things go wrong, the coalition will look to work harder to improve the existing frameworks, tighten our belts and encourage others to do the same. Those on the other side of the parliament prefer to take the easier option of introducing new taxes or imposing even stricter regulations. This broadbrush approach to governance and fiscal policy is lazy. Instead of rolling up their sleeves and finding ways to improve, the Gillard-Greens alliance think it is easier to put their hands deeper into Australia's pockets than to change the rules of the game to prevent Australians from stopping them. The government's decision-making processes around FoFA over the past two years were confusing. There were lurches and changes that came from nowhere to the proposed regulatory arrangements under FoFA right up until the introduction of the current legislation. Knowing this government's track record, naturally this was done without proper appreciation or assessment of the costs involved of any unintended consequences or other implications flowing from the proposed alterations. The reason I am so passionate about this is that in my electorate of Hasluck there are 16 financial service providers serving hundreds of my constituents. They provide an essential service to the community, especially in the Western Australian economy where many people are taking advantage of the mining industry and taking home increased pay packets. Conversely, there are many people in Hasluck who have not been able to take advantage of the mining boom or who work in a different industry. With all the new taxes heading their way, financial advisers are actually reporting an increase in people looking to make their money work as hard as possible for them. Financial advisers help Australians to increase their financial opportunities and better manage their financial risk. Peter Stewart, of Benchmark Consultants, and David Goode, of Westate Finance are two that come to mind in Hasluck who provide this essential service to the local community. They work hard to provide these opportunities to their clients. They should be supported rather than being faced with increased costs, increased red tape and increasingly unclear and unnecessarily complex legislation. This is not to say that the industry should not be regulated. Let me be very clear once again and say that, because financial advisers deal with other people's money, they should have a robust regulatory framework to protect the consumer. However, this bill does more harm than good. We need parliament to make things better, not more complex and costly for everyone. Other speakers have gone into the history of this legislation, so I do not intend to linger much on this. I want to spend most of my time expressing my dismay at the content of this bill and representing the views of my constituency-because they are the ones that will be hurt the most. When I was elected as member for Hasluck in 2010, I promised to stand up and fight for the residents of Hasluck on the issues that are important to them. This is one of those issues that I will take up for them. Financial advisers in Hasluck face job uncertainty and increased costs which will ultimately be passed on to consumers. The Financial Services Council stated that this legislation will cost the industry $700 million to implement upfront and $350 million a year thereafter. Additionally, job losses are expected to be in the tens of thousands across the industry. Government is supposed to facilitate growth by providing the infrastructure and services that the private sector cannot and then getting out of the way. How is this fiscally and socially responsible, to introduce legislation that Minister Shorten and Prime Minister Gillard know will cost jobs? This is baffling to us on this side of the chamber. Just in Hasluck, in addition to the firms mentioned before, we have Adviser Investment Services in Thornlie, NC Bruining and Associates in Midland, Golden West Financial Services in Midland, Grange Financial Management in Forrestfield, Clarity Wealth Management in Wattle Grove, Howarth Financial in High Wycombe and many more. Can the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation tell me how many of these firms will expand or shrink, and which individuals will face unemployment, as a result of this bill?. How about the real increased costs faced by each firm? Just like the carbon tax legislation, this bill lacks detail, it lacks proper thought and it increases the costs to everyday Australians. The residents of Hasluck deserve the opportunity to plan for their future. This bill will adversely affect the ability of people to retire comfortably. This government clearly does not understand the current needs of the community. This government does not respect the right of an individual to make it for themselves. The government should be providing every opportunity for residents to save effectively for their future and impact positively upon their future livelihoods. I know younger members of the local community who are working in the mines, in both the north and the south of Western Australia, and are working extremely hard to earn their money. Younger people are more financially aware than ever before and should be encouraged to seek financial advice, rather than be faced with increased costs to access it and reduced choice and competition in the industry. We should be not only providing people with the opportunity to access this advice now so as to reap the reward for their hard work in the future but also providing the industry with more support and fewer obstacles. The coalition's amendments will significantly improve this bill. These are the most important of the amendments: that the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA that is assessed as compliant by the Office of Best Practice Regulation; that opt-in be removed from the bill and the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement also be removed; that the drafting of the best interests duty be improved; that the ban on commissions and risk insurance inside super be further refined; and that the implementation of this bill be delayed until 1 July 2013 to align it with MySuper. The coalition also believes that one way of ensuring that clients are able to access affordable and appropriate financial advice would be to allow advisers and their clients to limit the scope of advice to a series of discrete areas identified by the client, rather than to mandate a full financial plan in every case. This concept of focusing advice to areas specifically identified by a client has become widely known as scalable advice. Numerous submissions to the committee expressed concern that the wording of the best interests provision in the proposed legislation does not allow for scaled advice to be provided. The legislation should allow the provision of scalable advice where the request for such limited or scaled advice is instigated by the client. This would allow many people to access advice more frequently and would be a very good starting point for clients seeking financial advice for the first time as it would not require them to undertake a costly and sometimes unnecessary complete financial plan. I think the biggest joke of this bill is that the government proposes to have it come into effect on 1 July 2012. When has this government ever been known to implement something effectively in such a short time frame? What is the rush? The proposed commencement date is four months away. It would it make sense to implement this bill simultaneously with MySuper, as they both require significant changes to the financial service provider IT systems; not to do so is indicative of this government's lack of understanding of the practical business realities faced by these companies. This legislation is a disgrace and the epitome of this bad Labor government. Minister Shorten needs to consider the coalition amendments to save this struggling industry. However, the minister has shown his true colours once again on this legislation-he has completely disregarded his government's own process requirements. On8 August 2011 the Office of Best Practice Regulation noted that an adequate regulatory impact statement was for only one part of the proposed changes. The other parts, which have the most impact on business and consumers, did not have an adequate regulatory impact statement prepared. Yes, they were drafted, but they were definitely not within the government's own standards. The government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation confirmed this in Senate estimates. It is no secret that this minister has no regard for the financial services industry and obviously no regard for following processes set by his own government. The coalition supports sensible reforms which increase trust and confidence in Australia's financial advice and financial services industry by increasing transparency, choice and competition. However, any reforms in this area need to strike the right balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and ensuring the availability, accessibility and affordability of high-quality financial advice. The government has been unable to point to another example in the world where a government has sought to impose a mandatory requirement on consumers to re-sign contracts with their financial advisers on a regular basis. Coalition committee members do not support government attempts through this legislation to make Australia world champions in financial services red tape. The FoFA red tape envisaged in this legislation will increase the cost of financial advice for millions of Australians with no or very little commensurate consumer protection benefit. A government seeking to lead the world in imposing additional financial services red tape should at least submit those proposals to a proper cost-benefit assessment. If you think this is just the coalition forecasting doom with this legislation, listen to the words of Craig Meller, managing director of AMP Financial Services. His words have no doubt been quoted by my colleagues previously but they need to be repeated and repeated until this government understands that real people will be hurt by this and almost every other piece of legislation it has introduced in this parliament. Mr Craig Meller said there would be job losses of up to 25,000 in the next few years as a result of Minister Shorten's bungling and added that one of AMP's overriding concerns is that the bill has been rushed through in its drafting and that if enacted in its present form it would have a deleterious impact on customers, financial advisers and the broader community. We believe there are so many problems with this bill that a rigorous stocktake is necessary and substantial additional work needs to be undertaken to get the drafting right. It needs to be recognised that this additional regulatory cost of the legislation will ultimately be borne by customers, who will pay more and not obtain the advice they need. But the initial impact will be on financial planners, and even the explanatory memorandum to the bill forecasts a halving of planner numbers in the next few years. We believe this could lead to job losses in the industry of up to that 25,000 figure over that period. We also fail to see how this would improve advice access. I once again would like to reiterate my opposition to this bill and call on Minister Shorten and the Prime Minister to swallow their pride and at least entertain some of the coalition's amendments to this bill. If they do, it would help keep people across this country in a job. Just one job loss hurts the community of Hasluck. One job loss creates pressure on a family, bills become bigger overnight, children's extracurricular activities get cut, holidays become non-existent and discretionary spending is halted with the heavy strain placed upon them. When we place this legislation next to the mining tax, the carbon tax and the private health rebate, this really does show where the Gillard-Greens' thought process is. They are an alliance driven by ideological means committed to punishing those that strive to better themselves and Australia's forgotten families and our seniors that the Prime Minister once described as not important. This is why I oppose the legislation. congratulate him on an excellent speech where he detailed, I believe beyond doubt, the reason why if the passage of this future of financial advice legislation is to go ahead we definitely deserve to see the government cooperate and put through the coalition amendments. If they do not, we will be forced to oppose it because the bills as they stand at the moment cannot be supported. BeforeI detail the reasons why the bill in its current form cannot be supported I would like to go back a step, and start by thanking Senator Matthias Cormann, our shadow Assistant Treasurer, for the excellent job he has done in prosecuting the case as to why this bill needs serious amending. Senator Cormann very kindly came down to the electorate of Wannon-it was about six months ago now-to talk to small businesses, to talk to the financial services sector, in the electorate of Wannon, to go through this bill and to get an idea of what their concerns were. It was very interesting and informing. We had 60 people at the forum. It was very well attended because in Wannon we have a lot of small regional and rural towns, and there are lots of financial services businesses which give financial advice, especially to surrounding agricultural producers or people who work in local manufacturing et cetera. So, at a very well attended forum on this subject matter, Senator Cormann spoke very objectively about the Ripoll inquiry and what we were intending to occur as a result of the Ripoll inquiry and the making of some regulatory change in this area. Senator Cormann pointed out very clearly that what we in the coalition were looking for was regulatory change where the parliament would focus on making things better, not just more complex and more costly for everyone. This was a message which was overwhelmingly well received within the forum. Senator Cormann then asked for questions, and the very first question that was asked by one of our financial services providers was: 'Senator Cormann, do you think that this bill that is going to come before the House, given who is taking it there, will favour the big super funds rather than all the small business providers of financial service advice?' That was the first question which came from the audience; that is what they were",253,Bills
314,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (19:04,"I rise to support the member for Hasluck and toworried about. They understood who the relevant minister was who was putting this bill forward. They understood that he is very much beholden to and at the behest of the trade union movement and that, as a matter of fact, he is a former big union boss, so not only is he likely to prosecute on behalf of them, he understands their requirements and their needs. He also understands that as he wants to step further in this place he is going to need their factional support to deliver the numbers for him. That was the question which came from the floor: do you think that it is going to be that connection to the big trade unions and to their industry funds that will in the end determine what this bill looks like? Senator Cormann said that he hoped not but he feared that would be the case. The fact that we are standing here tonight debating this bill and the way it has been presented in its original form shows that that question was, sadly, absolutely spot-on. It is a pity that the minister could not have been more objective, because the Ripoll inquiry was, and it set very clear guidelines as to how this legislation could look and how we could get bipartisan support for this legislation in this place. Yet this government could not put the legislation together in a form whereby it just said: 'Okay, we have agreement across parties on what the regulatory burden should look like when we make the changes here. We can do it in such a way that we reduce costs, simplify it and change the nature of the regulation but do so in a way which actually helps the industry to flourish rather than to help one part of it flourish and the rest of it to decline.' So that is where we are today, and this is why the coalition really wants to make four points about this bill in its current form. Firstly, it is unnecessarily complex and, in large parts, unclear. Secondly, it is expected to cause increased unemployment. Sadly, that increased unemployment will occur in those smaller businesses in this sector. It will not be the big industry funds tied to the trade union movement; it will be the mum and dad businesses, especially out in the regional and rural areas and the suburbs. They are the ones which, sadly, are going to suffer and that is where the unemployment is most likely to occur. Thirdly, it is legislating to enshrine an unlevel playing field amongst advice providers inappropriately favouring a government-friendly business model. That really draws on the second point. This bill will mean that those mum and dad family businesses will suffer. It changes the playing field and it does so in a way favourable to those bigger organisations that I have already mentioned. Fourthly, it is likely to cost about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum to comply with, according to conservative industry estimates. That is the regulatory burden that this bill in its current form will place on this industry. That is a very important fact to remember-and I am going to come back to this point. When you look at how the government went about examining the regulatory burden that this legislation would have on the sector, it did not follow due process. I will come back to that because Senate estimates has been very enlightening when it comes to that point. As I mentioned earlier, on our side we think that when you pursue regulatory change you have to focus on making things better, not more complex and more costly for everyone. Yet that is what this bill does. What we need to hear from the government is: why, when we had the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services conduct a comprehensive inquiry and make a number of well-considered and reasonable reform recommendations, did the government not sensibly adopt those recommendations and take them forward? Why has it gone beyond that? Why has it sought to favour one part of the industry over another? That is the one question I would like to leave with the government tonight. That is what we need an explanation on. I think it is beholden on the minister especially to give that explanation as to why he is serving the interests of a narrow base in this sector rather than putting forward legislation which would provide the whole industry a secure future going forward. There are a few points that we need to touch on about the legislation. The bills do not meet the government's own standards. This is a very important point. I would like to read into the Hansard part of the transcript from Senate estimates because I think it is enlightening when it comes to this point. Jason McNamara is the executive director of OBPR. When he came before Senate estimates, he had this to say: regulatory impact statementsin that area. I think that there were six separate RISs in that area. But we found those RISs not yet adequate. They had not met the best practice requirements. Senator CORMANN: … My question is: why? we would pass. Senator CORMANN: You say 'the impact analysis'. Can you be a bit more specific? RIS that refers to the costs and benefits associated with the policy. It is the detail-the impact on business, consumers or the government. It is that sort of analysis-'this change is meant to do particular things in the economy; it is likely to have these costs and these benefits'. Senator CORMANN: Are you saying that the government did not even have in front of it adequate information to assess the cost benefit of the FoFA regulation changes? changes. That is true. … … … Senator CORMANN: … the government's proposal to introduce the mandatory opt-in requirement and the annual fee disclosure, are they the sorts of things that were not properly assessed? Senator CORMANN: Can you list those six elements for us please? And it goes on. I could read the whole transcript into the Hansard. It is there in Senate estimates for everyone to see. Basically, the government decided that it was going to pursue an agenda to favour a select few and impose huge regulatory cost burdens on the rest of the industry. I will again repeat what the regulatory cost is. That regulatory cost is about $700 million to implement and a further $350 million per annum to comply with, according to conservative industry estimates. No wonder the government did everything it could to make sure that there was no proper regulatory impact statement done on this legislation. No wonder it wanted to hide the true burden of this legislation on the sector. The coalition will be moving a series of amendments, the most important of which are that the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA assessed as compliant by the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation; the opt-in be removed from FoFA; the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement be removed; the drafting of the best interest duty be improved; the ban of",257,Bills

They will immediately take away, in particular, the regulatory burden-that $700 million start-up burden and then the $350 million per annum compliance cost. These are sensible, straightforward amendments which are true to the Ripoll inquiry. As we know, the Ripoll inquiry had broad support in this parliament. It is the basis on which this legislation should have been built. It was not, and sadly that is why on this side we are saying that we will oppose this legislation for what it will do in particular to all those mum and dad family businesses in the suburbs, in the regions, in the rural areas, who will be severely impacted by this draconian legislation. Ms LEY (Farrer) (19:19): I reiterate that the coalition do not support the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 and cognate bill in their current form. We believe that the financial services industry requires a robust framework. However, as is typical of those opposite, they have proposed a framework overburdened with red tape. This legislation is particularly complex. It demonstrates the regulatory overreach that is now defining the Gillard government, a government so obsessed with regulation and red tape that they fail to recognise the damage they cause to business. Time and again, members in this place stand up and talk about the deadweight loss of compliance, of regulation, of red tape. As a member who has been in this place for 10 years I find it extremely frustrating that over time that burden never seems to reduce, but I am delighted that right here right now the coalition is deadly serious about reducing red tape, and that is one of the problems we have with these bills. With employment participation as one of my portfolio responsibilities, I have grave concerns regarding the likely job losses that will result from the legislation. Under this government we have seen thousands of Australians lose their jobs since the beginning of this year. Labor's mismanagement of this legislation will further lengthen the unemployment queues, with financial advisers set to join the line. This will result in not only job losses but also a likely increase in the cost of service provision. It is likely to cost about $700 million to implement the government's proposals and a further $350 million per annum to comply with them, according to conservative industry estimates. I do accept that in the wake of the global financial crisis there were a few high-profile cases of financial service providers collapsing, causing serious economic hardship to thousands of Australians. For this very reason parliament undertook an inquiry into the financial services and products on offer in Australia. The resulting Ripoll inquiry reported back to the parliament in November 2009, which is more than two years ago. The inquiry made some pertinent and timely observations. The coalition was supportive of the key recommendations from this inquiry. Regrettably, the government has decided instead to quiver, shake and run a mile from sensible change. The coalition, on the other hand, is supportive of introducing elements that foster greater trust and confidence in our financial services industry. Australians want to know that their hard-earned dollars are being carefully minded by those they do trust to provide their financial advice. Yet looking after taxpayers' money is something this government has failed to do. This bill is anti consumer, anti adviser and anti small business, and for that reason we will be moving a series of amendments, which are that the government be required by parliament to table a regulatory impact statement on FoFA, assessed as compliant by the government's Office of Best Practice Regulation. I am preparing to speak on a bill about equal opportunity for women in the workplace. It is unrelated to this legislation and it is a pile of bureaucratic nonsense, again burdening employers with extraordinary reporting requirements. The point is that it has a regulation impact statement, and I do not understand why such a trivial bill-I will call it that, and when I talk about it in the House people will see why-has a regulatory impact statement and this legislation does not. We will also propose that the opt-in amendment be removed. That was never proposed by the Ripoll inquiry. We will propose that the retrospective application of the additional annual fee disclosure requirement be removed, that the drafting of the best-interest duty be improved, that the ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super be further refined and that the implementation of these bills be delayed until 1 July 2013 to align with MySuper. That makes perfect sense. Most of the subject matter financial advisers deal with concerns payments and superannuation. Just to reinforce the opposition that we have to aspects of this bill, and the fact that we are not being entirely negative and we are making sensible proposals, I would like to run through the recommendations made by the dissenting coalition members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and draw from their report. The first recommendation is: That the Parliament defer consideration of the FoFA legislation until the government has submitted a full Regulatory Impact Statement in relation to the legislation currently before the Parliament which is compliant with the requirements of the government's own Office of Best Practice Regulation. Recommendation 2 states: That the commencement date of this legislation be timed to coincide with the commencement date of the government's proposed My Super changes, which are currently scheduled to commence on 1 July 2013. The commencement date should provide at least a 12 month period from the date of finalisation of all legislation and associated regulations to enable an orderly transition and implementation period. It is not fair to financial advisers, many operating in the small business space, to dump this stuff here and expect them to understand it and to operate perfectly in concert with it in a very short time. The third recommendation is: That the Opt-in arrangements contained in the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 be removed from the Bill. As I said, the Ripoll inquiry made no recommendation to introduce an additional annual fee disclosure statement over and above the current regular statements provided by financial service product providers to their clients already. And the committee received a lot of evidence that, based on the various consultation sessions, it was the industry's clear understanding that the government's proposal to impose an additional annual fee disclosure statement would be prospective-that is, it would only apply to new and not existing clients. The committee received evidence that, after more than two years of this long consultation process, the introduction of a retrospective annual fee disclosure statement was something that came completely out of left field when it first popped up in this legislation. Therefore, we really need to remove those opt-in arrangements. Recommendation 4 states: That the annual fee disclosure statements contained in the Corporations Amendment (Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2011 be prospective only as per the government's long standing commitment and that they should not apply retrospectively to existing clients on the basis that the increased costs – ultimately borne by consumers – far outweigh the questionable additional consumer protection benefits. Recommendation 5 states: That the annual fee disclosure statement requirements be amended from ""detailed"" prescriptive information and inflexible issue rules to ""summary"" information only ""given"" at least annually to the client. Recommendation 6 states: That section 961B(2)(g) be removed from the proposed Best Interests Duty to remove uncertainty about the practical operation of the Duty. Recommendation 7 states: That the best interests duty in the proposed legislation be amended to explicitly permit clients and advisers to agree to limit the subject matter of advice provided in order to facilitate the provision of ‘scalable advice’. There are a couple more recommendations, which I do not believe I need to read into the Hansard of the Federation Chamber because I and other speakers on this bill have given a clear indication of the coalition's approach and our dislike of the direction in which this is going. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:27. Resources, Energy and Tourism: Portfolio Entities (Question Nos 816 and 817) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on 7 February 2012: How many departments, agencies, commissions, Government owned corporations or other such bodies have been created within the Ministers portfolio since 24 November 2007 (excluding existing departments that have been re-named or merged into a larger entity), what is the name of each such entity, and how many full-time equivalent employees did each such entity have at the end of 2011.
