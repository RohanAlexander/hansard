58,Sir Earle Page (Cowper,"Ministe rthrashed out in the debate on the subsequent bills of which notice of motion has also been given. Legislation necessary to give effect to the Government's wheat stabilization plan is as follows:(1) National Security (WheatI n dustry Stabilization) Regulations which have been promulgated. These provide for the establishment of the .Stabilizathe House of the nature of the Governtion Board, its machinery and administration; the registration of wheat farms and the licensing of growers. (2) National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations which have been drafted but not yet promulgated. These will provide for amendment of existing regulations guaranteed price. (3) Wheat Tax (War-time) Bill. This will provide for a tax of 50 per cent, of the excess market realization beyond 3s. lOd. a bushel on all wheat harvested after the 1st October, restricted the market while the normal 1941. (4) Wheat Tax (War-time) Assessment Bill. This will provide for assessment of the amount of tax by the Stabilization Board, and its collection. (5) Wheat Industry (War-time Control) Bill. It is the lastmentioned bill with which the Government is immediately concerned, because the Wheat Industry (War-time Control) Act 1939 will cease to operate after the 1st December, 1940, and it is desired to ensure that there should be continuity of provision for proper disposal of moneys raised by means of the flour tax. The Government's plan of stabilization provides for continuance of the home-consumption price for the guaranteed price over all and for the distribution of excess realizawar to secure a. plan of stabilization tions over and above the guaranteed price. The legislation which will be introduced immediately will provide the means for the disposal of excess realization over and above the guaranteed price. Such part of those excess realizations as are due to go to the stabilization fund, in addition to collections from the flour tax, Sir Earle Page. are referred to in the bill which I now seek leave to introduce. The bill simply provides that the moneys from these two sources, standing to the credit of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund, shall be applied to enable the Commonwealth to pay the guaranteed price and to repay to the Commonwealth Bank advances made by the bank. I now take the opportunity to inform ment's plan as a whole. Australia's wheat problem is both a world marketing problem and a war problem. Before the war, the statesmen of every country were devising ways and means of disposing of the huge surpluses of wheat in such a way as to keep farmers on the land. The problems of the wheat exporting countries had been steadily to ensure tbe growing more difficult because the principal importing countries in Europe, ever since they were struck by the depression, redoubled their efforts to secure selfsufficiency. These policies of self-sufficiency exporting countries maintained or even increased their production. The result was the accumulation of a huge surplus between the years 1928 and 1934, more than twice the normal annual demand of the importing countries. Although reduced by climatic conditions in the United States of America, the surplus mounted again until now there is a greater supply of wheat in the world than ever before. The world price of wheat dropped to a low level in recent years and efforts were continuously made over the last six years to find some form of international wheat agreement which wonld prevent the accumulation of these surpluses of wheat that overhung the market and destroyed profitable prices. The Australian Governments had been trying for twenty years before the present, which would dovetail in with the international position, and wore actually discussing this problem when the war broke out. The outbreak of war increased the magnitude and complexity of the problem. The war is largely a European war Many great importing countries are being blockaded as the result of war. The war has caused also shortage of shipping and increase of freight rates. Tho four great wheat exporting countries of Argentina, Canada, the United States of America and Australia are outside Europe and are rtill growing wheat on a pre-war basis. At the outbreak of war, therefore, the passage of three consequential bills, are Australian Government was confronted as follows:not only by inherent problems of the industry, but also by those additional urgent problems caused by the cessation of trading and market quotations. Normal markets had disappeared. interests of the wheat industry, and to facilitate war-time marketing, the Government took control of the marketable wheat remaining from the 1938-39 harvest and established the Australian Wheat Board to control, store and market the 1939-40 crop. The Government then sought to bring to a head plans it had been devising to stabilize the industry for the war period and provide a basis for post-war stability. From the point o.f view of national war effort, some degree of security within the industry is essential. War-time stability will also help towards securing the general adjustments that are necessary to put the industry on a self-supporting basis. The Government recognized that a long-term plan would stimulate the adoption of better farming methods, Government is based on an acquired crop thereby reducing production costs in the of 140,000,000 bushels at a guaranteed industry and placing it in a better comprice of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. for bagged petitive position in the post-war period. wheat.

The Commonwealth Government therefore determined to stabilize the wheat industry under the national security regulations, because it realizes that stability in grow wheat last year, will be considered. this industry is essential during the war.

In addition, they will, as required, furnish returns in order to enable the Government to investigate production costs. Provision will be made for the transfer of licences in rcsj)ect of registered properties. As I have said, it is not proposed that farms on which wheat is not now being grown will be registered in future as wheat-growing properties. The object is to confine tlie stabilization plan to farms and farmers at present growing wheat. It is not intended to imperil the genuine wheat growers' opportunities for success by allowing into the wheat-growing industry, at depressed periods of other industries, men who can engage in a wholesale way in the growing of wheat at very little cost on land that can be used better for other purposes. The aim of the scheme is a marketable .crop of 140,000,000 bushels, which is approximately equivalent to a total crop of 160,000,000 bushels, as about 20,000,000 bushels is used for seed and stock feed. This total of 160,000,000 bushels approximates the average Australian crop during the last six years. Each year Australia consumes about 33,000,000 bushels of wheat, and has an exportable surplus of from 100,000,000 to 110,000,000 bushels. This export figure does not. differ widely from the quantity suggested by Australia as one of the terms of an international agreement when discussions took place with the other great wheat-exporting countries. The average production figure will be maintained by certain safeguards, of which the first is the system of acreage control through the registration of wheat farms and the licensing of wheat-farmers. from growing wheat for their own security regulations, and the complerequirements ? will be required to register their before the next seeding, exactly where properties. An additional safeguard is the protion of the scheme until next year will vision for the cutting of crops for hay as really be to the advantage of the farmer, directed by the Government. Directions in view of the small harvest this year. to cut hay will be given in years when a heavy crop is in prospect, and arrangements will be made for some finance to be made available against such hay. Arising out of this stabilization plan, I hope there may develop some voluntary debt adjustment between debtor and creditor in the wheat-growing industry where advantage has not been taken of the provisions of the Farmers' Debt Adjustment Act. Adverse conditions for many years have increased the debt obligation of a great .number of wheat farmers to such a degree as to place them in an impossible position. Now that there is some certainty of a reasonable annual return, many creditors will no doubt realize that it will be to their own interests, as well as that of their farmer debtors, to agree upon a plan of debt liquidation spread over future years. This will enable the debts to be paid and, at the same time, will give to the farmers a reasonable prospect of regaining their independence. If only this result were achieved, I should consider that the stabilization plan had been justified. It must be realized that any wheat grown in excess of the 140,000,000 bushels basis will not participate in the guarantee. The same must, of course, apply to surplus hay, but facilities for its disposal will be provided. The provision foithe cutting of crops for hay will not only assist to form a basis, for a national conservation scheme, but, by avoiding sharp fluctuations of the acreage .sown, will also give the opportunity, should market conditions be favorable, for Australian wheat growers to take the fullest advantage of a high world price. The scheme will operate in respect of the 1941-42 harvest. There should thus be ample time to work out fully all of the preliminary details of the plan. The plan is, however, being brought into mentary legislation is to be passed so they stand. The deferring of the opera-",18,Wheatindustry War Ti Me Control Bill 1940

62,Sir Earle Page,"No; but they that all wheat-growers will know, wellThe export surplus of fliis year's harvest will approximately equal the quantity used for home consumption, and it is likely that the price received by the farmer this year will be more than the 3s. lOd. a bushel guaranteed by the stabilization. plan. In these circumstances, if the plan were operative in respect, of the 1939-40 harvest, tanners might be paying money into the fund in the first year of the scheme. In view of the adverse season, it is not desirable that this should happen. The plan will be controlled by a small board, whose liaison with the Australian Wheat Board will he maintained by Mr. Clive McPherson, who will be chairman of both hoards. The advice of wheat growers will be obtained through an advisory committee. Added representation of wheat-growers on the Australian Wheat Board itself is also being arranged. The Government regards as most important the provision that the wheat grower will cut for hay, in any season, the acreage determined by the stabilization board. Thus the acreage to be harvested for grain can be controlled according to the seasonal conditions. The hay will form, the basis of a fodder conservation plan which the Government will inaugurate with the co-operation and assistance of State governments and industry organizations. Mr BA UMAX -What officers will advise the acreage to be cut for hay? Sir EARLEPAGE It is intended meantime. that this work shall be done through the State agricultural departments. I hope later to introduce proposals for scheme, which I shall discuss with the various States and the agricultural industries. This will provide essential fodder supplies for primary industries in normal years. Reserve stocks will be accumulated for years of short supply, when, under existing conditions, production in essential industries, such as dairying and meat, decreases disproportionately with adverse seasonal conditions. supplies should enable these industries to maintain a more constant level of production. This will benefit both the individual and the nation, and w ill undoubtedly assist ns in competing with other nations by assuring a continuous stream of Australian exports to our customers. be a national water conservation scheme ? Sir EAELEPAGE I agree with-the necessity for such a scheme. The more effective use of f a r m machinery and plant which the stabilization, plan, combined with a fodder conservation scheme, would bring about should also tend to reduce production costs, lessen individual f a r m overhead expenses and enable our agricultural industries to become more successful in the fierce competition that w ill emerge in the poor, but hungry, post-war period. If , by some community effort, we could apply mass-production methods to individual farms by providing the necessary plant and machinery without additional capital cost to the individual farmers, we might easily revolutionize the net results to our producers. An examination of conditions in sections of industry to-day reveals the urgent need for action along these lines and indicates the huce unnecessary losses that have taken place because of 'the failure to co-operate. There is no doubt that such action would bring about a reduction of production costs which is essential if we are to retain, during the post-war period, any market advantages which we may be able to secure in the be a compulsory pool. a national fodder conservation of the conditions within the industry over the past decade best indicates the value of this plan in overcoming the problems of the Australian wheat industry. I have had prepared, and now lay on the table of the House, statistical and historical statements concerning world production and marketing. As these illustrate the principal features of the The conservation of fodder world wheat industry and of Australian wheat, problems, and may be a guide to us in dealing with the present situation, I ask that they may be incorporated in Hansard for the information of honourable members.

Various attempts were made to bring about a complete operative organization to meet this position, and provide a stabilized situation for the farmer. In 1935 legislation to this end was passed by tlie Commonwealth Parliament and most of the State parliaments to provide a home-consumption price for the wheat consumed in Australia, and establish an Australia-wide wheat marketing organization, but such legislation was declared invalid by the P r i v y Council. The referendum to validate it was never understood, by the people and accordingly it was rejected. In 1938, however, agreement between the States and the Coni.monwca.lth Parliament was reached, with the result that complementary and supplementary legislation in the seven Australian parliaments established a fixed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for wheat for flour for home consumption. This legislation has resulted in substantial gains to the wheat-grower over and above what he would have received had he been paid world parity price for the whole of his crop. An effort has been made to assist the legitimate wheat-grower by restoring to their natural industries the .marginal areas which cannot grow wheat profitably over a period of years. £500,000 a year for five years is to be provided to thu States under the Wheat Industry Assistance Act in. order to accelerate the process of transference of men to more profitable occupations on these areas, and thus one menace to the stability of the industry is being removed. The Commonwealth Government has agreed that during the next three years the plans of the Statesi n this connection, which w ill absorb £1,500,000, shall be expedited. The Commonwealth Government, also dealt with the problem of the overcapitalization of wheat farms, especially the debt position of the farmers. In 1934, provision, was made to grant, to the Stat.es £12,000,000 for farm. debt, adjustindustry ( War-time Control) B ill , which ment on conditions that, the farmers' debts should be written down and that repayments should be used for a revolving fund to make money available to the farmers at a. lower rate of interest. The beneficial effect of this money has not been as great as it would have been had the Go vein nient's plans to stabilize the industry been successful when this money was first made available six years ago. Therestill £3,000,000 of the original sum allotted. This money will be used more effectively and profitably than was the amount which has already been expended. I sum up the position by expressing the belief that what we are doing now will help to establish this important industry on a basis which w ill enable it to deal with ail of its existing problems. Marketing organization has already provided for the most efficient disposal of the harvest; the stabilization plan now adopted will ensure a steady return for the wheat delivered to the board, the plans for the evacuation of marginal areas are being accelerated, the home consumption price will be retained in all circumstances, and voluntary debt adjustment on a sound basis is likely to ensue. The .benefits thus envisaged w ill not only accrue to the farmers themselves, but also be reflected in all districts dependent on the wheat industry. -The discussion that has occurred on the motion for leave moved by the Minister The sum of for Commerce( Sir Earle Page), has not been, strictly in order as such discussion should properly be confined to the terms of tlie motion itself; but.

The House might, by appropriate means, suggest that this sum should not be made available to the commission from loan money, if honourable members felt that they were not obtaining from the Government the necessary assurances that they require. As I should not like to transgress your ruling, Mr Speaker, I ask the Treasurer to give io the House an undertaking that in dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its policy, re-appointments and reconstruction, honourable members will have ample opportunity to express their views respecting this very importantservice, and that the Labour party will be granted proper representation thereon. amount of £2,000,000, which is to be raised on the loan market, is earmarked for expenditure by the Post Office, I should like the Treasurer ( Mr Eadden) to explain whether that department will be debited with the interest payable on the loan.

Thousands of listeners, who have to submit to the inconvenience of poor reception, have a genuine grievance, because they are required to pay the f u l l licence-fee. I can understand that the present difficult times offer some justification for delaying the erection of new stations, but as some arc evidently being constructed in other parts of Australia, I urge the Treasurer not, to overlook the claims of Queensland.

Before honourable members agree to such an item they are entitled to receive fro m the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) some explanation of its purport. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) referred, inter alia, to the composition of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I declare emphatically that, honourable members are entitled, on a matter of this kind, to voice their opinions. As one who has had previous knowledge of the relationship existing between the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Postal Department and Parliament, I consider that the time for this legislature to devote some of its attention specifically to a discussion of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its composition, its future, and its relationship to the people of Australia, is long overdue.

Weekly, the case for which has not yet been put in this House. One of the cardinal rules in relation to the presentation of Loan Estimates to the House of 'Representatives is that they should show clearly the authority which is responsible for the expenditure of the money. Although yon, Mr Speaker, have ruled in a certain, direction, and I do not propose to challenge it, sooner or later honortherefore appeal to the Treasurer to proable members will be compelled to debate the subject that I have raised, because the Crown has the right to raise money, and Parliament has the right to determine the authority which shall expend it. Honourable members must also examine the qualifications of the persons who are to expend the money. If , as the Treasurer announced, this work for the national broadcasting service is to be carried out by the Postmaster-'Gcneral, that is one thing, but if it is to be carried out by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it is a different, matter entirely. In respect of both counts, however, I subnut that we should be entitled later in committee to examine this proposal in great detail. This bill affords mc an opportunity to discuss the important matter of telephone exchange services. In a number of country centres throughout the Commonwealth, a good deal of clamour is heard for the establishment of rural automatic exchanges. ""Whilst recognizing that the exigencies of war-time curtail the works which the Postal Department would undertake in normal years, I urge upon the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), who represents the Postmaster-General in this chamber, the desirability of continuing, as far as possible, installation of more of these exchanges in country centres. Probably the honourable gentleman knows as well as I do, the advantage of this system; and although Ave are passing through -most difficult times, the necessity for prounder that item honourable members are ceeding in the work should not be entirely overlooked. Evidently money can be raised on the loan market for this purI pose. If the necessary 'material can be made available, the Postmaster-General should proceed more expeditiously than he has done in the past to grant this facility to people living in the country. There are many places in my electorate in which the people have been clamouring for automatic exchanges for a long time, and the reply given by the department has always been that money is not available, and that, in any case it is difficult to obtain equipment. Evidently money can be found for other purposes, and I vide the money for these necessary undertakings. desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the deplorable service provided by the Mascot manual telephone exchange. For many years agitation has been conducted for the installation of an automatic exchange at Mascot, and work was actually begun on the new project just, before the outbreak of war. Since then it has been held up. The Mascot district, within the metropolitan area of Sydney, is one of the greatest manufacturing districts in Australia, and the existing telephone service is hopelessly inadequate. Not only is Mascot an important industrial centre, but it is also the aerial gateway to Australia. It is developing rapidly. When I made representations to the Postmaster-General's Department on this subject, I was informed that there was no equipment and no money with which to carry out the work. I now appeal to the Treasurer tb make the necessary money available so that the people of Mascot may be given the service to which they are entitled. able members will not take advantage of this debate to bring forward claims on behalf of various districts. The debate on this bill must be limited in its scope.

I ask the Treasurer why sufficient cabinets cannot be obtained when money is voted for that purpose by Parliament. In tlie district of Maribyrnong, where there has been great development, even more than in the district represented by the honourable member for Cook( Mr as an instruction to the Government Sheehan), we cannot get public telephones installed, because, according to the Postmaster-General's Department, there are not sufficient cabinets available, despite the fact that money is being voted which would cover the cost of cabinets. I cannot see why it is necessary to raise a loan for the carrying out of these works, but that, apparently, is the Government's policy, the responsibility for which it has to carry. I do not object to that, but I do object to being told, after a site has been approved and the application assented to, that the work cannot be done because there is a shortage of cabinets. the practice in this House that matters relating to administration may properly be discussed on the Estimates or on Supply, but that it is not permissible to discuss them on loan bills. By way of illustration, I point to the frequent instances when pensions appropriation bills were before the House, and all attempts to discuss matters of principle relating to pensions were resisted. this money is to be raised for the creation of public assets, am I right in assuming that it will be raised through the Commonwealth Bank at a nominal rate of interest? usual way through the Loan Council. sources ? Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

(vide p. 267). One point on which all political parties concurred during the recent election was that Australia, as a partner of the British Empire, should prosecute an all-in war effort, both for its own protection and to honour its obligations to the Empire to which it belongs. The stage has now been reached where the financial sacrifices entailed by the undertakings we have given must be faced, and I feel confident that Australia, will not fall behind in any respect. Although only a little more than two months has passed since the elections, a very acute difference of opinion has already arisen in this Parliament, on financial issues and on the method by which Australia should engage in an all-in war effort. This position arises at a time when raiders arcopera ting not so very far from Australia, and when mine-layers are at the very door of the country. When bombs are falling on England, this Parliament finds it impossible to carry out what was obviously the intention of the electorate when it returned a Parliament in which the Government and the Opposition are almost equally represented. As a newcomer to this Parliament, I make bold even at this stage to appeal for a greater degree of unity and clec.isi.oii. I believe there is room for the exercise of more reasonableness in the settlement of the differences that private have arisen in the consideration of this budget.

I shall vote against the amendment, and for the resolution moved by the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), because I want to see the Government make a start, but that does not mean that I necessarily agree with all of the Government's proposals. Neither will it prevent me from expressing my opinion in regard to certain phases of the budget. The Government has declared that it. will expend approximately £273,000,000 in 1940-41. There is room for difference of opinion as to how this sum should be raised with the least detriment to the country's social and industrial life. I accept the Treasurer's assurance that, this amount can .be expended before the 30th June, 1941. I say that because the rate of expenditure up to the present does not indicate that the money will be expended by the end of this .financial year, but the Treasurer has said that, before the 30th June, 1941, the rate of expenditure upon defence undertakings w ill have risen to £15,000,000 a month. If that conies to pass, the Government wil l have achieved, in the speeding up of its war effort, only what the people expect of it . Whether or not in every instance the Government has adopted the correct method of raising the money required, for the expenditure that I have indicated, time will prove. I can only say at this stage that I hope the raising of audi a. large proportion of those requirements by means of increased taxation will not have a deflationary effect, and will not give rise to internal troubles in the Australian economy. To illustrate the possibility that this may happen, I remind honourable members that the budget provides for the expenditure of £87,000,000 upon interest and ordinary services, £143,000,000 upon war services within Australia, and £43,000,000 upon war .services abroad. The Government, proposes raised in the following way: £19,090,000 -from business undertakings, £430,000 from revenue from the Territories of the Commonwealth, £51,400,000 from direct taxation, £74,925,000 from indirect taxation, and £4,255,000 from sundry revenues, making a total of £150,100,000 from revenue sources. It proposes also to raise £52,231,000 by way of loans in Australia, and leaves for the financing of commitments abroad, by a method that I shall mention presently, a sum of £43,000,000, making a total of £95,231,000. The Treasurer has indicated that during the current financial year, the cash balance of £28,049,000 brought forward on the 30th June w ill be used. The total of these funds estimated to become available agrees approximately with the estimated expenditure, and represent, a summary of the method by which the Government proposes to finance its expenditure during the year 1940-41. Before proceeding to discuss the general position, I wish to comment upon the incidence of direct taxation and indirect taxation, and to draw thu attention of honourable members to the revenue raised in the last pre-war year, namely 1938-9. In that year, the Government raised by means of direct taxation, £15,287,228 and, by means of indirect taxation, £58,749,671. This year the Government proposes to rai?e £51,400,000 by means of direct taxation and £74,925,000 by means of indirect taxation. Compared with the year 193S-9, the increase of direct taxation is £36,112,772, and that of indirect taxation £16,175,329. The increase of direct taxation for the last two years, therefore, will, he 236 per cent., while the increase of indirect taxation will be 27 per cent. In my opinion, that illustrates clearly that the Government has not been unfair in the allocation of taxation, as between direct and. indirect sources. I shall now deal with the Government's loan proposals generally. In 1939-40 the Government borrowed within Australia £43,010,000, and during that year it made sinking fund contributions totalling £4,494,000, so that it took off the Australian market that this money shall be the net amount of £3S,516,000. Under the Government's proposals, in 1940-41, it will borrow within Australia £52,231,000, and contribute from sinking fund sources £6,200,000. Therefore, ac£43,000,000 the bank may take upon the cording to its present intentions, the Golocal market through the sale of its new vernment proposes to take off the market, securities. this year a net amount of £46,031,000. I submit that in proportion to the proposed expenditure, and in proportion to the very heavy taxation that I have the credit of the Commonwealth Bank to indicated, the Government will not the cost of the war is limited to whatover .borrow on the Australian market, ever difference may remain between the provided, of course, that the market, amount found by the bank and the is not used in another way with amount taken off the local market. I which I shall deal presently. mention this because 1 wish to refer to controversies that rage to-day on the the Treasurer's comments with regard to question of central bank credits. It must the sum of £43,000,000 that is to be exbe quite evident that the central bank has pended abroad in 1940-41, and to that assisted the Government to finance its war portion of his speech in which he made expenditure, and is doing so to-day, durit clear that this amount would be ing the lag period between the time of financed by the Commonwealth Bank, expenditure and the time of raising the which is to receive Australian Governloans or raising the taxes, as the case ment securities in exchange for the sum may be.

If this be unavoidable, then I have nothing to say, because whatever steps are considered necessary to w in this war must be taken. If , however, we can avoid economic dislocation in Australia, while still maintaining the necessary war effort, so much the better for us all and for those who will follow us. There must be very definite limits to any form, of credit expansion, the dangers of which are very evident, and I do not think any honourable member needs to be reminded of them. If , however, the nation has credit resources which could be used within safe limits in time of crisis to preserve its financial equilibrium, surely there was never a moment in the history of Australia when their use was more justified. The financing of overseas expenditure from London funds does not result in the issue of new credit; it is only a temporary use of moneys that have been accumulated in London through the sale of Australia's surplus primary products. which are to be issued to the Commonwealth Bank be sold within Australia, in effect, the overseas expenditure w ill be by the central bank, taxation could, be met from the local market, and in the final analysis, the result will be that money will be exported from Australia, thus to that degree depleting the local market.

That may be so. It would be unreasonable and unfair of us to expect GreatB r it a in in the present circumstances' to finance our commitments abroad. For this reason I should like to see devised a formula, which Avill couvince the people of Australia that our external war commitments, or some portion of them, cannot be financed from central bank credit until it can be consolidated after the Avar. It is not a sufficient answer to the difficulty I have mentioned to say that this may involve a heavy strain upon the central bank. The burden of taxes that AVC face to-day w ill entail a heavy strain upon Australia as a whole. Let no one entertain any doubt whatever that the quantum of taxation noAv proposed will freeze the nation's industrial effort and retard our future progress. If my assumption that the Commonwealth Bank w ill unload the Avhole, or a portion, of the new securities upon the Australian market, be correct, this may be the explanation for the comparatively small home borrowings and the extreme taxation UOAV proposed.

124,Mr Spooner,"Before the suspenhand, Great, Britain does not stand i nI regret that the budget is silent upon matters of post-war reconstruction and development in Australia. These vital issues cannot be allowed to await attention until the termination of the Avar. Even if, at present, Ave cannot apply much money in that direction, Ave can at least set up an organization to devise plans to ensure that no delay shall be experienced after the Avar in diverting expenditure towards our rehabilitation. While Ave are planning and preparing for a long war, Ave should keep our thoughts upon the prospect of attaining victory at an earlier date than may at present seem possible. When victory is Avon, an era of dislocation is bound to result from the rapid unwinding of a. highly specialized Avar organization, for some o.f AA'hich no need will exist after the Avar. Unless machinery be held in readiness to meet that position, disorder and distress may very Avell result. Wc are aware, for example, of how long it took Australia to move into Avar. It can take us equally as long, or much longer, to move back to peace, if, under the strain of war, Ave fail to make even elementary preparations for essential post-war reconstruction. In this regard the budget lacks imagination. It fails to anticipate Australia's need to prepare for greater population and production after the Avar. taken to plan our post-war reconstruction. have seen a detailed explanation in the budget of what the Government proposes to do in that respect, because our postwar reconstruction effort should be considered conjointly Avith our war effort. Reverting to the Government's taxation proposals. I believe that Ave should aim at standards which are applicable to Australia. It is not necessary for us to adopt the methods of other countries. Wc have our own future to watch, and our OAvn present to protect; and our conditions may differ very widely from those in other countries with whose systems of taxation our own system has been compared. We should retain in the industrial system CAery pound which is not r urgently required for our full war effort. I notice, for example, that the increased direct taxes which it is proposed to collect during the next financial year amount to .£33,000,000. Werei t possible by an adjustment of the strain upon the market for borrowings in other directions to reduce that figure by £8,000,000, and for the Government's borrowings on the home market to be increased by an equal amount, the result would still be that the borrowings for 1940-41 Avould amount to £60,000,000, whilst the total taxation collected would still amount to £120,000,000. The proportion of taxes to borrowings would remain in the ratio of 2 to 1. It is not for me to propose a AA-uy by Avhich taxation could be adjusted if such a rc-arrangement Avere possible. Such proposals must emanate from the Government itself. I hope that it Avill be found possible to re-arrange the taxation proposals in such a Avay as to keep to a minimum the costs of administration, AA'hich I believe will increase considerably under the present proposals. To-day, the services of our experienced administrators should be directed as much as possible to our war services. But the Government's proposals Avill have the effect of transferring some hundreds of experienced administrators to the Taxation Department. Those men could render far more valuable service to Australia if they were employed in connection with our many AA'ar activities. In a time like the present the Government should take bold and original action to deal with, the unprecedented difficulties with which, we arc confronted. Our present machinery of administering and collecting taxes is top-heavy and far too costly, whilst our taxation laws are unreasonably complicated. I am afraid that the Government's new proposals Avill further complicate that position and place additional burdens upon our administrative machinery. I was interested last night to hear the honourable member for Barton( Mr Evatt) refer to this matter. I listened to him intently, as a constitutional authority, to hear whether he Avould express an opinion as to whether or not the Commonwealth now possesses power to cancel the State taxation systems, and to collect the whole of our taxes, both State and Federal, through one source and under one simple and comprehensive measure.

Each of the States has issued its budget for the financial year 1940-41, and has indicated the amount which it expects to collect from taxes. For that amount it must be protected, but in order to do so we do not need to perpetuate the collection of taxes by so many methods and through so many different channels as has been the custom now for some years. The existence of seven different systems of taxation makes it very difficult already that I shall vote against the foius to start afresh by adopting a simple method of tax assessment for Australia as a. whole. This difficulty is accentuated in view of the family of new taxes which have been bred during the last decade, including those which originated during the depression, such as unemployment relief, development, wages and social services taxes. All that matters to the States is that they should receive the amount of revenue for which they have made budgetary provision. It would he a wonderful concession to the taxpayers to be relieved of the dual system of overlapping Commonwealth and State assessments. Such action would greatly increase the efficiency of Australia's tax-collecting systems. If this cannot be done immediately it should be possible at this stage to implement a wages tax scheme for small income earners similar to those by which certain States collect taxes by stamp systems. The use of that method would render unnecessary the preparation of soine thousands of income tax returns by persons earning a low rate of wages and would do away with all the expense of tax assessments, administration, correspondence and other incidental costs. News messages cabled from abroad during recent weeks indicate that Cabinet Ministers and other public men in Great Britain are directing their thoughts towards the new conditions that must prevail in that country in the future. I believe that a movement in that direction will soon become more intensive in Australia. Such a movement will greatly assist our war effort and will create greater public confidence in the promises made by governments about post-war reconstruction. Promises of good times to eontc after the war is over are not enough. Something should be done now. Up to the present Australia has been negative upon all matters not directly connected with the war. The nation is in need, of a positive effort that will not in any way diminish its determination to continue fighting until victory is achieved. I believe that this effort towards the solution of postwar problems, when it comes, will be successful and will lead to great developments in this country. I have indicated amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, but the debate on tbe amendment may have the effect of bringing about what Australia needs in order to preserve its democratic institutionsgreater co-operation between opposing political factions and, ultimately, the formation of a national government. support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). Unlike the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner), who first attacked the budget and then announced his intention to vote against the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, I shall not make an analytical speech on the principles of Government finance. I shall expose to the committee the viciousness of this budget and its brutal treatment of the lower-paid workers whom we on this side of the chamber represent. The honourable member for Robertson expressed the hope that an outcome of this debate would bo the formation of a national government, but I point out that ever since the outbreak of war the Labour party has co-operated with the Government, arid given, every support to its war effort. Since the people expressed their views at the elections a national war council, including members of the Labour party, has been established. Those members convey to the Government the views of. the Opposition on all matters affecting the nation's war effort. What hopes there were for the formation of a national government have been destroyed by the viciousness of this budget. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said that it was a radical budget which represented a compromise between the views of the Government and those of the Labour party. If that be so, all I can say is, ""Lord help the",33,Budget 1940 41
127,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [2.34],"Itoilers of this country if ever a truly United Australia party budget is introduced "". stupidity and futility of any further advocacy by honourable members opposite of the formation of a national government. In common with all other members of the Labour party I believe that the workers will do everything possible to bring the war to a successful conclusion. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has said, they will give their all. But the wealthier sections of the community should give their share also. This budget favours the sections which the Government represents, to the detriment of the masses of the people. Its effect on the workers will be devastating. Profiteering was rampant during the last war, but in spite of that lesson no excess war j>rofits tax has been imposed since the outbreak of the present conflict. Admittedly, a company taxation measure was brought down on the 9th M.'a.y of this year. Discussion of that measure was adjourned and, although the bill came before Parliament again in August, last, discussion was again .adjourned. Now, this budget proposes the imposition of special war-time strike directly at the poorer sections of the community, and not at the rich combines and corporations. withstanding the Prime Minister's statement that the rate of tax on the higher incomes will be trebled, the Government proposes to collect from wage and salary-earners whose incomes are less tha.n £400 per annum a total of £5,000,000-fifty collected from them in the last financial year. This budget will make the poor poorer and the rich richer. The Government will have at its disposal a tremendous income, which no douibt will he expended in Melbourne, if past performances are any indication, ithus assisting the wealthy sections of the community, who in turn assist the Government at election times. The honourable member for Robertson said that the budget might cause a small measure of deflation next year. I agree with that view, but I go much farther. It will create widespread unemployment-, it is merely the beginning of a policy of deflation that will have a serious effect on all States. Mr Riordan. except New South Wales and Victoria. I come from Queensland. What war This budget exposes the industries are there in that State in which money collected by this Government will be expended ? On the eve of the elections, the Minister for the Interior (Senator Poll) stated that £1,750,000 was to be expended on war industries in and around Brisbane. When I asked in this House recently whether those contracts had been let, I was given the vague reply that the matter was being inquired into. The budget is merely another attack upon those who have long been the victims of a vicious system. They suffered more than any other section during the depression which came after the last war, and they suffered most, during the great depression of 1929-32. Since 1932 they have been bolted by this Government through indirect taxationI say belted because no other word is adequate. Now the Government proposes to deal a knock-out blow to them by direct taxation. Already wage-earners in the low income group are paying relieftaxes or development taxes and are contributing to the funds of the Commonwealth as members of war savings groups. The Government's proposal is that a single man earning £3 taxes which a week-and , incidentally, in Brisbane the basic wage is £4 4s. a week-wil l be compelled to contribute Is. 6d. a week in Notdirect taxation. A man earning £200 a year will be compelled to contribute 4s. a week. All this will be in addition to the other charges I have mentioned. Unmarried women will suffer in the same way. Most of them are endeavouring to save what they can out of the pittance times as much as was they receive as wages in order that they may marry and start wedded life a little above the bread-line. The Government's proposals will prevent them from making those savings. Honourable members supporting the Government, belonging as they do to the wealthier classes, cannot understand the position of the poorer people. Most of them do not know what it is to struggle along on a mere pittance, endeavouring to save a few shillings every week. This budget will prevent those wage-earners, not only from saving for themselves, but also from contributing to the war effort through war savings groups. Many of them will find it extremely difficult to live decently, particularly those who have relatives dependent upon them, who nevertheless is regarded as the irreducible minimum, are not classed as dependants according to is to be further reduced under this budget. the terms of the taxation legislation.

129,Mr Riordan,"The Labour party isbo asked to contribute a portion of the boom payment, so that when the war is over they will be able to maintain themselves for a time even though they are unemployed.. Thus the Government may have time to prepare to assist them financially later. Apparently, this Government proposes to tax the workers in the boom period and will have to look after them when the boom bursts. When the war is ended, we shall find that the position of the financial institutions profits by 102 per cent. Among the comhas been strengthened as the result of the expenditure of enormous sums by the Government. When the burst comes the conditions will be akin to, if not worse than, those of 1929-32. The Government has not yet made any provision in regard to post-war planning. The honourable member for Robertson said, "" I regret that the budget is silent on post-war plansecured various contracts from the Goning"". I echo that sentiment, and so do the people of Australia. The Government will wait until the war is over and the boom has burst before setting about planning for peace-time reconstruction; but it will be merely locking the stable after the horse has fled. It appears to me that we are heading for a morass similar to that of 1929, which was the inevitable result of the activities of the budget? None at all. Apparently, the Bruce-Page Administration. Although that depression was world-wide, there was no planning by the Government to anticipate its effects, neither foresight nor imagination was displayed, and there was no appreciation of the altered world conditions. The Government which occupies the treasury bench must early undertake the task-it will not be an easy oneof planning for the day when peace shall have been restored. Tlie press that supports the Government has declared, almost unanimously that the people of Australia must make a. heavy sacrifice in the interests of the country. The sacrifice, however, is to be confined to the toiling masses. What hardship will the budget impose on wealthy companies such as BrokenH i ll Proprietary Company Limited, Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, the Bank of New South Wales, and other vested interests. The company taxation proposals of the Government show clearly by whom the sacrifice will be made. The shareholders of monopolistic companies 3fr. Itinrilav. are merely to be asked to return to the Government a portion of their ill-gotten war gains. I have lists of figures taken from Jobsoris Investment Digest showing the net profits and disclosed reserves of 70 large companies. With the permission of the committee, I ask that the tables be incorporated in Hansard. [Leave granted'] (vide pages 338-41.) It will be seen that between 1936 and 1939 the iron and steel group increased its net panies in this group are BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, Australian Iron and Steel Limited, Hume Steel Limited, and Hume Pipe Company (Australia) Limited. The disclosed reserves of these companies increased between 1936 and 1939 by 56 per cent. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, it may be mentioned, incidentally, has vernment. Its disclosed capital, including bonus shares or watered stock, is £10,9.83,300. Its disclosed reserves, which were £5,941,700 in 1936, increased to £9,0S6,200 in 1939, whilst its net profits during the same period increased from £850,400 to £1,413,500. What sacrifices have these companies made? What sacrifices are they to make under this policy of the present Government towards vested interests has undergone no change. Interest and profits must remain sacrosanct. The group of sugar and tobacco companies, which includes the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, the British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited, and Carreras Limited, made a net profit in 1936 of £1.637,600. By 1939, the net profit of this group had increased to £2,123,000, or by 30 per cent. During the same period, the disclosed reserves increased from £4,365,100 to £5,856,000, which was an. increase of 34 per cent. The glass and textiles group includes Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, Lustre Hosiery Limited, Bond's Industries Limited, Davies, Coop and Company Proprietary Limited, Lincoln Knitting Mills Proprietary Limited, Australian Knitting Mills Limited, and Yarra. Falls Limited. The net profits of these companies increased from £457,600 in 1936 to £658,800 in 1939, or by 44 per cent. Their disclosed reserves for 1936 were £1,463,800, but these reserves have now increased to £3,762,S00 or by 156 per cent. Yet we . are told that the workers must make sacrifices. The imposition of company income tax on a sliding scale is so confusing to the man in the street that he will have difficulty in understanding its incidence. A straight-out impost of 10 per cent., 20 per cent., or 30 per cent, on profits could be readily understood; but, apparently, the object of the Government is to confuse the issue as much as possible, so that it may say to the toiling masses, ""We have imposed heavy taxes on the big companies. They are playing their part."" The shipping companies showed a net profit in 1936 of £615,800, and in 1939, their profit had increased to £1,031,900, or by 68 per cent. The disclosed reserves of these companies totalled £4.209,500 in 1930 and £5,066,200 in 1939, showing an increase of 20 per cent. One wonders what kind of Government we have when we are told by its chief: spokesman that the budget represents a compromise. It is obvious that tlie Government is acting as a Father Christinas to the monopolistic companies. I now come to the rubber group. The companies in that group earned a net profit of £528,500 in 1936, and £707,500 in 1939, an increase of 34 per cent. amounted to £1,013,200 in 1936, and £1,205,600 in 1939, an increase of 19 per cent. The next group consists of the breweries. Incidentally, none of them are Queensland breweries. They are Tooheys, Tooth and Company, Carlton and United, Melbourne Co-operative, and Swan Breweries. Collectively, they made a net profit of £1,499,100 in 1936, and £1,922,600 in 1939. an increase of 2S per cent. Their disclosed reserves rose hy 5S per cent, from £3,529,100 to £5,59.1,800. The chain and retail stores consist of Cox Brothers, Myer Emporium, Myer Emporium (South Australia), David Jones's, Woolworths (Western Australia), Woolworths (New South Wales), Finney Isles and Company, Mark Foys, Anthony Hordern's, G. J. Coles and Company, and Woolworths (Victoria). Their net profits in 1936 amounted to £1,103,700, and they increased in three years by 30 per centre) £1,434,100. Over the same period their disclosed reserves increased by 67 per cent., from £2,198,300 to £3,656,600. for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. under the heading of "" Tobacco and Sugar "", but there is no harm in repeating them. In 1936, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited earned a net profit of £938,000; in 1937, £1,036,300; and in 1939, £1,103,700. Its paid-up capital-includin g bonus shares, of course, for all of these companies seem to have them-amounte d to £11,700,000 in 1939-40. When the honourable member for Denison( Mr Beck) has been in Parliament a. little longer, he will learn thai the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited does not make all its profits from its activities in the Queensland sugar industry. Most honourable gentlemen from the south seem to think that the company makes all of its money by exploiting the sugar industry, but that is far from the truth, because it has many other investments. All of the figures which I have cited are taken from Jobson's Investment Digest, and I commend it to honourable members. It is a most illuminating publication. Their disclosed reserves The foodstuffs group, which consists of Peters American Delicacy Company, Nestles and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk, the Rosella Preserving Company, and Henry Jones, had in 1936 net profits amounting to £484,300. In three years the net profit increased by IS per cent., to £571,000. The disclosed reserves rose in the same period by 22 per cent., from £2,182,100 to £2,815,500. Then we have the cement group. It includes Adelaide Cement, Standard Portland Cemeut, Goliath Portland Cement and Australian Cement. The net profits of that group amounted to £203,200 in 1936, and £254,700 in 1939, an increase of 25 per cent. But reserves jumped by S5 per cent., from £636,000 to £1,178,200. Is it not obvious that exploitation is occurring when companies over a period of three years can develop enormous reserves and pay enormous dividends from",36,Budget 1940 41
130,Mr Buck,Let us have the figures,38,Budget 1940 41
131,"Mr Riordan""","I gave those figuresprofits? Those are the disclosed reserves. God knows what reserves are not disclosed! I should not like to have to go through the books of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited in order to discover that company's undisclosed reserves. Even a mob of Philadelphian lawyers, accountants and economists would be befogged. The gas and electricity group, consisting of the South Australian Gas Company, Adelaide Electric, Australian Gaslight, North Shore Gas, and Metropolitan Gas (Victoria), together, had net profits amounting to £934,100 in 1936, and £1,067,000 in 1939, an increase of 14 per cent. Their disclosed reserves rose by 15 per cent-£2,540,50 0 to £2,929,600. I now approach the interesting group, described under the heading, ""Newspaper, Wireless and Paper Manufacturing"", as consisting of Associated Newspapers, the Herald and Weekly Times, Advertiser Newspapers, Amalgamated Wireless, and Australian Paper Manufacturers. Their combined profits were £763,200 in 1936, and £996,100 in 1939, an increase of 30 per cent. Their disclosed reserves soared from £2,111/300 to £3,293,700, an increase of 56 per cent. The grain and wool merchants group consists of Younghusband, Goldsborough Mort, and Dalgety and Company, whose combined net profit was £322,900 in 1936. and £353,200 in 1939. The disclosed re serves of this group decreased by 3.1 per cent, from £3,448,300 to £3,341,300. The decrease, no doubt, was the result of the drought conditions. The last group is covered by the heading, "" Miscellaneous "", and its members are C.O.B., Taubinans (Paints), Kauri Timber, United Provisions, 4th Victorian Permanent Building, Drug Houses of Australia, Gordon and Gotch. and Electrolytic Zinc. They made a net profit in 1936 of £819,300, which increased in three years by 32 per cent, to £1,084,200. At the same time, the disclosed reserves rose by 18 per cent, from £3,438,100 to £4,059,100. The net profit earned by the groups I have cited amounted in total in 1936 to £10,291,200, and in 1939 to £14,071,900. Disclosed reserves rose from £37,559,800 to £52,765,500. Those companies are putting away enormous reserves so that when this conflict is over and property values have fallen in the depression which must set in, they will be able to employ these reserves to make profitable purchases of more property. The banking institutions, too, are making enormous profits. The combined net profits of all these groups covering 70 major companies in Australia increased by 36.8 per cent, between 1936 and 1939, and as their disclosed reserves increased by 40.5 per cent., the total increase amounts to 77.3 per cent. The Government expects to collect £20,000,000 from incomes over £1,000 a year, £8,000,000 from the middle incomes, and £5,000,000 from the lower incomes. The income in three years derived by these enormously wealthy companies in 1939 amounted to £14,000,000, but expansion of secondary industries since the declaration of war must mean a considerable increase of their earnings. These companies, which have more to lose than has any other section of the community, should be called upon to play their part in financing the Avar effort to at least the same degree as the Government expects the lower paid Avorkers to share the burden. From their huge reserves they should contribute toAvards the Avar effort. I ask the Treasurer to consider taking from these companies, not a portion of their net profits, because there are many Avays in which their net profits can be : concealed, but 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, of their gross profits. That money should be paid into the coffers of the CommonAvealth. in order to offset the deflationary effect of the present budget. The 2,500,000 wage earners in this country haA'e to expend all that they receive in order to live; yet a portion of their earnings is to be taken from them. That being so, the Treasurer should require these Avealthy companies to make a compulsory contribution towards the nation's Avar effort. I Avish to refer IIOAV to an anomaly in the budget. The Government proposes that deductions shall be made Aveekly from the earnings of taxpayers. There are many seasonal and casual workers, such as those engaged in the timber, tobacco-groAving, pastoral and sugar industries, Avho do not receive a Aveekly wage all the year round, but are seasonal workers only and paid at piece-Avork",38,Budget 1940 41
132,Mr Rim,"dan.rates. During their periods of employment they are paid at higher rates than are usually paid to men who work throughout the year because of the seasonal nature of their work. [Leave to continue given.] within this category. The Commonwealth Pastoral Award of 1938. which, I believe, is still current, and covers Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania, takes into consideration the fact that the basic wage amounts to £3 17s. a week. To that amount is added 12s. a week as the margin for skill, making £4 9s. a week. Because the work is intermittent, a further 20 per cent., or 17s. lOd. a week, is added, bringing the total to £5 6s. lOd. a week. The court assumes that that wage is paid for 20 weeks in each year, making a total of £106 16s. 8d. This is called by the court an expedition. Fares are assessed at l is . a week, or £11 for the shearers and workers in pastoral, timber 20 weeks. The court also assumes that three weeks of the 20 weeks are occupied in travelling, and therefore it adds £10 10s., representing three weeks at £3 10s. a week, to cover that expense. Of the 20 weeks, the shearer is actually engaged in the work of shearing for only seventeen weeks. The mess allowance for that period is £1 6s. a week, or £22 2s. in all. As the shearer is required to supply his own combs and cutters, he is allowed 10s. a week, or £8 10s. for the seventeen weeks during which he is engaged at shearing. The total amount is then £158 18s. 8d. It must be remembered that the shearer has to maintain two homes. The court takes into consideration that the shearer may have to travel for two or three days after leaving his home before he commences work, and travels a few days after he finishes work in order tp reach his home; accordingly it allows the shearer an additional £4 9s., bringing his total earnings up to £163 7s. 8d. But because he has not been at home for 20 weeks, the sum of 14s. is deducted weekly from his earnings, that being the estimated cost of his upkeep at home. The total of £163 7s. 8d. is, therefore, reduced by £14, thereby bringing his total earnings as a shearer to £149 7s. 8d. In order to earn £5 6s. lOd. a week, which the court says shall be his U2] wage, the shearer has really to earn £8 15s. 9d. a week. Under the Government's income tax proposal, he will be assessed on the basis of earnings amounting to over £400 a year. The scale of tax Shearers come sets out that a taxpayer without dependants who earns £9 a week shall pay 22s. 6d. a week income tax. Actually, the shearer receives under £150 a year and, therefore, he should pay no tax. The Government should correct anomalies of this description. has made a pertinent point, but I assure him that provision has already been made to deal with the subject. the Treasurer's remark, but I ask him to direct my attention to the particular provision to which he refers. Unless such anomalies be corrected I shall be inundated by telegrams and letters from and tobacco industries, and also from other casual employees, requesting that corrective action be taken. I desire to know in detail how it is proposed to deal with such anomalies. I wholeheartedly support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, for I consider that the budget as presented is grossly unfair in its provisions in respect of lower-paid workers. I urge strongly, also, that the 70 monopolistic companies to which attention has been directed should be called upon to contribute out of their gross profits in some proper way towards the cost of waging the war. The shareholders in these companies have valuable assets to protect, and they should be willing to agree to a fair allocation of profits towards our defence expenditure. The burden should not be left chiefly to the unfortunate toilers who constitute by far the greater number of the men who go overseas to fight for what, after all, is a miserable pittance, in comparison with the incomes enjoyed-, in one way or another, by most of the shareholders in these wealthy companies. Unless the Government takes action along the lines I have suggested it will find that very shortly a cyclone of public condemnation will be whirling around its head. It may then be too late for it to awaken to its responsibilities to the great mass of the people.",39,Budget 1940 41

Yesterday I asked the Minister for Commerce a series of questions on this subject. I desired to know, in particular, the names Advisory Committee and was informed that they wereMr J. A. Stevenson, Department of SupplyI and Development, Chairman. Dr. A. E. V. Richardson, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. MrI . H. Boas, Chief of Division, Division of Forest Products, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Mr R. Bruce Hogg and Mr E. H. Kinnear, jun., persons experienced in the production of fibre from straw. I assume that Mr Kinnear is a son of the well-known principal of the flax processing organization established at Colac and Camperdown in Victoria, and the rope and twine works in Melbourne. I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but I believe that Mr Hogg is associated with the firm of Miller and Company Limited, It is rather strange rope manufacturers and flax and fibre processors. I offer no objection to the appointment of those two gentlemen, for it is probably desirable that their expert knowledge in the processing and treatment of flax fibres fro m the straw state to the finished product should be available to the committee.

In fact if the best interests of the industry are to be served, it is essential that the flax-growers a satisfactory arrangement. should have direct representation. The Minister himself must be quite ready to admit the justice of this claim. In my series of questions I asked the right honourable gentleman whether any request had been received from the Ballarat Flax Growers Association for representation on the committee, and I was informed that none had been made. Yet it seems beyond question that, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the committee, the growers of Victoria and Tasmania should be represented upon it. McPherson be appointed? are already full. I am quite certain that an acceptable representation could easily be secured -country ever since. Only recently two That the interests of the growers need protection is shown by the fact that the price fixed for flax grown in Australia is £5 a ton, the pre-war figure. Yet the processors of flax were practically invited to mark their own ticket, for they were asked to quote the price at which they considered they would be able to supply flax fibre to the manufacturers. I have no doubt at all that it will be discovered in due course that the pre-war price of £5 a ton for flax will prove to be definitely remain at sea as long as their crews can unremunerative to the growers. I ask the Minister for Commerce, without waiting for representations from the flaxgrowers of Victoria and Tasmania, to invite their associations to nominate representatives on this Advisory Committee in order that they might impart to it their knowledge of the production of flax, and ensure also that the economic interests of all associated with flax-growing are not neglected. for Commerce) [3.36] I shall bring the honourable member's representations under the notice of the Minister for Supply and Development, who deals with flax-growing. I understand that the dinioulty in the past has arisen because a difference of opinion existed as to which was the most representative organization from which to secure a nominee. I believe that if the honourable member will be good enough to discuss that matter with the Minister for Supply and Development we shall be able to come to [3.37] I desire to bring before the House a matter. of great importance to the people of Australia, namely the maintenance of ships and new ship construction. Honourable members on this side of the chamber at least a decade ago tried to compel some of the big Australian shipping companies to be patriotic enough at least to build their ships in Australia. At that time honourable members from New South Wales joined with us in an attempt to impose a duty on new prietary Company Limited. A good deal of lobbying took place and our proposals were rejected, with the result that there has been a shortage of shipping in this ships were lost off the Victorian coast because of the inadequacy of the coastal patrol. Discontent exists, not only among the crews of ships trading in Australian waters, but also among passengers because of the inadequate protection of the sea lanes approaching our ports. During the last 12 months only two second-hand trawlers have been regularly engaged in mine-sweeping in waters adjacent to the coastline of Victoria. Those two vessels keep awake or until their coal or stores run out. When one ship is in port for revictualling and to give the crew a rest period, the other has to do the work alone. I have no doubt that, in reply to these statements, the Minister will say that there are at least five or six vessels of this type now in commission and engaged in patrolling the sea lanes approaching our ports and harbours, and that they are assisted by the Royal Australian A i r Force. Let me say at once that those engaged in the protection of our sea lanes have done good work; but there are not enough patrol vessels to give us a feeling of security. The Royal Australian Air Force is ably assisting in this work but air patrols cannot be undertaken during the hours of darkness when enemy raiders are most likely to approach our coast.

It is regretthrowing stones across the chamber at table that we should have again to raise the all-imporant subject of shipbuilding in Australia at a time when ships have been sunk off our coasts and in adjacent waters and mines have been laid at our doors. The short-sighted policy of past governments inconnexion with the shipbuilding industry is now made apparent. We have no suitable vessels with which to augment the coastal patrol. started. That dock will be a great asset Five or six months ago the then Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) bluntly told the House that there were not enough bottoms to take our cargoes across the seas and that we would have to ration what shipping space was available. The honourable gentleman said that it was proposed to give priority to wool because wool was essential for war purposes, that a little space would be given to wheat, a little to meat and other commodities, but nothing at all to the products of the thousands of men engaged in the wine industry. At that time we urged that the Townsend report on the possibility of quickly and economically building in Australia cargo ships of 9,000 tons gross weight should be made public. Unfortunately, however, the Townsend report has been pigeonholed for eight months, and this Government and the ono that preceded it have been guilty of almost criminal neglect in their carried overseas in British ships. The failure to deal with the problem of the provision of shipping for Australian requirements. The naval position is equally bad. The British Government asked us to help it out by building ships here, but we want them for ourselves. strikes, too. honourable members on this side of the House are doing their best to help the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) to' find a way to prevent them. I do not object to the honourable member's interjections, but it gets us nowhere. Honourable members on both sides of the House should put their heads toproblems. It was that note in the honorSuch a small fleet the chamber. We get nowhere by merely one another. The Townsend report should be tabled without delay; we should already be giving effect to its recommendations. Docking facilities in the big capitals should be improved. The Treasurer may say that the preliminary work on the construction of a graving dock in New South Wales to accommodate capital ships has already been to Australia, but what has been done in the other States? Before the graving dock can be completed, we should undertake and complete the building of at least twenty more new ships, which are so badly needed. The New South Wales people are doing their best, but in Victoria we are doing very little because we have not the facilities, the plant, material, heavy lifting gear and large docks. When Great Britain began to prepare to meet Hitler's blitzkrieg, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited was asked to supply various kinds of sheetmetal for air-raid shelters. We should be very proud that this great industrial undertaking was able to fulfil the orders, and we hope that the Australian-made materials were instrumental in saving thousands of British lives. But here is the moral: At the outset, the metal was BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited was pleased to receive the orders, and was able to deliver them so long as the British Government was able to provide the necessary sea transport. Now, the British Government has lodged further orders for sheet-metal, but the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which is anxious to supply the goods, has been notified that the materials must be carried in Australian ships. That gives rise to a grave problem, because no such ships are available. Some years ago we asked the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited to build in this country",45,Munitions Annexes High Of The Members Of The Flax Production

As the company makes tremendous profits in Australia, it would have made a patriotic gesture in acceding to our request. Of course, it did not do so, but continued to purchase ships built abroad. Now, when the company is receiving big orders, it is unable to fulfil the damaged hull will have to be patched, them, because it lacks ships to carry the cargoes to the British Isles. Private enterprise will not engage in shipbuilding in Australia until local construction becomes more profitable than purchasing abroad. wealth Government should hesitate no longer. We should have commenced to build ships when the former Minister for Commerce explained the precise position to us. He stated that the report could not be given effect to because all of our efforts must be concentrated on building ships. far as it relates to shipbuilding, is hot worth a ""hang"". member declared that Australia could not afford to split its shipbuilding resources, and that, as all our ships were required for naval purposes, cargoes would have to wait. Such a statement illustrates the. seriousness of the position. Last week, a shocking tragedy occurred in Port Phillip Bay. When the Duntroon ex Melbourne was passing through the "" Rip it was involved in a collision with a mine-sweeper which had been compelled by bad weather to return to port. Both vessels were controlled by the Department of the Navy, which must have been aware that one of the ships was leaving port and that the other one was returning. That tragedy seems to indicate lack of co-operation within the department. As a result of the collision, all the members of the crew of the mine-sweeper lost their lives. The majority of them lived in my electorate, and I had the sad duty of visiting their relatives. It is common knowledge on the Melbourne waterfront that adequate provision is lacking to safeguard the lives of men who are patrolling our coast. The company posOut of that tragedy, apart from the loss all the materials required of life, a most serious position might easily have arisen. If the Duntroon had been too badly damaged to make its way to Sydney for repairs, it would have been laid up in Port Phillip Bay indefinitely, because Melbourne has no dock capable of carrying out a big job. Another vessel, the Orungal, is aground off the coast 500 miles from the nearest dock. If experts consider that it can be refloated, and when three or four days of favorable weather is indicated, an attempt will be made to take the vessel to Sydney for repairs. On such a voyage the lives of the crew will be endangered unnecesThe Commonsarily, simply because no adequate docking facilities are available in Melbourne. More docking facilities are urgentiy required, as every ship which receives a knock may be crippled and may have to crawl to the nearest harbour. I can visualize half a dozen ships lying idle in Port Phillip Bay, all too big to be docked, whilst the damage done to them precludes their being towed to Sydney for repairs. Unfortunately the Commonwealth Government is doing nothing to encourage shipbuilding in Australia. The construction of the Sydney dock cannot be completed in two or three years. Are we to build no ships in the meantime? The fullest use is not made of the WiUiamstown dock, which is owned by the Government of Victoria. Recently, a proposal was made that the Commonwealth, instead of spending a few hundred thousand pounds upon this dock which has done such good work in the past, but which must be enlarged to meet present-day requirements, should subsidize a private company to undertake shipbuilding on a site on the banks of the Yarra. Another plan has been suggested by me-the Government of Victoria, the Melbourne Harbour Trust and the Commonwealth Government each to contribute one-third of the cost of bringing the existing dock up to date. This work is urgent, because we lack sufficient vessels to patrol the coast. Such a condition of affairs is disgraceful and should be rectified without delay, seeing",46,Munitions Annexes High Of The Members Of The Flax Production

I am assured by the Premier of Victoria( Mr would be very suitable for work Dunstan) that at the dock in question six ships totalling 36,000 tons were built in five years, but the dock, being out of date, cannot now be used to any appreciable extent. Recently, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to receive a deputation upon the subject, but he explained that he was too busy to do so, and suggested that I should approach the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Harrison). It is our duty to help the Government of Victoria and the Melbourne port authorities to construct the dock, because it will constitute an important link in our defence system and be a great economic asset to Australia. ask the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) to claims of applicants for work.

Rather than expend such a huge sum of money on a dock which will not be finished for two or three years, it would be better to use the money for improving docking facilities in other States. all our eggs in one basket. should certainly be better docking facilities along the southern coast of Australia. It is absurd that all shipping should have to go to an eastern port for repair and overhaul. For many years, the honourable member for Boothby( Mr thize with the request of the honourable Price) has urged that a dock be built at Adelaide. It astonishes me that those in authority are unable to see the need for it. The present situation should be improved without delay. I have received the following telegram signed by the secretary of the Labour party in South Australia and the secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, of Adelaide:Our General arranging special meeting of High Court in Sydney almost immediately to hear Commonwealth appeal against the dismissal of the charge against Rowan and Garland and Garland's appeal. Time and expense, principals and witnesses, grossly unfair. Contend hearing should he in Adelaide. These two men, Rowan and Garland, were prosecuted under the provisions of the National Security Act for having made certain statements at an anticonscription meeting in Adelaide. The case was heard before a magistrate in Adelaide, who dismissed the charge against Rowan, and convicted Garland. The Commonwealth Attorney-General has appealed' against the dismissal of the charge against Rowan, and Garland, I understand, has appealed against his conviction. Both appeals are to be heard by the High Court. Now, it appears, the cases have been set down for hearing in Sydney. This is grossly unjust, because it will mean that the principals, their counsel, and witnesses, if any, will have to travel from Adelaide to Sydney. The prohibitive cost will make it impossible for these men to proceed to Sydney and sented :adequately defend their case. It is only fair that the appeal should not be heard until the court is in session in Adelaide. be heard? "" almost immediately "". An injustice will be done to all concerned in this litigation if the appeal be heard in Sydney, but if it be postponed until the court sits in Adelaide, the parties will have an equal opportunity to produce witnesses to speak on their behalf.
