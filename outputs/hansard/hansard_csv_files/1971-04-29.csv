World Government Dr EVERINGHAMI present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth: (1) That arms races, in which Australia is involved, have war as their natural conclusion. (2) That peace movements have never succeeded except by general acceptance of a superior jurisdiction by previously independent sovereign regimes and their followers.

(4) That for the survival of mankind and the lasting security of nations, sovereignty over the means of making war must be passed to the citizens of a unitary world. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House wil give leadership to other citizens by declaring adherence to the general principle of working for a democratic legislative, judicial and executive authority, with constitutionally limited and adequate powers over armaments and disarmament, and over diversion of a proportion of war budgets to a world development fund.

Petition received. addressed to the Treasurer. I ask: Do taxation statistics show that the taxable income of some 3 million Australian wage earners averages only approximately §30 a week but provides more than $445m in taxation? Is it true that some higher income earners save almost the equivalent of those incomes in deductions allowed under the Income Tax Assessment Act? Further, are the incomes of these low wage earners being drastically reduced by the high cost of transport paid by many of them in travelling to and from their places of employment? Is it a fact that in 1957 Mr Justice Dixon, in giving judgment in the High Court in the Lunny and Hayley cases, severely criticised section 51 of the Act and said that if he were to be directed to review the section be would have misgivings about what conclusion he would reach? In view of the fact that Mr Justice McTiernan, in a dissenting judgment in tbe same case, indicated he could not find anything that would indicate that in the rate of wages being paid the appellants there was any consideration of the expense incurred in travelling to and from work, does the Government propose to do anything about reviewing this hardship through an amendment of section 51 of the Act? Did the Chief Justice imply that the section should be reviewed? did not hear every word of the question ate to divorce the statements that were but I understood it to be primarily made by the 3 left wing unions from the designed to ask me whether the Governproblem of the land rights of Australian ment would consider allowing deductions Aboriginals. The House will remember that in relation to expenses on transport to and from work. Is that right? question related to the amount of revenue bulk of taxpayers who are in what the honourable member describes as the lower income groups compared with the amount of revenue raised from higher income groups. It is a fact that a great deal of the revenue from tax raisings does come from average income. I do not know that this could ever be changed because, as it is the average wage that indicates the level at which the majority of workers are earning. I do not see any way in which this can be changed. If the implication is that there sbould be higher tax rates for the higher income earners, I do not think I can agree with the honourable member. The fact is that if the rate of income tax is pitched at such a high level that the rewards of earning more are reduced then incentive tb earn is consequently reduced, and what we need greatly in this country is entrepreneurial skill, management skill and a willingness of people to undertake responsibility. I think this is in the interests of the country. The specific matter of allowing transport costs as a deduction has been considered on many occasions. I can give the honourable gentleman an assurance that when the Budget is being considered this matter will be examined. to fhe Prime Minister who will have seen reports that 3 unions-the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Sheet Metal Workers Union and the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society-jointl y agreed at their annual conferences yesterday to seek a work ban on mining operations in the Gove Peninsula. In view of the Prime Minister's recent speech will he advise the House what initiatives have been taken by the Government to protect Aboriginal land rights?",14,Petitions

9,Mr Mcmahoni Think It Is Appropri,"only yesterday the Attorney-General explained the legal position as a result df the decision in the Yirrkala case. I feel it is appropriate to point out that in that instance the Government was anxious to ensure that the Aboriginals had every conceivable opportunity to present their case in order to protect whatever legal rights they had. The Attorney-General pointed out that we paid all their costs, including those of witnesses. The next point I want to make is that if the Aboriginals want to pursue their rights in the High Court they have every right to do so. and I do not under any circumstances want to anticipate any decision they might make. But the Government has been particularly anxious to divorce the legal aspect from the moral problem and the problems associated with justice and reasonable treatment of Australian Aboriginals. So, as the honourable gentleman has noted, at the meeting in Cairns recently, which the Minister for Social Services attended on my behalf, the case was put to the State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs that the Commonwealth would take the initiative, no matter what the decision might be in this case, to protect the recreational and ceremonial land rights of the Australian Aboriginals and that this Government would do all it could to ensure that the Aboriginals had adequate opportunities for business enterprises. I have already discussed this with Dr Coombs, Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, the Postmaster-General and at least 2 other Ministers, and they know the urgency and sensitivity of this problem. I hope that within the course of a few days my colleagues will be able to prepare some policy recommendations and that within a very short time the Australian Government will be able to consider the recommendations and come to some sensible resolution of this problem. I emphasise to everyone, including the 3 left wing unions, that we should not confuse the legal approach, the moral approach and an approach based on justice for Australian Aboriginals. General: When does he expect to matter involved some investigation being reintroduce the Bill for the Commonwealth Superior Court which Sir Garfield Barwick was authorised by Cabinet to design in December 1962, which Sir Garfield described in an article in the Federal Law Review in June 1964, on which he made a ministerial statement, as the then Attorney-General, in May 1967 and for which he introduced the original Bill in November 1968? When does the Attorney-General expect to receive a report from the Administrative Review Committee under Mr Justice Kerr which he appointed in September 1968 to deal with matters which could come within the purview of the proposed Court? Have the Committee's terms of reference been changed since he first appointed it and have its deliberations been interrupted by the Chairman's duties as Chairman of the committee of inquiry into pay and conditions in the Services? . Mr N. H. BOWEN-The proposal for the establishment of a Commonwealth superior court is a matter which is under consideration at the present time by the Attorney-General's Department. It is not yet under consideration by the Government due, I think, to the change in Ministry. In due time the question will be presented for consideration by the Government. As to the lapse of time and any question of urgency associated with the matter, I would point out that when the proposal was suggested originally the list in the High Court, particularly in single Justice matters, was very greatly in arrears. Under the administration of the current Chief Justice this position has been altered rather dramatically. The extreme urgency which existed then no longer exists. Nevertheless, the whole problem involved a great many policy questions for the future of the judicial system in Australia. This will be very carefully considered and when a decision is made honourable members will be notified. The other matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition related to the Administrative Law Committee. I understand that the Committee's deliberations have been completed and it is in the course of preparing a report. I have arranged to have communication with the chairman at lunch time today to see, amongst other things,",15,Aboriginal Land Rights

' Mr N. H. BOWENI am not prepared to make any commitment at this stage. I think that the report could be of considerable public interest and I will consider that question when I receive the report. There has been a change in the Committee's terms of reference. This occurred during the period that my predecessor was responsible for it. The change was only a slight one and widened thefirstterm of reference to ensure that whether or not a superior court was set up the Committee would still recommend whether an appeal should be made to some, appropriate court. There is nothing of great significance in this, except that it leaves it open to the Committee to recommend where the appeal should go. I am not conscious that the fact that Mr British subjects given the same opportunity Justice Kerr has been appointed to inquire into Service pay and conditions has in any way delayed, this matter. I think that the magnitude of the task has been the cause of the delay.

If so, how much is New South Wales required to provide before Commonwealth funds are distributed? Who administers the relief expenditure involved? What amount of Commonwealth funds has been provided to New South Wales so far during this financial year? attitude has always been that the assistance properly assessed. Nevertheless, I expect to persons affected by natural disaster is there will be claims before 30th June. primarily a matter for the State governments. However, the Commonwealth has accepted that there will be occasions when the expenses of natural disasters are beyond the means ef the States and that ister a question. What arrangements have therefore the Commonwealth should assist been made for international scrutiny of the in the relief of expenditures and the reconconduct of the presidential elections ia structions that are necessary following a South Vietnam?

Equally, assess the conduct of the elections? it cannot be assessed accurately in advance how much it will cost to meet the natural disaster expenditures, and therefore it has been very difficult to assess whether or not Vietnam is one that is entirely within the relief from natural disaster is within the jurisdiction of the South Vietnamese Govmeans of the States. Therefore the Comernment.

In addition, of course, the Common, wealth is providing relief for personal hardship on a $1 for $1 basis with the States and $100,000 has been expended for this purpose. The administration of the scheme is the responsibility of the States. The honourable gentleman, I think, asked how much had been expended at present by the Commonwealth.

The advice that I have had -and I have not been able to confirm it is that the instruction was given as a result of a statement from the Public Service Board of its approval of this procedure. I should say, perhaps, that it is a requirement of the Board that the services of the Post Office should be continued. This obviously raises tbe other question which was asked by the honourable member. As Minister in.charge of the Post OfficeI am concerned that the staffing should be such that it is possible for people to be released during normal times of work for this sort of purpose or any other purpose other than a compassionate one. Leave to take part in this sort of demonstration would, I believe, be an unnecessary cost to the Post Office. to the Minister for the Navy. As the naval patrol base has been established in Cairns, will the Minister in considering the name of the base remember the Minister for the Navy at the time of the construction of the base and name it HMAS 'Killen'? I think this would be appreciated by the people of Australia. If not HMAS 'Killen', will the Minister consider naming the base HMAS 'Gorton', after the Prime Minister at the time? Navy, in keeping with British naval tradition, has a long history of choosing names very carefully and purposely for its vessels. Proud traditions build up behind those names which are transferred from time to time as new ships are added to the fleet. Those traditions have been continued in the Royal Australian Navy. Patrol boats which are to serve in waters surrounding Papua and New Guinea will bear proud war-time names associated with that country. I appreciate fully the suggestion in the honourable member's question as to the contribution made to the Services by my predecessors in this portfolio. I am sure this will be one of the considerations before the Naval Board when it thinks of the proud future of the fleet. Thank you. Minister for Primary Industry been drawn to the promotion of a new margarine pf stated American origin? Does he think that it is just coincidence that a section of the medical profession is now making a renewed attack on butter? Will the Minister state whether it has been established definitely that the intake of butter is a contributing factor to heart complaints? Is the Minister aware that I butter both sides of my toast, put buttered toast in my soup and spread butter on my meat and vegetables as did my antecedents, all of whom lived to be over 90 years of age? member is now giving information. honourable member butters up all of us on occasions. I do not-know anything about the American import to which he has referred but 1 do know that there seems to have been continued controversy over whether the intake of saturated fats or total fats is significant in terms of the incidence of coronary heart disease. However, as to whether there has been any factual conclusion on which of these fats is the more significant, I am not conscious. I think that there has been sufficient controversy for the position to be still uncertain. I am sure that if the honourable member continues to butter his bread on both sides both the dairy farmers and his own constitution will benefit. National Development a question.

AND HARBOURS Appointment of Select Committee (11.17)I move: Tbat a select committee be appointed to inquire are able to perform and in particular with into and report upon the development of major airports and harbours. This is a matter which I consider is of national importance and one which is entitled to the consideration of this House. The object of moving this motion is to bring about greater member participation-by 'member participation', I mean greater participation by back bench members of this Parliament-in the affairs and the workings of the Parliament. During the last 10 years we have seen the Government, both in this House and in the Senate, agree to the appointment all told of 19 committees. Two of these 19 committees were joint statutory committees, 17 of the 19 committees were select committees. As time is not available to me to enumerate these committees, with the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate in Hansard this table prepared by fhe Legislative Research Section of the Parliamentary Library. It reads: Senate Road Safety Encouragement of Australian Production for Television Air Pollution Canberra Abattoir Container Method of Handling Cargoes Medical and Hospital Costs Metric System of Weights and Measures Off-Shore Petroleum Resources Water Pollution Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse Securities and Exchange Honse of Representatives Voting Rights of Aborigines Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve House of Representatives Accommodation Parliamentary and Government Publications (Joint Select) New and Permanent Parliament House (Joint Select) Aircraft Noise Pharmaceutical Benefits Wildlife Conservation I thank the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon) for his courtesy because I did not have an opportunity to inform him before I rose that I would seek the incorporation of this material.

The same the major Australian airports today. The breaches occurred during the recent Easter Committee set about to try to find a solubreak. We know that the curfew was tion to the problem of aircraft noise and breached on numerous occassions with minits effects on people. But the one stumbling block throughout the inquiry was the terms isterial and departmental approval. I asked of reference of the Committee. Most of for detailed information over 3 weeks ago; the members of that Committee were I was advised about 5 minutes ago by the firmly of the opinion that there was only Minister's secretary that the information one solution to tbe problem which beset a was now available.

But mittees and interdepartmental committees unfortunately because of its limited terms go about their work. Contrast the enthusof referenee the Committee was unable to iasm which members of this Parliament examine this aspect of the problem of have displayed towards their duties and noise.

T will deal with that what I have had to say. matter in detail later. I want to deal with the approach to the people who are involved with the shipping problem of aircraft noise by the interdeand airports of this country one sees that partmental committee which was appointed this is not a minor matter. In 1969-70by the former Minister for Civil Aviation, which is the last year for which the LegisMr Swartz, back in January 1969. For the lative Research Service can provide me with benefit of honourable members. I display records-7. 4 million domestic passengers the headline in the 'Australian' of 14th used airports at capital cities, including January 1969. It reads: Swartz orders study for new big airport. I would have liked to be in a position When one appreciates the number of Canberra, and there were 994,000 passengers on international flights. So this involves a lot of people who I think are worthy of consideration in order to make sure that the facilities that are provided are the best available for this type of transport. I do not want to stretch my friendship with the Minister for Shipping and Transport too much by asking that the figures for general capital expenditure on airports be incorporated in Hansard, but he may like to co-operate in this way; I can assure him that the figures are provided by the Legislative Research Service. The figures 1 provide show how much has been spent on capital city airports in the last 5 years. In 1969-70 $29,658,000 was spent on all capital city airports, including that in the Australian Capital Territory, and in 1968-69 $26,173,000 was spent. I have shown honourable members how many people are involved and the expenditure which is involved just on capital development of these airports. Some $55m has been spent in this regard in 2 years. This amount of money will not diminish over the next decade; it will increase. The facilities will have to be expanded to provide for the growth in our population and the increase in the number bf passengers travelling in aircraft. When one compares, for example, the length of runways, the area of airports and what is happening in Australia at our airports with leading airports overseas, one sees a big disparity. We are all the time talking about what a great country Australia is, and I agree that Sydney InterYear 196566 196667 196768 196869 1969-70 196J-66 196667 196768 196869 1969-70 (a) Essendon.

The Sydney Airport is built on 1,500 acres and this will be increased to 1,700 acres when the north-south runway is extended to 13,000 feet. Tullamarine Airport is the only one in Australia which compares with airports overseas. Essendon Airport has an area of 820 acres; Brisbane 3,800 acres; Adelaide 2,800 acres; Perth 3,600 acres; Hobart 1,280 acres; and Canberra 1,197 acres. Compare these acreages with those of some of the major airports overseas. For example, Chicago's O'Hare Airport has 7,200 acres; New York 4,900 acres; Montreal, a new airport, 3,700 acres; London's Heathrow, which is not a good example, 2,900 acres; Rome 3,500 acres; and Orly in Paris 3,660 acres. When one looks at these figures one can see the difference between what is taking place in the development of Australian airports and those overseas and one can also see the need for a committee of back bench members who are-prepared impartially to examine the facts and to make recommendations to this Parliament.

Many airports throughout Australia besides those in the capital cities require expansion and development of the facilities to which I have referred. Brisbane, for example, is used as an international airport on many occasions by people coming to this country. Have a look at the shocking facilities there. I do not have to tell honourable members of the shocking condition of Brisbane Airport. The facilities there, whether measured by international or domestic standards, are completely inadequate. It is an absolute disgrace that this Government has allowed Brisbane to deteriorate to its present state. When one looks at the Gladstone, Mackay and Townsville airports one can see there is a great need to provide better facilities. Tn Townsville houses are being built under flight paths. There is need for action to be taken at an early date. I conclude my remarks and leave the matter to be dealt with further by my 2 colleagues who will be speaking on this subject. One of them, the honourable member for St George, is one of the real authorities on aircraft noise in this Parliament. I also want to deal with the matter of seaports. This country is experiencing a boom in the discovery of minerals, the development of our mineral resources, the export of those mineral resources, and also in other export industries. The latest figures available for a full 12 months-for 1969-70-disclos e that our exports were worth $4,131.5m and our imports were worth $3,881.2m. Once again we are talking about a considerable amount of money. The figures I gave related only to our exports and our imports in international trade. I have not taken into consideration the considerable amount of internal traffic in the carriage of iron ore and coal and other bulk commodities. The principal responsibility of this Parliament is the handling of overseas trade. We should examine once again the question of the ports of Australia-no t only the airports but also the shipping ports. It has been quite difficult to get information on this subject, but the Commonwealth Year Book discloses that the revenue from all of the major ports in Australia today is $81.831m. The outstanding loans on all of the ports that I have referred to in the 6 StatesI have deliberately excluded Darwin because it comes under the jurisdiction of this Parliament and because the Public Works Committee from time to time has carried out investigations into the affairs of the port of Darwin-amoun t to $295m. If honourable members look at the amount of assistance which bas been given by the Commonwealth they will see that this Parliament sbould be completely and totally ashamed of the fact that it has allowed this responsibility to rest completely on the financial resources of the State parliaments. A question was asked by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Kirwan) which I will use as an example. I thank bim for having put his question on notice. It is question No. 1335 of 12th June 1970. The answer disclosed that in the last 20 years, from 1950, this Parliament has made available to the States by way of direct loans or grants for port development only $9.027m in the way of loans and $4.374m in the way of non-repayable grants. These figures alone disclose the limited amount of money that the Government has been prepared to make available to the State parliaments to assist them carry out many of the important developmental works that are necessary throughout Australia. Australia is going through its greatest mineral boom. The Government has allowed many of the private industries to set up their own ports. This is not altogether satisfactory.; Let me quote from the Australian Chamber of Shipping Annual Report for 1970. The chairman drew attention to the fact that Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd was breaking away completely from international procedures as far as levying port dues on ships was concerned. Immediately a ship ties up at a buoy in a port it has to pay harbour dues. Under international practice it is customary for a ship not to be charged harbour dues and. all the taxes that go with them until such time as the ship is tied up at a wharf and is ready to commence operations. This is one of the things of which I have always been afraid when private industries are allowed to set up their own ports. They own the port. They run the port to suit their convenience and under their terms and conditions. I think it is completely unsatisfactory. Because the time available to me is limited I shall speak briefly. There is a need for Commonwealth the interest of honourable members, select intervention in this field. Let me quote committees should be set up to investigate some of the remarks from the Annual these important questions. Report of the Australian Chamber of Shipping. It says: In Newcastle the question in our minds is member's time has expired. Is the motion whether the port will be capable of handling large seconded? bulk carriers, and here again we are awaiting a decision on whether it is feasible to provide an increased depth of water. In relation to the port of Sydney, it says: Operators of .conventional vessels are still having difficulty in securing suitable berths for these vessels . . Specialised facilities are certainly needed, particularly when it is realised that Charles Jones) has moved that a select by the end eJ 1972 there should be 33 cellular vessels and 13 toll-on roll-off vessels trading into committee of this Parliament be set up to fhe port of Sydney. This gives a clear indication that the shipports and harbours. I take it that he is ping facilities which are provided in Austalking about the House of Representatives tralia today are not satisfactory. We are only. seeing a revolutionary change in shipping. At one time a 10,000 ton ship operating on the coast here was considered to be a big ship. When the Broken Hill Propriety make it a joint committee. Co. Ltd put its 19,000 tonners on to the run in about 1954 or 1955 everyone was despite all the allegations and statements astounded at the size of them. Yet in made by the honourable member, there is recent weeks a tanker of about 364,000 no need at all to take up the time of memtons was launched in Japan. On the west bers of this Parliament with such an acticoast bulk carriers of about 100,000 tons vity. I hope to show that a great deal of are now just everyday sights. There is no activity is taking place in the very fields doubt that these ships will expand to a size about which the honourable member has of 150,000 tons or even more. There is a spoken. I hope to prove also that there is a need for the Government to do something recognition not only by the Commonpositive to provide the means whereby wealth but also by the State governments honourable members can work together to of the problems facing harbours, and airovercome the problem that exists today ports. I do not propose to deal in any when 29 different port authorities adminisdetail with airports as they do not come ter 40 of the ports handling our national within my ministerial responsibility. I protrade. This situation is not good enough pose to deal strictly with that area of my and it should be improved. Australia should have a national port authority to plan the development of ports, facilities, roads and everything associated for McMillan( Mr Buchanan), and other with them. There must be a reduction in colleagues will deal with other aspects of tbe costs of transport, which are adding a the matter. The whole tenor of the speech burden to our industry, to everything we of the honourable member for Newcastle do, to our cost of living, of about 25 per tended to highlight one fact, that is that he cent of the total cost. Transport is an has a very centralised political outlook. I important matter. It is an important condo not think that he was talking in terms tributing factor to the increased cost of of co-operation with the States but rather production, the cost of living and everyof dictating to the States. It is the same thing associated with national industry and approach that we have heard previously development. Therefore I commend to the from him and his colleagues on the other attention of honourable members the great side of the House. The honourable memneed to bring member participation into ber tends to ignore both the constitutional the affairs of this Parliament. I believe that rights of the States and what I believe to to improve the facilities and to increase be the States' wishes in this matter. Their Mr Morrison1 second the motion and reserve my right to speak.

52,Mr Nixon (Gippsland,Minister for,27,Airport Statistics Statistic S Of Selected Overseas Airports
53,"Mr Nixoni Hope To Prove That,","wish is to retain some authority over matters which come within their jurisdiction. I hope to show that by co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth the very problems mentioned by the honourable member are being attended to. I am sure that the South Australian Labor Government and the Western Australian Labor Government would not agree with the approach made by the honourable member. There is no doubt that ports are the gatethat we have built about 21? ships worth ways to Australia's international markets and also to many of our internal markets. They provide the very lifeline for Australian primary and secondary exporting industries. The efficiency of these ports, their workings and their facilities greatly affect transportation costs. Indeed, the facilities themselves and the industrial activities of those engaged on the wharves can affect very vitally the turn-round of ships to and from Australian ports and thus affect Australian export industries with increased costs if there is inefficiency or industrial trouble. Australia is one of the world's largest per capita importers and exporters, and we rely largely upon sea transport and therefore on the adequacy of the port facilities for overseas trade. The ports are now handling about 60 million tons of exports and about 35 million tons of imports annually. This represents an incredible climb in total volume. It represents an increase of the order of 550 per cent in exports and a doubling of imports over the past 10 years. Similarly, on the domestic scene 30 million tons are being carried annually between the Australian ports by ships engaged in the coastal trade. This represents a 60 per cent increase on the tonnage 10 years ago. I would like to quote just one more figure. The 70 ports dotted around the 12,500 miles of Australian coastline now handle over 4,000 overseas ship visits annually, and that is an increase of 33$ per cent over the position 10 years ago. The cost of transport and export competitiveness depend on the ability to use new and larger vessels. This fact, of course, is recognised by the Government. My Department has sponsored university research studies into the turn-round time for bulk carriers at Australian ports. The aim of these studies is to reduce costs and provide a safe and fast system. But again I stress that it is important that we should recognise the State rights involved in the establishment and maintenance of ports. We do not have the right to charge in and say to the States: 'You build a port here or build a port there'. We have control only over Commonwealth areas. We have responsibility for shipping services both interstate and international. We have responsibility for the construction and design of ships, and it is interesting to note about $616m since the end of tbe war. We provide and maintain navigational aids of the order of 500 around the Australian coast, and the Commonwealth has a responsibility in relation to pollution of the sea and also safety at sea. So the Commonwealth has wide responsibilities. Nevertheless we recognise the fact that the States have a constitutional responsibility in the matter of ports and we seek to achieve the end result talked about by the honourable member for Newcastle more by co-operation than by dictation. We have in effect assisted the States on many occasions in the past when our assistance has been sought. We have provided $5.3m for the export coal loading facilities in New South Wales, $400,000 to expedite coal loading improvements at Gladstone in Queensland, and $3.3m to finance harbour works at Weipa. We provided $1.9m for the Wyndham jetty and $3m for the Broome deep water jetty in Western Australia. We provided $1.6m for the new jetty at Derby in Western Australia. Additionally, as mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle, the Commonwealth is redeveloping the port of Darwin. We provided funds there for the construction of the bulk iron ore wharf and will provide new facilities at the port at an estimated cost of $l9m, including new land-backed berths for general and container cargoes and new bulk berths and facilities for small craft. There has been a great change in shipping and in the whole technology of shipping over recent years. In the old days we used to see drums, bags, bundles and boxes stacked on the wharf, with cranes on top of ships and men running everywhere-o r walking everywhere, perhaps I should say. We have seen a tremendous speed-up in the handling of cargo. It is true to say that the roll-on roll-off ship and the container ship today can handle about 4 times the cargo handled by a conventional ship. This is because of its speed and quick turn-around. The Australian National Line has been a pioneer in the development of the roll-on roll-off ship. Not only has it led in Botany Bay. The honourable member in the Australian context but it has led the world. Today we see not only rear-ramped roll-on roll-off vessels but ships of more sophisticated design such as the 'Parella'. We see what are called quarter ramp vessels which can pull into a. standard wharf for cargo handling. We see also large scale bulk oil and ore carriers. I was present at the launching of the 'Amanda Miller', a vessel of 66,000 tons, at Whyalla recently. This is certainly the largest ship, we have built in Australia. Some people have plans and are giving consideration to building even larger ships. We may see container ships doubling in size to 60,000 tons, and we know of tankers of up to 300,000 tons being planned. These changes have improvements in shore handling facilities. Indeed, most shipping advances could not operate without port improvements. Shipping developments have been directed at facilitating, reducing and accelerating cargo handling. The operation of cellular container ships is dependent on specialised port facilities, including wharfage, cranage, terminal and depot facilities. So berths for these ships have been developed in the States at Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle and Brisbane. Roll-On roll-off vessels also require their own facilities. The Australian National Line, the Government shipping line, has developed facilities of its own in 7 or 8 ports around Australia. Berths have been constructed at a whole gaggle of major and lesser ports around the coastline. Specific work has been undertaken to accommodate the problems of the huge bulk carriers. They need facilities such as large stockpile areas and conveyor equipment. These facilities have been provided because of recognition of the need by the Commonwealth, the States and other authorities. Port development work is continuing. Because of the need for ports to take larger ships, dredging operations are in progress at Bundaberg, Dampier, Port Adelaide, Thevenard, Risdon, Melbourne, Port Kembla and Townsville. So we can see that this work is going on in every State at the present time. More special wharves to handle roll-on roll-off vessels are being programmed for Albany, Stanley, Melbourne and Westernport. I have mentioned the Darwin port development, but there are also new developments going on for Newcastle mentioned the problems of Sydney. He will know, of course, of a programme to expend $30m on bulk tanker and specialised general cargo facilities in Botany Bay, so Sydney will have a second major port. In addition to new works at Darwin and Botany Bay, it is estimated that $100m will be expended on other port development projects in the near future. That is the context of the situation about which we are talking, and in my view it reflects credit on all the authorities concerned. But with huge amounts of capital involved all the alternatives and the possibilities must be considered carefully before committing expenditure. It is fair to say that most port developments occur as necessitated reaction to needs, and fhe Commonwealth believes that the time has come when we have to anticipate needs. I see a role for the Bureau of Transport Economics in collecting data from around the world, watching the trends and informing the Government so that we know which way we are going. To make sure that there is some cooperation and uniformity State Ministers and Commonwealth Ministers with responsibility for. ports have now had a couple of meetings, and we are due to meet again in the near future. The Commonwealth considers the economics of national port development on 4 criteria. It considers whether a project has value beyond a State, is likely to contribute to Australia's development, will facilitate expansion of ports, and is beyond the normal resources of the States. We have to realise that ports have limitations in depth, harbour and wharf congestion, redundancy and obsolescence. I hope that the machinery that we and the State Ministers are endeavouring to establish will enable all Ministers with responsibilities for port development to meet on a regular basis to discuss these matters. I believe the machinery should enable us to report and recommend on matters of mutual interest in port development and marine affairs affecting development of ports and port facilities. In this way we can assist in maintaining continuous and comprehensive information programmes on port development. So far as my ministerial responsibilities are concerned tbe honourable member for Newcastle suggests that a select committee be appointed to inquire into and report on the development of harbours. I believe that because of the way in which co-operation is being given by the States in this matter and because of the way in which there has been an exchange of information and views on what is needed for Australian port development and also in view of the possible activities of the Bureau of Transport Economics, now is not the appropriate time to set up a committee of tbe kind suggested by the honourable member for Newcastle. This is especially so when we Gorisider that members of this Parliament are so busy performing many other functions that they would have difficulty in finding the time to be members of such a committee and that the points raised by the honourable member for Newcastle are being taken care of by other means. Co-operation with the States is one way in whicb this matter is being handled. I repeat that we all need to recognise that the States have constitutional rights in this field. Not only do they have constitutional rights but ako do they wish to maintain those rights in this field. I do not believe that it is for us to dictate to the States. Rather we should seek their cooperation in order to achieve what is best for Australian shipping and Australian export industries. Therefore, I say clearly that I do not believe that now, when members of Parliament are so busy with their normal parliamentary activities, with their electoral problems and with other committee functions, is a proper or appropriate time to form a select committee on this matter. In seconding this motion I would like to point out that the reason for it arose out of our desire to expand the terms of reference of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise to include the siting of airports. The Government refused to accept this amendment and as a result the motion now before us was placed on the notice paper on 3rd March 1970-1 3 or 14 months ago. It seems to me that it adversely is not only the nulls of God that grind learn and the quality of work done. 12669/71-R-183 ] slowly because I found as a new member of this House how cumbersome and how inflexible the procedures of this House can be when the Government chooses to avoid. issues which it does not like. The Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon) made the usual criticisms of the Australian Labor Party. He said that the Labor Party was seeking to centralise control. What we are seeking is in fact effective co-ordination. Despite what the Minister had to say there is not in Australia at present effective coordination of transport industries on a nationa] basis. Certainly the Government has no objection to national co-ordination in terms of commissions because it has already set up the National Universities Commission to co-ordinate tertiary education in Australia. We are still asking for the same sort of principle to be applied in the very important field of transportation. The Minister also made the point that there is no need at all to take up the time of honourable members on this issue when we are all so busy. I hope that we are all busy on items as important as this. I most certainly support the motion because I think this is the sort of thing that members of Parliament should be undertaking. It is very easy for the House to dismiss the effectiveness of select committees. However, I would like to refer to the United Kingdom experience over the selection of a site for a third airport for London. Back in 1963 a Whitehall interdepartmental committee decided on an inland area called Stansted for the site of a third airport The British Government confirmed the decision in May 1967, but the citizens of the United Kingdom and private organisations did not like the decision that the Government had made. The Noise Abatement Society of the United Kingdom presented a very detailed and very worthwhile report. The Society recommended another site at Foulness. I would like to quote from the report of the Noise Abatement Society which places an emphasis on noise, and I am fairly confident that this is not the sort of emphasis that any sort of interdepartmental committee in Australia would put before the Government. The preface to the Society's report on the third London airport states: Noise destroys all that is good in civilisation. It affects health of mind and body, retards recovery of the sick and reduces the capacity to",27,Airport Statistics Statistic S Of Selected Overseas Airports
54,Mr Morrison (St George) (11.53),"It is vitally important therefore that London's Third Airport is built on a site where the least possible nuisance is caused by day or by night. Later on, the report stated: The main determining factor in siting a modern airport is noise, since this is the factor most likely the Government has to get off its stern and to restrict its operational potential. Through their individual efforts the members of the Society succeeded in having the Roskill Commission set up. As honourable gentlemen will know, in the last couple of days, the British Government made a decision on the siting of a third airport for London. That decision is not for Stansted, which was recommended by the interdepartmental committee but for Foulness. Quite clearly a recommendation or a decision on a third airport for London, as on a second airport for Sydney or on the development of airports and ports in Australia, is far too important a matter to be left in the hands of interdepartmental committees. The problems are just as much social as they are economic. The Department of Civil Aviation has an interdepartmental committee. The Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Cotton) received the report of that interdepartmental committee in September last year and that is the last we have heard of it. We do not know what were the terms of reference of this committee. We do not know the weighing of criteria which the Committee examined. Therefore it seems to me that Australia will be faced with a Whitehall decision. What we on this side of the House are recommending is that the whole area of development in national transport, particularly the siting of airports and harbours, be brought to the attention of honourable members through a select committee. PerhapsI could make one observation, particularly in relation to air transport. Air transport is, without any doubt, the pampered child of the transport industry; it certainly is one of the spoilt brats of the Commonwealth Budget. For every person carried on a domestic night the taxpayer, through the Budget, makes a contribution of $11. It also should be a matter bf great concern to members of this House that the air transport industry is supremely illogical. Airline operators decide what is the most profitable aircraft in terms of passengers, freight and operating costs but no thought is given to the enormous expenditure in terms of providing runways, terminal facilities and so on, because the people and not the airlines have to pay for these. To use a transport analogy, the cart is being put before the horse. The airline operators come up with great shining monsters and find out what sort of runways are needed, whether existing runways will have to be reinforced and whether passenger buildings will have to be enlarged. Surely this type of approach has to be stopped. I would like to refer at this point to the developments at Mascot. The Government is throwing good money after bad at Mascot in persisting with the further development of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Diminishing returns have set in with a vengeance. As the honourable member for Newcastle has pointed out, the airport area of 1,500 to 1,600 acres at Mascot is insignificant by international standards which now require between 12,000 and 15,000 acres. Even Tullamarine has 5,500 acres. Furthermore, the construction costs into Botany Bay are astronomical in comparison with construction costs on land. In the United States of America the cost of runway construction works out at about $300 a foot. At Tullamarine the cost was in the vicinity of $570 a foot but the costs of the extensions into Botany Bay are working out at $5,500 a foot, which is 10 times the cost at Tullamarine. But what is equally disconcerting is that the projected duplication of the north-south runway, which will be achieved at an excessive cost, will be a scandalous waste in terms of usage. The limited area will not allow the 5,000 feet separation of runways which is required under international standards for simultaneous operations. The most that can be obtained is a 1,000 feet separation, and it will not be possible to use the runways simultaneously. The Government's civil aviation policy, which has been notable for its lack of foresight and planning, continues to flounder. The Minister for Civil Aviation, in a statement made, appropriately, on 1st April, said: Because of the heavy investment by the Commonwealth and the airlines we are committed to Mascot. Therefore, we have to make the most of what we have. Let us examine this proposition. The Commonwealth investment at Kingsford-Smith, including additional developments specifically authorised, totals about SI 13m. But what is the value of the airport land for alternative use? I made some inquiries of land valuers and real estate agents and they have told me that the land in that area is worth from $5 to $7 a square foot. As the area involved is about 1,600 acres, the real estate value of the airport is in the vicinity of $350m. Quite dearly it is nonsense to talk of the investment burden. The Government could, on economic grounds, jettison Mascot and construct a new airport of the size of Tullamarine which cost in total $83m and show a handsome profit It could most certainly cover the cost of a fast access from Sydney to an outlying airport by monorail or by a 6-lane highway. Let us assume that we work on the basis of retaining Mascot as it is, stop any further development and put tbe planned resources intot a second airport. This decision must be made urgently because, as we have seen at Tullamarine, it take 10 years from turning thefirstsod until an aeroplane takes off on the first regularflight.A second airportand I concede this point to the industryshould be so sited as to allow for a 24hour a day operation. On economic grounds it is a colossal waste of resources to limit the hours of operation of an airport but justifiable public pressure and the social priorities of people living in the vicinity of Mascot will prevent the lifting of the curfew. The airline operators and the people they serve have a vested interest in getting a second airport The Government is more likely to respond to their demands than to the demands of the people I represent and my demands. SoI say to the airline operators that it is up to them to start putting pressure on the Government for a second airport for Sydney because this is the only way that they will get 24-hours a day operation. In its report the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise raised a number of issues and made a number of recommendations, but the Government has been very lax and certainly very slow in seeking to implement the recommendations. One of the recommendations dealt with noise monitoring. Noise monitoring, as we see it, is to place a limit on the noise that aircraft can make and still be allowed to operate at airports. Noise monitoring has been in operation at Heathrow Airport near London for 13 years. I ask the Government immediately to implement the recommendations of the Aircraft Noise Committee and to impose a noise limit on aircraft operating at Mascot, such monitoring to be policed by a noise monitoring system. The operating rights of airline companies whose planes persist in violating the noise limit should be cancelled. The noise exposure forecast has been a matter of great concern to municipal authorities in my electorate, in the electorate of my distinguished colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Lionel Bowen) and in the electorate of the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly). The noise exposure forecast can show only points of noise nuisance. The action called for is to reduce noise over these areas and not to wipe out areas under the guise of planning which is what the State and Federal governments seem intent on doing. To the problems of aircraft noise and safety the Government has introduced another factor-the reality of depressed land values. The problem will get worse. Total aircraft movement at Kingsford-Smith Airport for the year 1970 amounted to 123,081. A projection made by the Department of Civil Aviation predicts that by 1980 some 210,000 movements will be taking place at Kingsford-Smith Airport. This means that if the airport is allowed to be open 24 hours a day there will be 1 movement every 2 minutes, and life will be hell for the people of St George. The Australian Labor Party has set down a policy which is clear and unequivocal. It regards the following points as vital and urgent: Firstly, we must halt the further uneconomic and anti-social development of Mascot airport. The Government is only throwing good money after bad. The airport area is far too small by international standards to justify further development. Secondly, an immediate decision must be made to build a second airport and to get on with the job. Thirdly, noise limits must be imposed on planes operating at Mascot, such limit to be policed by a monitoring system. Fourthly, the night curfew must be rigidly enforced. Fifthly, the angle of approach of aircraft coming into Mascot must be increased from 2.67 degrees to 3 degrees. Sixthly, there must be insistence on greater usage of the runway over Botany Bay. Finally, as has been proposed in the motion, a select committee of this House should be set up to inquire into and report upon the development of major airports and harbours. We do not want to be faced, as the people of Great Britain are faced, with a Whitehall decision in respect of which the people can make no contribution and cannot make their point of view known. What the motion seeks is a select committee that can take into account not only economic problems and transport problems but also special problems that are involved in any transportation question. All honourable members are aware of and are indebted to the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) for the interest he has taken in the subject of airports and, more particularly, harbours. He has contributed greatly to their thinking on many aspects of these subjects, but I disagree with him on the need for setting up a select committee to inquire into the development of airports and harbours. From what the honourable member for St George( Mr Morrison) said, one would imagine that the proposal is to establish a sort of watch dog over the development and construction of existing airports, but I believe the purpose behind the motion is the development of sites for new airports. This has been the subject of discussion in this House on many occasions in respect of the terms of reference of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, but the House wisely decided not to extend the inquiry of that Committee which was inquiring into noise by enabling it to investigate the siting of airports. Wherever airports are sited there is noise. It is desirable that airports should be in places where there are no houses. This situation has been achieved at Tullamarine where the airport has been established close to Melbourne in an area where there is limited housing development which would be affected by the fly-over of aircraft. The Victorian State Government rightly and wisely accepted the recommendation not only of the Aircraft Noise Committee but also of other committees which were formed with similar objectives and will limit the number of houses that may be built in that area. The siting of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is an entirely different situais not the same thing. The expression that tion. The decision by the Chifley Government in 1946 to site the airport at Mascot was taken because it was thought to be the only suitable area. No one knew at that time that this industry would develop to the enormous size that it has developed. At that time it was the only site available having regard to safety aspects and reasonable access to and from the airport which are so necessary for the development of airport traffic in any big city. Because of the growth of this industry there have been continual demands from the people who were unfortunate enough or unthinking enough to live within ear range of the airport for a diminution of aircraft noise. I believe that the recommendation of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise on this aspect has had a very beneficial effect in that the Department of Civil Aviation has been persuaded to go to great pains to ensure that there is the least possible amount of aircraft noise at Mascot airport. Violation of the curfew hours on flying, which has been complained about often, is something which is not a terribly great nuisance to the people in surrounding districts. Surely there are some occasions when it is necessary to run late nights. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for St George condoning the 24-hour use of airports. I am very glad that he has come around to this because in the past he has been most vehement that it should not happen. There is no reason why this should not happen at Mascot because the air traffic can come in over Botany Bay. I think that the people in the St George area would find that to be beneficial. However, that is another subject and I do not want to be diverted. I want to speak about the necessity for appointing a select committee to inquire into and report upon the development of major airports. I think that the appointment of such a committee would be wrong. Members of the Opposition have made the point that members of this ParliamentI accept this -kno w a lot about the areas which would be investigated. Honourable members would be able to get all sorts of information about the suitability of airport sites but we do not have the expertise or technical know how to make a judgment on where a major airport should be located. I know that we could call for all sorts of technical advice but that has been used is putting the cart before the",30,Airport Statistics Statistic S Of Selected Overseas Airports
55,Mr Buchanan (Mcmillan) (12.7),"horse. I think this is most decidedly a case of putting the cart before the horse. The Department of Civil Aviation has built up in this country a most efficient organisation. The Department has staff which is completely devoted to the expansion of this industry in the best interests of the people of Australia. The Department does not take the best interests to mean the business community or the people who will benefit by travelling, but to mean the people of Australia as a whole. Tbe Department of Civil Aviation is just as concerned about the nuisance value of an airport as it is about the benefits which will flow to an area in which an airport is located. The Department is conscious of the fact that an alternative site is necessary. By 1980 it will be essential for Sydney to have 2 major airports. It is not just a case of resiting one airport. The proposal of the honourable member for St George is to build a lot of highriseflats. That would be a worse infliction upon the community. The Opposition would abandon the Mascot airport. Abandonment of the Mascot airport would not solve any of our problems. It is unfortunate that the topography around Sydney is unsuitable for the siting of a second airport. In looking ahead I think that the only answei, from a select committee point of view, would be to put the airport at Dubbo or Tuggerah. Honourable members opposite have talked about fast transport. In other countries a lot of airports tries has been that wherever an airport has have been built 50 miles away from the capital but this has not been done in any country which has been able to avoid it. it can avoid doing so. Each country has to find a locality that it suitable. In Englandthe honourable member for St. George referred to thisa departmental committee chose a certain she and then a noise abatement committee had a look at that site and chose another site. Tbe matter then went to the Government which made a decision -of course, that is the right thing-whic h will cost fstgl50m more. the decision. made a choice which cost an additional £Stgl50m because it took into consideration the facts which were laid before it. The case which the honourable member for St George quoted confirms my argument that we should not appoint a select committee to look into the general development of airports. This is a job for the experts. We have available the technical people to do this job. They have had a look at many sites in the Sydney area and all these are under consideration. I might mention that there is a similar study taking place in Melbourne and there are a lot of angry people not very far from where I live who say that their little village should not be obliterated. In the overall picture of what will be best for the nation, bearing in mind the way that this overgrown industry will develop, the experts have to go into all of these things and put the details on paper. When that stage is reached and a definite site is in mind, I would have second thoughts about the appointment of a select committee for this purpose because such a committee, having technical advice and expert recommendations, would be able to look at the different sites and consider the various view points. That committee would be able to examine in closer detail what it would really mean. In the case of the airport at Avalon the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works took it upon itself to say that Avalon should be developed quickly because it was necessary and a matter of urgency. That Committee said that a training airport should be located away from any housing area. The experience of overseas counbeen sited there has developed the need for people to work at it and service it, and other industries develop around it. There is pressure all the time to build up another monster. The noise factor in the development of an airport is vital. Australia has greater need for flying facilities than has perhaps any other country. These facilities are vital to Australia's economy. That is why we have developed such a lot of expertise on this subject. Anyone who has travelled around Australia-mos t honourable members have done so-appreciate s the fact that we are continually developing our airports. The Department of Civil Aviation has to keep up with what is going on in the civil aviation field. Personally, I think that airline companies move far too quickly in purchasing new planes. They are developing far more quickly than they should be. They do",33,Airport Statistics Statistic S Of Selected Overseas Airports

All of these problems would day and age. be solved if they were considered by planners who had a proper scientific background. Previous replies which have been given to me by the Minister have indicated that there is no alternative site for an airport within 50 or 60 miles of Perth. But who is to say that such a site would not be acceptable in the future due to changed public transport systems? But if this is the only siteI do not accept that it is-a t least it should be reserved for the future and the surrounding areas should be planned accordingly. Bearing in mind the fact that in the last few days the British Government has accepted a site at Foulness, some 50 miles out of London, as the site of its third airport, it is not impossible that a site some 50 or 60 miles out of Perth could be suitable as the site for a future airport in Perth.

63,Mr Robinson (Cowper) (12.33),"The select committee could not equip itself indenying that the present Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport site is a great asset to this country. But it also, of course, creates great problems. When all the work in hand at the airport has been completed the Government will have spent more than $120m on its development. This makes Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport the largest investment of its kind in civil aviation in Australia. Despite the frequent criticism levelled at having in mind the views submitted by that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport over the years, it has always been regarded as an airport developed on a standard and to meet a requirement which is indispensible for this country. Its planning has often been difficult because, in common with other airports, it has had a problem in meeting the remarkable growth that has occurred not only in air transportation but also in the surrounding community which it serves and in the commercial requirements of the nation as a whole. The same factors apply to the development of Essendon airport and now the more up to date Tullamarine airport. In all of this development the work of the Department of Civil Aviation has been quite outstanding by world standards. The leadership given to that Department by the respective Ministers, the present Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Cotton), his predecessor, the present Minister for National Development ( Mr Swartz) and the earlier Ministers over the years, I believe has been of great significance for the future development of air transport in this country. The specific problem at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, of course, is the ever present complaints regarding noise. So serious did the Government consider this matter that it appointed a select committee of this House to inquire into it. That Committee did a very good job in bringing under notice many of the detailed considerations which required attention and which, as a consequence, have been given greater attention and have had greater emphasis placed upon them. This in itself is to the credit of honourable members who served on that Committee and all who co-operated with it. It is clear that for the future developof complaints that we hear frequently in ment of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport this House and that we have heard again there must be consultation with the State today. I believe that there has been a great Government of New South Wales. This is currently being done. Because of the peculiar problems with regard to finding a suitable site in the Sydney area for a second airport, it must be foreseen as an expensive undertaking and a far more expensive project than the development of the new Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine. The Minister for Civil Aviation already has had detailed talks with representatives of the New South Wales State Government and, Government, the Commonwealth is proceeding with a proper consideration of this matter. This is a subject of utmost importance in both State and Federal spheres. No intentional delay has been involved. I am sure that every statement issued is positive evidence of this. Rather, an approach has been made in a way that deserves some commendation. A second airport for Sydney, no matter which of the sites is finally selected, will involve the expenditure of a great deal of public money and I am sure that all thinking people in this House will agree that nothing will be gained from rushing into the matter. I would point out that it is not a problem that we alone face. Many major world cities need new airports-citie s like New York and London-and there has been reference in this debate to recent announcements concerning a third airport for London. We are having great difficulty in finding suitable sites within a reasonable distance of the city, which is exactly the situation facing London. Honourable members will be aware of a recent decision on the site for the third airport at London and, as has been mentioned, this site will be SO miles east of that city. Can one imagine the problems that this creates in all of the ramifications of air transportation? The issue of siting a major airport should not be a political football. It is an onerous, complex and extremely technical task demanding the maximum expertise and effort. Future generations will be either well or badly off depending on this decision which must be made carefully and in full co-operation with all of the authorities involved. Noise is really the only basis deal of ^understanding and misinterpretation of tbe attitude of the Department of Civil Aviation towards aircraft noise and its effect on the residents of suburbs near to the present Sydney airport. It must be emphasised thai outside the airport boundaries, which are controlled by the Commonwealth Government, we depend on State and municipal authorities. We are, of course, very concerned about the welfare of the people who live in these areas. The Department is doing its utmost to ensure that noise is kept to a minimum. and I believe that this is in no small measure due to the effects of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. This is the primary aim of planning and technical advances in jet engine design and performance and the lengthening of the existing north-south runway in Sydney win, of course, contribute greatly towards easing the noise problem as will the operation of noise abater ment procedures. This is a proper and factual approach.

65,".. . . 44 Bill Presented By Mr Mcmahon, And",,39,Ministers Of State Bill 1971
66,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime MinisThree major considerations have led me to propose an increase in the number. Firstly, I want to allocate to a separate portfolio some important matters which could only otherwise be handled by a senior Minister by adding unduly to the responsibilities now imposed upon him. I am thinking particularly of the discharge of Commonwealth responsibilities in the fields of Aboriginal Affairs, the Arts and the Environment. Secondly, there are administrative advantages in placing with a single new Minister and Department a group of specialised general service functions which have hitherto been attached to a number of departments. Thirdly, and in association with the creation of the new Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the additional Minister and Department will permit the Prime Minister to discharge more effectively his main functions, which are leadership of the Government and administration of the Cabinet system. Before discussing these matters further, I think it will assist honourable members if I list the functions which at this stage will be under the administration of the new Minister. These are: 1. Aboriginal affairs, including responsibility for the Council for Aboriginal Affairs and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. ' 2. Activities relating to the environment, including responsibility for the Office of the Environment. 3. Activities relating to the arts and letters, including responsibility forAustralian Council for the Arts Australian National Gallery Commonwealth Art Advisory Board Historic Memorials Committee Commonwealth Literary Fund Commonwealth Assistance to Australian Composers Advisory Board 4. National Library of Australia. 5. Commonwealth Archives Office. 6. Australian War Memorial. 7. ANZAC Agency, Commonwealth War Graves Commission. 8. Activities relating to the production of Australian films, including responsibility for the Australian Film Development Corporation and the National Film and Television Training School. 9. Grants to national organisations 10. World expositions. 11. National Radiation Advisory Committee. 12. Certain general service functions, including responsibility forAustralian Government Publishing Service Government Printing Office Commonwealth Advertising Division Commonwealth Stores Supply and Tender BoardI have decided that, in addition to these functions, administration of Commonwealth activities in the rapidly developing and increasingly important field of tourism, including the activities of the Tourist Commission, should be placed with the new Minister. Overall policy on matters relating to tourism will remain, as at present, with the Minister for Trade and Industry. For the past 3 years, as honourable members know, Senator Wright has been the Minister responsible for tourism under the Minister for Trade and Industry. He held this portfolio in addition to his other principal duties as Minister for Works. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the fine service he has given to the development of tourism during his term of office. He has been energetic, enthusiastic and effective in helping to create a new awareness in Australia of the value of tourism and the great opportunities for its development on a national scale. Following a review by the departments concerned, we have also decided to establish an Overseas Property Bureau. The Bureau will be a specialist agency charged with a functional responsibility for the provision, management and maintenance of overseas land and property for Commonwealth purposes. It will not detract from the responsibilities of other departments or Heads of Mission for the effective operation of overseas posts and will be assisted by an Advisory Overseas Property Committee composed of senior representatives of those departments. The operations of the Bureau will help departments and Heads of Mission to concentrate on their principal task of representation. Administration of the Bureau will be placed within the new Department, as an additional general service function for which the Minister will assume responsibility. The administration of Aboriginal affairs and he will be a member of the ministerial and of Commonwealth functions in the fields of the arts and the environment are among those to be transferred to the new Minister. It is the Government's view that it is now appropriate to separate these 3 functions from the Prime Minister's own administration. As Prime Minister, I will continue to have a deep interest in them. But it is not necessary, for that purpose, that I remain the responsible Minister. I now mention briefly each of these 3 functions because of their importance in the new Ministry. The effect of the successful referendum in 1967 was to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws in relation to the Aboriginals, as it already could for the people of any other race. Following the overwhelming vote of the people the then Prime Minister, Mr Holt, judged that initially the administration by the Commonwealth of Aboriginal Affairs should be within the Prime Minister's responsibility. A Council for Aboriginal Affairs was established and a Minister, though necessarily occupying another portfolio, was appointed Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs under the Prime Minister. It now seems opportune to entrust this important responsibility to the new Minister, as one of his major functions. As the welfare and development of Aboriginals affect more than one department, a ministerial committee will be appointed to study the special needs and problems of Aboriginals and to advise ways of improving them. In this connection, I invite the attention of the House to the statement on Aboriginal Affairs which the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) read on my behalf at a recent meeting in Cairns of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council, which is composed of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for Aboriginal affairs. Furthermore, I want to acknowledge the energy and application of my colamong various departments. In each case league, the Minister for Social Services and the activities are not directly related to the the high worth of his contributions in his role as Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs over the last 3 years. He has estabmake to thc effective functioning of the lished the portfolio for the Commonwealth and has contributed in large measure to the advancement of Australian Aboriginals. The Government wiU, of course, continue to get his counsel in Aboriginal matters committee which was referred to in the statement made by him on my behalf last week at the Cairns conference of Ministers responsible for Aboriginal affairs. In the field of the arts, the Commonwealth is becoming increasingly involved and is giving assistance in a wide variety of forms. I have no doubt that this is widely welcomed. We ought to continue to develop in this field and we will. But the increasing variety of Commonwealth involvement again suggests that the time has arrived where the functions can be transferred to a new Minister. In addition to responsibility for the Council for the Arts, the new Minister will be responsible for the National Library, for the Australian National Gallery, and for assistance to Australian authors and composers. All these are related functions and can usefully be put in the charge of the one Minister. Then there is what has come to be called 'the environment'. An office to bring together and generally to superintend the Commonwealth's work and responsibilities in the environmental field is a new initiative, and an important one. Commonwealth activities in this field are beginning to gather momentum, and will need the attention of a Minister. Responsibility for them, too, may now with advantage be moved to the new Minister. Putting these proposals in another way, the Commonwealth initiatives in Aboriginal affairs and the arts have now achieved a status and a level of activity that require separate administration. It has seemed desirable at the same time to add what will be a rapidly developing role in relation to the environment. The second main reason for creating the new portfolio is that there is a range of what might be termed 'general service' activities which are at present allocated primary purpose of those departments, but they have an important contribution to administration as a whole. Examples are the activities comprehended within the Australian Government Publishing Service, the Commonwealth Archives Office, preparation for world expositions and the new Overseas Property Bureau. Each of these functions involves the provision of services in important areas for all or a number of departments. The Government believes that locating them in the one department, under the control of one Minister, will yield significant advantage to the administration as a whole. The third main reason for creating the new portfolio is to permit the Prime Minister and his Department to devote themselves to the matters which are central to Government. An examination of the history of the functions attached to the Prime Minister and his Department reveals a recurring theme of the detachment from fhe Prime Minister of new functions as they develop sufficient momentum to sustain a portfolio or department of their own, or as other opportunity for appropriate attachment arises. Thus in earlier days the Department of External Affairs and, in more recent times, the Department of Education and Science have been separated from the Prime Minister's Department. It is natural that, as initiatives are made and before they are fully proven, new ministerial and departmental arrangements should not be sought. But equally, once the significance of the new activities has been proved and accepted, it is appropriate that they be given separate ministerial and departmental status. Further than that, it is important that the Prime Minister, as leader of the Government, should be able to give a great deal of attention to the administration of the Cabinet system. Whatever other functions may come or go, the Prime Minister is Chairman of the Cabinet. It is his function to ensure that leadership is given; that there is effective co-ordination, through the Cabinet machinery and by individual consultation, of the activities of Ministers, each of whom has full responsibility and accountability to Parliament; and that, through the Cabinet machinery and in other ways, the ever-changing problems of Government are given full attention and co-ordinated and speedy resolution. These are the central functions of the Prime Minister as leader of the Government, and he must look to his Department to give him support in them. It is these considerations that lie behind the creation of the new Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This Department ter)-by leave-In association with the will have administrative responsibility for Ministers of State Bill, I wish also to the co-ordinating role of the Prime Minister and it will also be geared to give me advice on the demanding and ever-present preoccupations of the Government as a whole. These vary from day to day but range across such matters as the state of the economy, the Commonwealth's role in welfare, relations with the States-so important in a Federation-and external relations and defence. These are the administrative responsibilities of the Prime Minister as leader of the Government. When to these are added the role of leadership in the Parliament, the duties as leader of a party, the requirements imposed as chief spokesman for the Government both in the Parliament and in public, and the many representational obligations that must be accepted, it can readily be seen that functions which arc in the main administrative, or can be handled by another Minister and department, should where practicable be transferred to them. In short, I believe that the addition of a new ministerial portfolio to discharge the functions I have outlined represents a significant advance in the organisation of the functions of government. There will be renewed emphasis upon the importance the Government attaches to three different groups of responsibilities-in Aboriginal Affairs; in the arts; and in the environment. In each of these the Commonwealth is increasingly assuming a role in community affairs at the national level. There wiil also be a useful concentration under single control of a number of 'general service' activities having a functional or administrative affinity. By making these changes, the Prime Minister and his Department will be released to discharge more effectively their primary functions. And the lines of responsibility to the Parliament for the various functions will be clarified. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. Ministerial Statement",39,Ministers Of State Bill 1971
67,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime Minisinform the House of my intention to appoint Assistant Ministers to support certain Senior Ministers in the discharge of their responsibilities. Honourable members will recall that, since the earliest days of Federation, Assistant Ministers, Honorary Ministers or Ministers without Portfolio have been a recurring feature of ministerial arrangements. These Assistant MinistersI use that term to describe all the persons I have hist referred to-ar e not Ministers of State in the strict Constitutional sense. The Queen's Ministers of State are, under section 64 of the Constitution, only those members of the Executive Council who are appointed to administer Departments of State. The Assistant Ministers will be members of the Parliament who are appointed to assist a particular Minister in the discharge of his duties. Because they are not Ministers of State in the constitutional sense, section 44 of the Constitution precludes the payment of any salary to Assistant Ministers in respect of their duties. All it will be possible to do is important that Ministers should be will be to make payments to them to meet out-of-pocket expenses, including travelling expenses, which they necessarily incur in the performance of their duties. I intend that the Assistant Ministers will be sworn as Executive Councillors. They will thus form part of the Federal Executive Council whose function, under section 62 of the Constitution, is to advise the Governor General in the government of the Commonwealth. The Assistant Ministers will thus participate in a most important aspect of the continuing good government of the Commonwealth. As members of the Federal Executive Council, the Assistant Ministers will in general be able to exercise statutory functions of the Ministers they are assisting-includin g the making of appointments and the performance of other functions expressly conferred on the Minister-provide d he has authorised them to this effect This is made possible by section 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act which, subject to any contrary intention in the particular legislation, permits any Minister or member of the Federal Executive Council to act for and on behalf of a Minister referred to in the legislation. Thus Assistant Ministers will be able to make appointments and perform other functions expressly conferred on the Minister by legislation. The Assistant Ministers will be assigned to assist certain Ministers of Cabinet rank, who have the responsibility, not only of administering their own departments, but of taking part in the continuing process of consultation which is an essential feature of effective Cabinet government. By appointing Assistant Ministers in this way I see the system of Cabinet government as being strengthened through allowing senior Ministers to give more time to Cabinet business. Assistant Ministers will, of course, work in accordance with the authority given to them by the Senior Minister. I see them, within this general authority, as conducting correspondence and making inquiries on his behalf. They will also be able to receive deputations on behalf of the Minister. I emphasise that Assistant Ministers will not be able to take political responsibility in the administration of any department. This is as it should be. As Prime Minister Menzies explained in his ministerial statement on Parliamentary Under-Secretaries on 27th August 1952, it directly answerable to the Parliament for the administration of their departments. Again taking up what Sir Robert Menzies said in that statement, there are occasions when it would be of great assistance to a Minister if his Assistant Minister could, during the Committee stages of a Bill, sit at the table of the House and represent his Minister in the discussion of clauses and amendments as they arise. I shall be consulting with the Presiding Officers on this matter to ascertain whether, to achieve this, an amendment of Standing Orders will be necessary. Numbers of those who in times past held office as Assistant Ministers were in due course elevated to full Ministerial status. I believe that the experience they obtained as Assistant Ministers was of great value in preparing them to assume full Ministerial status. I am confident that those who will be appointed to the new positions will obtain valuable and broadening experience. To sum up, the new Assistant Ministers will bring greatly needed assistance to senior Ministers in the discharge of their heavy duties, and will contribute to the better working of the Cabinet system. Secondly, they will help such Ministers to achieve more effective supervision of the activities of the departments to which they are related. Finally they will, as I have mentioned, provide important experience for members from this side of the House in both the legislative and administrative fields. I do not intend at this stage to make specific appointments to the office of Assistant Minister. These will be left until the parliamentary recess, when there will be opportunity to give further consideration to details of the way in which the Assistant Ministers will work and to select members for the positions. I make the statement at this stage partly to acquaint the House of events that will take place before it meets for the Budget session, and also because the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers needs to be seen in the full context of other changes being made in administrative arrangements, including particularly the proposal to appoint an additional Minister of State. I present the following paper: Appointment of Assistant Ministers-Ministeria l Statement, 29th April 1971. Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. matter and the Ministers of State Bill be the subject of a cognate debate in due course. course being followed. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. LOAN BILL 1971 Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading (2.37) I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. At the time the 1970-71 Budget was introduced it was noted that, because of the difficulty of estimating net loan raisings in Australia and overseas, there remained, as in every year, the possibility that some borrowing from the Reserve Bank may be necessary to complete the Commonwealth's financial transactions. In statement No. 4 attached to the Budget Speech, notice was given that authority would be sought in a Loan Bill to borrow for defence purposes such amounts as are necessary to complete the Commonwealth's financing requirements. Since the Budget was introduced, of course, a number of factors have brought about substantial increases in Budget expenditures and much lesser increases in revenues, so that our financing requirements are now greater than originally forecast. Some of the more important increases in expenditures which have occurred since the Budget were outlined in this House on 16th February by the then Prime Minister in his statement on Government expenditure. It is however, useful to refer to some of them here. The largest variations affecting the expenditure estimates have been additional payments to the States, including $60m to compensate the States for loss of receipts duty revenues, $43m in additional assistance to the States to help with their budgetary difficulties, and about $25m in increased financial assistance grants arising from the effect on the formula determined grants of the higher than anticipated increase in average wages. In all, payments to or for the States are now expected to exceed the Budget estimates by the order of $132m. Wage and salary determinations, including the effect of the national wage case decision, have also added directly to the Commonwealth's own wage and salary bill. Other additional requirements, such as capital advances to the Australian Wool Commission and payments under the rural debt reconstruction and farm adjustment scheme will also operate to increase our expenditures. Despite the cut-back in expenditures announced by the Government in February and the gain to revenue as a result of the faster increases in incomes and spending, the Government is Treasurer) now faced with a large prospective deficit for this financial year. On the financing side, the results of our loan raising activities in the first 9 months of the year suggest that redemptions and other expenditure on the reduction of debt overseas will exceed raisings overseas, as they did in the previous financial year, so that significant amounts will remain to be raised in Australia. Public loan raisings in Australia so far this financial year have, however, attracted slightly less support than in 1969-70, while redemptions of maturing securities have been heavy.

Bill presented by Mr N. H. Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading Mr N. H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Attor ney-General) (2,47)1 move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The primary purpose of this Bill is to control the practice known as resale price maintenance. Tbe provisions for this purpose are to be inserted into the Trade Practices Act 1965-1969. The opportunity has been taken to make one or two other amendments of that Act which will require the terms and conditions of the members of the Trade Practices Tribunal and of the Commissioner of Trade Practices to be prescribed by regulation rather than determined by the Governor General or the Attorney-General. Resale price maintenance is a restrictive trade practice, in the sense that it operates to restrict competition in the re-selling of goods. It is a practice by which a manufacturer or wholesaler of goods-to whom, for the sake of convenience, I shall refer as 'the supplier*-stipulate s a minimum price that must be charged on the resale of goods supplied by him. It is a practice that operates vertically in the distributive process as the goods pass in turn from manufacturer to wholesaler and from wholesaler to retailer. In this respect it is distinguishable from price-fixing agreements that are horizontal in the sense that they are between competitors on the same level of the distributive process. Section 35 of the Trade Practices Act already covers the horizontal agreements. But in its present form the Act does not cover, otherwise than incidentally, vertical price arrangements of the kind to which this Bill relates. The present position, therefore, is that an agreement between a group of manufacturers in accordance with which they agree that they themselves will not charge less than certain prices is examinable by the Trade Practices Tribunal at the instance of the Commissioner of Trade Practices, and if the agreement is determined by the Tribunal to be contrary to the public interest, it may be prohibited by appropriate restraining orders. But if a manufacturer acts. independently of other manufacturers, he is completely free, by engaging in resale price maintenance, to control the re-selling prices of the goods he supplies. In the result, there is a common retail price for the goods that must be charged by all retailers. However efficient a particular retailer may be, he cannot in these circumstances pass on the results of his efficiency to the consumer by a reduction in price. It can happen, moreover, that in such circumstances the manufacturer will find himself under strong collective pressure from the retailers to keep the minimum resale price at a sufficiently high level to enable even the less efficient retailers to operate profitably. Mr Speaker, there is no need for me to remind the House that our economy is at present subject to strong inflationary pressures. To meet these pressures the Government is taking action in several areas. It has restricted spending in the public sector and, as the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Anthony) announced to the House yesterday, the Tariff Board will shortly begin a systematic review of tariffs. In addition, mere is a need for more internal competition. There is need to ensure that the prices of goods are keenly competitive. In saying this, however, I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the prices at present operating under resale price maintenance agreements are all necessarily excessive. But1 do believe that the practice tends to remove the incentive to sell goods cheaply, and that, in general, the practice works against the objectives of efficiency which are so important if our efforts to resist the present inflationary pressures are to succeed. In concluding that this Bill should be introduced the Government has taken into account the experience of other countries with resale price maintenance. Most countries with free enterprise economies have come lo tbe conclusion that, in general, the practice is against the public interest, and they have followed up their conclusions by legislating to bring it under control. The United Kingdom enacted legislation for this purpose in 1964. Canada, Japan, South Africa, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Norway and Finland have also enacted legislation with respect to the practice in the last 10 to IS years. The United States of America has had such legislation at the federal level for many years. The degree of control provided for in the legislation varies from country to ' country. In some countries, for example, Canada, the practice is totally prohibited while the legislation of the United Kingdom makes provision for exemptions to be granted in respect of particular classes of goods and exemptions have in fact been granted in respect of 2 classes of goods. The experience of other countries has been that the circumstances in which resale price maintenance can be shown after full inquiry to be in the public interest are really few and far between. But honourable members will, I think, agree that it is desirable that the Australian legislation should recognise that there may be goods of certain kinds in respect of which the practice is desirable in the public interest, and that the legislation should enable exemptions to be granted where this can be established. I turn now to the provisions of this Bill. In brief, the Bill makes it unlawful for a supplier to engage in the practice of resale price maintenance, but provides for this general prohibition of the practice to be subject to any exemptions that may be granted by the Trade Practices Tribunal in respect of particular kinds of goods. Clause 12 provides for resale price maintenance to be dealt with by a new part of the Trade Practices Act, and this will be Part VIA. The various forms of conduct that will constitute resale price maintenance are set out in proposed sub-section (2.) of section 66A. It will be noted that in each case it is conduct on the part of a supplier of goods with which the sub-section is concerned. In brief, the forms of conduct mentioned in the sub-section are: A supplier makes it known that he will not supply goods to a re-seller unless the re-seller agrees not to re-sell those goods below a price specified by the supplier; A supplier induces a re-seller not to resell at less than a specified price goods supplied to the re-seller by the supplier; A supplier enters into an agreement to supply goods to a re-seller, under which agreement the re-seller agrees not to resell the goods at less than a specified price; A supplier withholds the supply of goods to a re-seller for the reason that the re-seller has not agreed to observe a specified minimum price or has sold goods at less than a specified minimum price; A supplier withholds the supply of goods to a wholesaler for the reason that a retailer who obtains goods from the wholesaler has not agreed to observe a minimum price specified by the supplier or has sold goods at less than a minimum price specified by the supplier; and A supplier uses in relation to goods supplied to a re-seller a statement of price likely to be understood by the reseller as the minimum resale price, for example, by having the retail price printed on a catalogue issued to the reseller. Special provision is made in the Bill for mere recommendations of resale prices. In the absence of these provisions a recommendation would constitute an inducement and would on that account constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. This would, in the Government's view, be going too far. So long as it is made quite clear that a recommendation is nothing more than a recommendation-that is, that there is no obligation on the part of the reseller to comply with it-the n there is no reason for treating it as resale price maintenance, and indeed there would be circumstances in which the resellers themselves would be unnecessarily inconvenienced if it were so treated. But on the other hand the legislation must plainly ensure that suppliers are not permitted to put any form of pressure on their resellers in the form of legally permissible recommendations. Proposed section 66B accordingly permits a recommendation to be made as to the resale price of goods provided that the recommendation is in writing and the document is endorsed with the words: The price set out or referred to herein is a recommended price only and there is no obligation to comply with the recommendation'. In regard to the withholding of supplies, that agreement will, by virtue of proposed one point that I wish to make clear is that section 66F, be to that extent unenforceable. it will not be resale price maintenance under the BiU unless the withholding is for the reason that the reseller is refusing to Division2 for the granting of exemptions. conform to the supplier's stipulations as to An application for such an exemption wiU resale price.

It will relating to what is commonly called 'loss be open to a person other than the applileadering'.

The detrimental effects referred make it clear that the supplier has this right. In the Government's view, it is undesirable that the control of restrictive trade practices should be achieved by unnecessary resort to the criminal law, and proposed section 66E accordingly excludes the possibility of criminal proceedings in respect of resale price maintenance. However, the fact remains that the BiU provides for the practice to be unlawful and provision is made in proposed section 90AA for it to be the subject of restraint by an injunction issued by the Industrial Court. An application for such an injunction will be able to be made by the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Trade Practices or by a person who has suffered loss or damage by reason of the particular practice complained of. Such a person wiU, moreover, have arightto recover damages in respect of any such loss or damage. Finally, if the practice is provided for by an agreement, I turn now to the provisions in proposed Before granting an exemption the tribuset out iu sub-section (2.) are virtually the tive as possible.. If the conclusion is same as those in the comparable provisions reached that there is a need for further of the Resale Prices Act 1964 of the amendments of the Act, further legislation United Kingdom, and they cover the will follow in due course.

I commend the services.

In its final report the Committee recommended that the number of open electorates be increased from 69 to 82 and the number of regional electorates from 15 to 18. During its 1971 tour of Papua and New Guinea the Committee met with an overwhelming request for increased representation in the 1972-1976 House of Assembly. It based its recommendations on one regional member for each of the 18 districts in Papua New Guinea and one open member to approximately 30,000 people. Although the Committee found some call on its tour for regional electorates to be abolished the majority opinion favoured their retention. The Committee felt that it was necessary that there be a guaranteed standard of education in the House. The Committee noted in its final report that regional electorates could be reviewed during the 1972-1976 House but that it might be necessary to consider some minimum the ability to read and write if regional electorates were to be replaced or abolished.

Education and Science)-May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this BillI would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the States Grants (Technical Training) Bill. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 2 Bills to be discussed in this debate. tion, that course will be followed. 2 Bills before us, the States Grants (Preschool Teachers Colleges) Bill, which amends the 1968 Act and the States Grants (Technical Training) Bill are both important pieces of legislation. The prethe period in which money may be spentmoney which has already been granted by .. .. 2.30 p.m. this House to the States for pre-school .. .. 2.30 p.m. teachers colleges. Where the buildings had .. 2.30 p.m. to be completed by 30th June this year .. .. 10.30 a.m. they are given an extension of time to 31st December 1972. This is not a tremendous issue to discuss. Certain pr-school authorities have not been able to carry through their building programmes within the time originally specified. 1 only want to make this passing remark: The Commonwealth and the States have never been seized with the importance of pre-school education, excepting where there is an articulate population and, in the Commonwealth case, excepting in its own Territories. Yet this subject now has a long history. The Commonwealth originally set up the Lady Gowrie child centres on very generous lines-generous , at any rate, for the days when they were set up-and fhe theory was to say to the States: 'Well, there they are. Go thou and do likewise'. Of course, the States did not have the money to go and do likewise so the Lady Gowrie centres simply stayed as examples that were not followed. We also have in the Australian Capital Territory a structure of preschool education which by Australian standards is quite outstanding but the States have never been able to imitate it. We have a limited Commonwealth intervention in this field in the kind of legislation which is now before us, and that limited intervention is to assist in the capital cost of setting up training colleges for pre-school teachers. It is the belief of the Opposition that the Commonwealth has to come in to reinforce the States to establish a pre-school system of education. It is quite clear in the Northern Territory, for instance, that where we have pre-scbool centres they are extremely important in that children of the Aboriginal race and children of European race mix together and have a social association, and for children of the Aboriginal race who are coming in as fringe dwellers they are a very important introduction to the sort of new way of life that they are following.

77,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) (3.15),"Th efully aware of bow important psychologically pre-school centres are for children in their whole life development. We hope that this type of legislation will be a precursor of Commonwealth intervention in this field and the platform of the Australian Labor Party provides for the setting up of a pre-school education commission to be radar, as it were, to guide Commonwealth action iu the development of preschool facilities. The other measure, the States Grants (Technical Training) Bill, is interesting. This increases the expenditure of the Commonwealth in assisting the States in the establishment of technical colleges from $30m in a triennium to $36m in a triennium or $12m a year instead of $10m a year. It is doubtful whether the increase from $30m to $36m for the triennium does very much more than offset the trend of inflation. It is not likely that the States will be able to buy much more in the way of buildings in this triennium than they did in the last triennium. It is not likely that $36m will go any further in the coming triennium than $30m did in the last, yet it is to be welcomed because it will create further technical facilities. The Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn) foresees that the legislation will assist the States to meet: . . . likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as retraining of married women and retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service decline in English earning capacity. A briland industry for higher technician courses . . . I am afraid Australia needs a much greater expenditure and effort directed to technical education to give the Australian labor force the skill and flexibility it requires. We have in this country very much followed the English tradition of education and not the Scottish tradition, and this has been our disaster. I remember going to Dunedin, which is a Scottish foundation in New Zealand. Founded, I think, in about 1851 it had Otago Boys High School, the Otago Girls High School and the University of Otago by 1862, all in a period of 11 years. Western Australia, a very typical Anglican foundation in 1829, did not get Perth Modern School till 1911 and did not get the University of Western Australia till 1913, a time lapse of 82 and 84 years. 1 am afraid Cromwell, with his ideas on education and his structure of universities which anticipated what Britain did not do till the 1950s, gave the Anglican establishment such a fright that they decided education was a matter for elites whereas Scotland, where the Puritans triumphed, had massive compulsory education about 250 years before England did. We have tended to follow the clerk's education. The great desideratum in our high schools was the Eton-Harrow sort of education of England rather than that of Scotland so it became customary on English ships if one wanted to speak to the ship's engineer-o r to any engineermerely to bellow 'Mac' down the ship's hold and one knew one had the engineer because technical education was very much a Scottish monopoly. Starting with compulsory education early the Scots broadened it. The original Puritans wanted everybody to have an education so they could all read the Bible. After the King and the Church had been subject to the New Model Army they did not want literate lower order men. Seriously, this is a tradition. I think that the lack of technical education in the United Kingdom, or its late development, steadily dragged Britain back after 1851. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was a high water mark. After that one could say Germany and everybody else eclipsed England in technical education. This was concealed because Britain had a great overseas empire from which there was an inflow of dividends and this cushioned the steady liant book is out which consists of a whole series of quotations which one would think were a current commentary on England, such as the Consul in Switzerland reporting that 3,000 salesmen from Germany and other countries had gone through the country selling goods but only 28 salesmen had come from Britain and none could speak the languages. They did not present their goods showing the correct decimal weights and measures. They insisted on presenting things with their own unintelligible English weights and measures and constantly goods produced in Britain were not delivered on time. One was quite astonished to read that this was the report of the consuls in the year 1880. One would think it was the current lament of the 1970s. There has not been, I might say, the respect for technical education in the English system of education and that carfor a much more technically efficient popuried out to Australia that there was in the lation than she has had in the past.

78,Mr Brown (Diamond Valley),"It is significant, therefore, that at this time there should be this piece of legislation and the earlier Act which was passed in 1968 relating to a singularly important part of pre-school education. It is also significant that the Commonwealth itself should realise, as 1 believe it does, the overwhelming importance of preschool education in a civilised society such as Australia's. The Commonwealth's role in this part of education and in other aspects of education is one which has developed very much over recent years and is not a role which the Commonwealth has exercised for a very long period of time. This is mainly because of the constitutional situation. Whereas there are certain specific matters which are the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, education by and large is still the constitutional responsibility of the State governments. But, nevertheless, the Commonwealth has had a role to play and has been taking very valuable steps in education over the years. I noted in a book entitled 'Australia Since Federation' by Professor Fred Alexander, which was published in 1969, a particularly interesting exchange between a former Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, and one of his senior advisers. It indicates the Commonwealth's attitude to education at that time. The then Prime Minister's adviser was suggesting to Mr Chifley that the Commonwealth should go into a wider area of education, and he advanced this argument with some force. This book describes the exchange as follows: 'No', said Chifley, 'I'd like to keep out of education-it has special difficulties for us: it's mixed up with religion, aid to denominational schools and all that. Besides, the Constitution leaves education as a State function.* 'But,' objected the adviser, 'you're already subsidising pre-school centres and the universities directly.' 'Ah,' concluded Chifley, with a broad grin, 'that's differentthey're for kids before they've got souls and after they've lost 'em.' Indeed, that is a comment with which some may agree, but it certainly indicates very clearly the Commonwealth's attitude at that time. However, the situation has changed. The Commonwealth's attitude over recent years has been to look at the broad structure of education across the whole nation and to seek to identify those areas in whicb the Commonwealth can be of assistance, bearing in mind that the primary obligation for education is with the States and bearing in mind also that the Commonwealth's role should be to assist the States in their particular role. As I say, the Commonsvealth has made a substantial contribution in many fields of education, and the particular one with which we are concerned now, pre-school teachers training colleges, is one of the areas in which the Commonwealth has been assisting the States. The second of these basic principles that really should be understood is the role that is being played by voluntary organisations in pre-school education across Australia. The State Governments and local authorities, of course, make a very substantial contribution to pre-school education in Australia, but I suggest that it is above all the voluntary organisations which are the backbone in this area of educational activity. Indeed, it is fair to say that the situation of pre-school education in Australia could not be as strong as it is without the very valuable work that is done by the many public spirited people who have taken part in the work of those voluntary organisations. Again it is significant to note that the Commonwealth has recognised and appreciated the valuable work done by such voluntary organisations in the field of pre-school education. When a former Minister for Education and Science introduced the principal Bill, the States Grants (Pre-School Teachers Colleges) Bill 1968, he had this to say: Finally, I should like to express the Government's respect and admiration of the work of the voluntary organisations in the pre-school field, There is a tradition throughout Australia of community involvement in this area of education, not only of parents interested in having a kindergarten available for tbeir own children but also of many men and women giving freely time and money so that kindergartens are available in areas where need is great. From the former arises a most useful awareness in the minds of parents of many aspects of their children's education, an awareness which may be maintained throughout the years of schooling. The latter is a most useful form of community service. That is what the Minister said on that occasion and it indicates that the Commonwealth has very commendably recognised the work done by voluntary organisations in the pre-school education field and is further assisting them. One of these organisations which has taken a very important pan in pre-school education in Australia is the Australian Pre-school Association. The work of this Association has likewise been recognised by the Comsuppose that 50 per cent is not exceptionmonwealth insofar as the Commonwealth ally high, but it is, I venture to say, better has been making grants to it so that it than in other States. The 50 per cent might might carry on its work.

It is interesting to look at some of improved. the work that the Victorian Branch has been engaged in. It appointed a sub-combeen published recently is tbe report of mittee to carry out a survey of the whole Professor Karmel's committee on educacross-section of pre-school education in tion in South Australia. In the chapter Victoria, to look at the present situation, relating to pre-school education that report the needs and the best way in which those reveals a situation which is not very satisneeds could be met.

The situaloss. It is vital that recognition and due attention be given to the important part which pre-school tion is not very good in some of the States education plays in the totalfieldof education. Without labouring the point, it is importal Territory and the Northern Territory tant to remember that pre-school education where, of course, the Commonwealth has is, above all, laying these firm foundations particular responsibility. for the child's subsequent educational experience. Secondly-and again this is a point parthat need to be met and remedied. It proticularly related to the need which this vides some $2.5m for the provision of prepiece of legislation seeks to meet-w e school teacher training colleges and it will should note tbe emphasis that the sub-comenable the capacity to produce trained premittee placed on the need for improved school and kindergarten teachers to be and expanded facilities.

It is important to remember that survey and ascertained that there were this is a particular need that was identified some 70,000 pupils in Victoria who started by the Commonwealth's not just making primary education in the year in which the its own decision about the matter but survey was conducted. It found that some rather by consulting the State Govern50 per cent of those children had received ments, the local authorities, the colleges at least 1 year of pre-school education. I and all bodies and groups concerned with at least the opportunity, which its parents may or may not take up, to have that A very interesting document that has emphasise, is taking all children between but it is fairly good in the Australian CapiThe need is there and I suggest that the Bill that we are considering will enable pre-school education. Their opinion, as expressed to the Commonwealth and accepted by the Commonwealth, is that it is in the area of pre-school teacher colleges that the greatest need existed. It is very commendable that the Commonwealth has seen fit to make this substantial sum of money available for the provision of more places in pre-school teacher training colleagues. The third area of-concern that the subcommittee of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Pre-school Association identified related to supervisors-no t merely the teachers themselves but those highly trained and experienced pre-school and kindergarten supervisors who supervise the work of a group of pre-school centres or kindergartens. The sub-committee looked at the period 1963-69 and found that during that time there had been 223 additional pre-school centres established in Victoria. It also found that some 30 to 40 new pre-school centres were being established each year. But despite such a large increase in the 6-year period in the number of pre-school centres built, the number of supervisors available had not increased by one since 1963. It was for that reason that the sub-committee made a specific recommendation relating to the necessity for an increase in the number of supervisors available to carry out this important work. The sub-committee recommended as follows: . . . that the ratio of centres to supervisor should be 20-30 Centres to each supervisor. It would be necessary for an additional 8 advisors to be appointed to establish a ration of 1 to 30 centres. The present load of 60 or more centres per advisor makes it impossible to provide adequate help for the Committee and teachers. That is another important area of need which the Committee identified as the result of its survey. Coming closer to home, let me refer to one of the particular training colleges mentioned in the schedule to the 1968 Act. I refer to the Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers' College. The Committee was able to identify the particular financial needs which that college had then and still has. The first of the important matters is that there is a need for recurrent funds to be made available. The Committee referred to the necessity for this money to be provided by the Commonwealth. That was the view of the Committee. It is not a view which should be accepted automatically but, I suggest, it is a view that should be taken into account. It is significant that a body such as this, with wide and long experience in preschool education and in dealing with State governments and the authorities concerned with pre-school education, knowing the sources of finance available and where they have come from, should have recommended specifically that some considerations should be given to making recurrent grants available to the college by the Commonwealth. I trust that that is something which the Commonwealth will take into account and keep under consideration as it continues to look at the role of the Commonwealth in education in the years to come. The second of the particular needs related to bursaries. It was felt by the Committee that, at least as far as the Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers' College was concerned, more teacher bursaries should be made available and that they should be more valuable and brought up to par with the studentships made available by the Department of Education and Science for those persons who intend to undergo primary school teacher training. They are the 2 particular needs of the Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers' College which the Committee identified as the result of its survey. I hope that honourable members will look at the report that the Committee made as a result of its inquiries and look al the needs of pre-school education that still exist. I emphasise, as educational authorities have been emphasising for some time, that this is a very important field of education. I do not want to go over all the recommendations that the Committee made but I should like to refer briefly to a few of them in the time. I have left to me. The Committee emphasised that adequate supervision of all pre-school centres is vital. It goes on to substantiate that statement by saying that at the present time there is not adequate supervision available in view of the lack of staff to carry out that important activity. It further said that the section of the Department of Healthwhich is the responsible department in Victoria-responsibl e for the supervision of pre-school centres in Victoria is understaffed and that there is a need for a substantial increase in the staff available. The Committee emphasised the work of voluntary committees and the fact that the voluntary committees do not receive sumcient financial support from the State and Federal Governments. It made a plea for furtherfinancialsupport from those governments. Without going into it in more detail, it is fair to say that the report is very analytthe fact that he went to London and had a ical. It goes into the subject of pre-school education in Victoria in great depth. It identifies particular needs in pre-school education in Victoria. I compliment the Australian Pre-School Association on the work it has done in that regard. Let me go back to the Bill and say that it is substantially a machinery piece of legislation insomatters. I want to remind the House that far as it post-dates the prescribed date within which the grants can be made under the legislation. It goes hand in hand with the principal Act which was passed in 1968 which makes a substantial sum of money-$2Jm-availabl e for pre-school teachers' training colleges. This scheme of legislation shows that the Commonwealth recognises the importance of pre-school education in Australia. It is important for the long term education of all children in Australia. Without any equivocation at all I compliment the Government on introducing the legislation in the first place and certainly on introducing this particular piece of legislation which will ensure that all the money can be disposed of and to the very best advantage. would like to speak briefly also about the States Grants (Pre-School Teachers Colleges) Bill. I must confess that I was intrigued to hear tbe reference to the former Prime Minister, the late Ben Chifley, in this connection as no-one has to make any apology for the great interest displayed in a very practical way by his government. One should not talk in retrospect on occasions like this, but I would remind the honourable member for Diamond Valley( Mr Brown) that it was the Chifley government that was responsible for the introduction of the post-war reconstruction training scheme and which laid the plans for the extension of the university scholarships scheme to secondary education. I would remind the honourable gentleman also that for years after I came to this Parliament in 1955 I heard the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, ridiculing the idea that the Commonwealth had any obligation in educational matters at all. Invariably he invoked the Constitution as an impregnable barrier which would prevent the Commonwealth from playing any part in pre-school, primary, secondary or technical education. For that matter, if it had not been for scotch on the rocks in the Savoy Hotel with Sir Keith Murray, I doubt whether we would ever have had an inquiry into secondary education in Australia. It is to the eternal credit of Sir Keith Murray that he was able to persuade the reluctant Sir Robert Menzies to interest himself in these the original Act-the States Grants (PreSchool Teachers Colleges) Act of 1968empowered the Government to make grants of up to $2?m to the States for allocation to pre-school organisations for capital projects. This BiU is a consequential one. It is to extend the time in which those grants can be made. The Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn) said that the BUI is aimed at doubling the capacity for the training of pre-school teachers in Australia. One cannot be certain that that declared intention can be fulfilled, for it takes a lot more than buildings to facilitate the doubling of the number of pre-school teachers. Regrettably, even if this is achieved, the demand growth is such that no real progress will be accomplished. The shortage of teachers in pre-school education will be even greater than it was before. The fact is that State Governments have no financial capacity to alleviate this problem of the unavailability of adequate pre-school facilities and opportunities throughout Australia, because they lack the taxing power. This Government, which has the taxing power, up to this point of time has shown no inclination to accept the responsibility to underwrite the States' pre-school education programmes. Many matters have to be taken into account besides the capital cost of buildings. There is a need for residential facilities, for scholarships, for equipment and for finance to cover the cost of administration. I was interested to read a Press release on 20th February 1970 made by the then Minister for Labour and National Service on this subject. He gave an indication of the results of a study of the pattern",53,States Grants Pre School Teachers Colleges Bill 1971
79,Mr Les Johnson (Hughes) (3.50),"Iof child care centres throughout Australia. It contained remarkable revelations. For example, it revealed that 14,000 children attended 555 registered full time day centres in Australia. The Minister said that this was consistent with the statistician's findings that 18,500 children vvere in part-time or full-time centres. The release went on further to say that 200,000 mothers in the work force had 250,000 children under 6 years of age. Yet only 7 per cent of these children were in child minding centres. One wonders what is happening to the rest of them and about the extent to which, they may be neglected or relegated to the care of people who may not want them. When we go on to look at more of these impactive statistical facts we start to get an New South Wales to send a child to kineven greater shock. New South Wales has 252,000 children in the 2 to 5 year age group. There are 17,000 of these attending pre-school education facilities; that is, some 7 per cent of all those eligible are having the benefits of pre-school education. It is remarkable that in the United Kingdom, which is hard pressed and which is said to be in a bad way, on its knees, the Plowden report is to be implemented, and the Government is working steadfastly towards the end of achieving an enrolment of 90 per cent of the eligible children for pre-school education. Sweden, we are told, has 56 per cent of eligible children enrolled. In the Australian Capital Territory 36 per cent of eligible children are enrolled and 78 per cent of the 4 year olds are enrolled. That is the position in this privileged part of Australia, which I do not quibble about. It ought to be an effective guide to the Government of the kind of thing that should be done throughout the rest of Australia. In Victoria not 36 per cent of those eligible are enrolled but only 17 per cent. In South Australia only 14 per cent, and in New South Wales only 7 per cent of the quarter of a million children eligible for pre-school education are enrolled. To bring New South Wales up to the standard of the Australian Capital Territory, 3,500 extra teachers will be needed, according to the authorities. When one looks at the extent to which pre-school education is subsidised per head of population one will again see in a vivid way the disparities that operate throughout this countrya state of affairs for which this Government clearly must accept responsibility. If it accepts any responsibility about this matter, if it is to underwrite, surely its job is to ensure that its responsibilities are discharged in full. In the Australian Capital Territory we subsidise pre-school education to the extent of $1.82 per head of population. In Victoria the subsidy is 57c, in South Australia it is 45c, in Western Australia it is 21c, in Queensland it is 8c, and in poor old New South Wales it is 6c per head. That is to say, assistance is given in the Australian Capital Territory at a rate that is 30 times higher than that in New South Wales. If that sounds like an equitable arrangement or anything approaching justice, it could have fooled me. It often costs more in dergarten than it does to send a student to university. Whereas the cost of a 3 year arts course in the University of New South Wales averages $6.80 a week, charges at most kindergartens in that State are between $5 and $10 a week. Many of these kindergartens are little more than child minding centres with hardly any educational content. The incidence of untrained staff is extremely high, and buildings and equipment are often inadequate. According to the Bureau of Census and Statistics, over 100,000 Australian women are willing to go to work and want to go for economic reasons, but many are prevented from doing so through the cost or unavailability of pre-school education facilities. I am not advocating by any means that women should have to go to work but it is an economic necessity for many women at the present time, and that this is the barrier to their employment is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. How can a woman with, say, 2 children find the incentive to go to work if she has to pay $20 a week for the care of her children at a pre-school education centre? Nevertheless in many areas there are long waiting lists and many parents have to book children into various types of centres months and even years ahead if they want to get them accommodated. What has happened to the announcement made by the Government in February last year that the Commonwealth would set up a network of child minding centres throughout Australia? In any case what sort of quality characteristics will these centres assume if they ever get off the ground? Will they be staffed by trained personnel? Where will the staff come from? WiU there be sufficient trained in the centres to be established under this legislation? Will these centres compare with the excellent centres conducted by the Lady Gowrie organisation, the Kindergarten Unions and such bodies as the Sydney Day Nursery Association? Will they be child minding centres or centres properly oriented to education? Pre-school education, as the honourable member for Premantle said, is the Cinderella of the education system. Predominantly it is the children of middle class families who have the benefit of pre-school education. This is certainly the case in Sydney. To tbe extent to which Sydney has these centres, they are substantially located on the northern side of the harbour bridge, and out in the southern suburbs and in the western sprawl it is a matter of catch as catch can. There is very little public finanindicate that some thought has been given cial support for these centres and so the families have to make very substantial sacrifices if they want their children to get the benefit of pre-school educadon. Economic barriers stand in the way of conferring these benefits on the impoverished social group not only in Sydney but in to amend provides up to $2im for capital almost every part of Australia.

The aims of it want to thwart and stop this exploitation most of the organisations-the beneficiary of the educational needs of children, or does it want to make it a part of the education system? Apparently there has been no application of thought to the important matter of who should meet the cost of teacher training and of teacher salaries and the capital cost of buildings and equipment. Apparently this has never been sorted out properly. Who pays the bill? Should this educational opportunity be available to families with or without direct charge, or should it be a charge on the public purse and based on the principle of capacity to pay through the utilisation of the uniform taxation system, which meets so many other educational requirements? In the preschool education system what is to be the role of the community, industry, local government authorities and State and Federal governments? I would like the Minister or some spokesman for the Government to to any of these matters. When will a blueprint of objectives be formulated, propagated and practically supported by the Government of Australia? The principal Act which this Bill seeks works. In New South Wales this provides for a new college for the Sydney Day NurUp to date industry has done practically organisations which are listed in this Bill; and I have checked through their objectives -involv e the following factors: They want pre-school experience for all. So far many of these organisations such as the kindergarten unions and so on are intent on meeting the needs of the socially deprived and afflicted. They are unable to spread their service throughout the region or the country at large. They want pre-school experience for all 3 to S-year olds whose parents require it and acceptance of Government responsibility for the teacher training programme. They want the Government to meet the full salaries of all trained teachers who graduate from a recognised college. Further, they want capital grants to establish more centres. It probably costs a minimum of $30,000 or $40,000 to set up a centre for some 25 children. Is this to be relegated to young communities where young couples are confronted with paying off their homes and establishing their families? . The kindergarten unions want grants for kindergarten teachers college administration and supervision and scholarships or bursaries for students. They point out some of the problems. There is a desperate shortage of staff and accommodation; there are inadequate salaries; and some States have no awards at all covering this field. In some States there are terribly ad hoc arrangements. Some States have no legislation covering pre-school education centres. Further, there is an incredibly high staff wastage rate because there is more attractive employment outside and as a result there are very limited promotion opportunities. Overseas there are very significant new trends in this field. There is a change in emphasis from the social development of a child in kindergartens and pre-school centres to the intellectual development of children. There is the development of the concept that disadvantaged children should receive compensatory pre-school training. As I mentioned earlier the United Kingdom is giving effect to the Plowden report that pre-school training should be available to all children over 3 years of age. In the near future the authorities in the United Kingdom expect to attain a 90 per cent response. In the United States of America under 'Project Head Start', the Economic Opportunity Act 1964 provides pre-school opportunities plus medical and dental care as well as proper nutrition if necessary. That legislation also provides for a full year compensatory education programme plus an 8 weeks sum up programme for children prior to entering full time education. The Federal Government of the United States meets up to 80 per cent of the expense in any community and in poor communities it meets the entire cost. I want to say that for a long period the Opposition has declared its intention of doing something more useful in this regard. I conclude by saying that the Opposition stands for this: For Government responsibility for education, including the obligation to ensure that pre-school education is available for every child; The Commonwealth to establish an Australian preschool commission to define and examine regularly the aims of pre-school education and to recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to ensure that pre-school centres are located, staffed and equipped on the basis of needs and priorities. Only with the implementation of this kind of programme in which the Commonwealth takes the initiative can this problem which has been neglected so much and suffered by so many, be effectively overcome. Dr SOLOMON (Denison) (4.10)-We appear to be ringing the changes on these 2 cognate Bills. I want to speak mainly on the Bill concerning technical education. I hope not to be very long because I do not feel that this Bill requires a great exhibition of fervour in relation to the matters which are involved. However, under this Bill we are talking about 400,000 students who are involved in technical education in Australia. Of that number something like 8,000 students are in 11 or 12 colleges in Tasmania. I think it is fair to say, as was very thoroughly explored, if not said in the same words by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), that technical education in the history of Australian education has been a very decided poor relation. That fact has been recognised in recent years to the extent that we have now a continuing programme of assistance to the field of technical education. But there certainly remains a situation which I think is of vital consequence to this country; that is, a situation wherein the untrained man has probably never been at a greater disadvantage. Given the fact that not everyone either has the capacity or the will, even if the physical means are there, to take on what is normally called an academic line of training, the importance of technical training assumes an even greater role in our total educational spectrum. I think the honourable member for Fremantle was very right in drawing attention to the origins of our educational philosophy and the fact that we follow far more the English line of thinking and training than in fact the Scots. It may or may not be that our lack of history of educational development in the technical field stems from that choice or following of origins. However, the situation remains that we have a continuing, and certainly not lessening, need for training in this field. The honourable member for Fremantle raised a number of social issues of quite wide connotation which depend on that particular discussion of philosophy and origins which I do not wish to explore at this time although they might well be explored during some other debate. The need for technical skills I think is not merely one in which we need to train people to do particular jobs which it suggests; they hold considerable of a largely physical nature in a skilful way. Certainly, that is necessary, as I do not think we could reasonably claim that this country has a tradition of very skilful workers with their hands. The best workers of this type that we have had lived a long time ago and probably put up some of the very fine stone buildings that we find in parts of this country, notably in Tasmania. These workmen were skilled in crafts which have practically long since gone. This is the sort of thing which has not been very much in the ethos of Australian educationcertainly not at. tbese levels-in recent times. It is not only a need to work machines well or to learn newfieldssuch as electronics and that sort of thing. There is also a need for those people coming in at the bottom level of technical training to develop both their skills and their personality capacity to become very good foremen. If honourable members opposite occasionally suggest that there is some lack of managerial skills in this country I think can report difficulties of implementing that we should at once identify a very plans to spend the money available, this is decided lack of skills both of the sheerly technical kind and of those that can lead others at that level of operation in Australia. I believe that Australia is very much lacking in the capacity to get the best out of workmen of a basically skilled nature by their fellow workmen who are in a position of some authority and leadership. Therefore, anything we do in this sphere towards creating a greater pool of skills among the substantially working tradesman type of population from which can be drawn-and with greater possibility-goo d men to lead in these fields, T think, will be something very well done. Mention was made by the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn) in his second reading speech of the Tregillis Mission which went to Europe to look into the field of technical education. The mission's report, of course, is very comprehensive and long, and it makes interesting reading. It is one which I think the Minister suggested in his speech has not yet been possible to implement, but it has been widely viewed and studied by those in the appropriate areas. I look forward with some hope to at least the transfer of the knowledge which that report contains and to the possible adaptation of some of the things promise for the further development of technical education here. In connection with this BillI should like to put on record the fact that in Tasmania2 colleges currently are involved in the total moneys made available under the Bill. The figure involved totals for Tasmania about $ 1.14m and it concerns 2 schools in the third and fourth population centres of the island. At Burnie afigureof about $1.3m from the previous period is involved and tenders are to be called next month for the trade complex at the Burnie Technical College. I think that tenders for the site works have been let already. Funds are available for consultants in the further development of this college. At Devonport $601,500 has been expended on the first stage which has been completed and is now occupied. The second stage is about to commence and about $430,000 of funds is involved. The second stage is expected to be completed in January 1972. While in some areas of education we not so of those colleges in Tasmania. In fact I am happy to report that administrative and programming difficulties are either non-existent or minimal. Everything is going well and the local authorities are happy with these 2 particular developments. I understand that this is at some variance with the general implementation of technical education grants which the Government has made available over the past 7 or so years. In fact I believe that the main difficulty in the implementation of this programme has not been the lack of funds, as honourable members opposite sometimes suggest, but is related to the capacity of the States to plan a programme of construction in such a way that progress on their various projects and, consequently, expenditure from the funds available are maintained at an even and appropriate level throughout the triennium or the period involved. It is rather nice to see that in Tasmania that problem is not being met. 1 shall say no more at this stage about the field of technical education other than that it is clearly a deserving field. The increase from $10m to $12m per annum for thc States as a whole is to be commended and I hope it will continue to produce the skills which are so needed. Pre-school education opens up a considerable field for social commentary. The honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) already has spoken on that front. I have no intention of taking him up on his comments point by point, nor do I propose exploring the field of pre-school education from start to finish. Basic interest in this field arises from a growing body of evidence, of not very distant origin, which is showing with little doubt that children of the ages from 3 to 5 years have a far greater capacity to learn than was ever thought possible, in general terms at any rate, by the general public or, for that matter, by educationists. I found the penultimate remarkI think it was-of the honourable member for Hughes most interesting in this regard. He drew attention to the fact that in some areas overseasI think he mentioned Great Britain particularly-ther e has been a change in training at this very low level from social to intellectual training. That, I think, is implied or should be implied in the whole concept of providing some degree of formal education at the pre-school level, but I 12669/71-M-184 1 wonder whether the honourable member for Hughes and others of his colleagues have taken their thinking any further on that particular front because, as I understand it, their counterparts in Britain, if not in the Australian Labor Party in Australia, have joined the ranks in championing the concept of comprehensive education. If comprehensive education stands for anything, in my view it stands for a considerable involvement in social training as well as, and sometimes in substitution for, intellectual training. I suggest that members opposite might take their thinking into the next level of education. If it is generally agreed that intellectual training is desirable at the 3. to 5-year-old level, .1 should think it very hard to make a case for any diminution in intellectual training at some higher level of education. That is not to gainsay that some degree of social involvement is not useful. The basic point is that young children, 3 to 5 years old, are capable intellectually and mentally of taking aboard a lot of reasonably formal training. By whatever skilful means that training may be transmitted they are, in fact, capable of learning a lot. The object of this Bill substantially is to provide teacher training for that purpose. The honourable member for Hughes questioned whether the Government thought that the whole area of pre-school education was good or bad. I do not know how rhetorical his question was meant to be but I should have thought that the very fact of the Government making available funds for this particular area of education, which has only recently been recognised as deserving of considerable government involvement, would have answered that question. The Government thinks that it is a good thing. He also asked questions about teachers for where and what. Perhaps if we opened up the whole field of pre-school education that would be fair comment. Clearly it is no good having teachers if there are no schools. It is worse to have schools with no teachers. I should have thought that in the general context of shortages, real and imagined, in the whole process of education questions about teachers would not require much answering in practical terms. It may be thought, and it still can be said, that the Government has not entered upon this field in as thoroughgoing a fashion as might be desirable. I think the same is true of any field of education at any time. It would be unfair to suggest that preschool education is other than a beginning fielda field which is just being developed for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. It does, of course, raise the major social issue of just where children aged between 3 and 5 years can best be trained. A number of members from both sides of the House have expressed the view in passing, or more centrally, from time to time that it is difficult to find a substitute for the home. It is also well established-and probably increasingly so as time passes and educational psychology develops-that the mother is the central figure in a young child's life and if she has the capacity to transmit not only love and affection but also something of a basically intellectual kind, so much the better. But the plain fact remains that not all mothers are, at least in any formal sense, capable of transmitting, much less trained to transmit, in any sort of defined area in any meaningful, efficient or educational sense, a body of information equivalent to the capacity of her child, or for that matter somebody else's child, to absorb. Hence a case can be made, irrespective of one's social attitudes in this matter, for some body of formalised pre-school education. This, as we have said earlier, is recognised and it is obviously something which will develop further. I think, however, that I would prefer to leave this to another time and perhaps to a debate on a somewhat slightly different Bill. The question at large of social attitudes and social influences in this area can, of course, open up a whole gamut of possibilities between the wholesale creches of the Soviet Union and our hitherto held concept of a young child's place being in the home with the mother. I commend both these Bills to the House as, in fact, the Minister has long since done. Dr JENKINS (Scullin) (4.26)I wish to greater number of pre-school teachers will make only passing reference to the States be a great help. Grants (Pre-school Teachers Colleges) Bill. I must admit to some degree of agreement with the honourable member for Denison debate dealing with the question of tech(Dr Solomon) that on the question of a nical training and the provisions of this pre-school child the home is probably the Bill relating to funds for building and equipbest training place, but with the qualification ment for this training. HereI disagree with that the home is economically and the honourable member for Denison who domestically stable. Unfortunately in many said that perhaps the debate on this should instances this does not apply. I welcome the additional money which will be made available for the training of pre-school teachers because I hope that they may help to solve some of the problems in our community today. These teachers may be used to staff creches which not only educate the children but care for them in other ways because there are special groups that require this help. I refer to special groups such as the deserted husband who is often in a dreadful position. He is left not only with young children to care for but often with very high debts, hire purchase and so on which his wife has left behind. Another group is the deserted wives, widows and unmarried mothers, all of whom often have to find sources of employment to be able to provide for their children and keep the family together. At present in many cases they have to use the private child minding centres which, in the main, are expensive and do not have adequately trained personnel. The other factor, of course, is that there is an increasing number of married women who, for their own economic need or because of their interest in following a trade or a job, wish to go out into employment. There is also an increasing demand by industry and institutions for the employment of married women. For example, in the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Burke( Mr Keith Johnson) a large factory-Ericssons Pty Ltd-ha s found it necessary to set up a creche for the female employees because it needs the women in its work force and to attract them it must provide facilities for the children to be cared for. Hospitals are in much the same position in attracting married nursing staff back into nursing. I instance 2 hospitals in Victoria, the Alfred Hospital and the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital. In order to get adequate nursing staff, they have had to set up creches or pre-school centres. So in this sense the provision for training of a I want to spend most of my time in this be deferred until some other time. I believe we should give to this Bill a great deal of importance, representing as it does the continuation of a scheme that started in 1964. We should look at it as it reflects a great deal of educational change which has been forced on governments and the community because of the rapid technological advancement taking place in the community today. I believe the honourable member for Denison outlined quite well some of the reasons for expansion. Indeed, he covered the affairs of his own State rather well, but I deplore his suggestion that only those of lower academic attainment should be those who go into the technical training scheme. I do not believe that this should be so. 1 believe there is a place for the intellectually able and that more and more of them should be taken into the technical stream. In fact, this sort of attitude on the part of educationists, particularly in the primary field, to divide them into 2 groups, those who intellectually attain and those who do not and then send them on to technical schools, has been one of the things that has held back the development of technical training. As one who has spent many voluntary man hours serving on technical, high school and university councils in the last 15 years I feel that I have some experience from which to speak. It is not my intention forcefully to criticise the Government. After all, it would only lay the blame on the States or the lack of trained technical teachers and there may be some validity in that argument. RatherI want to look at subjects relevant to, and ask appropriate qualitative questions on, matters of technical training and its expansion to which these grants may be applied and for which they may need to be increased in the future. These questions are meant to invoke these thoughts: How are the amounts of these grants determined? How do we know the basic information that will give us an idea of the needs of the States? How are the grants related to the needs? How are the needs determined? How do we know what amounts are necessary? I reiterate the quotation from the speech of the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn) by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). The Minister said: In determining this level of assistance the Governaccommodation which could bring small ment has taken into account likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as retraining of married women and retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service and industry for higher technician courses, which could have an effect on the programme of the States. I would have thought that the words 'could have' were too mild. I think 'will have' is the term which is most appropriate and which should have been used. If we add to this the general quotation from the publication 'The Secondary School at Sixes and Sevens' it is relevant. It reads: In a real sense the secondary school has become an institution for holding adolescents until the labour market is ready to receive them. The technical society demands more mature and adaptable, if not more skilled entrants into the work force. While it may be held that the latter quotation applies particularly to high school more than to technical training, I would direct the attention of the House to the evidence of increased participation and retention of students in technical schools mentioned in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Education in South Australia 1969-70. At page 59 it reads: . . . in other words, 70 per cent of the observed increase in the number of senior students aged 16-18 years is attributable to rising retention rates. Then on the following page it states: Technological progress is producing an industrial structure which requires an increasingly skilled and sophisticated work force; and employers are demanding higher educational standards of applicants for jobs. Schools are offering an increasing number of courses to suit the differing aptitudes, ability and needs of pupils. On page 66 of that report we see the differential in retention rates between high schools and technical schools. There is a vast difference between the two in that in 1964 from the 11th grade to the 12th grade the high school retained 39 per cent while the technical school retained only 3.6 per cent. Four years later the figure had risen to 50.3 per cent for high schools and 15.6 per cent for technical schools. I think this shows that the retention in technical schools is rising quite dramatically. The need for definite steps to alter the difference in retention rates between metropolitan and country schools, as shown in this report, is quite real. We may never remove this barrier because of the lack of large country industries, but by the use of residential numbers of children from country areas for training and then send them back into the the Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes) smaller industries which may exist, these must have a continuing interest because of grants will make a vast difference. The need for vocational training for dropouts and misfits is another factor that could why the accent is necessary only on the be added to the need for technical training expansion. AH this indicates a rather wider progress that is being made in the recognirange than one would believe the term technical training should be applied to, yet much of this is included, as was indicated by the Minister. At a State level-and as a former member of a State Parliament I must arise out of the reports of the various am pleased to see this-the grants for the committees which sat during the 1950s and buildings and equipment necessary for the early 1960s which, amongst other things, technical training do not require matching indicated the need for more university amounts from the States.

For example, instances where matching grants must be Monash applied to preserve proper development. side in the faculties of science and engineerHowever, in this case the field is expanding ing-eve n bearing the name Monash so much in regard to persons requiring because of Sir John Monash's great contritraining and where the needs pressure from bution to technology in Victoria and, employers is constantly changing that I indeed, Australia-ye t this university from welcome the different schemes for developits first intake in 1961 has had the overment in the different States.

In all these fields great advances are being made production-wise and up-to-date training of fully qualified personnel is needed to keep up with modern techniques and methods.

The need for financial assistance for the provision of additional technical training facilities is very much in evidence by the States' submitting early programmes in order to participate in the funds made available under this Act. With the technical era, with the tremendous advances in the various industries and in thefieldsthat 1 have mentioned, it is very important that young Australians receive the best technical education that can possibly be given to them. I feel that under this Bill provision will be made along these lines and considerable benefit will accrue to the various States of Australia in this field. This Bill will be of great benefit to the nation. As one honourable member has said, these are straight out grants. They do not have to matched $1 for $1 by the States and this will be of great benefit to the educational facilities in the States in the funds they have available for the technical education field. I support the Bill and commend it to the House. Bill cannot be regarded as being of great significance. Its only importance is that it extends the period in which money will remain available for pre-school teacher colleges. WhatI would like to discuss is the importance that the Australian Labor Party gives to the right of all children to a pre-school education. We believe that all children should have a pre-school education because of the considerable educational benefits that it can provide. But of equal importance is the strategic role which we believe the pre-school can take in an assault on inequalities between children. Inequalities abound at every level of education in Australia. They reflect the divisions of wealth and class within our society and they are consolidated by a combination of governmental apathy and outright discrimination. For particular groups within the community, such as Aboriginals, migrants and handicapped children, the education system is a one-way street to frustration. For other large sections of the community progress through the education system is determined less by ability and the desire to learn than by parental wealth and social status. These inequalities can be aboof parents, charitable and voluntary orgalished only by a deliberate policy of social and economic change and by an educational policy aimed not merely at giving equal opportunities to all but at giving greater opportunities to those whose needs are the greatest. One of the key instruments to be used by the Australian Labor Party in achieving these ends at the pre-tertiary level is the Australian Pre-schools Commission. The Australian Pre-schools Commission to be established by the Labor Party will serve both a general and a specific function. It will aim to provide a pre-school education for every child and to give early treatment to culturally disadvantaged children. A pre-school education must be regarded as a right of every Australian child. Tts value is paramount for a society which is concerned with the social, emotional, aesthetic and intellectual growth of children. In the environment of the pre-school the door is opened to a wider range of creative and imaginative activities than is provided in the homes and neighbourhoods of many children. The pre-school provides both the outlet and the avenue for physical and intellectual growth which are essential to the healthy development of young children. The foundations which the child's home provides for growth as a social individual and for the development of reasoning and communication skills are reinforced in an atmosphere which makes learning a happy and rewarding experience. The growth of self reliance and social co-operation gives this educational environment in the preschool a value that scarcely needs emphasising. However, this value is barely recognised by governments. The Commonwealth's expenditure on pre-school education is less than microscopic, and represents an insignificant fraction of its total expenditure on education. The Commonwealth's educational blinkers limit its vision to the end products of the educational process. Substantial sums are spent on the minority who are fortunate enough to get to the tertiary level of education, but the Commonwealth makes no direct grants to the primary schools and only nugatory grants to the pre-schools where the formal educational process begins. Such limited preschool facilities as do exist in Australia owe more to the initiative and imagination nisations and municipalities than to the enlightened intervention of State governments. The assistance of State governments",66,States Grants Pre School Teachers Colleges Bill 1971
81,Mr Kennedy (Bendigo) (4.56),"Thisvaries over a range from negligible to unsatisfactory. Only about 3 per cent of the children of pre-school age in New South Wales are attending pre-schools, while the figure in Victoria is approximately 30 per cent. By comparison the Commonwealth recognises the right of all children in the Australian Capital Territory to 1 year of pre-school education. Thus the chances of a child's educational opportunities are determined not in accordance with the principle of equality and the needs of the child but with the fortuitous circumstance of where he.happens to live. At the same time, the use by State governments of a subsidy system to assist parents and voluntary organisations to provide pre-school facilities results in the disteacher colleges if of only marginal assistcrimination which characterises the later stages of education. The subsidy system means that a child's educational opportunities are determined not by his needs and not by the Government's sense of responsibility, but by the accident of where he happens to live. Thus pre-school facilities are most abundant and most satisfactory in wealthier residential areas, and most lacking in rural and inner suburban areas where the facilities are needed most. Thus we have the situation in Victoria referred to by the Maternal and Child Welfare Officer of South Melbourne Council, Doctor Dora Bialestock, who was quoted in the 'Age' of 14th November last year as saying that the largest portion of the Victorian Government's subsidy for preschools was going to the more affluent suburbs. She said that only 1 child in 7 in the working class suburb of Brunswick and only 1 in 5 in South Melbourne were receiving a pre-school education. The same situation can be seen in my own electorate where the number of schools in working class and rural areas is inadequate and where the schools have long waiting lists. Yet not even the more affluent sections of provincial cities and towns in Victoria have top-grade pre-school facilities. At the same time, the fees charged for pre-school education impose a special burden on families of low income. In Victoria, the average fee per term is $13 to $15 at least. Tn some places in Victoria and in other parts of Australia the fees are far higher. The simple fact is that preschool education should be recognised as a right of all children and, accordingly, should be free. But for many parents, the fees are prohibitive, and many children who could benefit most from a pre-school education are being denied the opportunity. It is clear now that pre-school opportunities for all children can be provided only with the assistance of the Commonwealth Government. The States are limited in their revenues, and only slight improvements can be provided by them on their own. The Commonwealth refuses to recognise its obligations. While it guarantees to all children in the Australian Capital Territory the right to 1 year of preschool education, the assistance which the Commonwealth gives to the States in the form of capital grants for pre-school ance and reflects a sense of concern for the welfare of Australian children which is only slightly greater than English governments in the eighteenth century showed towards Dame Schools. But even worse, the sheer materialism of she Commonwealth Government now threatens to build up a system of Commonwealth subsidised day care centres for children, which I believe will have little to do with the educational needs of children. Many of such centres as exist at present ignore the personal, social and educational needs of children and are aimed principally at caring for children while mothers return to the work force. Many of the existing child minding centres breed boredom, insecurity, poor intellectual development, sometimes poor health, frustration and conformity. That is not merely my view. This is the view that was expressed by Phyllis Scott, in her chapter in a book entitled 'It's People That Count'. Only a Government which is concerned with profitability and productivity in the economy rather than the needs of children could finance the expansion of such a system. This materialism must be replaced by concern for the needs of children which will produce a system of pre-schools for all children, and which will help develop creative self-reliant responsible and co-operative individuals. At least the Government should ensure that if it does intend to subsidise child minding centres or day care centres-o r whatever other terminology the Government cares to use-it will balance and co-ordinate the principal economic needs that it is catering for with the educational needs of the children. However, the Labor Party's Pre-School Commission will aim not only to ensure equal access for all children to a preschool education but also to discriminate in favour of those who are disadvantaged by the limitations of home environment. Children from low income families, migrant children, Aboriginal children and handicapped children are unlikely to be equal to others in the level of intellectual and social skills which they have achieved by the time they reach the primary school. The middle class Australian child has already received from his home environment the advantage of greater opportunities for communication, for social confidence, for creativity, for reasoning of the type required by the primary school, and for motivation to be successful. By comparison, the migrant or Aboriginal child faces the massive obstacles of differences between his national and racial cultures and the culture of the white Australian school. The physically, mentally or socially handicapped child faces specific disadvantages which will severely retard his educational growth unless identified and treated early. The child from a family of low income, low education and low occupational status by comparison with the middle class Australian child will not have reached the same level of development of his basic skills of language and reasoning. The disadvantages faced by all these groups of children will accentuate and accelerate throughout their school careers unless they are treated at an early stage. The first few years of education are critical to the attitude which a child develops towards the school and to the abilities he acquires and develops. It is essential that every child should be and feel successful, both at meeting the intellectual tasks set by the school and at being a self-confident individual and member of the school's society. Therefore, while catering for the child's social and personal growth, the schools must strive to maximise every child's ability to communicate, to understand, to concentrate, to create and to find pleasure and satisfaction in learning. The development of these abilities must be continuous. The pre-school level is clearly a strategic stage for identifying and starting to remedy the deficiencies of the disadvantaged child. The Australian Pre-Schools Commission will treat the remedying of handicaps suffered by disadvantaged children as one of its principal tasks. The traditional rofe of the pre-schools, according to Dr M. M. de Lemos, writing in the 'Quarterly Review of Australian Education' of June 1968, has been seen as 'providing mainly for the social and emotional development of the child'. The emphasis has been placed on creative and dramtatic play, ancl the schools' task has been seen as educating the 'whole child'. Learning is largely spontaneous through self-directed activity. The teacher's role is seen as responding to the child's needs rather than imposing guidance or instruction. The value of this role in catering for largely middle class groups of children has been considerable. However, experiments over the last decade-particularl y in Operation Head Start and other American experiments-hav e also highlighted the potential of a supplementary or alternative role for the pre-school in developing the intellectual skills and abilities that are essential for later school achievement. The handicaps which the child's cultural environment cause and in which the greatest retardation generally occurs are in the reasoning and language abilities. These abilities are fundamental to success at every stage of later education. It seems apparent, therefore, that the learning situation provided for the disadvantaged child by the preschool must be structured specifically to develop those skills. This is not to say that such specific and directed learning should be the sole or whole content of his preschool education, nor is there any one definition as to exactly what the teaching methods to be employed should be. Overseas experiments have indicated a wide variety of methods, and further and continuing research is required in Australia. But what does seem clear is that specialised teaching is required in the skills in which the disadvantaged child is deficient. The alternative is to treat him as though he were equal to the more advantaged middle class Australian child and to keep the pre-school oriented towards the present combination of emotional and social development and self-directed learning. This alternative, however, would ignore the already substantial advantages mending appropriation announced. of the middle class child and is likely to leave the disadvantaged child with the same relative handicaps with which he entered the pre-school. Pre-school education must be a national concern. It is no longer tolerable that its third time. growth should be haphazard, unplanned and unco-ordinated, distributing benefits to the few and ignoring the rest of the many. Its future development is possible only with Commonwealth assistance and national planning. The Australian PreSchools Commission to be established by (vide page 1590), on motion by Mr the Labor Party will ensure that CommonFairbairn: wealth moneys will be expendedfirstin the areas of greatest need.

85,Mr Lynch,"In these second reading Industry Conference, which was set up bywaterside workers who were available for work but not required to work received attendance money paid by the Authority from the proceeds of the charge. On the introduction of permanent employment it was recognised that waterside workers on weekly hiring under the Conference arrangements would be in a similar situation in being available for work but on occasions not required to work. The men concerned do not lose by this because they are on a weekly wage. Insofar as the employer was concerned it was decided that, whereas in previous circumstances attendance money would have been paid, the employer should be reimbursed from the charge for full shifts paid for when there was no work for the men. Attendance money payments continue as before for waterside workers who are not engaged on weekly hire and who are defined as classes B and C water1 side workers. Prior to the changes in 1967 the basis for financing the stevedoring industry long service leave scheme through the charge was to provide funds only to meet payments on account of leave taken on a year to year cash basis. In 1967, when the components of the new charges were calculated, it was decided to convert the previousfinancingarrangements from a cash outgoing basis to one where a fund would be built up to enable sufficient money to be available to pay all long service leave as and when it became due. The Authority continued to administer the long service leave scheme. Tbe conclusion reached in 1967 was that the major permanent employment ports should continue, as in the past, to contribute something to the costs in the remaining ports. The maximum rate set for class A waterside workers was therefore fixed at $17.55 per man-week under the 1967 legislation and regulations made under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act at that timefixedthe actual rate at $16.85 per man-week. The notional hourly rate was calculated at 48c, being the same as the pre-existing charge in the industry. The maximum charge in respect of class C waterside workers was fixed at 55c per manhour, only 7c higher than the pre-1967 level, and this amount was determined on the basis of the additional money needed to finance the long service leave fund. At the continuous ports for class B waterside workers the maximum rate of 80c was 32c higher-22 c of this representing the pension, redundancy and long service leave items. The balance of 10c over and above the pre-1967 charge represented a further contribution towards the cost in those ports. The regulations made in 1967 set the charges for both B and C class waterside workers at the maximum provided under the legislation. However, since the introduction of permanent employment in 1967 -whe n the original charges were determined and expected to cover the situation until June 1971-cost s have increased as follows: (a) The weekly wage rate for class A waterside workers has risen from $50.50 per week to $67.40 as at 1st January 1971, because of flow-on of the metal trades margins decision, the national wage case including the last 6 per cent increase, and consent award increases granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This represents an increase of 33.5 per cent in the ordinary award weekly rates for waterside workers since 1967. Over the same period the rate for a metal trades fitter has increased by 33 per cent. (b) In May 1970, under the Chairmanship of a Deputy President of the Commission, Mr Justice Moore, the employers, the ACTU and the Waterside Workers' Federation reached agreement on a number of matters which were awarded by consent. These included a weekly wage increase of $6.50, an extra week of annual leave (now 4 weeks) plus a 17i per cent loading, sick leave increased from 5 to 7 days per annum with no limit on accumulation (previously 2 years limit), in addition 3 days compassionate leave on the death of a close relative, increased meal money $1.25 (previously $1.00), and provision of personal issue of 2 pairs of overalls per year. (c) By previous agreement the rate of payment for annual leave had become the rate for long service leave entitlement and this commitment increased by 17i per cent foilowing the Moore Award. Since the introduction of permanent employment in 1967 the weekly rate of pay for long service leave has risen by 46.2 per cent. (d) Attendance money payable to casual classes B and C waterside workers increased by 11.3 per cent from S3.10 per day in 1967 to S3.45 per day in 1970. (e) The cost of reimbursing employers of class A waterside workers for full shifts when their employees were available for work but not required to work has risen partly because of a 33.5 per cent increase in the minimum weekly rate of pay since 1967 and partly because of the increasing incidence of these shifts this financial year. I should point out that whilst the total waterside worker labour force has decreased from 20,140 in 1967 to 17,178 at the end of February 1971, the demand for labour over the past year or so has fluctuated quite markedly. The result has been that on occasions there have been large surpluses of labour available but not required to work. There are 2 basic reasons for this. One is the need to retain a labour force which is adequate to cope with the peak demands created by trade factors and shipping movements. The second is that the change from conventional to container and unit load vessels has not proceeded at a uniformly consistent rate. Accordingly the incidence of paid but unworked shifts has become the major item of expenditure from the charge revenue and as such is under close scrutiny by the Government. Every effort is being made to keep this factor within reasonable bounds but of course the fluctuations in trade and shipping movements have and always will be a determining influence on the actual level of the labour force required to service the industry. Because of the progressively increasing costs the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has found itself unable to meet its financial commitments from the charge revenue. As an interim measure in mid 1969 the Authority reduced the amount paid to the long service leave fund by 2c per man-hour from that portion of the charge relating to the long term funding of the Long Service Leave Reserve in order to meet day to day expenditure. In October 1970 the Authority was forced into the position of suspending payments to the Long Service Leave Reserve Fund altogether and in addition some interest bearing deposits falling due from that fund reserve have not been reinvested but utilised to meet current expenditure. The cash reserves of the Authority were entirely exhausted in November 1970, and since the 16th October 1970 it has been necessary for the Treasury to make advance payments of $800,000 each month to overcome the current deficits. As a further interim measure pending consideration of legislative changes the charge for class A waterside workers was increased by regulation to the maximum provided by the legislation of $17.55 per man-week, a notional equivalent of 50c per man-hour, as from the 15th February 1971. It is regretted that further increases in the charge are necessary particularly at a time when the Commonwealth is concerned to contain price increases throughout industry. They are needed to restore the financial position of the Authority in order to meet its commitments from the charge revenue and recoup the short-fall in the Long Service Leave Fund which has been eroded since mid 1969 in the ways in which I have just outlined. However it needs to be borne in mind that the charge rates fixed in 1967 have been held at those levels for 3 years during a period of rapidly rising costs in the industry. The increases now needed have come about because of the accumulation of arbitrated decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, other changes in wage rates and conditions of employment awarded with the consent of the stevedoring industry employers and the increased incidence of occasions when there is no work for the men. In fact an increase in charge rates has been specifically requested by the employers and they have indicated that it would be intolerable in their view to continue to allow the Authority to engage in the deficit financing of the financial commitments of the industry. In this respect it needs to be pointed out that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority is primarily acting as an agent for the industry's employers in channelling the funds from the charge back to them for pensions, redundancy and paid but unworked shifts. It might also be said that the Authority plays an agency role for the employers in its administration ciation of Employers of Waterside Labour. of the industry long service leave scheme. The employers, as they did in 1967, have again accepted that thefinancialarrangement for classes B and C waterside workers should be subject to some minor subsidy from the charge levied on the work performed by class A waterside workers. The increases in the charges proposed reflect approximately the same degree of subsidy as that fixed in 1967. To have done otherwise would have placed a disproportionate cost burden on employers in the non-permanent employment ports. The main purpose of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill 1971 is to amend the Stevedoring Charge Assessment Act 1947-1967 to provide for a conversion of the charge for class A waterside workers from a man-week basis to a manhour basis. When the 1967 legislation was introduced the employers specifically requested that the stevedoring industry charge for class A waterside workers should be expressed as a weekly amount as all their records were being kept on this basis in respect of weekly hire employees. The then weekly rate of $16.85 was calculated on an assumed average working week, over a full year, of 37.4 hours. After allowance was made for authorised award absences in a year for annual leave, sick leave and public holidays, the notional should be adequate to meet costs to 30th hourly rate determined was 48c. At the present weekly rate of $17.55 the notional hourly rate would be 50c. Experience has demonstrated that the effective hourly rate of charge paid by individual employers varies according to the degree of labour utilisation and the weekly rate therefore has operated unfairly against those employers unable to obtain maximum utilisation of labour. Put another way, if an employer because of stevedoring contract commitments worked his men on average in excess of 37.4 hours per week the effective hourly rate of charge from the weekly levy of $17.55 would be less than 50c per manhour. Therefore the busier larger employer would be able to get all hours worked at a cheaper hourly rate and enter into contracts to the disadvantage of other employers. The proposed change in the class A charge from a man-week to a man-hour basis has been recommended by the AssoBecause of the proposed conversion of the class A charge to a man-hour basis the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill also provides for consequential amendments to the principal Act to exclude the levying of the charge on specified manhours paid for by the employer but not actually worked by his waterside workers. These paid hours are almost entirely in respect of awarded annual and sick leave entitlements and shifts where waterside workers were available for work but not required to work. The purpose of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill 1971 is to amend the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1967 to permit the charge to be imposed at rates up to $1 per man-hour for class A waterside workers, $1.75 per man-hour for class B waterside workers and $1.20 per man-hour in respect of class C waterside workers. In 1967, the principal Act was amended to permit the respective charge rates to be fixed by regulation at a level not exceeding the maximum rates authorised by the Act. It is the Government's intention to declare as soon as possible by regulation that the new rates of charge be 65c, $1.20 and 82c per man-hour for classes A, B and C waterside workers respectively. These rates in the proposed regulation June 1972 and recoup the deficit in this financial year. Leaving aside the prospect of further increases in wage rates it can be expected there will be scope for some significant reduction when the past services benefits section of the pensions fund and the long service leave reserve have been fully funded and the labour force has been stabilised at an appropriate level following completion of the transition to containerisation and other forms of unit loading. In summary, Mr Speaker, since November 1967 the 33.5 per cent increase in the award rate of pay for waterside workers and other progressively increasing costs which I detailed earlier in my speech make it necessary for changes to be made in the charge rates. Debate (on motion by Mr Charles Jones) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time. Second Reading Labour and National Service) (5.37)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Basically this is a machinery Bill that stems from the changes in the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill. I have already referred, in my earlier speech, to the principal changes made by this Bill. Having outlined the reasons for these measures relating to the stevedoring industry charge it is appropriate for me to touch briefly on some aspects of the stevedoring industry. In the course of these second reading speeches I have given details of the considerable increases in wages and conditions which have been awarded to waterside workers. The most recent major concessions were made in May 197(5 when the parties were before Mr Justice Moore. As part of that consent 2-year award both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation gave a written undertaking there would be no stoppages of work in respect of those matters which were the subject of that agreement. In relation to other conditions of employment not covered by the agreement reached before Mr Justice Moore the Waterside Workers Federation gave an undertaking that it would progress all claims with the employers through established procedures and take all reasonable steps to ensure that work continued normally while these negotiations were in progress. It is common knowledge that since then some members and branches of the Federation have embarked on stoppages ranging from 1 hour to a full day on issues covered by these undertakings. I am informed that the ACTU and the federal officers of the Federation have done their utmost to ensure that the undertakings which they gave in the proceedings before Mr Justice Moore were honoured. I want to make 2 points perfectly clear. Firstly, tbe Government expects the undertakings to be honoured. Secondly, the Government will be giving close attention to the performance of the Federation, its branches and its membership recognising they are one of the principal parties to the agreement. The parties to the National Conference Agreement can scarcely be expected to endorse a new agreement in 1972 unless branches of the Federation and their members can establish their bona fides in respect of the unexpired terms of the current agreement. It is to be regretted that the Federation in some branches has also become the vehicle, along with certain other maritime unions, whereby minority elements within the trade union movement have sought to convert industrial power into political action. In many instances strike action has been taken on a unilateral basis without the sanction of the ACTU or the Trades and Labour Councils. The performance of employers in the industry is not above criticism. In some instances unilateral concessions by individual employers have led to industrial stoppages when the Federation has sought to extend the gains made. In addition many employers have found it difficult to make the transition from the pre-1967 casual system to permanent employment. In the Government's view the employers now have had sufficient opportunity to be able to take fully on themselves all the responsibility of the weekly hire system to which they are parties. The Government will be giving careful attention to the manner in which the employers at all levels administer these responsibilities. On the credit side it is fair to say that the technological changes which have occurred in the stevedoring and shipping industries since 1967 have been achieved with the co-operation of the Waterside Workers' Federation. This is in clear contrast to the experience of certain overseas countries where the stevedoring employees strongly resisted the introduction of new techniques. In Australia most of the disputation which has occurred has resulted from action by ancillary labour other than the waterside workers in these new areas. I stress that the Government views with serious concern the degree of industrial dislocation on the waterfront. The extent of this dislocation is clearly evident in the number of man-hours lost through strikes, which in 1969-70 were 1,072,592 representing 3.8 per cent of the total man-hours",72,Alice Springs
86,Mr Lynch (Flinders,"Minister forworked. This was the highest number of man-hours lost since 1964-65. The National Conference Agreement and enabling legislation both come up for review before the end of June 1972. The Government will be carrying out an intensive review of the permanent employment arrangements and the particular matters to which I have drawn attention. Its judgment on how the scheme has operated and what action should be taken for the future will be influenced by the performance of fhe parties. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Charles Jones) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.44 to 8 p.m. Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 April (vide page 1890), on motion by Mr Anthony: That the Bin be now read a second time. The Opposition supports this Bill which, as the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr 30th June or any other month, Australia's Anthony) pointed out in his second reading speech, proposes one simple, though vital amendment, to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act 1956-70, namely, that the maximum contingent liability which the Corporation may accept under contracts of export payments insurance and under guarantees be increased from $300m to $500m. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation is a highly successful enterprise and a very useful undertaking, having been established in .1956. The amendment in this Bill is the fourth or fifth of a substantial holdings and assets in Australia. series of amendments, the purpose of which has been to increase the scope within which this organisation may operate. We on this side have always supported the Corporation and have suggested that it ought to have been given a wider ambit to enable it to handle other sorts of insurance. appears to be the isolated asset of foreign If EPIC, as it is known, had been given a wider scope this would have strengthened its reserves and would have enabled it to carry out its important task much more strongly than it does now. The main purpose of EPIC is to assist Australia's export industries. I want to quote a statement contained in the 14th annual report of EPIC for the year 1969-70. It reads: Epic's function is to encourage and expand trade with countries outside Australia by providing a specialised range of insurance and guarantee facilities not normally obtainable from commercial insurers. In performance of this function the Corporation Is required to pursue a policy directed towards securing revenue sufficient to meet all its expenditure properly chargeable to Tevenue. At least the organisation has been successful, except in its earlier years. On the financial side it has continued to make a profit each year and also to expand the volume of business that it transacts. As we all know, Australia's future will depend to a large degree on the expansion of its export trade because it is primarily what is earned in export that conditions what we are able to import. Unfortunately Australia is still in the overall position that on an annual basis, taking into account all transactions-exports , imports, invisibles and so on-that if it were not for a capital inflow which over the last 10 years has aggregated nearly $ 1,000m for each of those 10 years, this country's balance of payments would be in an unfortunate situation indeed. We congratulate ourselves from time to time that at a certain point in the year, be it the reserves are said to be $ 1,500m, $ 1,600m or $ 1,700m including the amounts that we have with organisations such as the World Bank. What that figure of reserves does not show when you look at it on the basis of a balance sheet analysis, is that we owe considerable sums of money overseas on Government account. There are 2 large economic powers-the United Kingdom and the United States of America-whic h have I think at present the combined equity of American and United Kingdom undertakings in Australia is somewhere in excess of $8,000m. When one adds to that Government indebtedness of somewhere in the region of $3,000m or $4,000m, then what exchange holdings is very small indeed. Australia is one of the countries that, relative to its gross national product, taking exports or imports as indicators of our gross national product, which is running at about $30,000m, has an export trade somewhere of the magnitude of $4,000m",76,Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill 1971
87,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) (8.0),"which is about 15 per cent or 16 per cent of the gross national product. That is a very high proportion of our total economic activity which is dependent on overseas trade. As I have indicated, Australia imports more in aggregate than it exports. The purpose of EPIC is to assist exporters in Australia who have to sell on a long term rather than a short term basis. If one looks at the way in which world trade is expanding, particularly the trade from what I call the advanced countries to the less advanced countries, or from the developed countries to the underdeveloped countries, one will see lhat it is in fields such as capital goods that there has been the greatest upsurge in activity. Also when one looks at the path of Australia's export trade that is assisted in this wayI have indicated that our exports are somewhere in the region of $4,000m annually-the path that is covered by export payments insurance is somewhere in excess of $300m which is about 10 per cent of our annual export trade. A comparison of this with the United Kingdom will show that the volume of transactions carried by this sort of organisation and by banking assistance is about one-third of the United Kingdom's export trade. Australia at least has a long way to go as far as this kind of transaction is concerned relative to our total trade. I think this points up significantly the directions in which we have to continue to move in the areas ahead. It is a welcome move that the contingent liability is to be increased from $300m to $500m. I hope that it will not be very long before the Government seeks the sanction of this House to raise tbatfigureto $ 1,000m which will still not be a very large part of our annual overseas transactions. I think it ought to be recognisedI am sure it is recognised but perhaps without acknowledging the implications-that Australia lives in a part of the world where economic events are in a state of flux. We are inclined sometimes to think that we are still an outpost of Europe and that our traditional trading lines are with the United Kingdom and subsequently with the United States, when really our future lies in the expansion of trade in places such as Indonesia, South East Asia, the Philippines, India and other countries in that part of the world. It is perhaps significant that this week we are being visited by an important delegation from Japan. I want to quote one or two observations that were made in a fairly recent issue of the 'Economist' which is not a newspaper given to a wild kind of extravagant political statement. It is if anything a conservative journal. Only a few months ago in the issue of 21st November in the section titled 'Business Brief there is a heading which reads: The oriental economic imperialist is Japan. The article begins: The Japanese economy is twice the size of all the other economies of Pacific Asia together, including Australia and New Zealand. Projections by the Japan Economic Research Centre suggest that the outflow of long term capital from Japan in 1975 that is 4 years from nowcould be anything from $2,500m to 3 times that figure, as compared with $668m in 1969 Of course, whilst the Japanese economy is twice the size of all the other economies of the Pacific area, including those of Australia and New Zealand, one needs to bear in mind that per capita the Japanese standard is still not as high as that of either New Zealand or Australia. As the population of Japan exceeds 100 million people, that is, 8 times the population of Australia, and its gross national product, is $US200 billion compared with Australia's $US33.5 billion, or 6 times greater, we are beginning to get near the point where Japan's per capita standard is almost 'hat of Australia's. But as we all know Japan has a much better record than we do in what is called productivity and it has a much better record in the expansion of overseas trade. The article goes on to state that because of the situation in which Japan, a small country with a large population, finds itself, it is dependent upon the rest of the world for supplies of raw materials. Tbe article continues: This is why the Japanese have roamed the world in search of raw materials; the quest has led them to Australia (coal, iron ore, bauxite), to possible oil fields everywhere, and all over Latin America. Of course, we all know the significance of Japan now as far as the iron ore industry is concerned, but at the same time Japan is much more systematic in the expansion of overseas trade than is Australia. When we debated another aspect of this measure some 12 months or 2 years ago I mentioned that one of the reasons Japan is so successful is that there are closer relationships between Japanese industry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry than there are between Australia and its potential exporters. I believe that in the years ahead unless Australia becomes as systematic in the pursuit of export trade as Japan has been-and I believe we can be just as successful as they are if we go about it as systematically as they do-bu t unless we do we will be left behind in the race for economic development in this part of the world. In many respects Australia is uniquely situated because of its historical traditions and because it was left with an advanced flexible arrangements and recognise that the kind of economy-althoug h in terms of keen competition will be not so much in its population of 12.5 million it is still respect of the sale of such products as nowhere near as great as potentially it wheat-as in the credit terms that are can be-bu t its future lies in greater available for sales of capital goods, particudiversification of its export sales. We have larly machinery and manufactured items on traditionally relied upon primary products. which the credit terms may have to go up The latest annual report of the Export to Payments Insurance Corporation states: As the following table shows, manufactured about this sort of thing goods for the first time, constituted more than contained in the report, one is surprised to half of all insured business (55 per cent). Steel and aluminium exports to a value of see that relatively few individual people take $50.3m were covered compared with $22.2m in advantage of this kind of insurance. Neverthe previous year.

The transGreasy wool recorded a reduction of $4m and actions with a face value between $400,000 processed wool $8m due, it is believed, to a and $2m numbered 143 and accounted for fall in prices rather than in quantity. Nevertheless, the point is that it is still of the transactions.

This primary products rather than manufactured sort of insurance is relatively big business products. I believe it is this field of manubut it is availed of by comparatively few factured and capital goods that Australia's people. Nevertheless, it is highly significant economic health lies in the future. One of in the development of Australia's export the rather intriguing explanations of this trade. occurred in the Minister's speech when he said: The principal factor in this unexpectedly rapid is no great incentive on the part of the build-up in contingent liabilitythat is why we are seeking these amendfield of primary industry-to sell his promentsis the insurance of wheat export transactions. I directed a question upon it to him at the time. A rather odd little comment was made about this kind of thing in the latest annual report of EPIC. Surely it is strange that wheat which is supposed to be consumed, say, in the same year as it is purchased should have to be sold on long term credit at all. In fact that sort of trade runs contrary to the assumptions of what is called the Berne Union. Another article in the report states: There is increasing evidence of departures from the conventional maximum of 180 days credit for raw materials and consumer goods. Regrettable as this trend may be, the Corporation sees its duty to recognise changes in payment patterns occurring in international trade so that Australian exporters do not suffer any competitive disadvantages on this score. I would hope that they will make more the maximum period of 5 years. If one reads the statistics which are have been issued. There is a table on page the whole of the financial year 1969-70, 801 more than one-third of the total face value I think that one of the difficulties in the structure of Australian industry is that there individual producerI am leaving aside the ducts overseas rather than internally. Yet in the long run this is where the great opportunities for diversity, both internally and externally, of the Australian economy lie. How are we to promote the kind of national sentiment which says that we ought to export rather than to look only to the home market? This gets down to the fundamental questions of the structure of Australian industry, of the control of Australian industry, and of certain mechanisms which regulate the internal activity of industry in Australia. On the last occasion when we were dealing with similar legislation I said that we ought to be looking at what was done by Canada some years ago. I quoted from a document entitled 'Bank of MontrealBusiness Review' of 27th June 1969. I pointed out that in Canada it had been decided to replace what was called the Export Credits Insurance CorporationECIC-by a new organisation called the Export Development Corporation-EDC . That Corporation has been given a far wider scope and flexibility to enable it to respond effectively to the changing needs of exporters. I suggest that this is the kind of change that is needed in Australia in relation to EPIC. The EPIC needs not only greater contingent liability backing but also a wider franchise so that somebody in Australia, other than the voluntary bodies which are called export promotion councils and so on, is charged with the responsibility of seeing that there are considerable increases in our export trade in order to build the future economic destiny of Australia. I think that is highly significant. 1 again comtheless, there should be better drive and mend this suggestion to the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Anthony) or to his representative in the chamber this evening. Nobody denies the highly significant importance of expanding Australia's trade in future years and of relying not only upon primary products, and now minerals, but also upon the more sophisticated levels of manufacturing industry in Australia to ensure that activity is conditioned to the needs of the developing parts of the world. Later on this evening we will debate the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. If Australia gave the same attention to the development of the undeveloped areas as it gives to its own internal defence arrangements, I think that as a country we would be a much safer place. We should try to build better bridges and to establish better economic relations with out near neighbours, with Indonesia in particular, rather than stand awestruck, looking at the remarkable economic improvements in Japan. We should orientate our own economy to the sort of drive that is evident in Japan. Our survival in this part of the world and our attempt to make this part of the world a better and safer place are contingent upon the expansion of exports from Australia infieldsother than the primary industry and mineral fields. If we were to do this we would hardly recognise the face of the Australian economy by 1980. 1 think that one of the great tragedies in Australia is that we are in a state of economic drift. We are not facing up to the fundamental and overall economic disabilities in the Australian economy. We simply hope that something will turn upthat the price of wool will rise or that somebody of whom we never thought when we produced the wheat will buy wheat from us. We no longer get that kind of easy solution to the problems of economic growth and expansion. Again1 commend the systematic approach which the Japanese have adopted in this matter, and I would hope that gentlemen who visit JapanI understand that the Australian Deputy Prime Minister will visit Japan within the next week or so-wil l give greater consideration to the co-ordination that apparently exists in Japan due to the work of its Ministry of International Trade and Industry-MITI . I am afraid that we have not got in Australia the equivalent of MITI but, neverbetter cohesion between industry and our export representatives. I hope that greater attention will be given to this question in Australia in the years ahead. Opposition does not oppose the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has said. It is a reasonably simple piece of legislation. It is designed to increase the contingent liability of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation from $300m to $500m. That is the total amount for which the Corporation could become liable under its policies. The Australian Labor Party has been pleased with the performance of the Corporation since its inception in 1956 and the commencement of its operation in 1957, and it",77,Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1971
88,Mr Keating (Blaxland) (8.28),"Th ehas consistently supported legislation designed to increase the contingent liability of the Corporation. EPIC, as the Corporation is known, is charged to be self-supporting, that is, that over a period it has to operate at neither a profit nor a loss. Over the 14 years ending in June 1970, EPIC incurred operational deficits in 8 years and surpluses in 6 years. It operates on principles similar to those of any other form of insurance, inasmuch as in return for the payment of a premium an exporter can claim on EPIC in the event of non-payment by his buyer for any of the reasons set out in the policy. In the financial year 1969-70-that is incorporate that document in Hansard. It 12 to 13 years since its inception-EPI C reads: Year ending 30 June $m 1958 1959 1960 1961 127 199 52.8 52.2 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 I thank the House for its courtesy. While I have this table before me, I wish to point out one aspect that is revealed in the figures. The operating costs in relation to the premium income of the Corporation seem to be excessively high. I do not know whether that is because EPIC provides other services. It does provide a credit service so that any Australian exporter can check the credit rating of any overseas firm that he has dealings with. I note from the table that from 1961 to 1962 the operating costs of EPIC were 87 per cent and 86 per cent of income from premiums. This figure has declined and settled at between 58 per cent and 60 per cent. That 58 per cent to 60 per cent of the income from premiums has insured exports worth $343m. In the 13 years since it started, EPIC has insured policies to the tune of $l,407m. In the 10 years from 1960 to 1970 the number of policies with EPIC has grown from 127, with a face value of $53m, to 809, with a face value of $343m. I have prepared a table which summarises a number of EPIC annual reports and lists the number of policy holders from the year 1958 to 1970, the face value of the policies, the actual maximum contingency liability, the premium income, the gross claims paid, the operating costs and the operating costs as a percentage of premium income.

Over the period of operation-no w 14 years, I think-EPI C has built up reserves of $2.25m. A number of amendments to the original Bill, passed in 1956, have been made. The first amendment in 1964 was to establish a situation in which an exporter could take out a guarantee on a risk that banks in Australia would accept as security. This covered not just normal commercial or political risks but any type of risk at all. Another amendment was enacted in 1965. This related to investment insurance which was to cover other than non-commercial risks in respect of investment overseas by an Australian company. The aim of this amendment was to bring export benefits to Australia through investment overseas by Australian companies either by themselves or in a participatory role with another overseas concern. EPIC provided cover so that the Australian company would not lose its investment should the political climate change with the result that the company would suffer a loss through political circumstances. Various other amendments have been made. Most of these have been for the purpose of increasing the contingent liability ceiling. This is what the Bill now before the House seeks to do. This ceiling was increased in 1956 to $50m. In 1959 it was increased to $100m. The ceiling was raised to SI50m in 1964. In 1965 it rose to $200m. It was increased to $300m in 1970 and now stands at $500m in 1971. As I said before the Opposition always has supported all of these changes. I wish to touch on another point in relation to the provisions of this Bill. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Anthony) said: The principal factor in this unexpectedly rapid build-up in contingent liability is the insurance of wheat export transactions. This business is entirely new-it dates only from January of this year-and the amount of contingent liability involved is very high. There is a certain amount of ambiguity about what that means. It is not very clear what the Minister is saying. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked the Minister whether he would clear the matter up. I would like to quote from the statement that the Minister released on this aspect. It refers to the question asked of him by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and then states: Prior to January this year, EPIC had been asked to insure only relatively minor quantities of wheat exports. However because of increasing international competition, in particular on credit terms, Australian wheat has had to be offered on terms to meet this competition. Consequently, there has been a recent substantial growth in EPIC coverage of wheat transactions. He goes on to say: The aggregate amount of the Corporation's contingent liability on wheat export transactions either insured or the subject of firm offers of insurance cover since January1 1971 is $30.2m. The point that I wish to make is this: Since August of last year, a number of contracts have been entered into for the sale of wheat to the United Arab Republic. I believe from this statement that the $30.2m covers wheat sales proposed by the Australian Wheat Board under contract to the United Arab Republic. In August 1970, the Australian Wheat Board announced the signing of a contract for 36.7 million bushels of Australian wheat to be supplied per annum over a 3-year period commencing 1st July 1971. In other words, approximately 110 million bushels of wheat will be supplied in 3 years. A question was asked in August of last year of the then Minister for Primary Industry, who is now the Deputy Prime Minister, in relation to the conditions of sale of wheat to the United Arab Republic. The Minister replied that the terms of the sale were a deposit of 10 per cent at the time of shipment with the balance to be paid in equal yearly instalments over a 3-year period. No specific reference was made to the interest rate involved. Since then, an additional sale of 18.4 million bushels of wheat has been made to the UAR. This was for shipment from September 1970 to January 1971. Another additional sale of 9.2 million bushels of wheat to the UAR was made entailing shipment from September 1970 to January 1971. I presume that these 2 operations were extended on credit. I further presume from the answer given by the then Minister that no interest payment was incurred. WhatI would like to know is this: Why was this particular transaction not insured with EPIC? This contract is, I remind the House, to operate over a 3-year period. I would also point out to the House that the Deputy Prime Minister has made a statement concerning wheat sales to Communist China. We have heard from Communist China-o r Red China or continental China it-that it proposes not to buy any more Australian wheat. Could it be that the Australian Wheat Board is extending itself to sell Australian wheat to lower the quotas for the benefit of the Australian wheat grower and to satisfy its own problems? I think that the after-season carry over of wheat stocks last year was 265 million bushels. What seems to be happening with this legislation is that the Australian Wheat Board has gone to EPIC and has asked it to cover it for $30 million obviously extended on credit terms extending over 3 years.",80,Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1971
89,As The Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) Calls,"Now, what is the present situation of the UAR in the Middle East? General Moshe Dayan, the Israeli Defence Minister, said yesterday that there could easily be a resumption of war. The chances of Australia receiving payment under such conditions are very diminished. I understand further that a contract was not exactly entered into, only a memorandum of understanding was signed. What this means is that for a nominal premium payment the Exports Payment Insurance Corporation could be up for this $30m-and , in turn, the taxpayers purse through the Commonwealth could be up for this $30m-becaus e this Bill has been introduced to increase the contingent liability. This is the first wheat sale to be covered by EPIC. I understand that rather than extending a 95 per cent cover EPIC has extended a cover of 60 per cent only. This is a cover amounting to approximately $20m. EPIC has left the liability for the remaining 40 per cent to the Australian wheat grower. In the financial year ended June 1969, the total amount received in premium payments by EPIC was $860,000. Comparing the total annual premiums of $860,000 and the reserves of $2.25m with a possible contingent liability of $18m to $20m, we see that the Corporation will be placed in a very uncomforable financial position, should the United Arab Republic find itself in a situation where it is forced to renege and deal now more in a general sense with on the extended terms of credit, covering the Export Payments Insurance Corporathe sale of this wheat. This morning, I asked a question of the duced in this Parliament last year to inMinister for Primary Industry( Mr crease a contingent liability the then Deputy Sinclair) concerning this subject. He said in Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and reply: . . . the terms and conditions are such as to ensure that over the whole of the context of its in his second reading speech. I would like operations EPIC is able to maintain the very to read it to the House because it is quite remarkable record of profitability which it has an eye-opener. He said: achieved since its establishment a few years ago. The Minister went on to say: I am quite sure that if it were not for the EPIC cover in this instance, it would not have been possible perhaps for the Wheat Board to have accepted the general responsibility of the terms and conditions available. That answer pretty well bears out what I have said. The Australian Wheat Board He went on to say: was not prepared to 'cop* the responsibility for this sale itself, and has loaded it on to singular unanimity by the opponents of the the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. By paying a fiddling premium it can say with safety: 'If anything goes wrong, EPIC or the Commonwealth must carry the baby'. So, this Bill is before the House tonight and we are expected to 'up the ante' with respect to the contingent liability of this corporation. The Minister also said in his second reading speech that there were a number of other aspects and a number of other transactions which forced a situation where the contingent liabilities should be increased. The Opposition accepts that and that is why it supports the legislation. I consider the aspects of wheat sales is a valid one because of the situation in the Middle East and the fact that the Country Party has been caught on the hook with China and has to carry over 260 million bushels of wheat from last year. It has problems with its seats in wheat growing areas. If it goes to the people within the next 12 months it could lose seats like Gwydir and other marginal Country Party seats. The Government has to get the wheat off its hands; it wants to sell it to the United Arab Republic. It does not really trust the UAR. It says: 'Give us an Export Payments Insurance Corporation policy and we will let the Commonwealth cany the baby.' This seems to me to be a pretty feasible summation of the situation and this is the way the Parliament should view it. I leave the subject of wheat on that point tion. When similar legislation was introIndustry, Sir John McEwen, who introduced the original Bill in 1956, was quite frank The birth of EPIC was delayed many yearsat least 4-by the barrage of criticism and opposition raised against it from inside and outside government. Interests representing private institutions such as banks, insurance companies, associations and elements even within the governmental structure, attacked, criticised and blocked the provision of this new facility by a government corporation for at least 4 years. I was told with monotonous regularity and with facility that there was no need for it-worthwhil e and soundly based Australian exports should need no assistance of the type other countries had; it would merely provide at government expense a hidden subsidy to prop up 'lame duck' export ventures; it could not possibly work-the premiums would be too high, the losses too great, and exporters would prefer to take their own risk; it was a duplication of existing banking and insurance .facilities which were willing and able to afford all the assistance needed; such a corporation was a Socialist conception and an unwarranted intrusion by government into private business; such a corporation would provide unfair competition to private enterprise institutions, and so on. What Sir John McEwen was saying was Government not give exporters in this that the opposition to this legislation came country some assistance by allowing the from sections of the Liberal Party, his Corporation to move into marine insurance. partner in the coalition, and other people With the reduction in premiums that the within the business world of Australia.

In reply to a question referred to by the honourable member for asked by Senator Mulvihill some years ago, Melbourne Ports. What Australia needs is the Minister in the Senate representing the a complete export development corporation Minister for Trade and Industry gave a which covers 3 things. They are the figure of $26.5m as the total marine aspects covered by the Export Payments insurance premium for the year 1966-67. Insurance Corporation, marine insurance The Export Payments Insurance Corporaand an export credit facility, which is tion's premiums amount to only $860,000. something that is very sadly lacking. I would not mind seeing the Corporation Last year in the HouseI asked the get a slice of the $26.5m marine insurance then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister cake when we consider that most of the for Trade and Industry this question: companies operating in marine insurance in Australia are British or companies from facility other overseas countries. It is not just a matter of getting business for Australia. It means also that very considerable savings will be effected in our balance of payments through reduced remittance of profits overseas. I would like to see the Corporation get into this business. When we look at the type of insurance that the Corporation was to take on, and I will cover the categories basically, we find that they included buyer risks of insolvency, protracted default in repayment, repudiation of contracts, political risks such as import licensing restrictions, exchange transfer blockages, wars and revolutions and catastrophic risks caused by external events beyond the control of both exporter and buyer which are not normally insured by commercial insurers. No commercial insurance company in Australia would have taken on insurance with those risks. Such companies had a dog in the manger attitude. They were not prepared to accept those forms of insurance themselves yet they did not want the Government to set up an organisation that would, because they feared it would eventually get into other fields of insurance like marine insurance. If the Export Payments Insurance Corporation has to carry the baby with this unpalatable type of insurance why does the In the few minutes I have left 1 would like to touch briefly upon the subject Will the Government set up an export credit to provide finance at better than commercial terms to assist the export sales of Australian manufactured military equipment and other high value commercial exports. He replied: It is true that lower interest rates are provided by the governments of some countries that are competitive with us. It is quite clear that certain governments from time to time seek to give their exporters a competitive advantage by providing funds at lower interest rates. I have never felt that this Government could engage in an interest rate war in these circumstances. In other words, he was saying that we are denying our exporters cheap rates of interest and extended terms of credit when they have to go into other markets and compete not with their products but with the terms of credit that they can offer.",82,Business Corporation S Account
90,Mr Kennedy,"What was his reason?obviously because his attitude is indefensible. We see a typical thing occurring with the possible sale of Macchi aircraft to New Zealand and Singapore. The Australian aircraft industry here tried to sell the Macchi aircraft and faced competition from Britain and Germany, both of which offered their aircraft with the backing of export credit banks. What chance do our exporters have in offering products to countries overseas when we are offering credit terms at normal bank overdraft rates of 71 per cent interest, 50 per cent down payment and 2 or 3 years repayments. No-one in the world would come at those terms. It is time we developed an export development corporation to cover the things normally covered by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, also a marine insurance facility and also to supply credit at extended terms and at reasonable rates of interest-4 1 per cent to 5 per cent. Unless we do that we have no chance of developing our exports and we can forget about developing secondary manufactures. Unless we offer extended terms of credit as decent interest rates we cannot sell products overseas. To summarise, the Opposition supports the legislation for the reasons I have outlined. Order!

That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'whilst welcoming the advances provided in the Bill, this House is of opinion that the Commonwealth should establish an appropriate instrumentality to bring about co-operation and co-ordination with the States and local authorities to: (a) ensure that planning authorities are established or developed, (b) ensure that all lands vested in the States or Commonwealth will be retained and that private rights to such land is limited to leasehold, (c) identify a number of appropriate sites for new cities and co-operate in their development, (d) assist in slum prevention and renewal and (e) assist appropriate bodies to carry out comprehensive urban improvement and development.' In moving the amendment I desire to set out the details of what a Labor administration would do. For too long housing, urban living and the environment have been at the very bottom of the priorities list of successive anti-Labor governments over the last 2 decades. The Opposition wants a new deal for housing, particularly for young married couples and for very old people. It wants a better deal for the onment and the right to participate in the arts, the theatre, culture, social and recreational activities. Equally they should have the right to develop, enjoy and contribute to a full life and not just exist from one day to the next. On 29th September last the former Minister for Housing, Dame ernment, said: One of the major aims of our housing contribution in the next 3 years will be to encourage the States to provide decent housing for lower income families who are unable to obtain satisfactory private accommodation. Let us examine the Government's record over the last 2 decades and then let us deal with the prospects of the former Minister's prediction being carried out in the future.

That is a shameful record. Yet a spokesman for the Government has said that its major aim was to build low cost housing for persons on low incomes. I say to the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns): We want more than words and platitudes. We want action. It is about time the Government did something for the people on low incomes who need homes. According to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the cost of a three bedroom flat from the Victorian Housing Commission is $22 a week. The figures in the table which I have incorporated reveal that the proportion of homes constructed by State housing authorities to all homes constructed in Australia dropped from 22 per cent in 1955 to less than 10 per cent in 1970. I believe that the position will worsen because of the credit restrictions announced by the Government in its direction to the Reserve Bank in April 1970. Interest rates on loans to the State Housing Commissions have increased from 5 per cent to 6 per cent. This means that the position for the year beginning in July 1970 will be worse than it was for the year ended in June 1970 when State housing construction had dropped to 9.8 per cent of all constructions, one of the lowest ebbs in the last 2 decades during which this Government has been in power. Last November all the State Housing Ministers met in Melbourne and made a unanimous request that the interest rates for the construction of low cost housing constructed by the State housing authorities be reduced from 6 per cent to 4 per cent. Let me remind the Minister for Housing that at that time-thi s was prior to the recent elections in Western Australia5 out of 6 State Ministries were anti-Labor Governments. All6 Ministers were requesting that the interest rates be reduced from 6 per cent to 4 per cent. This is only one of the reasons why this legislation is inadequate. The prevailing interest rate of 6 per cent on moneys made available to the States is excessive. People cannot meet this commitment. It is almost a usurious interest rate for what the Government calls 'low cost housing'. It is about time we got back to the Chifley formula. In 1945 under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement interest rates were 3 per cent. In the year 1969-70, 47 per cent, or $355m, of the moneys lent by the States for works and housing came from Commonwealth revenue. It did not come from loan moneys but from Commonwealth revenue, which is provided by the taxpayers. They were the people who made the money available. Yet the Commonwealth in providing this money to the States charged the highest interest in the history of the Commonwealth. It charged an interest rate of 6 per cent although 47 per cent of the money made available was from Commonwealth revenue. Government supporters talk about their housing policy. A major priority for the Government in the next 3 years should be the provision of low cost housing. The record of the Government is a disgraceful one. It is the record of a sectional governcome down on us, but he knew that the ment. It is the record of a government that represents only the wealthy sector. It represents only the monopolies, oligopolies, companies and those who have great personal wealth. It has very little understandis still in that dilemma. Although he has ing of the problems of those people who really need housing. This year is the year for a new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Let us return to the Chifley formula. Let us reduce the interest rate to not more than 3 per cent. Let us be firm that no wage earner will have to pay more than one-fifth of his income in rent if he wants to rent a home from a housing commission. The rent for housing commission homes today is ludicrous. The Brotherhood of St Laurence did some' research into rents and found that a person who wanted a housing commission flat in Melbourne would have to pay $22 a week. If we apply the Chifley formula, which provided that a person should not have to pay more than one-fifth of his weekly income in rent, people renting a flat at $22 a week would have to have a weekly income of $110. Average weekly earnings today are only $84, and it is interesting to note that 70 per cent of all wage earners earn less than $84 a week. Does this example not clearly expose this sectional Government that occupies the treasury bench in Canberra? Housing reform is long overdue. We have a new Minister for Housing, but we need more than a new broom; we need revolutionary ideas and action. We need some action to move the Treasury. I know that the conservative elements on the Government side, particularly the new prophet from Queensland, the new Minister for Housing, will say that the Government is to have a new policy and will do revolutionary things for the people. Have we not heard this story before? Have we not heard the story of that great radical man of the right who formerly sat on the back bench-the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth)? When he became the Minister for Social Services he was in a dilemma. He did not know whether the Government should cut down defence expenditure so that he could extend his expenditure on social services and Aboriginal affairs. He was caught. He is one who looks for a Com under his bed every night. He was fearful that the Red hordes would Government would have to cut down on defence expenditure if he was to get more money for social services and Aboriginal affairs. He found himself in a dilemma. He brought new thought to his portfolio the age pensioners and people on social services have regressed under his administration. The same can be said of the Minister for Housing. He was a man who worried about red hordes coming down from the north and was an advocate for greatly increased defence expenditure. Where in the heavens is he to get money for housing? He has to make up his mind. As I said from the word go, the whole question is a matter of priorities. The Labor Party has at the top of its priorities the interests Stretton states: of the people and the cities where the mass of the Australian people live. In housing matters we are dealing with old and young people and family people. They are at the top of our priorities. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know this hurts you as a member of the Country Party, but we are members of the city. We belong to the great metropolises where over 80 per cent of the people of this great Commonwealth live. As spokesman for the Opposition on urban affairs and housing, 1 have respect for the people of the country. But I want a fair deal for the people of the city. Let this new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement embody some of the principles set out in the amendment we have put forward. Let us not build boxes for people to live in. Let us not construct houses of the type that are being constructed in the ghettos of Mount Druitt and Green Valley or in the concrete jungles of North Melbourne where people are being put in 20-storey sky scrapers where in fact they are mere prisoners. Let us stop building these ghettos. Let us stop cramming together people with homogeneous ecnomic and social outlooks and let us plan for the heterogeneous community. We want to see the best in people. We want people from all walks of life-workin g people, middle income wage earners and high income people-in the same communty adding strength to one another and drawing from each others resources and experiences. Not only would I like to see them heterogeneous in terms of income but I would like to see them heterogeneous in terms of colour, creed and race. I want to see us more outward looking than inward looking. Let me give an example of what 1 am talking about. I want to quote from an interesting book. In fact I think it is the best book that has been written on this subject. It is written by Mr Hugh Stretton and is entitled 'Ideas for Australian Cities'. The author gives details of living in Green Valley, which of course is a metropolis of some 30,000 people situated on the outskirts of the south western part of Sydney and 20 miles from the centre of Sydney. I might say that it is as hot as hell in the summertime and as cold as ice in the wintertime. On page 160 of his book Mr. . . nine-tenths of Green Valley's workers travel out of the district to work. There and back, three-quarters of them travel between 25 and SO miles a day. Half must change channels twice or more each way. For a quarter of them, travelling time adds the equivalent of 2 working days to the working week. The average is nearly 2 hours a day; with some misfitting between work and transport timetables, many families do without their breadwinners for 11 or 12 hours. Also the city's lowest wages pay some of its highest fares. Similar distances and (without weekly concession tickets) even higher fares separate them from most friends and relations they'd like to visit, and from the pleasures and services of the city centre which is more than an hour each way and more than a dollar return . . . To get a family of 6 from Green Valley to the beach or the zoo and back takes most of a day, including half a day's travel by car or perhaps 2 day's wages in fares and expenses . . . Hugh Stretton points out that 60 per cent of Green Valley's families have no car and 29 per cent are in the deserted wife category and do not earn wages. The out-patient departments of the public hospitals to which the people of this area go are not very easy to get to. In fact, Hugh Stretton at page 162 of his book states that there are no regular family doctors and some people cannot afford or cannot understand medical insurance. He goes on to say: So what happens when their babies get sick on winter nights? There may be no doctor on duty within miles, nobody has a telephone and the distant public one is as usual smashed unusable by vandals. That is the position of Green Valley; it is a position that we have to rectify. We have to rectify the position of the Green Valleys, the Mount Druitts and the concrete jungles of North Melbourne. Hugh Stretton in his book sets out the success stories that we should follow. One such example is that of the heterogeneous society of Canberra. We should be building a society such as this rather than the Green Valleys and Mount Druitts or the high riseflatsof North Melbourne. We have in Canberra a heterogeneous society blended of people from all fields of life. We have workers on low incomes, people on middle incomes and those on high incomes who blend and add to each other. This is the sort of society that I believe we should try to add strength to; this is the society we land that was sold at restricted auction in need; and these are the standards for which we should strive. I want the environment of a city Uke Canberra spread right across this continent. I want to see our communities have the serenity, tranquillity and beauty of the city of Canberra. I want everyone in the Commonwealth to have an equalrightto share in the better things of life. These are the issue to which a Labor administration will give major priorities. The Opposition's amendment sets out in broad principle what a Labor administration will do when it assumes office. We want people to participate in a developing life. We want people, as William Morris said, to be not only entitled to a better life but to be also able to enjoy life, to enjoy art, to enjoy culture and to enjoy a serenity and tranquility in life. We want everyone to be able to do this. Attention to this aspect is long overdue. This country has an abundance of wealth. However, our priorities are out of focus. What we have to do is to get our priorities hack into focus and make sure that we develop the nation in the interests of the people. Our amendment refers to the building of new cities. We say that we will identify a number of sites appropriate for new cities and co-operate in their development. We know that we have limited power in this field but we will work in co-operation with the States and co-ordinate the forces that are available to us. We want to build other Canberras. We want to make sure that land is available to young couples in other parts of Australia under the same conditions as it is available to young married couples in Canberra. Let me give an example of what is that people occupy land on leasehold. happening in Canberra. The National Capital Development Commission, to its great credit, from 1962-63 has been able have a system such as the one in Canberra, to reduce the price of land for unrestricted although this would not be the way in blocks. This means that people Uving in which we would implement the system. Canberra have an advantage over those However, even under the conditions on people living in the best residential areas in the capital cities in suburbs such as St Ives in Sydney. The average price paid at auction in Canberra for unrestricted land in 1962-63 was $4,500. By planning the Commission was able to reduce the price during a period of inflation to $3,000 in May 1970. This was revealed in the thirteenth annual report of the Commission. I asked the research section of the Parliamentary Library to examine the average price of Canberra in 1970. It was able to inform me that the land was made available at an average price of $900 a block. This means that people such as public servants in Canberra have the opportunity to buy a block of land for $900 at a restricted auction if they have not previously purchased a block of land in the Australian Capital Territory. Blocks in groups purchased in Canberra by firms such as Pettit and Sevitt and other developers which build large numbers of homes averaged $1,700 each in 1970. Let us compare tbe position in Canberra with that in the city of Sydney. The average price of a block of land in Sydney is between $8,000 and $9,000. I represent a working class area. In fact, in Guildford where I live a person would pay $7,500 to $8,000 for a block of land. We are asking tbe people of Australia to elect us to office and to give us the power to carry out our proposals. In co-operation and co-ordination with the States and local government authorities the Labor Party wiU purchase large tracts of land to build Canberras. We will make land available to young people more cheaply and on a more equitable basis than appUes under the present Government even in Canberra. We believe in the concept of leasehold land. This is the way in which land should be distributed. Also, we believe all people are entitled to share in unearned increment, as the area improves then all share in the increase in value. This is the basis on which we believe land should be allocated. We believe in the basis of using a realistic system of land value and rental which means The Labour Party beUeves that we should which Canberra's land system has been operated, I have shown the difference in the price of land in Canberra as compared with the price in other capital cities. If we are given tbe opportunity we will implement what I have set out. We will build many Canberras in this nation of ours. We will make land available to people, old and young alike, to make sure that they have a secure future. After all, every young family is entitled to a home without suffering economic hardship. Another aspect I want to deal with in regard to the amendment is the assistance to bodies to carry out comprehensive urban improvement and development. This is another vision of the Australian Labor Party. Excuse me if 1 am a little parochial on this question, but I come from Sydney. 1 live in Sydney and I think it is a beauticreated great land prices. What1 am sayful area. However, nearly 100 years ago Mr Neilsen, the first Minister for Lands in a Labor administration in New South Wales, proposed a green belt around Sydney harbour. It seems to me that an administration whether Labor or anti-Labor, in New South Wales could purchase land on the foreshores of Sydney harbour in your area, Mr Authority, but from the advent of the Speaker, and make it available for the use of all the people and not just a select few. We do not want to be ruthless about this. If people want to live in this area for the rest of their natural lives they may do so. But we want to return progressively the foreshores of Sydney harbour to the people of Australia. We want to do this sort of thing not only in Sydney, it should be manifold throughout the Commonwealth. This should be done in Melbourne, Brisbane, in the mountains or in the desert. We want to return and restore this Commonwealth progressively to the people of Australia. If we determine our priorities we can do these things. We achieve our aims if the people of Australia give us an opportunity to do so. For these reasons I propose this amendment to this negative legislation. seconded? Mr CopeI second the amendment and were entitled to anything that they could reserve my right to speak. tened to many stupid statements in this honourable members want to know about House but for arrant nonsense member for Bendigo, who is interjecting, is truths about it. grossly out of order. He will either be seated outside the chamber or will resume his seat within the chamber. of knowledge and for arrant nonsense I have never heard anything worse than the speech of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren). Unfortunately, for the Australian Labor Party its spokesman condemns the Party out of his own mouth because all the things of which he complained were initiated and developed by a Labor government in New South Wales. The entire situation about which the honourable member for Reid was speaking came about as a result of the advent of the Cumberland County Council. It initiated all the hocus pocus of zoning which ing is correct, but I want to make it perfectly clear that the executive officers of the Cumberland County Council were not corrupt. The corruption from above and below was so great that the Labor Government of New South Wales had to supersede the Council with a State Planning Cumberland County Council resulted all the high prices for land in New South Wales. In 1951 a fairly large block of land in North Parramatta could be purchased for £250-$50 0 nowadays. Even with increases in the basic wage it could now sell for about $2,000 to $2,500 but because of the advent of the Cumberland County Council with zoning and putting land under the counter and creating a black market, unfortunate Australians now have to pay from $6,000 to $8,000 for a block of land. That is Socialism and if anyone wants to know about it I am tbe man to see because I have lived with it and fought against it since 1951. Zoning is the trouble. People who knew what the Cumberland County Council was doing knew what areas were to be AIF who had lived in these areas for years get from the increased value of their land but the go-getters came in, bought the land socialisation and this planning they should",85,States Grants Housing Assistance Bill 1971

97,Mr Irwin,"As I was saying, for lackThe amendment which was moved on behalf of the Opposition seeks to ensure that planning authorities are established or developed. The great evil came in New South Wales when the enormous suburban sprawl was permitted and when sewerage, electricity and water services had to be extended 30 miles from the heart of Sydney. What should have been done-and I stated this in 1951-wa s to establish 3 new cities in New South Wales. Port Stephens has the greatest harbour in the world and the Port Stephens area should have been developed as a city. Two or 3 cities should have been established instead of this enormous suburban sprawl. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being expended to develop roads within 5 and 6 miles of Sydney, thus propping up the. enormous concrete jungle and denying the right of Australians to a decent and goodly way of life. The present situation was brought about by a Labor government in New South Wales and by no-one else. It created Green Valley to which the honourable member for Reid referred. Fortunately, with the experience of Green Valley, the Mount Druitt area is better set out and the homes are of better construction. The average age of people residing in that area, including the children, is only 8 years. I am proud of those young people and I deprecate the phrase which was used by the honourable member for Reid to describe the people living in Green Valley and Mount Druitt. They are good young people who will make good. The environment has been improved. The churches are doing a wonderful joba job that the New South Wales Labor Government should have done. That Government did not establish swimming pools or recreation halls. It provided the people with nice homes but it did not give them amenities. The churches came in, God bless them. These young married people could not afford 20c to put on the church plate but the Church of England-the wealthy parishes-helpe d and a fine edifice has been erected and the rector is doing a marvellous job in trying to alleviate the difficulties that confront these young people. Clarke land? The New South Wales Labor These difficulties would not be present if proper planning had taken place. Hundreds of thousands of blocks of land green belt. 1 understand that the considera4 and 5 miles closer to Sydney were availtion was $500,000. Work that out and, if able for development. Most of that land you can, deny the corruption and bribery was in areas the streets of which were connected with electricity and some had reticulated water available. But did the Labor Government develop that land? No. It had to acquire 5 and 10-acre farms from people who were happy and contented in supplying vegetables for the Sydney market. Instead of developing other areas that had been divided some 30 or 40 years ago the Mount Druitt area had the misfortune to be ready for development in about 1914 when war broke out. At a time when there was a hugeflowof migrants from England, the land was ready for development. After we got over the First World War we ran into the depression and then we had the Second World War. Large numbers of blocks of land still remain vacant but these farmlets have been taken over and all the work of putting in a reticulated water supply and other essential services has taken place at great expense. If we had been true to our trust we would have developed new cities. Surely there must be an economical city. What we have to boast about is that by the year 2000 Sydney will have 6 million or 7 million people. It is a crime and an utter disgrace that we are proud of such a thing when we could have given the people new cities with services radiating from the centre of the city. An economical city, I understand, contains about 2 million people. But we are building this huge concrete jungle and making the people travel, as the honourable member for Reid said, long distances to get to the city or to the seaside at a cost of something over $1. If there is to be any denunciation we should point the finger at the people who initiated thisthe Labor Party of New South Wales, and no-one else. The honourable member for Reid spoke about the green belt. The city of Sydney is bounded by the Pacific Ocean, the great Hawkesbury River and the Great Dividing Range. Thousands of acres of land were declared to be green belt land. I know all about green belt land. None of that land is left now. What about the Marcus Minister for Lands at the time said that the land would be there in perpetuity but within 12 months it was released from the that goes on. The people on their holdings do not know anything about these things but the other people know 2 years ahead what the zonings will be. The big people go out and buy up the land and they know that that it will be residential or industrial within about 2 years. But the ANZACs and those of the first Australian Imperial Forces, the old pioneers, never knew anything about this. I have written letters inquiring why land is declared residential or industrial at certain points. The purchasers do not go to the farmer who has a negative zoning. Instead they go to the people who have land in the green belt and buy it at a reduced price. If the honourable member for Reid wants the people of Australia to have a better way of life these are the sorts of things that he should tackle. He should nol come in here and cackle about things in which he is not well versed and in which he has had no experience. The second part of the amendment moved by the Opposition reads: (b) ensure that all lands vested in the States city of Paris proper and people travel or Commonwealth will be retained and that priby express underground railway from the vate rights to such land is limited to leasehold. new city. No Labor government could We in Australia have never wanted leasebe expected to have the foresight which has hold land. If honourable members were to been demonstrated in Paris. It is there see the homes which were built 80 or 90 to be seen by those who have eyes to see. years ago on leasehold land they would not have anything to do with it. We like to have our own land. We are entitled to our own fee simple. I trust that we always Everybody agrees with this objective but shall be. What incentive is there for a until we can catch up with our lack of person during the latter years of a leasehousing facilities it is much better to leave hold, unless it is in perpetuity which means this matter alone. Paddington was described almost the same as freehold, to worry as a slum at one time but because people about it? But who wants leasehold land? moved into the area with new ideas and I suggest that honourable members have a renovated the buildings, most people are now look at areas such as Glebe and Merevery honoured to live there. Some of the wether near Newcastle where land was great architects in the world have said that under leasehold. Nothing was done to the the small cottages and two-storey buildings cottages towards the end of the leasehold with brick walls are best suited for the period and slum areas were created. This climate in Australia. should not have occurred. I must say that I agree with the third that assistance should be given to appropart of the amendment which reads: (c) Identify a number of appropriate sites for urban improvement and development. Of new cities and co-operate in their development. course, no-one could have any grouch I think that is a wonderful idea. If the against that. We have endeavoured to New South Wales Labor Party, the New make life in urban areas worthwhile for South Wales State Planning Authority and our estimable young people who are now the Cumberland County Council had taken having their first children, and ws get notice of me in 1951 that position would great satisfaction in helping them. I am obtain today. I want to say in passing proud of the young people in the Mount that this is not a novel idea. In 1920 the Government of the day in New South WalesI do not know whether it was a Labor or a Liberal government-wen t into the matter of establishing a harbour at Port Stephens. That wor.dcrful harbour has been represented to me as the greatest natural habour in the world, much better than those in Sydney and San Francisco. If we had identified appropriate sites for new cities and radiated services into the hinterland the situation would have been much better than it is now. I agree with that part of the amendment but I think we have left it too late. Hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into propping up Sydney by the provision of fly-overs and extra laneways on roads which are now almost overcrowded. It has been just a waste of good money. To illustrate my point I refer to Paris. The old city of Paris has not been disturbed. A new city has been commenced some 25 kilometers from the old city. The new city is attached to the beautiful Part (d) of the amendment reads: Assist in slum prevention and renewal. The last part of the amendment states priate bodies to carry out comprehensive Druitt area for the cleanliness of their homes and the neatness of themselves and of their children. There things give us great hope. I trust that something can be done to alleviate the position so that they do not have to travel long distances to swimming pools or to the seaside. They are excellent people and I am sure that they will form a great community in that area. I support the Bill which is only a simple ing out of context with the other elements Bill to confirm the payment under the old agreement. There was no need for this amendment but, having been moved, 1 thought I should express my ideas and feelings in regard to them. If the honourable member for Reid wants to know anything about the construction and planning of new cities I will be pleased to assist him if he has any time available. honourable member for Mitchell( Mr pattern of tomorrow's communities. Irwin) unfortunately is discredited when he talks on this issue because it is well known that he talks out of his pocket, that he was a developer and the only reason he carried out this tirade of abuse against the State Planning Authority plan was because it cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. ably be in favour of town planning. member for Mitchell will withdraw that remark. truth. 1 withdraw tbe 'liar'. member will withdraw the remark. Mr IrwinI withdraw the remark. he is regarded as a joke because of his attitude member for Robertson knows full well that no honourable member can cast aspersions or imputations against the conduct or character of another honourable member. I suggest that he desist. draw any aspersions that have been cast upon the honourable member. But let me say that in my electorate of Robertson in the 2 years since I have been involved in politicking I have seen the price of land rise from $2,500 a block to $7,000, and this is in an area where people have come to get cheaper land. Today, 50 miles from Sydney, they are paying almost the same price as the average price in Sydney. But let me say that the essence of the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party is to highlight the complete lack of awareness of the Federal Government's approach to housing. To view the problem of housand ingredients that determine the quality of life and the quality of the environment is one of the great tragedies of the postwar period. Governments in Australia are, to a degree, still prisoners of their own and the community's lack of imagination and vision. What we ought to be examining are not houses, homes, fiats, home units, etc, but every facet, every ingredient and every influence that affect the total shape and As one drives through mile upon mile of the urban wasteland of today's metropolises one cannot but help being appalled by the incredible ugliness, monotony, loneliness and aimlessness of the monster that, through our lack of vision, our politicians and bureaucrats have created. We have created this monster of an urban sprawl. In recent years an ever growing number of concerned citizens have echoed their concern and lamented the lack of initiative by governments in their approach to this ever increasing and snowballing problem. We must make up our minds once and for all if we want to provide homes or create communities. If it is the former then we should proceed as we are now and continue to build mile upon mile of houses all built of ticky tacky with all the concomitant results. Social scientists throughout the world have studied the effect that these burgeoning metropolises have upon the unfortunate residents. Due to the size and sprawl there tends to be a lack of identification with the community within which they live. People become lost in the maze of suburbia. There is a sense of not belonging to anything, of not having an involvement with the community in which one lives, of not being aware of one's neighbours and of not even being familiar with or known to one's neighbours.

106,Mr Cohen,"Very well, I will withof the town; of belonging to that town. To be able to walk down the street and to recognise and be recognised by friends and associates gave one a sense of belonging, of being part of something and of being secure. People took and still do take pride in the achievements of their community simply because they can identify with that community. They belong to it and it belongs to them. This sort of identification is impossible in today's suburban sprawl. One house sits on top of another, one street runs into another and one suburb is indistinguishable from its neighbouring suburb. The next step is alienation from society itself. Loneliness, boredom, lack of identity, a feeling of insignificance and being a tiny fish in a massive pool leads to psychiatric disorders, juvenile delinquency, family disintegration and alcohol and drugs, and in some instances to crime. The present pattern of urban development is a perfect pattern for a total disintegration of our society. Perhaps these words are a little strong but I am sure that honourable members will agree that we are bent on creating a society that is only one-tenth of what it could be. WhatI hope to do this evening is to antagonism-betterr roads, new inventions, new relate 2 factors that determine the shape industries and better-paid jobs for thousands. and pattern of our towns and cities and to tbeIt towns attack the custom of treating these factors the country.

I do not wish to delve too deeply into the history of the interdependence of car transport and town and city development. tions of the economy are fashioned to its Most members will be aware that urban demands. growth of earlier periods developed primarily through the availability of different world's modes of transport.

Whilst this is still true to to ask if the car should not be replaced with a great degree, rail is not as major a deteranother form of personal transport. One that minant in our growth as it once was. It has does not make servants of its users. been succeeded -by the automobile. Since the war we have had a vast number of new suburbs appear even though they have practically no access to rail facilities. In fact, upward trends in car ownership have been paralleled by a sharp decline in the level of public transit patronage. The number of people using public tranmunities around fhe automobile instead of sport declines annually. The results are vice versa we are going .to perpetuate and 12669/71-R-[85 ] only too obvious. The commuter is subjected to the daily rush from the suburb to the city on crowded buses, choked streets and late trains. He is the victim of <polluted air, blighted street sides and the incredibly urban ugliness and chaos of an asphalt environment. In the words of Wilfred Owen: Expressways are disrupting neighbourhoods, displacing people and converting communities into garages. A nation intent on making it .easier to move has made it increasingly difficult to live. Grossly inadequate housing and poor transportation are closely inter-related problems. Each one helps to make the other worse. The poverty of close-in living conditions compels those who have automobiles to escape to the suburbs, creating massive traffic jams for commuters and making public transport increasingly inefficient. I want to quote from a recent editorial in the 'Daily Minor'. It was headlined 'Servant or master?' and it stated: In the beginning, hurtling over the countryside at four miles an hour, it was condemned and persecuted by the horse-loving gentry as an instrument of the devil. But the car brought advantages that softened brought rural communities within reach of and gave townspeople the freedom of That is no longer true. Yet the influence of the continues to grow. Town and city planners battle hopelessly to cope with its needs; huge secOne way and another, the car today is probably the world's biggest single employer. It is also the biggest single killer.

Perhaps they are a bit too strong, but nevertheless strong enough to make those of us who have the role of legislators take heed and listen to those who are pointing out to us our negligence, our apathy and our indifference. While we continue to plan our comaccentuate the present situation that I have described. Why must we design them as we have in the past? Are we so hidebound by our traditional clumsy and inefficient methods of town planning that we cannot break away? What happens now? Along comes a developer who buys SO acres of land and he divides it into a couple of hundred building blocks for which he must provide kerbing and guttering. Gradually, over a couple of years', a wide variety of houses, all with designs screaming at one another, are built. Probably the residents receive electricity; they may receive water, at some time in the future they will receive telephones; but they certainly will not have much likelihood of receiving sewerage. Then the Department of Education will build a school, probably 2 or 3 miles away, requiring buses to transport the children or, if their parents are a little more affluent, they may be driven by their parents in cars. Two miles away in another direction some other bright developer will decide: 'Here is a good focal point for a shopping centre', as another couple of developers are in the process of building more houses. Suddenly some industrialists realise that there is a labour force available, so they build a few factories a few miles further out, and eventually we have what passes for a suburb. This process continues in a leap-frogging movement, onwards, ever onwards. Father cannot get to work without a car; so mother has to have a car as well to take the children to school and to do the shopping because public transport is not available or efficient enough for convenience or comfort. So it goes on, with cars and buses tearing up and down the streets, highways and byways, maiming, murdering and polluting, when all of it could have been avoided if only the government authorities had the money, vision and power to bring all these components together so that a proper civic design could be planned, obviating the necessity to have such unplanned chaos. Let me ask a series of questions. Why do to Caversham we have to have every house fronting on English Tradition, full of variations in level and to the street? Why, for that matter, does perspective, and provided with an unusual number every house have to be built on a block of of fine old trees. land X feet by X feet with a back yard Then comes this passage on traffic which is usually too small to be able to do segregation: anything in, thus forcing children to play on the streets and run the risk of being only killed by cars, as they so often are? Why cannot we have small units of homes built in a circular pattern with playing space available in the centre and the homes on the perimeter? Why cannot schools be designed in the centre of the community within easy walking distance for children, without their having to run the risk of crossing dozens of roads to get to school? Why do we have to have one type of home only built in the one community, with single unit dwelling all together in the one area and all home units and flats in another area? Why cannot we design communities in which we have a mixture of all these varieties of dwellings to suit different tastes-on e or two storey homes, flats, home units, the new style but gradually catching on town house, and many others? I might add that not only should one have in a community different styles, but one should also have dwellings of different styles. I think that this is the great mistake that we have made in our society-w e have not designed communities; we have just designed homes. I believe it is very important that we should seek to build communities so that people do not have to travel all over the place, as they are required to do at the moment, and have to use cars to get there. This can be done and it is being done. This afternoon I was fortunate enough to receive a letter from a gentleman in Perth. I understand that he is extremely well known in town planning spheres. I refer to Counsellor Paul Ritter. He wrote to me because he read of my interest in road safety and of the way in which I have been raising the matter of the automobile and its effect on our life. Amongst other things, he sent me an item of interest which I want to quote because I think it supports what I have been saying tonight. It concerns the Caversham Park village scheme. It reads: Here, on the edge of Reading, a little more than two miles from the town-centre, work has already begun on clearing the site of what will certainly be one of the most interesting community-developments ever undertaken in Britain, be known as Caversham Park Village. Park really is a park, in the best Traffic Segregation' has become more than the civilised way of planning residential areas; it has become Government policy. A rapid accepthave an over-abundance of lawyers and ance of this principle can only do good. We shall earn the gratitude of our children and, in graziers-turn, of theirs. Cars, as has been said, are 'a mixed blessing', if we do not plan for them properly. Their very size, power and speed make them dangerous use a few more doctors. But we certainly bullies, and the traditional way of planning along have too many lawyers and fanners and streets allows them to affect all areas. The 'Radburn Principle', on which Caversham not enough town planners. I believe that Park Village will be laid out, accepts that the this Parliament should represent people advantages of the car are immense, and that its from all walks of life. We should have garage should be handy, next to the house. But farmers, lawyers, doctors and dentists, but beyond this, it makes sure that there is another side of life available to all, and particularly to to the best of my knowledge there is not children and old people, tt allows for areas where one architect or one town planner in the people can walk and talk in safety, where voices Parliament.

Good planning (perhaps surprisingly) can produce these Caucus Committee on Housing, Urban excellent advantages very economically, putting Development and Decentralisation, and bethis way of living within everybody's reach. Later on it reads: The principle is easy to understand. A main service-road serves many culs-de-sac, or loops, and as Don Gazzard and George Clarke who this road-system is quite separate from the pathsystem. Each leads to the right places in the rigbt way. Driving is smoother and pleasanter on roads reserved for vehicles. Walking seems shorter along sheltered, well-landscaped routes. The pathmeeting him in the future. There are also system represents an extended park. There will be various ways over a linear playground, tor small children, longer 'adverture-routes' for older National Capital Development Commission. children, and possibilities of safe movement for old people and for those exercising their pets. The system of a main path, with secondary branches leading to schools, shops, Community Centre, Church, playing fields, and many other communal facilities, will be very well illustrated at Caversham. As In all the best examples of this kind of planning, the main paths go under roads where the routes cross, so that nuisance is avoided and danger eliminated. Within such a plan, people can live as privately as they wish, and use the paths as much, or as little, as they like. It all depends on the house-type and the gardens, and more variations are possible with this than with a 'traditional' layout. The idea serves equally well with detached houses, with terraces, in local authority housing schemes, or in private developments for sale, of which Caversham Park Village will be the first large-scale example in Great Britain. I believe that we can and must start to build Caversham Park villages in Australia. This is what we are asking. Of course, the honourable member for Mitchell would be horrified at that sort of plan, but I think that the great majority of Australians would support it. I think that the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns) would support it. I want to conclude on this note: If there is one thing we need in this Parliament and in this House it is some town planners and some architects. I think it is one of the great tragedies of this place that we cause of the interest I have had in this matter for many years, I have been fortunate to meet many fine men-me n such are well known in Sydney for their work for the State Government. I have not met Mr Ritter, but I am looking forward to men like Ian McKay who works for the RecentlyI noticed that a Mr Gillies made a first class statement, which was headlined in the 'Australian'. He said that architects and town planners are going to get involved. I think he used some words which probably are not parliamentary. I say to architects and town planners who may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings: It is time you got involved in the political system'. I know how strongly they feel because I have spoken to them. It is no .good their trying to exert pressure from outside. They have to be in here where the action is. I support the Labor Party's amendment. Speaker, this is a remarkable Bill. If we study it carefully we see that essentially it is an indictment of the Government. All that the provisions of this Bill do is act as a stop gap. The Government, which has had 5 years to negotiate a new housing agreement with the States, has not done so. Because the Government has not achieved this in 5 years, this Bill has been introduced as a stop gap measure to continue the agreement into the coming financial year, until such time as a new agreement can be completed.

The extraordinary thing is that a new Commonwealth department was created, among other things, to complete this wealth-State Housing Agreement. I was agreement. Previously new agreements were entered into readily. The first agreement came under the Chifley Labor Government. As I understand it, the Government had managed to complete negotiations on this Agreement in the past. But in 1963 a new department was created to improve efficiency. What has happened? That Department has not been able to complete its investigations, present its findings and make to it, I will let it go. arrangements with the States so that the Government may lay before this House at the appropriate time a new Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. That is why I say that this Bill is an indictment against the Government and surely represents an admission of defeat for that lovely, bright, new glossy Department that was formed in 1963. We have a further example offered to us of the remarkable achievements of this Department. I refer to the homes savings grants scheme under which young people can receive up to $500 as a housing grant. This remarkable achievement of the Department of Housing is so full of technicalities that no young person possibly can know what it is all about without getting expert assistance in regard to it. Far too often we find that young people go to the banks and other places for expert explanation of the scheme and are advised wrongly. This occurs because not enough people know what are the provisions of the legislation. I see that the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Irwin) is nodding his head in agreement. This scheme is so tied up with technicalities that many people-and I do not think that there is a member of this House who has not had the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid is very wide. But it does not cover the legislation dealing with the homes savings grants scheme to which the honourable member for Chifley is referring. Unless he can show some relevance between what he is saying and the provisions of this Bill and the amendment, the honourable member will be out of order. think that there was some relevance because I was dealing with the efficiency of the Department of Housing as illustrated by its lateness in finalising the new Commoninstancing the inefficiency of the Department and the Government-member's remarks must be relevant to the Bill and to the amendment moved. referring specifically to this brassy new department that was set up. However, if you are upset about it and a little sensitive able member say that the Chair was sensitive on the issue? Government was sensitive. the amendment is fairly wide ranging and covers an enormous number of matters in relation to housing. Mr UrenI arranged it that way. remind the honourable member for Chifley that the scope of the amendment is very wide. Speaker, that you would be most fair at all times. I would not suggest for one moment that you would be sensitive. I think that there may be other people on the Government side of the House who would be sensitive. Leaving that topic, I wish to deal with some other matters which are within the province of this Bill and the amendment. I think that we should be looking at the moment at the point of view which provides for a new look, particularly in regard lo housing schemes and to the provision of assistance to enable young people to obtain their own homes. I do feel that high interest rates are having a decisive effect in this respect. That subject is within the province of this Bill.

121,"Mr Armitagei Agree. There Is No Complete Lack Of Playing Fields, Swimming","the Commonwealth and such a proposal is embodied in the amendments moved by the honourable member for Reid( Mr local employment and to provide the essenUren). Special grants must be given to assist these outer perimeter areas of the great cities, particularly those areas to which the great mass of the new population is moving. These areas hold the young people bringing up the future generation in this country. I also believe, as is mentioned in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid, that assistance must be given by this Government towards local government interest payments because the burden on local government in these areas is far too great altogether. In other words, we cannot take people from all over the country and just put them in an area with nice homes and good hard-working community-conscious people, without giving them the necessary package deal with all the necessary services and industrial development that go to make a complete community. Those are the reasons why I strongly support this amendment. The new agreement to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the States has taken this Government 5 years to achieve. The new Department of Housing still cannot settle down and do the job in reasonable time. When the new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement comes before the House, I hope during the next session of the Parliament, I would like it to provide for appropriate instrumentality to bring about these matters I have mentioned. I hope it will have a little heart and do something far greater than is being done today for aged persons' units. At present if people register with the Housing Commission of New South Wales for an aged person's unit they have to wait 4 or 5 years, such is the length of the waiting list. That is a different 4 or 5 years from 4 or 5 years in the life of a young person. Many of these old people do not bother to register. The honourable memher for Mitchell will understand that. They wonder whether they will still be alive when a house is allocated to them. When this new agreement is negotiated I think the essentials to be considered are the proposals set out in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid on behalf of the Opposition as a whole, particularly the package deals to assist in the capital development of these areas, to provide the necessary facilities, to provide the necessary tial assistance for aged persons' units. If this is done this House will have demonstrated that it has a conscience. Until it is done this House does not have a conscience. The honourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) has highlighted the very essence of this debate, especially by drawing attention to the great virtues of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren). One wonders why the Government is not prepared to show enthusiasm for these important matters which have been raised. We are coming to the end of a parliamentary session. Soon after Parliament resumes for the Budget session a new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement will be introduced. It will be effective for a 5-year period. It will have enormous significance for the people of Australia and for anybody to be so satisfied as to feel that the present Agreement represents everything that is desired in the housing field shows a presumption beyond understanding. The honourable member for Reid has moved an amendment which underlines some very necessary and desirable injections into the Australian housing programme. For example, he has proposed that there be an co-operation and co-ordination between the States and local government in respect of housing. The Opposition contends that there is a fragmented approach to housing at the present time, that we are obtuse and that we have diffused the responsibility for the enormous variety of facets which are involved. IfI had time tonight I would dearly love to enunciate the wide range of headings over which the United States housing authority prevails. It has brought under one umbrella responsibility for the wide range of problems in the housing field. Is the Opposition to be criticised for contending that there should be an authority to ensure that planning authorities are established and developed throughout Australia? The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) has told us of the problems which result from inadequate planning. Is the Opposition to be criticised",98,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities
122,Mr Les Johnson (Hughes) (10.15),"for contending that lands vested in the States or the Commonwealth should be retained for public purposes and that private rights to such land should be limited to leasehold? We all know that land is often valueless until it is aggrandised and upgraded by the expenditure of public money, and the Australian Capital Territory is a case in point. The Australian Capital Territory in the days of King O'Malley and others was a hinterland. We found it; we came to the Molonglo River and subsequendy we acquired the land for the airport, the railway and the roads and poured money into the Territory. Canberra is a great city, a city to be emulated not only in this country but by the world. The Crown land of this country was upgraded because we expended public money on it. So when the honourable member for Reid contends on behalf of the Opposition that we should retain this land for the benefit of the people because it will be valueless until we bring services to it, he is saying something that is inspired, idealistic and not deserving of criticism. He wants the Government to accept some responsbility for the identification of new cities. The honourable member for Chifley, the honourable member for Robertson and some honourable members from the other side of the House have told us that the cities are bulging and polluted, that people travel hours and hours to and from work in these rotten contaminated environments. Ought we not be prepared to take this problem by the throat and show the initiative which characterised our forebears who did establish new cities? Where are the new cities that have been established in the last 2 decades while this Government has been in power? The Opposition wants to see the elimination of slums and substandard housing. That is one of the proposals in the amendment. The Opposition wants to assist the appropriate public instrumentalities to carry out a comprehensive urban improvement and development programme. Under the constitutional arrangements that prevail, these instrumentalities are unable to provide the services and to resume areas that are required because of the inadequacy of funds available to them. Let me take a case in point. In the 'Sydney Morning Herald' today, and no doubt in other newspayers as well, there is the revelation that the Sydney Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board decided yesterday to increase its rates for water and sewerage by 9 per cent. The3 million people who live in the great City of Sydney and in the City of Wollongong will be affected by this decision. Enormous increases in rates will take place, 9 per cent being the average. In addition, there will be other increases which have arisen as a result of revaluation of properties. Many of the municipalities, we will find, will increase their charges for water, sewerage and drainage by as much as S3 per cent or 54 per cent. Every water, sewerage and drainage authority in the capital cities faces the problem that more people require sewerage services today than 20 years ago. The Opposition included a provision in the amendment in recognition of the fact that these instrumentalities and the State governments from which they derive have inadequate money-raising capacities. This Government is usurping those revenueraising capacities. Very often it is spiriting the money away for its own purposes. The things which are near and dear to the people are often being relegated elsewhere. All honourable members, regardless of what side of the Parliament they come from, recognise that the 9 per cent increase in water, sewerage and drainage rates results substantially from the high interest rate policy of this Government. Despite the fact that rates are going up all around Australia there is no preparedness-as the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) told me this morning in answer to a questionto make funds available for this purpose. These matters are tied closely to the amendment. The Opposition is not just concerned about making houses available. It is concerned about making homes available and making environments available to people. All honourable members know examples of places in Australia on the outskirts of the great cities such as Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, where young people often have no choice but to go 10, 12, 17 or even 20 miles out. In my area, which is IS or 20-odd miles from Sydney, people are paying $14,000 for a block of land and they are out on the end of a dusty track. cent reducible interest. has said, they pay 13i per cent reducible interest. They are in shackles for the rest of their life for their first mortgage, let alone the second and third mortgages and the hire purchase on their furniture. They are living at the end of the line on a dusty done in regard to private developers. The road which becomes a dust bowl in summer and a quagmire in winter. The services are inadequate and often elementary things such as shopping centres are unavailhave access to the Commonwealth Develable. They are miles from the railway and schools and there is an inadequacy of bus services. The Government could not care less. The intention of the amendment is to convey to the people of this country that there is an alternative. What happens in this Parliament is that periodically we concern ourselves with the business of making money available to a limited number of people who want to spend it on the acquisition of a home, but we do not care very much about the manner in which that money is expended or the kind of product that it buys. This indifference is not emulated in other parts of the world at all. In the United States where the great Housing and Urban Affairs Authority operates and co-ordinates in a contemporary kind of way, they have regard for these things. If the Government is to make public money available to people for housing it ought to get the best ments are made up of good men and true possible product for it. But the Government makes money available through the State housing authorities and many other schemes such as war service homes, the homes savings grants and even the building societies. Thirty per cent of housing authority money goes to the building societies today. The Government does not care what kind of product that money buys. It is possible to do something about this situation. In the United States the owner of a large piece of land-som e hundreds or possibly thousands of acres-coul d go along to an authority and say: T want to develop this land.' The authority would say to him: 'We will give you assistance which in the long run will benefit the people who are going to live in the houses which you develop. But there is a criterion which you have to fulfil. The development must measure up to planning and architectural concepts. It must measure up in terms of the provision of services and community facilities. Equally importantly, you, as one developer who will get the benefit of low interest or cheap money, will have to show your capacity and wulingness to pass on that low interest money.' This can be done in Australia. It can be Government can say: 'If you measure up to these standards which we consider to be the birth right of every Australian, you can opment Bank of Australia. If you go and build a lovely town or city on your land and pass on this Shangri-la at advantageous rates of interest then you will get financial backing and support through the Development Bank.' But the Government is using public moneys, sometimes letting racketeers and exploiting entrepreneurs take over and bleed the people dry so that in the end they finish up with a second grade product and their life is purgatory rather than what it ought to be. The Opposition does not accept that proposition. I outlined what is done in the United States for private developers. The Opposition feels that this ought to be done in regard to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The Government does not have to dictate anything to the States, which have sovereign rights. State governwho have regard for public welfare. If the Government gives them a decent enticement and if it shows that it has some ideals and objectivity about the public interest it will find that every Premier and State Housing Minister will respond. The Government has the prerogative under section 96 of the Constitution to make funds available. It can set down the conditions upon which the funds will be made available. It is time this was done. It is time that the Government made its allocations in regard to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement with the objective of achieving standards. I have not said any of the things that I intended to say tonight. I wanted to talk about how the Government had destroyed the Housing Agreement and the wonderful concept that the Chifley Government had. I do not want to be retrospective about it, but it is marvellous to think that decades",99,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities

124,Mr Les Johnson,"As my colleagueago a Labor government had ideals that cannot even be comprehended these days by people in the Liberal Party and by the Country Party jackals. They have not got this decent concern about people. They have destroyed the wonderful idea of the rental rebate system wbich provided for low repayment rates for people who purchased homes, which rates were geared to people's income so that we could fulfil in this country the United Nations objective that people ought not to be spending more than 20 per cent or one-fifth of their income on housing. Honourable members opposite do not care what the people pay any more. If they have a look at the housing commission reports, the details of which I hold in my hand, they will find that the average housing commission applicant in Australia receives an income which does not enable bim to pay the rental or to pay the repayment cost of a housing commission home. Many other important principles which I would dearly love the opportunity to outline here this evening have been destroyed by this Government. In conclusion, I want to tell the Government that it ought to think earnestly in this period that remains beween now and the adoption of the next Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. What it has done for decades now is not good enough. It is conceptually primitive, even sterile. There are many marvellous things that this Government could do over the ensuing 5year period. Its members can read the books in the Library and avail themselves of the research facilities here to see what is being done in other countries. Let us not become more second grade than we are about this matter. Let us do what we can to encourage Australians to fulfil their birth right and live in a decent environment where their children can grow up and have the opportunity to live a decent life. Dr GUN (Kingston) (10.32)I want to speak for a couple of minutes about something that is not directly related to the appropriation in the Bill. As we are discussing the general subject of housing costs I want to raise a matter which affects housing costs and which raises a couple of other important issues. It relates to a report that came across my desk early this week. It is the 1968-69 report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. I must confess that I do not have a great deal of knowledge of or experience about this body. To be quite honest, in the 18 months I have been a member of this Parliament I have not yet had one constituent come to me about a matter relating to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. But I would appreciate it if the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns) could give me a few straight answers on this annual report because there are a few figures and statements in it that intrigue me. The first thing is the revenue and expenditure statement. We see that the total revenue for the year, after allowing for transfers in respect of premium income applicable to future years, is $1,013,663. That is for one year. So the revenue from premiums applicable to this year is just over $lm. On the other hand, the expenditure is no less than $360,613. So this means that the administration costs of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation are in excess of one-third of the turnover of the Corporation in one year. Honourable members might recall that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whidam) has criticised the voluntary health insurance funds from time to time because their administration costs were of the order of IS per cent of their annual turnover, yet the administration costs of this Corporation are over 33 per cent of its turnover. How are these administration costs made up? Salaries for the year were $182,000, and rent and office services accounted for $33,681. Where on earth is all this money going? Now let us have a look at what the claims for the year were. They amounted to $21,441. So just over $21,000 was paid out in claims, $lm was collected in revenue and $360,000 was expended on administration costs. I do not suppose we can quibble. I know that we want to have a fairly prestigious Government corporation but, goodness me, it appears that this is just bureaucracy gone mad. I wonder whether the Minister could explain what is going on. It seems to me that here is a misappropriation of public funds. Let us consider what the activities have been. The last paragraph of the statement signed by the Chairman of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation states: . . . in view of the long term nature of the insurance risk and its relationship with the level of economic activity the Corporation believes that an adequate investment portfolio is needed. No wonder it is needed. If we look at the assets of the Corporation we find that its reserves total nearly $3m. This seems to be a completely disproportionate amount. Now it has been decided by the Corporation that it wants to begin investing the money in profitable ventures. That is all very well. Perhaps all of us who are given charge of anything want to build up an empire, but I have yet to see the parallel of what is happening with the Corporation. I take it that the Corporation's assets are to be invested so that they will yield more profits, and at the same time the people who are paying premiums to the Corporation, that is, the lenders, will be passing the increased cost on to the home builder. It seems to me that the person buying a home will be slugged so that the Corporation can build up into an extraordinarily large empire. I notice from the report under the heading 'Financial Results' that during the year the premium was reduced from 2 per cent to l.S per cent, but in spite of that the reserves have built up to the enormous amount of nearly $3m. What will be done with this amount? I should like the Minister to explain also what will happen with this big empire. Why is there this attempt to build it up? On the previous page of the report I notice this statement: During the year the United States Government established a statutory authority, the Government National Mortgage Association. GNMA will enable lenders for housing to raise new funds by the issue of guaranteed debentures, the guaranteed debentures to be issued on the security of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration . . . Developments in this field will be watched with interest. I do not know whether this means that it is to become a lending institution. It appears to me that if we take a leaf out of the book of the United States organisation we will be lending the money to the usurers who will be making a profit from public funds lent to them. I regret having to enter into this debate and I know that my remarks are not related directly to the appropriation, but it seems that this is about the most relevant opportunity to raise this matter. I hope that in his reply the Minister will explain some of the cancerous growth of this organisation and let us know what is happening to public funds. I have a belief that the home buyer is being hit while bureaucrats are building up an empire for themselves. would like to mention one or two points. I never cease to wonder why it is that when members of the Opposition-and on occasions members on this side of the House also-mak e speeches they have to insult someone. I refer tonight to the honourable member for Hughes( Mr Les Johnson) who mentioned what seemed to me to be fictitious points. I was sitting here and smiling because some of the things that he was saying were definitely incorrect when he turned round and blamed what he called the 'Country Party jackals'. This kind of remark does not do 'him any credit whatsoever. This man who lives in a city electorate and represents people from the city has no idea of the position in the better Australia outside the metropolitan area. Another of his remarks to which I object was the suggestion that countries around the world had better houses and conditions than Australia. What kind of Australian is this man to say these things when men who travel with parliamentary delegations to countries overseas come back here, no matter from what side of the House they are, and say that this is the best country in the world? They say that Australia is a great country. It does not do for any honourable member to put up the suggestion in this House that regarding housing Australia is one of the worse countries in the world. When an honourable member does this someone is bound to contradict him and I am the one who is doing it tonight. understand that this sitting is scheduled to go on till 2.30 or 3 o'clock in the morning and I do not have any wish to protract it unduly with a lengthy speech. In fact, even if I wanted to do so I understand that I would not have the opportunity since the Whips have been able to rake up only 5 minutes for me which, if I may say so, is hardly appropriate for a matter as important as this and touching so many people so closely. Let me say firstly that it seems to be characteristic of housing debates in this Parliament that the scope of Government legislation is always very restricted and the scope of subsequent Opposition amendments is always very wide. I do not",101,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities

A table already incorporated in this debate by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren), the Opposition's shadow minister for housing, shows that the proportion of low cost State housing has consistently diminished as the population has increased at record rates. At the same time as that has been happening, that is to say, at the same time as a greater and greater proportion of the community is forced into private, higher priced housing, people have been forced to build on higher priced land. What has happened to land prices in the last decade is too notorious to need elaboration here. But what has the Commonwealth done to combat this? It has done nothing. It has not even produced an idea on the subject. Only the Australian Labor Party has suggested a possible solution. We said at the 1969 election, and have continued to maintain, that States should be financed by the Commonwealth to enable them to acquire land to develop and subI would like to give one example of where this proposition could be realistically in price which follows rezoning. I have previously quoted in this chamber examples of rural land selling in one year at $1,000 an acre. After rezoning took place, the price went within 3 years to $12,000 an acre. I have no doubt that despite the very best intentions of the present State Government, a similar situation will develop in the northern corridor if rezoning is permitted. I also have no doubt that a State Labor Government would be more than interested in the proposition we have consistently presented, that is, it would be interested in resuming, developing, subdividing and then selling the land at cost. Whatever hopes may have rested on the development of the area in regard to the dampening down of land prices, nothing is more certain than that fhe most effective way it could operate would be under government management and disposition. But the Western Australian Government, as with the governments in each State, could not prudently consider a proposition of this type in view of present financial considerations. Only the Commonwealth can properly assist this development to take place. I want to stress that I am not dealing only with a question of cheaper land. The question of the complete urban environment is also involved. Only a government with large tracts of land at its disposal can create an environment as pleasant as has been developed at Canberra. Only the Commonwealth Government can be relied on to incorporate adequate open space, recreation facilities and safety features in urban developments because only the Government has enough finance. The Government Whip is looking at me rather severely, but I have 12 seconds left. In that time. I want to add a thought to that presented by the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun). He asked the Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Caims) some questions relating to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. I support the general trend of his thoughts, although perhaps not his vehemence in totality. I hope that the Minister will answer those questions. I wish to add a question. The honourable member for Kingston pointed to the extraordinary percentage of revenue which goes in operating expenditure, particularly on salaries. He also pointed to the low proportion of claims. The Minister was asked whether expenditure might be reduced. In answering that question perhaps he could also indicate whether he would consider lowering the premiums. It is clear from the very small number of claims made on the Corporation that even if no premiums were charged the income on accumulated assets would be sufficient to meet any reasonable claims in the future. There would be nothing wrong with very low premiums being charged by the Corporation. The insurers have good security. They are not insuring something which will go out of fashion next year. Housing does not go out of fashion and its value will not drop. I hope that the Minister will see fit to comment on the points raised by the honourable member for Kingston, and in indicating whether operating expenditure can be reduced perhaps he would also say whether he would and which is worth recapitulating, is that be prepared to look at the prospects of by this amendment members of the Opporeducing the present level of premiums. for Housing) (10.50)-in reply-Perhaps it would be appropriate for one or two moments to return to the Bill which is before the House, and merely to remind honourable members. I will read the title of the Bill. It is: A Bill for an Act relating tofinancialassistance to the States for the purpose of housing. The Bill is designed to make financial assistance available to the States over the months subsequent to 1st July and until such time as a new Commonwealth and State housing agreement is passed by this House, which we hope will be as early as possible in the Budget session. It is in relation to the Bill that I shall direct my remarks, because that is the matter before the House. BeforeI deal in some measure with points that have been raised in relation to the Bill let me say that I thought that the attack that was made upon the honourable member for Michell( Mr Irwin) was an unfair attack upon a person who, in respect of housing, has shown an incredibly kind nature and an incredibly great understanding of those who require housing. Unlike so many of those who have criticised him he has had actual experience in the field. Those who know something of the development of the areas west of Sydney will know that he has had experience in the housing field. It is worth recalling that the honourable member for Mitchell drew, from his own experience, 2 points which are worth recapitulating. He made it abundantly clear that even though costs of housing and the costs of all factors associated with housing development have risen significantly, contrary to the philosophy of the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition, local influences in this field can have a great and pervasive effect. We know from experience that such matters as the supply of and demand for factors that are appropriate to housing have a big influence on the difference in costs and the difference in escalation of costs which occur in various parts of the Commonwealth in various local authority areas. The honourable member for Mitchell drew upon his own experience in that field. The second matter to which he referred, sition clearly are trying to play politics.",103,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities
127,Mr Kevin Cairns (Lilley,"Ministe rTbe proposition that a Canberra should be built almost everywhere in Australia, where the Opposition would suggest it should be built is ludicrous. It is against common sense, but it is a proposition which finds its way into the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) who led for the Opposition. It is not appropriate and it is designed to attract some of our sympathy -between one-eighth per cent and onemember for Reid, who is interjecting, made one or two points appropriate to the Bill. He referred to a report from the Brotherhood of St Laurence concerning rents that are paid for certain flats and dwellings in Melbourne. I think that the figure he mentioned was $22. The honourable member recently received an answer to a question on this matter. The question asked the Government to supply details of the weekly cost for a 3-bedroom flat or dwelling and it was directed particularly to Victoria. The answer which has been supplied to the honourable member indicates: last week-ver y recently. Mr UrenI have not seen it. member may go to his room and acquire it. The information is easily obtained from the Housing Commission of Victoria. Rents paid on such houses and flats range between $10.40 and $12.30 a week. There may be a slight escalation of those figures but there is a great difference between rents of that level and rents of over $20 a week. The charges for rents and the charges for houses which are being acquired from a State housing authority are determined by that authority. Many of the commissions make different determinations according to the source of their funds and according to averaging or other processes which they might make between houses built at different times. The most interesting part of the argument delivered by the Opposition in relation to this matter is the recapitulation of the policy of the Chifley Government. It was mentioned by every speaker for the Opposition except the honourable member for Chifley( Mr to the rigidity which they built into the Armitage). There may be an undue sensitivity in that respect. However, let me remind the House that the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement which was negotiated by the Chifley Government had 2 features which it is appropriate to mention. It placed practically the complete emphasis in its policy on rental housing and it applied an interest rate to the loans and advances made 'available to the States of quarter per cent below the long term bond rate. The concessional interest rate being applied by this Government is 1 per cent below the long term bond rate. I think that fact ought to be remembered by the House because it is appropriate to a correct understanding of the position. Reverting to the interest rate argument, tbe final point I make is this: It is now demonstrated that in any day and age interest rates are not something which can be completely insulated from what occurs elsewhere in the economy. The days when one thought that interest rates could be completely isolated are gone. As was demonstrated by Mr Phillips of the Reserve Bank of Australia in the R. C. Mills lecture delivered on Wednesday night, those who would suggest that we ought to revert to interest rate policies of former days have at the same moment to concede that they must adopt the fiscal policies of certain days. They cannot exist in isolation. interest rates on war service homes. have been held on war service homes and that is to our credit. The honourable member should be delighted that we did not hold the policies of the Australian Labor Party in respect to the concessional long term bond rates. The country should be grateful that we did not hold the small concession which was given in that respect. If we accept the contention that interest rates should be rigid and completely isolated from what occurs elsewhere in the economy we are going to return to the days when attemps were made to control interest rates under, for example, the British Labour governments in the years after the second world war. We will return to some of those policies which were utterly disastrous in terms of capital investment in the country, utterly disastrous with respect British economic system, and utterly disas-",105,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities

134,Mr Kevin Cairns,"Interest ratestrous with respect to the ultimate benefits which could be given to the British people under such a policy. Those policies do not apply today. Any sensible fiscal or monetary management in an economy has to argue that such policies do not apply today. The honourable member for Chifley was concerned about bank advances for housing and that the calls to statutory reserve deposits from the banking system in respect of appropriate money management should not occur to the extent to which they occurred, and that there should be willy nilly a release from statutory reserve deposits so that banks can make an appropriate effort in the housing field. If the honourable member were aware of what could almost be termed contemporary history with respect to housing he would be aware that in the middle of last year the banking system and particularly the savings banks increased their activities in housing so significantly as to take up ithe slack which developed because lending from various other institutions decreased greatly. During last year the banks, in terms of housing, provided theflexibilitywhich enabled housing construction to proceed at as even a level as was in any way possible. Other honourable members have raised various points in relation to this matter. At this hour I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House. I would like to make one last point which is appropriate. The amendment which was moved by the Opposition will be rejected for 2 principal reasons. The philosophy of the amendment is a completely centralist philosophy and it has been completely centralist philosophy. If the honourable member would like I shall spell it for him. It is perfectly clear to those who are aware of what has occurred with respect to housing and <the factors which go into housing that local influences in a whole number of fields can be the most pervasive and most effective influences in many ways in respect to fhe cost of that housing. They occur, of course, under an economic umbrella which is outside local control but which is within the limitations of the Commonwealth Government. The second reason why this amendment is to be rejected-and one has to judge the sincerity of amendments in this House-is that quite clearly there is a lack of sincerity in the amendment. Let me demonstrate the lack of sincerity. If the Opposition was concerned with costs in this field, if it was concerned with increased housing costs, which I know have occurred, and if it was really concerned with those things that make up housing costs, it would be concerned not only with interest rates but also with insurance rates and the grants that are appropriate to the levels of housing. In order to expose the lack of sincerity of the Opposition in this respect I refer the Opposition to a debate that occurred in another place last week, on 21st April. If members of the Opposition are concerned with housing costs they should examine closely the Hansard record of proceedings in another place at page 935; the circumstances in which members of the Opposition voted as they did on that occasion and why those members effectively rejected the propositions concerning the levels of the grants for housing. If honourable members opposite make this examination they will realise that the actions of those honourable senators on that occasion ran counter to a philosophy which has been presumably -Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Oxley that he remove himself from the position in which he is standing. Mr HaydenI was just getting a drink of water. gest to the honourable member for Oxley that he remove himself from the position at the end of the table. this one last point: It is perfectly clear from the philosophy and the substance of the amendment, and from the economic policies which underlie the principle of the amendment put forward by the Opposition, that it is inappropriate in the Australian context and it is outside the structure of this Bill. The amendment is not appropriate to what is being attempted to be achieved in this Bill. I remind the Housethat this Bill is designed to give assistance to the States for the months subsequent to 1st July this year, so that some States which draw advances under the Act during:",106,Houses And Flats Completed By State Housing Authorities

Some statistics are given, and then the report states: An analysis of world trade by origin and destination confirms the prevailing trends of the past decade: the expansion of developed countries' exports has been absorbed by the developed countries themselves; the trade flow of developing countries is increasingly directed toward the developed countries; and the proportion of developing countries' exports to other developing countries has been gradually shrinking.

This, in a sense, is fhe reverse of what it is hoped might be achieved. I do not intend to speak very long because, candidly, I regard it as absurd a point of order. Sir, I have been trying to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports addressing this House, but I cannot hear him because of your Country Party colleagues on the other side of the House who just will not quieten down. Can you control them? -Order! The conversation is not coming from only one section of the House. 1 repeat that it is difficult for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to be heard above the conversation in the chamber, and I would suggest that in these circumstances honourable members, if they wish to continue their conversations, should do so outside the chamber. regard it as absurd that this Parliament should contemplate this sort of measure in this way, and I say that with some feeling. 1 suggest that if one looks back to the time when a measure similar to the one we are discussing was debated in this chamber some 2 years ago, the debate took place in much the same sort of circumstances. I suggest that a proper amount of time ought to be set aside in this House to debate what are Australia's real obligations to assist in the economic development of those parts of the world which are less fortunate than we are and, of course, of those parts which are adjacent to us geographically. The way in which this debate is taking place reflects no credit on the Government. After all, this measure was introduced into this House only on Thursday of last week, and we are expected to debate it at this hour only a week later. But the International Development Association is one of the more worthy of tbe institutions because it collects finance from countries such as Australiaa developed country-and lends it on low-interest terms, or in this case on no-interest terms, to assist in the sort of projects that are quite clearly delineated in the tables contained in the Association's annual report. In a way I am sorry that I 12669/71-A-|8fi J have not more time to go into details, but I commend the report to honourable members. On page 6 of the report it is stated: IDA That is, the International Development Associationmade its first development credits infiscal1961. It has been in existence now for nearly 10 years. The report continues: During the past 10 years IDA has made 221 commitments, totalling $2,773.lm net in 55 countries, for agriculture, education, transportation, electric power, water supply, telecommunications, industry, and project preparation and technical assistance. It goes on to list the countries to which assistance has been granted. They include India, Pakistan, the Sudan, Turkey and the United Arab Republic. It then gives details of the assistance which has been given to these countries. The report continues: Construction, expansion and/or equipping of 627 general secondary and specialised training schools, 52 teacher training colleges, and 8 agricultural universities. These projects, in 11 African, 3 Asian and 2 South American countries, will enable enrolment to expand by 148,900 in general secondary schools; 31,100 in technical and agricultural training schools; 7,700 in teacher training colleges; 6,200 in agricultural universities. Impressive as those figures may sound, they are but a small part of the task that has to be performed. The period from 1960 to 1970 was described rather hopefully as the decade of development, but apparently because of the inadequacy of the resources that were made available by the countries which should have thought more seriously about the problem, the decade of development was a decade of disappointment. Whether the world will have the same kind of opportunity from 1970 to 1980, without there being some fearful consequences, remains to be seen. One needs to look only at the tragic events taking place in India, Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia and other parts of the world at present to realise that the margins of tolerance might not be as great in the 10 years from 1970 to 1980. That is why I commend to honourable members, who may be a little too tired to worry about it tonight, the material contained in the annual report of the World Bank, and particularly that part which deals with the International Development Association.

It is hoped that the debate will conclude by 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock this morning.

I say lo those Government members who are not yet in the Ministry that if that they will treat the business of this be the case at the moment. The way in which this Parliament is being run is absurd.

158,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) (12.3 During Tbat Period. For The Most Part This,"I want to draw attention to one item in particular in Supply Bitt (No. 2) which I am sure ought to be of concern to members of the Country Party. It is estimated that $33.5m will be required during the Supply period for advances by way of loan to the Australian Wool Commission. I would have thought that there would be some honourable member on the Government side of the House who would want to debate seriously the situation of the wool industry as they find it, particularly the workings of the Wool Commission. Honourable members would have had adequate opportunity to have such a debate had these Bills been held over until a reasonable time. That could have been done if the Government had been willing to remain in session for atleast another, week or two. But members of the Country Party support the Government and apparently concur in the process by which it hastily dismisses itself from public responsibility. I think we are at a time of great watershed so far as the development. of the wool industry is concerned. On the one hand there is the optimist who thinks that the wool industry somehow is going mysteriously to change for the better all of a sudden; on the other hand there is the pessimist who believes that the industry is going to be slowly extinguished because of the greater use of synthetic fibres. I do not know how this question is going to be resolved in the next year or two but I think it is a subject about which a lot more should have been said in this House than honourable members will have the chance of saying. Another measure, the Loan Bill, was can say quite honestly that I have been on introduced in this House today. It will committees where greater scrutiny has been come on for debate some time next week. given to a petty cash voucher for $15.32 In essence it shows how nebulous are some than we are giving tonight to the expendiof the assumptions on which the Budget presented in August last year was drawn. ture of a sum 100 million times as great. A lot had happened in the 7 months or so It appears to me that there are 2 main since August last. I will say a bit more reasons for our skimpy and superficial about the Loan Bill next week. I certainly performances in debates such as this debate do not feel like delaying honourable memon supply and analogous debates on the bers at this time of night. I regard proceBudget and Appropriation Bills. In the first dures like this as a farce. Nobody wants to place, the practice has developed of allowlisten and for that reason 1 will say no ing discussion on any subject at all during more. I have made what protest I can on these debates. So there is a very great behalf of the Opposition. 1 hope at least temptation to concentrate on one's own that the Minister for Education and special interests rather than on any scrutiny Science( Mr Fairbairn) will convey the of the details of expenditure in question. feelings of honourable members on this side of the House to his colleagues. Perhaps he may even yet persuade them to meet for another week at least in order to deal with some degree of decency with the very important measures that are to be pushed through this House next week. In the days before television there was a British Broadcasting Corporation radio comedy series called Take It From Here*. As I sit in this chamber listening to debates, especially those concerned with the disbursement of enormous amounts of public funds, I often find myself recalling a sketch from that series in which Dick Bentley played the part of a big time American gambler. On the first night this gambler went into a casino and won 48,000. Everybody was staggered, but he just sneered: 'Peanuts'. On the second night he went into the casino and won 50,000. Again everybody was staggered, but he just said: 'Peanuts'. On the third night he went into the casino and won 100,000 and everybody, body was staggered. But once again, as cool as you like, he just said: 'Peanuts'. Finally, on the fourth night he went into the casino and said: 'Does anyone want to buy 198,000 peanuts?' That story comes to mind, I suspect, because the cavalier way in which we deal, with public funds is such that an observer could well believe that v/e are not dealing with public money at all but that we are dealing only with peanuts. We are not dealing with peanuts; we are dealing with real money, good Australian dollars. Under these Bills there are 1,532 million of them. I",111,Supply Bill No 1 1971 72
159,Mr Berinson (Perth) (12.10 A.m.),"For example, in the debate on the Appropriation Bills earlier this week we had successive speakers ranging over topics as far apart from each other and from any scrutiny of expenditure as cigarette advertising, the East Pakistan cyclone, ANZAC Day, gold mining subsidies and the Trade Practices Act. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not attempting to say that any of those matters was unimportant and not worthy of discussion. WhatI am saying is that if we are to have a debate covering all those topics we certainly will not be able to deal with any one of them in sufficient detail and we certainly, will not be under the present system. I draw the doing the job we should be doing in the scrutiny of expenditure. The second reason for our odd treatment of these public funds is that it is really not practical under the present forms of the House to pursue financial inquiries in any detail. For example, in the Supply Bill (No. 1) there are something over 100 provisions under the heading 'Salaries and Payments in the Nature of Salaries'. IfI asked in each case for the increases which these sums represent over the amounts provided under equivalent headings last year and for an indication of how much of the increases is due to increased salaries and how much to increased staff, I simply would not get an answer. That would not be a frivolous question. I want to emphasise that. Among other things, the answer would show whether the Government's restraint on Public Service recruitment in this calendar year is intended to be carried over into the next financial year. But there is no point in asking that question because I would never get the answer. In the same Supply Bill there are over 100 appropriations under this delightfully vague heading 'Administrative Expenses'. They are not small sums involved under that heading. Under the heading 'Administrative Expenses', for example, the Department of the Interior is seeking an appropriation of over $4m and the Bureau of Census and Statistics alone over $Sm. All told, we will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars under this heading. To tell us that those hundreds of millions are for administrative expenses is just the same as telling us nothing at all. IfI were to make a simple and reasonable request to have extracted from each heading the the Department of Foreign Affairs could amount represented by telephone charges I would not get an answer. IfI did, it would certainly not be in time for me to pursue the matter in this debate if I felt that course to be appropriate. Let me emphasise that this would not be a frivolous question. Indeed, the 126th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts almost invites that question with its discussion and obvious concern for possible Public Service abuse of the STD services. Let me give one more example of matters, which should clearly be pursued but which certainly will not be pursued attention of honourable members to page 34 of the Supply Bill (No. 1). Can anyone say that we should not seek further detail about the fascinating and intriguing item: Taxes and fines-remissio n under special circumstances. The amount involved is $1,550,000. We should be making such an inquiry. This should be the time to make it. We will not make that inquiry because we know quite well that if we did we would get no meaningful reply. These are examples of specific items in the Supply Bill which properly should be pursued. I want to make one more general comment on the nature of supplementary appropriations such as those we dealt with earlier this week, and on our inadequate and even improper treatment of them. IfI understand the position correctly, these supplementary appropriations are meant to cover expenditure which could not have been anticipated when the Budget was framed and brought down. Obvious examples under that heading would be the increase in salaries due to the 6 per cent wage increase last December. On looking through those Appropriation Bills one will find hundreds of items in relation to which it is not at all clear that the expenditure in question could not have been anticipated What on earth was the Bureau of Meteorology doing that required an additional appropriation of $200,000 this month to cover telephone, postage and telegram expenses for the period since August? What was the bureau doing that required an enormous sum like that for such a limited purpose and which could not have been anticipated as recently as last August? Again, one can readily understand that not have anticipated its disaster relief conthe comments of the honourable member tribution of $130,000 or its special aid to Cambodia of $900,000. But why would it not be able to anticipate that it would be liable for an additional $713,000 for rent between last August and February this year? These are the questions which we should be asking in appropriation debates. But we realise that there is no practical point in asking them. Clearly we will get nowhere trying to clarify these matters and trying to do the job we should be doing in relation to money Bills while we are restricted to the present forms of the House. New forms are needed. As it happens, we do not even have to exercise our imagination to think what they might be. The Senate Estimates Committees which were formed last year are a very good indication of how a practical job can be done. When one reads the Hansard report of the Senate Estimates Committees one gets the impression that they are still feelnot get the Committee stage itself. We were ing their way to find the best and most appropriate procedure. But it is already quite clear that ih these very important and basic matters the Senate is leaving this House for dead. Honourable members spent 6 to 7 hours debating Appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4-al l of it on second reading generalisations. By contrast, the Senate Committees will spend something like 50 hours in detailed probing of expenditure. They will have the Ministers and senior officers of each department before them. When the senators ask a question they can pursue it. If they do not get a reply they like they can ask the question again or ask another one or do whatever they like to elicit the information that they are after. We cannot do that under our present forms. We should be aiming to do it under new forms similar to those of the Senate. Not least of the benefits which have flowed from these Senate estimates committees is the fact that they have forced departments to produce supplementary memoranda to the Estimates. For example, whereas in the Appropriation Bill available to members in this House the estimates of the Department of Trade and Industry occupied 2 pages, the elaboration available to the Senate estiSenate Papers Office and I was there mates committees went to 50 pages. I want to say something about this derived from for Cook( Mr Dobie), the Chairman of our Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts, whose opinion on these matters I think should be respected. In a debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) he said 3 things that I want to quote. In the first place he said this: . . . it is disturbing to find that the second reading speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden), though it described in general terms the reason for the total appropriation . . . does not contain sufficient supporting material to explain why approval for certain amounts is being sought from this House. The second statement was this: I hope that when the Bill reaches the Committee stage there will be adequate material made available to honourable members to ensure meaningful debate within the time allotted for this purpose. That was a rather forlorn hope because not only did we not get additional information at the Committee stage, but we did gagged at the second reading stage of that Bill and we had no opportunity for Committee discussion. The third statement, with which he concluded his comments on this debate was: SoI would repeat to the point of nausea, but it must be repeated, that the Parliament must have the figures. The honourable member for Cook at that time spoke of the need for thefiguresand spoke in terms indicating that they were not available. In fact, as it happens, they are available. There is a complete breakdown and elaboration of the appropriations for every department made available by those departments to the Senate estimates committees. 1 have them here, and they are interesting reading. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, you will be interested to know that the standing of this House has now so depreciated that members of this House are not entitled to copies of these explanatory memoranda as of right. When I read in Tuesday's Senate Hansard of reference to documents of this nature I went to the House of Representatives Bills and Papers Office and asked for them. I was informed that that Office did not have any copies. I went to the informed that it had some copies but that it would not give them to the likes of me, that is to say, the likes of a member of the House of Representatives. I am not blaming the officers of the Senate for that. They were acting under ministerial instructions, and in fact they were good enough to suggest to me that if I liked I could go to each Minister separately, cap in hand, and ask him whether he would be good enough to provide me with a copy of these documents. That will be the day. I am here, in common with all other members, to represent about 60,000 electors and a population of over 100,000. Not the least of the matters on which we are here to represent our constitutents in the distribution of the very heavy taxation levies which are imposed on them. In that duty we are entitled to every assistance and not the obstruction which these ministerial instructions represent. I know there is a habit in this House to ask questions in debate and never have them answered. But I ask the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn) to listen to this question and please forward it to the appropriate Minister: Will the Government ensure that in future all copies of these memoranda are made available to members of this House or at least made available to them on request? I can see no reason why that procedure should not be adopted, and I believe that this House would be entitled to resent any further refusal to prevent us having the benefit of the memoranda to which I have referred. Whatever reason there might have been in the past for Executive reluctance to agree to an effective committee systemI personally have never seen such a reasonthere can be no reason for preventing a House system of estimates committees being established at once, and certainly in time for the Budget debate. The Government has nothing to lose from such a move. Our committees would not frustrate or delay its programme as it might have feared. We have the example of the Senate committees which make no move to cause and indeed have no power to indulge in that sort of frustration. A refusal to institute a committee system would not even a.m.) I join with the honourable memenable the Government to continue to hide ber for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) who the facts, if that is what it wants to do, led for the Opposition and the honourable although quite honestly I do not say that I member for Perth( Mr Berinson) in believe that is the intention. There can be no hiding of the facts disapproval of the manner in which Supply because if we want to know something all Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2) are that we need to do is simply approach our Senate colleagues and ask them to put the questions on our behalf. If anyone wants to reduce the House to contempt and complete ineffectualness, it seems to me that that would be the way to do it. I hope that none of us will acquiesce in the continued refusal of the Government to set up a suitable system for the proper scrutiny of its accounts. I do not want to digress too far from my main point concerning the estimates committees, but I should like to say one word on the whole question of parliamentary committees. We had a flurry of activity on this subject last year. There were inter-party committees of back benchers; a report was prepared and circulated by you, Mr Speaker; there was an urgency motion, at which time the Government did not sound really unenthusiastic about the proposal; but since then-quit e predictably, I suppose-nothin g has happened. A motion on this subject in the name of the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has been on the notice paper for 8 months, but the Government hasnever made time available, for the discussion of that motion. It is quite clear now that it never will make time available for that purpose. The Executive attitude on this matter is bad and it is wrong. Our acquiescence in that attitude is also bad and wrong, but most especially it is stupid. The only effect of our continued failure to engage in a committee system of a type which the Senate even now is showing to be effective is to prevent us from doing our work as representatives as well as we otherwise might. This is a matter going very close to our own self respect, not to mention the interests of our constituents. I suggest that both we and they should insist on no less than that on all these matters, but especially on those matters affecting their burden of taxation, we should proceed to a system which would allow us to give them proper representation. expressing my strongest condemnation and",112,Supply Bill No 1 1971 72

Every hand in this country should be Recently we debated a related matter in this Parliament but I do not intend to refer to it now. While the International Tin Agreement was being debated it was stated that the overseas price of tin had risen substantially. Has any honourable member thought what that means to the people of Australia? Have we organised our industries on the basis of what will happen in London? Surely there is a responsibility in Australia to fix prices here and to enter into greater competition with which will relate to the Australian economy and the development of our industries. That is true of iron, coal, tin, nickel when we had tofighteven to have the wool or copper. Our home and export industries should be so organised that those people engaged in processing our own resources will have some knowledge of what prices are likely to be. But under this Government nothing like that is likely to take place. It is long overdue. In considering our economic growth we have to get right down to basic matters of that description. This Government offers no hope that such a course will be followed. I can only hope that in the foreseeable things, but we must expand. We must not future a Labor Government will take office be content with this sort of development. to deal with these matters and to plan wisely in the marshalling and utilisation of our resources and the processing of our metals so that we can build up great sideration.

A glorious opportunity should be available not only to satisfy our internal market but also to seek out new markets our wool on the world's markets. My mind goes back only a few years to the time scoured and washed in Australia. There was great objection to it being done here. We were exporting dirt as well as wool and the idea of processing wool in Australia for the making of rugs, blankets, tweeds and so forth was laughed at.

162,6.60 51.66 7.83 ( Mr Mcmahon) And The Government As A,"deny them any means of drawing Government attention to their position, other than through the normal military channels, and these have quite clearly been futile. They have a just claim and the Government ought to be showing the same sense of responsibility and loyalty to them as they have shown to the Army. I have already given to the Government ample warning of the situation in the Squadron. My first non-public representations were made on 7th December 1970. I did not bring public attention to this matter until question time on 23rd February this year. The dissatisfaction of these men arises from the failure of the Government to grant pay increases through providing additional pay groupings. Two other units in the Survey Regiment were granted pay increases through additional pay groupings in 1969 and these were made retrospective to March 1968, when changes in the system of Army group pay were introduced. The lithographic personnel were assured that if their pay claims were lodged before 9th August 1969, and if those claims were granted, they would receive pay increases retrospective to March in the previous year. Although the lithographic pay claims were lodged before the due date, the men received neither a pay increase nor retrospectivity. This has placed them at a serious disadvantage, both in absolute terms and in relative terms. The result is that lithographic pay is low by cemparison with that of civilians with similar skills, by comparison with that of other and less skilled personnel such as drivers and clerks, and also by comparison with that of cartographic and topographic personnel of the same Regiment. The events that led up to the go-slow in December flowed from the unbelievable confusion and evasion resulting from the Army's embarrassment as being unwilling or unable to tell the men what the actual situation was with regard to their pay claims. On 11th September 1970 the men of the Squadron were told at Bendigo that a second level of pay had been approved for personnel of certain categories and that a third level was under consideration for those who had passed the advanced course. I understand from the Survey Directorate itself that they were told in Bendigo that the pay would come through in 6 weeks or so, but 12 weeks passed and nothing had been done. In December 1970 the men were considering industrial action. The Government may shudder at those words, but that was the reality of what the men were contemplating. They were informed on 2nd December that even though the Treasury had approved a second level in pay the Army had refused to accept it. My information is that the men were informed in Bendigo that the reason for the rejection by the Army of this pay increase was that the Army wanted retrospectivity to 8th August 1969 while the Treasury was prepared to grant it only to October 1970. The facts of this situation have never been fully revealed to the men. This information, when it was passed on to the men of the Lithographic Squadron, came as a real smack in the face and depressed their morale to rock bottom. The result was lethargy and a feeling of hopelessness which led to a spontaneous 3-day go-slow. After this go-slow, on 7th DecemberI sent telegrams to the Ministers for Defence and the Army, Treasurer and Prime Minister. I pointed out that the dissatisfaction in thc squadron was known to the Directorate of the Survey Corps, and I said that I thought it should also be known to the Government. I called for urgent action on the pay claims as the only means of heading off a further decline in morale and the possibility of industrial action. On the next day, 8th December, I received a telegram from the then Minister for Defence saying that he was investigating the cause of the delay in meeting pay claims and that he would advise me of the outcome. On 15th DecemberI sent a detailed letter to the then Minister for Defence outlining the situation as I understood it. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate in Hansard the letter which I sent to the Minister for Defence. It reads: Further to my telegram of the 7th December, in which I urged speedy action to finalize pay claims made on behalf of Lithographic personnel in the services, and in particular those of the Lithographic squadron at A.H.Q. Survey Regiment, Bendigo. The long and unjustifiable delay of the Government in dealing with these pay claims is the sole cause of the very serious dissatisfaction and unrest within the Lithographic Squadron at Bendigo. Unless speedy action is taken to finalize the situation of pay, I believe that the declining morale will lead to industrial action, such as a stopwork, as the only means of impressing upon the Government the grievances of these men. Basic to these grievances are three factors. Firstly is the inadequacy of their pay by comparison with that received by similarly skilled personnel in civilian employment. For example, I am informed that a married sapper (Group II) receives $70 per week (this includes basic trade pay plus all allowances) while the lowest paid lithographic draughtsman in civilan employment may earn up and over $100. .Secondly, many other army personnel, of less skill, such as clerks and drivers, are able to earn more than highly skilled personnel of the Lithographic Squadron. Thirdly, within the Regiment itself, the cartographic and topographic sections have been given pay rises with retrospectivity, while the only pay rise given to lithographic personnel over the last three years has been a slight increase which flowed on from the Arbitration Court. The change In the system of group pay in 1968 has given pay rises, accompanied by retrospectivity, which has given these personnel a generous financial advantage over. lithographic personnel. I am informed that a pay claim submission has been with the Government for over eighteen months, since June 1969. I am informed also that at that time it was stated that if the lithographic pay claims submission were made before 8th August 1969, then pay granted would be made retrospective to 1st March, 1968. The submission was in fact made before this date, but retrospectivity has not been granted back to 1st March 1968. It was announced to the lithographic personnel on 11th September this year that pay increases had been approved by Treasury, and that the men were due to receive them in five to six weeks after that date. Three months have now passed, and the men still have not received them or any indication of what the pay rises actually are. I understand that the additional delay has been caused because the increases have not been accompanied by the vital principle of retrospectivity-the Treasury Is willing to backdate them only to October 1970, and the Army has refused to accept pay rises because they are not retrospective to 8th August 1969. In view of the earlier undertaking to make pay rises retrospective to 1st March, 1968 the reason for the dates of retrospectivity as set by both the Treasury and the Army are impossibly to justify. But whatever the reasons for either date, the fact is that pay rises have still not come through, despite months and months of waiting by lithographic personnel. Furthermore, while the second level has been approved, no statement has yet been made about the third level, and no reason for the delay in this regard has been given. Finally, I am Informed that when changes were announced in the system of group pay in December 1969, the meagre changes made in lithographic pay were influenced by the Commonwealth Printer's claim that he was not paying his lithographic staff above the civilian award. As this claim has since been discredited, pay increases for service lithographic personnel should take account of the fact that the Commonwealth Printer has been paying above the civilian award. In view of the long delay and injustice which have characterized the Government's behaviour in the matters mentioned above, it is essential that the Government should make a speedy statement as to the nature of the increases and the date when they will come into effect. On 12th January1 received a letter from the Minister for the Army. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate that letter in Hansard. It reads: 1 refer to your personal representations in the matter of pay of lithographic personnel at AHQ Survey Regiment Bendigo. FirstlyI should say that the situation is not as described in your telegram. My investigations have shown that after consulting with the Commanding Officer, AHQ Survey Regiment, the Director of Survey is unaware of impending industrial action in the unit Secondly, contrary to your advice, pay increases have not yet been approved for lithographic' tradesmen categories. There is certainly no foundation to the allegation that tiie Army rejected pay increases for these employments; in fact retrospective pay increases were originally sought by my Department. The rate of pay for lithographic employments is still being determined. Consequently I am unable to predict either the rate or date of effect. I note that you also made similar representations to the Prime Minister and I have provided him with a copy of my reply to you. Two comments should be made on this letter. Firstly, the Minister did not deny that there was unrest. He merely stated that the Directorate of the Survey Corps had made investigations with the regiment in Bendigo and that the Directorate was unaware of impending industrial action. Incidentally, he made no reference to the unrest itself. The Minister left himself a let-out by passing the responsibility back to the Directorate and the Commanding Officer of the regiment. Nevertheless, the Minister was forced later to admit that there was unrest and dissatisfaction. On 23rd February this year I raised the matter in the House by means of a question directed to the Minister. He replied in this terms: I agree that there has been a degree of tension and dissatisfaction in this area. I do not agree with the conclusions that have been drawn and which are implied in practically every statement made by the honourable member. That is some admission for a Minister of the Crown to have to make about the men he is responsible for. The answer in relation to the Minister's investigations which he promised to make was given later by the Acting Minister( Mr Lynch) on Sth March when he said in a letter addressed to me: The situation is as described to you by my colleague Mr Peacock in his letter of 2nd January 1971 when he said that, after consulting the CO of the AHQ Survey Regiment, the Director of Survey was unaware of any three-day go slow action or of any confrontation in the unit in regard to pay claims or changes in production figures during the period in question. It is known, however, that there is dissatisfaction among lithographic personnel in regard to pay. This stems from the fact that these employments are alarmed witb the Graphic Arts Award which produces the current pay groupings. In other words, 2 Ministers of the Crown ation make 2 admissions of dissatisfaction and many other servicemen stop a review of tbese unrest, although remarkably neither admits principles is presently being undertaken stop comto the go slow action which took place in plex and far reaching issues are involved which early December. Are they not informed of require the situation by their officers, or are they finaUsation of the review I can give you no further taking refuge in silence? If they have still information stop. not been informed they had better make further inquiries, because it did take place Firstly, the objection that the linking of For3 days last year men stood around, lithographic pay with the Graphic Arts depressed and idle, and the processes Award cannot be an objection to raising involved in map making came to a virtual pay for service lithographic personnel standstill. However, I now return to the original the Government Printer, whose system of letter written by the Minister for thc pay rates is the basis of service lithoArmy. At long last this letter gave the seal graphic pay rates, is paying above award of ministerial certainty to what the men rates. If that is not the fact, I would like had feared, although it was in direct conthe Minister for Defence or the Minister tradiction to what the men had been told for the Army to show me that I am by their officers in Bendigo. The Minister wrong. Secondly, while statements by the for the Army said in his letter that pay Ministers have clarified the state of pay increases have not been approved for lithoclaims, these statements have also restored graphic tradesmen categories, that there tbe frustration and hopelessness that were was certainly no foundation to the allegaremoved when, after the go-slow, action tions that the Army rejected pay increases was taken to bring the men's grievances to. for these employments, and that in fact the attention of the Government. Thirdly, retrospective pay increases were originally the pay claims submission has been in prosought by his Department. But the Miniscess for 2 years, and including the year ter's answer raises other questions, and I 1968, to which it was hoped pay would be would like answers to those questions. If made retrospective, the men have now retrospective pay increases had been sought been waiting for 3 years. This is neither by the Army, why had they not been responsible nor reasonable. The Governapproved?

If it cannot justified? Why should men have to tolerate do that, it should at the very least make a this sort of misgovernment? Later on 22nd January the Minister for Defence sent me a telegram. He answered almost none of the points that I had raised cipally because all other endeavours I have in my detailed letter to him. The telegram read: I refer to your recent telegram about the pay of service personnel in thc Lithographic trade stop the pay of these categories is based on rates laid down by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the Graphic Arts Award and a thorough examination of the matter in August 1969 by the Defence Forces Trade Grouping Sub Committee on which the Department of the Army is represented comma did not support changes in the pay bf the servicemen involved stop it was concluded that the changes in rates could not be achieved within current basic trade grouping principles and that any variof these principles would demand examination in depth that has implications for pay of careful consideration stop I note the points raised in your telegarm comma but pending Three final points should be made. because the fact is, I am informed, that statement as to when the men can expect improvements in their pay. I have raised this matter tonight prinmade have had no direct result so far, but I raise it also because this particular situabring the petition forward in accordance tion is a reflection of a situation that affects the Services as a whole. It was the very inadequacy of Service pay, its inconsistency within the Services, and especially its inadequacy by comparison with superior pay for men with comparable skills and frequently with lesser responsibilities in civilian life, that has caused increasing resthat are bought over the counter. In that ignation rates and declining re-engagement rates in the Services. It was this situation of dissatisfaction within the Services which erupted last year in 2 successful resorts to industrial action by Navy and Air Force personnel and Which forced the Government to establish the Kerr Committee of Inquiry into Service pay and conditions last year. But there are many men in the Services who will not wait until the Kerr Committee makes its report and until the Government decides-if it does-to implement the Committee's recommendations. Many servicemen want action on their pay and conditions now. The case of the men of the Lithographic Squadron in Bendigo is one such case which has every reason to demand an instant remedy.. the debate tonight because there are a taxpayer. I shall refer to that matter number of matters I want to raise and in directly. The fact is that Australia is not relation to which I want to criticise the developing its mineral resources. It could Government. One of the first things I shall be said that we are not doing any more, deal with, quite briefly, is the imposition of insofar as our national economy and the an excise on wine which was introduced by interests of the people of the Commonthe Government in its most recent budgewealth generally are concerned, than is tary provisions. Not a great deal has been being carried out by many of the under said about this in recent weeks, although developed countries. They are in receipt of one or two question have been directed to aid from foreign powers, although these the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr foreign powers are not really giving them Chipp) in the House. I have in my possesaid since, in effect, it is in payment for the sion a petition from a number of growers raw materials that the foreign powers are in South Australia protesting against the extracting from those countries. Most of Government's action in imposing an excise the foreign aid which is flowing back to duty on wine. I received this petition a few underdeveloped countries is derived from weeks prior to the Dorothy Dix question the large profits that the foreign powers that was directed to the Minister for Cusare making from the raw materials toms and Excise by the honourable memobtained from these underdeveloped ber for Angas( Mr Giles). In reply to that countries. question the Minister said that the Government would investigate this matter and perhaps make some alteration to the prepolicy. The Government has not indicated sent excise duty. I could not bring this petthat it does not intend continuing its present ition to the notice of the House in the migration policy. All that we will see ordinary course of events because the petiwill be additions to the cost burden and tioners felt that it was not God who had the cost structure in general of the taximposed the excise but, in its stupidity, the paying community and an increase in the Government. For that reason I did not with the normal forms of the House. I predict that the Government will have a look at the present situation insofar as the wine industry is concerned and will probably remove the excise that was imposed last year and impose a sales tax on wines event honourable members on this side of the House will be given an opportunity to examine and debate the extent of the sales tax imposed by the Government. No doubt the Government will consider this proposal when it is formulating the Budget later this year. Much has been said tonight about the inadequacies of the Government in many fields. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) dealt adequately with the fact that the development of the country in the future will be only to the extent that, as new mineral fields are discovered, we will have throughout the length and breadth of the nation more and more huge holes in the ground. These holes will be perhaps like the holes that the Government is blasting in Indo-ChinaI turn now to Australia's migration",119,Local Government Rates And Chargesfa Comparison Of Amounts Paid In
163,Mr Foster (Sturt)'(1.4 A.m.),"I enter today at tremendous cost to the Australianpopulation of the cities of the Commonwealth. A decentralisation policy is needed. I should have thought that with the discovery of minerals in Australia, particularly in some of the less populous States, there would have been plans afoot by the Government to prevent the taking out of Australia on a great conveyor belt into bulk ships of all of our minerals. The same low price is being paid for our raw materials as is being paid to the underdeveloped countries. The discovery of minerals in Australia should have meant the establishment of cities on the western seaboard comparable to the cities that now exist on the eastern seaboard of Australia. This should have happened in one form or another with the discovery of minerals in Australia. It is just not good enough for the Government to say that it is developing the country. It might be saving the day from an economic point of view because of the fall in the earnings of the primary industries. The loss in the export earnings derived from the primary industries is being offset by the income and overseas exchange that is being derived from mineral exports, but this policy is not good enough in the long term; in fact, it is a very short term policy. What amazes me about the Government is the fact, as has been pointed out by the son), that it adopts an attitude of absolute legislative dictatorship in this place. Queswealth. tion time is absolutely hopeless insofar as endeavouring to extract information from an individual Minister is concerned. I would describe the questions asked by my colleagues as being either questions without answers or questions which result in some form of discussion that is designed purely to make cheap political capital of the honourable member on this side of the House who asked the question. Question time in this place is not a constructive way in which to extract information from Mini ters. The Ministers themselves ought to realise this, and I suppose it would be fair to say that the Labor government, when it was in office, was not any better in this respect. But the fact is that it is not good enough in this day and age. I want to make some brief reference also to what the honourable member for with by the Committee. It made a number Perth said and to what was said in this of recommendations on transport generalplace last year regarding the setting up of ly. Transport is getting into a hell of a a committee system. What the honourable member for Perth said is true, and it is worth repeating. Senate committees are doing some very worthwhile work in this regard. They are able to question various departments and authorities whereas in this place we cannot even question a Minister and expect to receive a sensible and reasonable reply. There is a vast difference between the two Houses of the Parliament in that respect. But one of the main criticisms I am making of the Government is that at the end of 1959 the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review came down with a report containing a number of recommendations. The report covered an extremely wide range of matters and it ought to have been the direct concern of the government of the day. As I bave said, it was a Joint Committee. There was a great deal of joint discussion in the Committee. But very little, if anything, has flowed from the Committee's report. There were no subsequent meetings of the Committee after it tabled its report; I accept that its report was tabled. No worthwhile consideration has been given by this House to putting the Committee's recommendations into practice or even to examining properly and adequately the matters witb which the Committee dealt, such as marketing, fhe financial structure of the Commonwealth and the powers of the CommonI plead with the House to accept that in fact it is not too late-som e 10 years after the report was presented-to pay some real regard to the position of this country today, because the Federal Government is inhibited, to some large degree, by the restrictions placed upon it by a Constitution that was spelled out in the horse and buggy days. Perhaps we, as a nation, would have been better off if the Constitution had been delayed for some 10 or 15 years until we could see the emergence of a concept which was different from the old colonial separate State system. Surely it is not too late for us, as a Parliament, to have a complete look at what the Committee said regarding a wide range of subjects. Transportation was one matter dealt",123,Local Government Rates And Chargesfa Comparison Of Amounts Paid In
164,Honourable Member For Perth ( Mr Berin,"hole. It is extremely costly and extremely wasteful. It does not run at anywhere near a profit. In fact, our transport system does not even cover the cost of maintaining it in its present form in any State in the Commonwealth. We should look at the question of transport on a national basis, that is, on the basis of national need, national development and national progress, and also on the basis of the efficiency of the transport as it affects the people. The transport system today in most capital cities and suburbs generally is in such a deplorable state that it is affecting the quality of life, if one regards quality of life as being adversely affected when one sits in a motor car in a queue in a poisonous, polluted atmosphere for some time, trying to get from point A to point B. As I have said in this House previously, shipping is related directly to our ability to create markets or to find markets for a very wide range of surplus primary products. In 1963 the Government saw fit to accept a report from Sir Alan Westerman, I understand, and we are paying very dearly for it today. In fact, there was no more classic example than the one quoted by me last September and repeated by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) some months later. The difference between our own Australian National line's showing a profit and showing a loss was the fact that the Line had to pay some $2m to a Japanese conference shipping line consortium because the Line carried a tonnage ot goods in excess of ths tonnage agreed around the conference table. I can see what will happen because of South Africa and see how far they have the manner in which this Government in been shipped. Perhaps then they will the past has tied itself to the shipping realise what is happening. monopolies-the pirates of the shipping world so far as Australia is concerned. The stupidity of the introduction of containerisation of wool has meant a hell of an increase in the cost of wool and most certainly has had a marked effect on the cases it is less than half. The honourable return to the grower. There has been a member for Macquarie mentioned what the tremendous capital outlay on the provision Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial of ships, dock facilities and containers. Research Organisation does to help proEvery time containers are moved they are mote a range of manufactured articles which moved at tremendous cost. A number of are produced from raw materials in this what one would most certainly regard as country and which are never put on the very wealthy companies have banded tomarket here. Manufacturers have displayed gether and amalgamated in these consortia. their capabilities, but the Government does They have become so large that one may not want to recognise those capabilities or well see, in the not too distant future, the products that are produced. Carpet is those consortia going to the wall, as did the Rolls-Royce company. What will the Government do then? Will it then impose a heavy taxation burden on the people who live in the cities and suburbs to get it out of the mess, but still not provide a national transport system? It is not too late. The Government should forget the containerisation programme so far as wool is concerned and study the advantages to be gained by using bulk ships to transport wool to the markets that are still available to this country. There will not be a decrease in costs, as the previous Minister for Trade and Industry tried to tell this House on a number of occasions. Incidentally, he never told me what he did with that $40m that he trotted off overseas with to buy Australia into the conference lines so that Australia would have a voice. But we have no voice and can be put to the wall. The honourable member for Angas can laugh about the situation, but it is very serious. This means the difference between Australia getting into markets and losing markets. I refer to the position in the islands to our north. We should look at some of the manufactured goods that are being sold in those countries and estimate the freight charged on goods shipped from Europe to that area. We should look then at what the shipping companies would charge Australia for shipping the same type of product, if we were able to sell it there. Honourable members opposite would be shocked if they made some comparisons along the lines I have suggested. They should look at some of the products from per ton.",124,Local Government Rates And Chargesfa Comparison Of Amounts Paid In

166,Mr Foster,"That is right. In manyone item. The sale of more Australian carpets could assist tbe wool industry. But nothing is done about it. I could raise this matter in the House until I was blue in the face. Whatever one says in this place, the Government plays politics with it. People are not important to members on the Government side. Politics are important to members on the Government side. They accuse us continually of playing politics. From time to time, on a measure such as the one before us I could ask all kinds of quesIn excess of $1,000m has been spent each tions about a whole host of subjects and the Minister would not answer me. However, on occasions this Government has passed legislation that compels a trade union to account for every cent it has spent. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has the right to demand to examine the balance sheet of a trade union. The Government does not accord similar rights to members such as the honourable member for Perth who, as he said earlier tonight, represents 100,000 people. The Government has its priorities completely wrong. The Government today is spending and wasting millions of dollars to create frustration and God knows what else in countries such as Indo-China. Such action is absolutely wrong unless it is put to the people of this country at a referendum. This Government has been returned to office in this place time after time with the support of 22 members from a small party which at a Federal election obtained only 8 per cent of the total votes cast. These members represent country electorates. The Country Party is given 5 positions in the whole of the Ministry so that the Government may say that it has a mandate from the people to squander millions of dollars. The Government has not that right democratically. It has not that right on principle. I would suggest further that the Government has not the moral right to do so. But the Government continues to do this. It has been almost 10 years since, in this available to a person in receipt of the country, a Prime Minister stood on his minimum wage. That is what the honourable feetI suppose that if I said that he lied members opposite do. They should not just to the electorate, you would want to pull sit there. They should say something. They me up, Mr Deputy Speaker. If he was not do not and cannot deny this. This is where a liar-and I do not suggest that he was a honourable members opposite and the liar-h e most certainly stretched the word Government have their priorities completely 'ambiguity' to great lengths, in relation to balled up, if I may use that term. This the amount of money that has been wasted is why I accused the Government of having by this Government-allegedl y required by double standards. it-in respect of so-called defence matters. At the same time, one might stand here and say again that the Government had squandered millions of dollars on the F ill and point out how many schools and hospitals this money could have provided. All these things have been said in this place before. I do not want to repeat them at this stage. I do ask the Government this question: year on defence. What can be honestly offered to the people of this country as a result of that expenditure? What has the Government in the way of forces and equipment to defend this country as a result of this tremendous amount of expenditure that has been going on almost since the Government has been in office? I am not saying that we should not appropriate money for expenditure on defence requirements. I am not saying that at all. WhatI am saying is that the Government's whole system of priorities is wrong. I turn my attention to the field of national health. Under the National Health Act, a man who earns the minimum wage or below is entitled to certain benefits. He can have what could be described as a sort of 'free ride' on medical benefits. The Government extends these benefits to those who receive up to $48 a week or $49 a week. I think that one of those figures represents the level now. At the same time, the health benefits that the Government provides for aged persons in this country are inadequate. I put my argument to the House in this way: An age pensioner on the maximum rate may have a personal fear that he or she should cover himself or herself in respect of hospital charges by joining a medical benefits fund because public ward accommodation may not always be available when required. The maximum pension rate is below $40 a week. The Government does not extend to such people the benefits I only wish that I had 40 minutes and not 20 minutes to speak in this debate. It is nearly half past one in the morning. I end on this note: The Government plays politics in this House whenever it can, no matter who is involved. The mothers who are bearing children today receive the same birth allowance as their dear mothers received 20 years ago. The Government introduced that allowance to win seats in this House. Honourable members on the other side of the House have completely, utterly and hypocritically forgotten about it. That is another point that I bring to the attention of this Government. I challenge any honourable member opposite to rise in this place next week and to indicate that something constructive will be done with respect to constitutional review. A committee should be set up to study constitutional review so that the Government may arm itself-withou t using accusations of centralism and God knows what other terms-wit h sufficient powers for the good of the nation. Whether this proposal is accepted or rejecing days of this Parliamentary session no ted finally is by the way. For the good of the nation we ought to examine whether or not additional powers should be granted to the Commonwealth because this would be for the betterment of the people and the development of the country generally. Order! The honourable member's time has Services Act. I shall cite one instance of expired. Mr DalyI move: That the debate be now adjourned. a division required?

Then, to prove tion to the state of the House. (Quorum formed) wish to use this opportunity to express my disappointment that these 2 Supply BUls do not include provision for matters which I People should be treated with more respect and other honourable members have raised and should not be placed in the embarrassin this House. There has been no provision ing situation of having to go through red for extra payments to the States to provide tape-type interrogation. Surely this Parliafor such things as the sealing of the Eyre ment is able to legislate more humanely to Highway, something that has been constantly requested by State governments in South Australia and supported by State governments in Western Australia. The request has been constantly refused. A return to the States of their tax moneys in this way would benefit not only State interests but national interests. The Government shirks its responsibility, as is shown by these Bills. It does the same in the area of activity covered by the Department of Civil Aviation. No provision is made in them for the resumption of areas for airports, such as is required at Perth airport. These are matters which must be attended to in tbe immediate future. Although the Government has failed miserably in these fields up to date it is to be hoped that when Parliament resumes for the Budget session these questions will be resolved. The Government will resolve these matters if it has at heart the interests of the average person. One of the major disappointments is in the field of social services. During the closprovision is made to ease the burden of the unfortunate person who receives only the wife's allowance to support a spouse. This is disastrous.. These people must face another winter on what is only a subsistence allowance granted under an often stupidly administered section of the Social a widowed pensioner who decided to marry an aged widow from overseas. Because of her remarriage this widow lost her pension. This couple found that although they were both over the age required to receive a residential qualifications.

I repeat, in case some honourable member missed it, that we cannot expect a pensioner to maintain a wife on what is a pittance. The wife's allowance is a disgrace. These people have been ignored. Surely this matter can be resolved as one of urgency. It is all right to promise that this matter will be looked at in considering the forthcoming Budget, but these people are in desperate need now. Mr Donald Cameron-Tel l us about the time Labor reduced the pensions. end of my speech we will discuss it. It is nice to see that the honourable member is actually listening; I thought be was too busy talking.

He further stated that interest rates on housing loans should be reduced. His view agrees with that of the new Labor Government in that State, which realises that housing is a social matter and that there can be no development without it. However, his awareness of the problem could have been generated by the public uproar at the Federal Government's direct raid on the home purchasers' pockets by the savage increases in interest rates last year. Public petitions begging for a reduction in these interest rates were drawn up and presented to this Parliament and the State Parliament without avail. How much of this mismanagement must we absorb before these protests are recognised and acted upon by this Government. No solutions have been offered in this session.

Mr Speaker Government members-Oh, no! find at this hour of the morning groans from the Government benches. But I would remind honourable members opposite that the timetable is not the making of the Opposition but of the Government. If they are not very interested in the Parliament, I suggest that tbey do what is in their minds and adjourn it and go home. I have some points to submit and I intend to submit them. Mr Donald Cameron-Hear, hearl member. I am glad that Queensland is still a member of the union. I wanted to say particularly in relation to the Supply Bills, which are associated with expenditure and the economics of the nation, that Australia in economic terms represents the last of the Mohicans. Alone among the advanced nations of the world we turn our back completely on national planning. Alone among the nations of the world we allow the waste and drift which is inevitable in a situation where the dictum of the Government is that the least government is the best government. But even with this dictum it is a source of surprise and regret that Australia has failed to seek an association with one of the most powerful and useful organisations in the world in furthercapital to those countries, having regard ing economic growth. I refer to thc Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That organisation, which began its situation. official existence in 1961, succeeded the Organisation of European Economic Cooperation, whose original tasks were the gish economies on the move again. It has great co-operative effort which led to the been a magnificent resource to member European recovery from the disaster ol states. Yet Australia so far has chosen to World War II. This body was one of the ignore an instrument which has been used handmaidens at the rebirth of Europe successfully by nations such as Japan and as one of the most powerful economic Germany, and in fact all the member forces in the world today-fro m the ruins nations of the European Economic Comof war to a renaissance which is still in munity. On our economic performance we full flower. The great task of the organisation has been to survey the whole field of of the 21 nations now comprising this body. It set a growth target for the decade of 1960-70 of 50 per cent on the real gross national product. Let me quote to the House the three aims of the organisation in case there is some doubt as to what it is and how it functions. Its aims are to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment and a rising standard of living in member countries while maintaining financial stability, and thus to contribute to the development of world economy; to contribute to sound economic expansion in member as well as non-member countries in the process of economic development and to contribute to the expansion of. world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations. The obligations of member countries, to which they have agreed, are to promote the efficient use of their economic resources; in the scientific and technological field, to promote the development of their resources; encourage research and promote vocational training; to pursue policies designed to achieve economic growth anJ internal and external financial stability and to avoid developments which might, endanger their economies or those of other countries; to pursue their efforts to reduce or abolish obstacles to the exchange of goods and services and current payments and maintain and extend the liberalisation of capital movements; and to contribute to the economic development of both member and non-member countries in fhe process of economic development by appropriate means and, in particular, by the flow of to the importance to their economies of receiving technical assistance and of securing export markets. There is no doubt as to how these objectives relate to our own The organisation has helped to get slug-",128,Local Government Rates And Chargesfa Comparison Of Amounts Paid In

175,Mr Grassbyi Thank The Honourable,"need this body and its expertise and help as much as, in fact more than, many of the 21 nations concerned. Australians have been given by the Government over 21 years a completely false picture of the economic growth of our nation. The advance in real terms over the past decade or so has been of the order of only l i per cent to policy implications of the growth in higher 2 per cent. At a meeting just recently someone said that if we are not careful we will not even be able to achieve in real terms the rate of growth in Ireland. I thought it was rather interesting to see what Ireland's growth rate had been over the same period. It was approximately twice that of our own. Surely the need is obvious. We are wallowing in sloth compared with the leap forward of many of the 21 nations associated with the OECD. Let us examine some of the benefits that would accrue even to us as members of Parliament as well as to the nation. Each year at this time the 'OECD Observer', which I am glad to say we have in the Parliament, produces the latest statistics showing the economic pattern of OECD countries, incentives to invest in developing countries, the need for inter-governmental co-operation on the environment and policy implications of increased growth in higher education. When we look at the latest publication we notice that it gives comparisons which are valid between the various member countries. It would be interesting to know exactly where Australia stands in relation to these countries-no t the statistics chosen by this Government or the figures chosen by any organisation that might have an interest in presenting them in a particular way, but valid comparisons with other states and other economies. From the Australian 'Year Book' we can fill in a number of the tables but certainly not all of them. It could be noticed too that the countries of the organisations are dominant trading partners, including the United States, Britain and Japan, which together must account for at least 80 per cent of our overseas trade. But it seems illogical that we have never taken up the opportunity to have our economic matters sorted out and clarified by this group. SoI ask the Minister for Education and Science( Mr Fairbairn), who is seated at the table, to convey to the Treasurer these questions: Why are we not members of the OECD? Is it our intention one day to become a member of this organisation? I appreciate that the answers are not within the purview of the Minister at the table but I would appreciate it if he would posa these questions to the responsible Minister. I also direct attention in particular to the article in this journal on the education. This is a summary of a 7-year statistical survey which has just appeared. It would be extremely interesting to have Australia's figures for comparison. The interesting curves on page 17 of the report indicate the degree to which Japan is pushing forward with her first level university degrees. If this process continues overlong, I submit there is a real possibility, in fact little doubt, that Australian minerals and agriculture will lie largely at the control of Japan, not because of any monetary relationships but simply because we have not taught our people to be technically competitively efficient or in the long run economically competitively efficient. It will be noted in the report that Japan, which has a low gross national product per capita, is third on the list of enrolment rates in higher education. This is the sort of data to which we can apply ourselves. We can all do this as members of Parliament and surely the Government would find this a useful tool. I do not think we can say that the nations associated with this body have not benefited. Consequently I pose the question in this debate particularly, because I feel that great benefits in the economic sphere would flow from our membership of this proven organisation in the field of economics. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Fairbairn) read a third time.

Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Swartz) read a third time. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Sinclair, and read afirsttime. Second Reading ter for Primary Industry) (1.47 a.m.) I move: . That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a short Bill of only 4 clauses. Its purpose is to provide parliamentary approval for the execution on behalf of the Commonwealth of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States for a rural reconstruction scheme and to appropriate funds for grants to the States for carrying out the scheme. The details of the scheme are set out in the agreement which is contained in a schedule to the Bill and in a schedule to the agreement. The agreement provides for the expenditure of $100m over 4 years. This scheme is one of a series of measures designed to help meet a crisis situation in the rural industries, and particularly the sheep and sheep-wheat industries. However, no agricultural industry is excluded from the scheme except for farm build up cases eligible under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. It is recognised that in respect of farm build up and the particular circumstances of some industries such as the horticultural industries there may need to be additional consideration of their special problems. These will be looked at separately. At the present time the price of wool is averaging about 30c per lb greasy. This is the lowest level wool prices have reached for 23 years. Receipts by the wool industry fell by nearly $100m between 1968-69 and 1969-70, giving rise to the necessity for the emergency financial assistance scheme for wool growers introduced late in 1970. This was intended as a short term measure which it was recognised would help only a proportion of the cases of financial hardship caused by the fall in prices. Returns for 1970-71 could be down a further $170m. They would have been lower still if it had not been for the operation of the Australian Wool Commission. A Bureau of Agricultural Economics survey in 196667a reasonably good year for the wool industry-indicate d that some 20 per cent of wool growers in Australia had net farm incomes of less than $2,000 per annum to cover servicing of their debts and living expenses. Today that percentage has doubled. The decline in actual receipts by the industry over the last 2 years is the major element of the economic problem of the industry. A further important factor has been the decline in expectations about the industry's future profitability. The immediate capital loss that this has involved in revaluation of wool producing assets, including sheep, could well amount to over $2,000m. In this situation the servicing of existing debt and the raising of new credit for continued operation have for a substantial part of the industry become problems of considerable gravity. The industry's outstanding debt has increased from $980m in 1966-67 to about $1,200m today. Net income calculations for the wool industiy can only be approximate but with the fall in wool prices, drought in some areas, and a decline in wheat incomes not offset by improved beef returns, the industry's net farm income in total has probably fallen from some $760m in 1966-67 to about $450m in 1969-70 and to $290m in the current year. The debt position has moved in consequence from one where debt represented something like l i times net farm income in the industry in 1966-67 to 2i times in 1969-70 and about 4 times in 1970-71. In the current year about one-third of the industry's average net farm income of some $3,000 per property is required simply to meet interest payments on existing debt. With the combination of a substantial loss of income in each of 2 successive years, a substantial decline in capital values, and little expectation that with likely price and cost trends profitability will recover to earlier levels, the industry is in a critical position and a particularly critical situation in the immediate short term. I am",129,Local Government Rates And Chargesfa Comparison Of Amounts Paid In
176,Mr Sinclair (New England,"Ministalking about Australia's largest rural export industry. It is an industry on which this country has depended very greatly for foreign exchange. The export of wool will earn in the current year almost $600m. Even though this is some $400m less than in 1963-64, the peak year since 1950-51, wool remains the single largest export commodity and accounts for about 15 per cent of the total export income. Australia may no longer wholly ride on the sheep's back, but the wool industry continues to be of major importance to our economy. lt is also of major social importance to the Australian community. There are some 89,000 wool growers running flocks of 200 sheep or more. It is a major contributor to the well-being and way of life of the majority of our country districts. Whole communities depend on it. We cannot contemplate a situation in which the forces against which we have been working but which seem to ' encourage a continual movement of people from eountry areas to the already overcrowded cities are accelerated by a mass exodus of wool growers because their properties have become unprofitable and they havereachedthe end of their credit resources. This has arisen in part because of drought; in part because of rising costs; in part because of a disastrous and unexpected fall in wool prices; and in part because of loss of confidence in the industry by some lenders. There seems no escape from the unpalatable fact that there will have to be a substantial restructuring of our rural industries. There is reason for hope that wool prices will recover from the present drastically low levels. It would be unwise to assume that the extent of the recovery however will be sufficient to permit the servicing of all debts contracted when property values and investment in property improvement reflected the profitability which did exist in the industry before thc effects of the cost price squeeze began to produce the difficulties which are only too apparent today. The wool industry is a very large industry. The solution to its problems put forward by some people is the apparently easy way of providing price support. In round terms each lc per lb in price support would cost the taxpayer $20m per annum. There are some producers whose costs and debt structure are such that they would need price support in excess of 20c per lb above present price levels in order to meet their commitments. The burden on the budget of a price support scheme of the magnitude required would be enormous. Apart from this it is essential for the health of the industry that it should not be fully insulated from the effects of changes in demand as reflected in price. The approach that has beeu adopted after an expert examination by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and after extensive discussions between the Commonwealth and State Ministers most directly concerned is represented by tha agreement set out in this Bill. The rural reconstruction scheme provides for assistance by way of debt reconstruction, farm build-up, and rehabilitation of those obliged to leave the industry where this is necessary to alleviate conditions of personal hardship. A complementary scheme to provide retraining assistance to farmers obliged to leave the industry is being formulated by the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Primary Industry in consultation with State authorities. Details of this scheme will ba announced as soon as practicable. To obtain debt reconstruction assistance an applicant must be unable to obtain finance to carry on and thus be in danger of losing his property or other assets if he is not provided with assistance. Debt reconstruction assistance may involve a rearrangement or a composition of debts to allow more time for payment. The authority may advance money for repayment of a proportion of the debts and for carry on expenses, livestock and further property development. Such advances may be for up to 20 years and the authority is required to ensure that the interest rate on Commonwealth money advanced under the scheme will average 4 per cent per annum. The farm build-up provisions are intended to encourage amalgamation of properties which are too small to be economic under today's conditions. Finance may be provided either to the owner of an uneconomic property to buy adjoining land to build up his property or to an adjoining owner to enable him to purchase an uneconomic farm. Grants may be made at the discretion of the authority to cover, in whole or in part, losses sustained in the disposal of assets included in the purchase price of the property which are not useful for the built-up property. Advances may be made for carry on expenses, plant, livestock and property development in respect of the additional land where finance is not avaUable from other sources. The interest rate for farm build-up advances on Commonwealth money is 6i per cent per annum. In considering interest rates it is as well quences of commercial judgments which to keep in mind that the aim of the scheme is to assist people who have prospects of becoming commercially viable. There must be an expectation that the farmer will in due course be able to service credit provided to him on normal commercial terms. It is not realistic to admit to the scheme cases which require the bridging of too large a gap between the terms provided under the scheme and normal commercial terms. In order to ensure that the scheme has the widest possible effect in encouraging sound permanent restructuring of the industry, the general objective is that half of the funds will be applied to farm build-up. This will supplement funds available for farm build-up from other sources. In this connection I am pleased that the Government has arranged with the Development Bank to extend its operations to include lending for property purchase for build-up purposes and advances are to be made by the Government to the Bank for this purpose. Mr Speaker, such is the condition of the rural industries at present that there are many cases where producers are in financial difficulty and will not be able to satistween on the one hand those who on the fy the requirement that they have prospects of commercial viability. It is the natneed assistance or would be eligible to reural wish of many people to continue in a way of life which they know and like and may have followed for many years. But while recognising the contribution these producers make in earning export income the Government must attempt to balance the real cost of resources used in gaining those earnings in devising measures of assistance to export industries. Carry on finance may alleviate immediate financial pressure for a limited period but if the result is a lot of additional hard work and worry and a still larger debt around the producer's neck, it may no. be worthwhile. This is not a policy of 'get big or get out'. It is not a policy of forcing people off the land. It is a policy of concentrating the assistance that is available on those cases which have the best hope of weathering the present adverse circumstances and recovering to a sound financial position in the longer term. In the application of the funds that are available the aim is to help producers. The aim is not to displace private credit and it is not to relieve creditors of the consethey have made. The Government is conscious that the present times are difficult not only for producers but also for institutional and other lenders. It asks that creditors will be forbearing and co-operate with the reconstruction authorities and the producers in a combined effort to retain in the industry as many producers as can possibly be placed on a sound basis and to avoid precipitate or disruptive action in the difficult times which the rural industries are facing. For those who are obliged to leave the land because they do not qualify for rural reconstruction and who need retaining, this will be available under the scheme to wbich I have referred. For those who are obliged to leave and who face financial hardship modest assistance for rehabilitation in the form of an advance of up to $1,000 may be provided by the reconstruction authority. The course of wool prices in the future is of course uncertain. There are, however, grounds for believing that present price levels are unduly low and that there will be some recovery in the coming months. There is the case of the producer falling in bepresent market outlook for wool do not ceive assistance under the debt reconstruction or farm build-up provisions of the scheme, and on the other hand those wbo, even with a significant improvement in wool prices, are beyond prospects of recovery because their costs are too high or their debts too large. These are people who, if their cases are judged on the present market outlook, would have to leave the industry. If wool prices subsequently recover they may have left unnecessarily-the y may have been able to return to profitability if they had been assisted to remain. With this in mind, the States have suggested that perhaps this proposed reconstruction scheme needs to be supplemented in some way, or even radically reviewed to accommodate these cases. However the States have accepted that at least this scheme should be implemented and in its present form, in order that this new finanindustries outside the primary sector. If so, cial assistance may be provided immediately and without delay. Future needs can then be assessed in the light of experience and the further knowledge gained. As I have said, this rural reconstruction scheme has been formulated in consultation with the State governments. The problems with which it seeks to deal are regarded as the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth will provide funds to the States to carry out the scheme. The States have agreed to administer the scheme and bear their own administration costs. The Commonwealth offered the States to the unavoidable necessity for adjustments the sum of $100m over 4 years for the in the industry to meet the changes in its scheme as a loan at an interest rate of 3 circumstances that have occurred. per cent per annum. At the request of the States an alternative offer was made and in this Bill are sound in their conception this was that $75m should be provided as and practical in their application. I trust a loan bearing interest at 6 per cent per that the House will take note of the very annum with the remaining $25m being a difficult financial problems which face rural non-repayable grant. There is a margin beindustry and in particular the wool industry tween the amounts the States would receive at the present time and will support assistif they lent half of the money for debt reance to these industries as provided for in construction assistance at 4 per cent per the Bill. annum and the other half for farm build-up at 6 i per cent per annum and the amount adjourned. the States will be obliged to repay the Commonwealth. The margin is intended to cover normal losses in lending under the scheme and write-offs under the farm buildup provisions. If the States incur losses from circumstances beyond their control and read a first time. the agreement provides that the Commonwealth will review the position with a view to adjusting the States' repayment obligaa.m.)I move: tions to the extent of such losses. Importantly the agreement provides for the operation of the scheme to be reviewed from time to time and for the review to include the funds to be provided for the scheme, the allocation of the funds between the States, the provisions for losses and write-offs, the interest rates to be charged States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Bill. to borrowers, and the proportion of financial assistance applied to farm build1935 authorised the making of grants to up. There will be regular exchanges of information between the States and the Commonwealth on the operation and effectiveness of the scheme. Perhaps there are some who will criticise the provision of special assistance to the rural industries on the grounds that comparable assistance is not provided to other let me say that it is an undeniable fact that wool growers have provided over many decades benefits to the country as the mainstay of export income without any form of price support or stabilisation plan. There will no doubt be a majority who will feel that wool growers should now, when costs and prices have turned against them, be assisted purposefully to meet the difficulties which face them. The Government has had to make its own judgment, after consultation with the States, on what is feasible having regard to the many other demands made upon its resources and having regard I believe that the measures provided for Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) LOAN (FARMERS' DEBT Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Snedden Second Reading That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act 1935-1950 to enable funds available to the States arising from that Act to be used for the same purpose as the funds to be provided by the Commonwealth under the The Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act the States for the purpose of discharging in whole or in part, the debts of farmers by means of compositions or schemes of arrangement between farmers and their",131,States Grants Rural Reconstruction Bell 1971
177,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Treasurer ) (2.3creditors. The States were empowered to use the funds to make either grants or loans to farmers. One condition laid down in the Act was that repayments to the States by farmers were to be used for the same purposes as the initial Commonwealth grants, so that such repayments constituted a revolving fund for the purposes specified in the Act. At 30th June 1970 the States had cash balances totalling $7.6m, and loans outstanding to farmers totalling $4.6m arising from the operation of the Act. During the recent discussions with the States on the rural reconstruction scheme, it was agreed that the States would use the balances available to them under the Act for the purposes of the new scheme, which are wider than those laid down in the ' Act. The Bill will enable the States to proceed accordingly. It provides that repayments to the States by farmers of loans made from these balances for the purposes ' of the new scheme may be used again, for the same purposes. A further provision in the Bill is intended to fulfil the undertaking a concessional interest rate of 4 per cent in given to the Tasmanian Government, arising out of .the 1968 drought in Tasmania, that the Commonwealth would take action to enable the State to use the funds available to it under the Act for the relief of farmers affected by that drought. Finally, as a consequence of recent bankruptcy legislation, the Bill provides for the repeal of section 9 and an amendment of section 10 of the Act. 1 should also like to take this opportunity of announcing'that, as a further means of facilitating desirable structural adjustment in rural industries, the board of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has agreed to widen the lending activities of the Commonwealth Development Bank. At the present time, the Bank does not normally approve loan applications for property purchases not involving substantial developmental features. It has now been decided that the Bank will consider loan applications for the purpose of assisting farmers to acquire additional land to build up the size and operational efficiency of their farms. Those eligible for assistance will be working farmers whose properties may be too small to constitute an enterprise viable in the long run, or farmers who by acquiring additional land will assist the adjustment process through enabling uneconomic farms to be purchased. Loan applications will normally be considered only from persons whose main source of income will be the farming enterprise concerned. The terms and conditions attaching to such loans will be the same as those currently applied by the Development Bank. In particular: (a) The repayment term will be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case, but may be up to 20 years; (b) The interest rate will be 6 i per cent; and (c) Finance would not otherwise have been available to the borrower on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. To increase the capacity of the Development Bank to operate in this new field of lending, the Government has decided to provide in the 1971-72 Budget an amount of $10m by way of an advance to the Development Bank. The advance will carry order to allow the Development Bank a margin to cover the costs of making and administering such loans. I commend the Bill to honouralbe members. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. Industrial Relations Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. House has on innumerable occasions listened to Dorothy Dix type questions directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) and other Ministers concerning disputes that have arisen in various parts of Australia. Invariably, we get a reply which condemns the employees involved in the dispute, with the advice that the cause of the dispute should be taken to the arbitration tribunals, and that the employees must agree with the decision given by the tribunal. This, the acceptance by employees of the decision, is the cornerstone of the whole arbitration system, we are told. This may look all right on paper to many people, but I am afraid that it does not work out sometimes in practice. There is",134,Adjustment Bill 1971
178,Mr Wallis (Grey) (2.8 A.m.),"Thisone big flaw in the system in that there is a right of appeal against decisions given by the various Commissioners. And it is this very function of the arbitration system that is the cause of a major industrial dispute within my electorate. I refer to the dispute involving the Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Whyalla ship yards. Some time ago, the Ship Painters and who . recognised the disabilities that existed, Dockers Union was granted certain and as a result extra payments were granted improvements in award conditions by the to employees in certain sections of this Commissioner covering that industry, but plant However, BHP again used the appeals the BHP decided to lodge an appeal, and provisions, with the result that its appeal some of the improved conditions were was upheld, again denying to employees knocked off as a result of the appeal to disability payments granted by the comthe Bench. This, naturally, was the cause missioner handling the case. It is also a of a great deal of discontent amongst fact that in that dispute the employees lost members of this particular union employed not only what had been granted by the at Whyalla. There were stoppages of protest on the that were made to them prior to the matter particular issue, which finally culminated going before the commissioner. in a total stoppage by members of this Union approximately a fortnight ago and, from the latest information, this stoppage is still going on. At this point of time the confidence of the BHP employees of other employees have been stood down Whyalla in the arbitration system as it is and it appears that the BHP company is set up at present. They are the cause of to use the stand-down provisions in the the continual discontent amongst employees awards to stand down many more of its that has gone on for some time, and I think employees engaged in its Whyalla shipa large part of the blame can be placed yards, resulting in a possible complete on BHP for its attitude to its employees shutdown of the yard. WhilstI personally generally. The work force at Whyalla is regret the number of men stood down, made up mainly of post-war immigrants to with the resultant loss of income for their this country, mainly from various parts of wives and families, I feel that the whole the United Kingdom but also from many dispute is a result of the fact that in this other countries. They have never worked case, as in other cases involving BHP at under a compulsory arbitration system such Whyalla, it is the company itself that does as we have operating, and many are not believe in accepting umpire's decisions, resentful of the manner in which it as employees are asked to do. From my operates. With the cases I have mentioned, observations, it is the typical high-handed is it any wonder that the BHP wage attitude, by the use of the appeals proviemployee sees himself up against not only sions, of this company that has been the the employer, whenever a dispute may arise, cause of this dispute. My mind goes back to 2 other occasions when the appeals provisions were used to deny to employees the improved conditions granted by a commissioner of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The first was in the construction of the oil drilling rig, the 'Ocean Digger' at the Whyalla shipyard. The employees engaged on this project were granted extra rates of pay to compensate for the disabilities connected with this particular job. The BHP company appealed against the decision, with the result that the payments agreed to by the commissioner were taken from the employees. The second occasion that comes to mind was in connection with the operations of the BHP's pellet plant at Whyalla. Here again, a dispute arose over disabilities suffered by certain employees at this plant. The matter went before a commissioner, commissioner but also disability payments Mr Speaker, it is cases such as I have mentioned that have completely sapped but also the arbitration system? I have been a firm believer that if our system is to work successfully the greatest emphasis must be placed on conciliation rather than on arbitration, and I think that this point was pressed home most strongly by my colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) in the address he made a few weeks ago on productivity. However, I am also firmly of the opinion that BHP believes the opposite-that arbitration on disputes is of more importance than conciliation. The very actions of BHP fully support this view. It adopts what is to me a very strange attitude, in that it does not recognise the Whyalla Combined Unions Council-a n organisation which covers most of the unions whose members work at the Whyalla shipyard. As a former secretary of a combined unions organisation, I have found that in dealing with industrial enterprises of some size, which have had some concern for the state of their industrial relations, they have ebb. been willing to discuss matters over the table with combined union organisations, and in many cases to reach decisions which, because they have been mutually agreed to over the table, are respected by both employer and employee. Surely the same approach can be made by BHP in its attitude to its employees and their organisaare normal men and would respond to a tions. The BHP company receives great assistance from governments in general; the shipyard operates with a Federal Government subsidy on ships built there; the housing of its employees in Whyalla is provided by tbe South Australian Housing Trust; the royalties it pays on its iron ore are minimal; its water is carried from the River Murray in a duplicated pipeline built at government expense; and many other government services are provided. Whilst it is our largest single private enterprise, incidentally our most profitable enterprise and apparently is efficient generally in its operations, I feel that until such time as it is prepared to change its attitudes to its employees on industrial matters, industrial relations at Whyalla will continue at a low Therefore, in conclusion, I urge the Government to use its influence with this company in order to have it alter its attitude, which creates so much discontent, and, by doing so help to create the peaceful industrial relations it so often expresses as its desire. The BHP employees of Whyalla bit of decent treatment instead of the higl handed treatment they now receive. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 2.15 a,m.
