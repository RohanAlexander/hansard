Sitting suspended from 10.00 a.m. to 10.06 a.m. Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by Mr Simmons: That the House take note of the paper. Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled Taxing relaxing. If some of its recommendations were a little stronger, the report could be called 'Relaxing taxing'. That aside, it is a very important report that has come out at a very important time for the tourism industry. The tourism industry in Australia is a young industry. It is in its early growth stages. That industry has the potential to provide a great deal of income to the Commonwealth of Australia in the future. I commend the report. However, I also commend the recommendation at the end of the dissenting report from the honourable member for Dawson( Mr Braithwaite). The honourable member recommends that a comprehensive review of the indirect taxation arrangements should be undertaken to develop options for reform which address the need for simplicity, equity and efficiency. It is important that we note that recommendation in the dissenting report. We all know-and the government should know-that the indirect taxes levied in this country are an impediment, not only to the tourism industry, but also to a lot of other small businesses and manufacturing industries. If we are serious about helping those industries grow and about helping the development of greater employment prospects for the nearly one million people who are unemployed in Australia today, we need to pay attention to that area. There are some good recommendations in the report. For example, recommendation No.3 says that all vehicles which are used exclusively for earning assessable income should be fully depreciable. That is a common sense recommendation. All the recommendations in the report, as far as I can see, are aimed at assisting the industry to get up and get going, thus generating more income for the country and generating more employment. Another recommendation which I highlight is recommendation No.5. It says that net capital gains tax should be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. No doubt government members would be aware that that was part of our policy at the 1993 election. That ties in with part of the recommendation of the honourable member for Dawson in his dissenting report about providing fairness and equity, and incentives to continue to invest in Australia. It is a very important recommendation. I urge the government to take it on board.",156,Bills Returned From The Ment He Says Senate

558,Mr Vaile (Lyne) (10.06 A.m.),"I want to comment briefly on the report of the House ofMC 2652 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 March 1995 The next recommendation I had highlighted-and it goes to the heart of a bit of a problem that I have had with a couple of tourism operators in my electorate of Lyne-is recommendation No. 11. that: ... a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and four wheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under and that the Transport Ministers Council be consulted for their assistancewith the implementation of this exemption. This is a terribly important recommendation and one that should be flagged to the government and indeed to the Minister for Tourism( Mr Lee) to act upon. The lack of exemption is causing a great deal of hardship in the tourism sector in Australia. Over the last couple of years-and indeed prior to the incumbent minister taking on the portfolio---ecotourism has been promoted and developed at a very rapid rate in all parts of Australia but in particular on the eastern seaboard. It is one element of growth that we are creating, a little bit of a niche market, in my region of New South Wales. We have the advantage of being close to the coast, close to the beaches, as well as having operators such as those that I am talking about who are providing day trips or overnight trips to the hinterland, into our forests, into our national parks, using these exact vehicles. These operators cannot get sales tax exemption unless they pay a hell of a large price for a vehicle that seats more than 12 people. Those vehicles that seat more than 12 people are not suitable for the type of job that they are doing. A couple of such operators are Richard Morocco from Port Macquarie, who had a vehicle specially built because he needed to have it under that size to operate in the forestry areas and the steep country that he goes into, and Wayne Whitford in Wingham, who is in the same predicament as he attempts to become established in the market. It was interesting to read the particular paragraph under the heading of 'Vehicles under 12 seats including small buses, courtesy buses, four wheel drive vehicles': Buses of 13 seats or more are exempt from sales tax under a concession introduced in 1961that is 34 years agoto allow for competition between gpvemment run transport services and those operated privately. Sales tax is imposed on vehicles of 12 seats or under, even when these vehicles are used entirely for commercial purposes. This had led to the situation where operators using larger vehicles may have a lower tax liability than their industry colleagues who use small buses, stretch limousines and 4 WD vehicles. It is the four-wheel drive vehicles that I am talking about. The next paragraph states: One operator, working within the specialistecotourism market, described his dilemma when purchasing a new vehicle: Ideally we would have liked an 8-10 seater 4WD but found that to have any less than 13 seats we would have to pay 21% sales tax. For example, a specially made 4WD coach built by Noosa Coach and Body would cost $121 000 with 8-10 seats and only $100 000 with 13 seats! It is just a ridiculous situation, and the committee noted in its report: The Committee regards this situation as undesirable and has sought suggestions for implementing sales tax exemption on tourism vehicles where they are used to generate assessable income. Therefore, the committee came up with its very simple recommendation on exemption. In all areas of Australia these vehicles need to be specially licensed. In New South Wales people have to be specially licensed by the Roads and Traffic Authority as tourism operators and tourist bus operators. That licence should surely be the criterion for the provision of exemption from that 21 per cent sales tax, which is an added burden in establishing these businesses. Thursday, 30 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2653 The government keeps telling us that it is all about helping small business get established. We are pouring lots of public dollars into that section of our community trying to get small businesses going through such schemes as the NEAT program, yet we are hitting people who are trying to start up a small business in the ecotourism area with a 21 per cent sales tax on their major item of capital expenditure. It is ridiculous, so I urge the government to take on board that recommendation in the report. The other recommendation I want to discuss this morning is recommendation 21, which is in my mind a little bit soft: ... in conformity with the equity criterion of good taxation, the accommodation sector not be singled out for taxation. I think that is probably code for telling the government that in the 9 May budget there should be no bed tax. But the report does not come out clearly and say that, I suppose because the government members on the committee could not be so forthright as to come out and say, 'No bed tax.' . The prospect of a bed tax and the public discussion that has taken place with regard to the implementation of a bed tax in Australia in the budget in May have caused a great deal of heartburn and concern in the accommodation and tourism industries. It goes right to the heart of whether the government is really serious about developing an industry such as the tourism industry and assisting the accommodation industry to stay afloat and stay viable. These industries have been belted around the ears over the last number of years since 198687, when the government introduced the FBT. When it was introduced, the FBT collected $535 million. In 1994-95 the FBT is expected to raise $3.23 billion-$3,230,000,000. This represents an increase of 500 per cent in nine years, and that is coming out of the productive sectors of Australia. You can argue all you like about the equity of an FBT; we believe that it should be completely reviewed. We believe that there should be a tax on non-cash remuneration, but it has gone miles too far. It has absolutely gone miles too far. There is no question that it has cost jobs in this country. Coming back to the bed tax, the prospect of a bed tax has not been ruled out. There was an interesting article in the Financial Review on 28 March which was headed 'Tourism industry relieved as bed tax fails to figure'. It seems as if that might be just a little bit of a beat-up because it was not recommended in this report that a bed tax be introduced. The article reads: The tourism industry has grasped at a new parliamentary committee report for reassurance that a bed tax will not be introduced in next month's federal budget. A bed tax, which has the tourism industry running scared, was not recommended in the report from the House Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled Taxing relaxing. The committee found no evidence of unfair taxation measures for the tourism industry, but the chairman, Mr David Simmons, said that as a young industry it was 'disadvantaged by not having access to taxation benefits available to better established industries'. That is absolutely correct. But the report still does not dispel the possibility of this government introducing a bed tax in the budget in May. I have been contacted in my electorate by all the tourism operators, and particularly the Hotels Association, who are very concerned about the prospect of that bed tax. There has been plenty of debate about it and, if the government does go down that path, it will surely reap another backlash like it did in the Canberra by-election from that section MC 2654 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 March 1995 of the community. It is again talking about taxing incentive, taxing the development of a young industry and putting more impediments in the way of the prospect of future employment in what the Minister for Tourism always promotes as one of Australia's major growth industries. We want to keep it that way. I would like to urge the government again, as has been done on numerous occasions by members from this side of the House, not to consider a bed tax. It would be a very regressive tax. I also urge the government when dealing with this report to seriously consider recommendation No. 11, that a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and fourwheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under and that the Transport Ministers Council be consulted for its assistance with the implementation of this exemption. It is a very important recommendation for the continued development of this important industry throughout Australia. I certainly hope that the minister is a little bit quicker in dealing with this report than some of his colleagues have been in dealing with a number of other reports. In closing, I must say that a report that is very important to the tourism industry in Australia and, certainly, in my electorate is the Industry Commission's report on the petroleum industry, which the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Gear) has had for in excess of six months now and has not responded to. We think he has put it in the too-hard basket. It is one for which a lot of people throughout Australia, particularly in the tourism industry, are screaming out for a positive and constructive response from the government. I just hope that, when the Minister for Tourism is getting ready to respond to this report, he does it in a speedier fashion than that in which the Assistant Treasurer has dealt with the report from the Industry Commission on the petroleum industry. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned. the Committee that we have present in the gallery this morning the Speaker and the Clerk of the Parliament of Kiribati. On behalf of the Committee, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Native Title Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 March, on motion by Mr Quick: That the House take note of the paper. the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, and it is on the National Native Title Tribunal Annual Report 1993-94. The second report has been tabled more than 12 months after the tribunal began in January 1994. The tribunal has received well over 100 applications, as recorded in the annual report. During that time, seven non-claimant applications have been determined, yet in not one case has native title been declared. That has come as a tremendous blow to Aboriginal people, whose expectations were raised very much by the Native Title Act and the rhetoric that went with it. They had expectations of the awarding of native title over sections of unclaimed crown land. Yet, to date, after well over a year, there has actually been no determination in favour of Aboriginal people.",159,Representatives Main Committee

560,Mrs Gallus (Hindmarsh) (10.22 A.m.),"Today we are looking at the second report ofThursday, 30 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2655 In fact, the only determinations that have been made-seven in all-have been made in favour of non-claimants. In that situation, we might feel that perhaps it is because of the backlog of 100 or so applications in the system and that, when they go through, we may see some positive determinations on behalf of Aboriginal people. But, when we turn to the actual annual report, which this report is examining, we find this phrase by Justice French, and I think it is one that should disturb everybody. On page 3 of the annual report, Justice French says: It is too early at this stage to say that the Tribunal will succeed in its objective of finding resolutions to many or any of the claims lodged with it during the reporting period. Although that, at the first glance, seems to be a fairly benign statement, when one actually looks at what it means, Mr Justice French is saying that he is not optimistic that any of the claims before him will reach a resolution in favour of native title. That is very sobering and an absolute blow, as I certainly know, to the aspirations of Aboriginal people on the basis of what the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) and others have said on the advent of the Native Title Act. As to the hundred or so applications that are still in the pipeline, we have to expect that at least another hundred will come up this year. If, in that period there have only been seven determinations, and there are a hundred applications outstanding and an estimate of a hundred more to come up this year, there will be an enormous backlog sitting there, waiting. We will understand the difficulties in resolving those determinations if we look at the claim around Kununurra, where there are over 220 claimants and non-claimants who have to go through the mediation process. It would be a nightmare to try to mediate amongst 220 different claimants and non-claimants. The record shows that there is little hope for Aboriginal people in regard to native title and that the hopes that they did have are not being met. On other matters, although the process is moving slowly, the tribunal reports that it is happy with the way that it is running. As to the tribunal's threshold in regard to the claims process, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title found that the process is consistent with the Native Title Act. It was found that the threshold was at about the right level, that the claims are not automatically accepted, and that there has to be a clear case for those claims to be put on the agenda. The threshold is high enough to stop hopeless cases from being accepted and bogging down the tribunal's process, but also low enough to enable many claims to reach the mediation stage. I will move to the key amendment to the Native Title Act, suggested by Justice French in the tribunal's annual report. His proposed amendment: ... would enable an inquiry to be held, on a discretionary basis, at any point after acceptance of the application to determine whether there is a prima facie case and in that context to allow for important points of law which may affect the negotiation process to be referred to the Federal Court. The committee considers that this is a reasonable recommendation and would support such an amendment to the act. The committee also notes that in his report Justice French said that he did not want to make any more recommendations until there was some decision from the High Court as to the validity of the Native Title Act. That validity has now been determined and we would expect that Justice French will bring forward further suggested amendments to the act. MC 2656 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 March 1995 In conclusion, I believe that the workings of the Native Title Act are important for Aboriginal people and Aboriginal affairs, and I would like to express my disappointment that no member of the government is here to comment on this report. the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title. The report is a relatively short one and it deals with the so-caIled annual report for 1993-94 of the National Native Title Tribunal. In fact, that annual report was not an annual report at all, because the tribunal was only established on 1 January 1994. It is reaIly a report on six months of operation and even that six months of operation has to be seen in its proper context. From1 January until 2 May there was only an interim president: the president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the acting president of the native title tribunal. Until even beyond the reporting date, 30 June 1994, there was no registrar; there was only an a-ting registrar, who, again, was the registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As Justice French took office as president on 2 May, the report deals only with a period of about two months during which he was in office. The report was delivered in September; it is now relatively out of date in terms of the history of that body. Almost as soon as he took over, it became readily apparent to the president that there were difficulties under the legislation that needed addressing. These were picked up in the submissions made to the parliamentary joint committee, which has a statutory obligation to consider and report on the Native Title Tribunal annual reports. The committee invited submissions, took viva voce evidence and has prepared a written report. In that report the committee highlights two difficulties that arise in relation to the legislation. It is to be borne in mind, in considering those matters, that the tribunal does not deal with or determine in any finite way any application for native title which is opposed or, for that matter, any application by a non-claimant which is opposed. The principal functions of the tribunal are to act as a registry for claims-that involves a formal acceptance procedure-and then to act as mediator in relation to opposed claims. The first difficulty highlighted in the report is in relation to the actual acceptance of applications. In the first instance, under section 63 of the Native Title Act, the application is dealt with by the registrar. The registrar must accept it, unless he or she is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out. The provision relating to the prima facie status of the claim is in section 63(1 )(b) of the act. If the registrar is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out, it is then referred to a presidential member. However, the presidential member does not apply the same test. The presidential member is directed by the legislation to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out, so that, instead of the negative ruling that a prima facie claim could not be made out on the face of it, the presidential member proceeds to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out. That is a cause for confusion on the part of those involved in applications. The second issue dealt with by the committee relates to events after acceptance. If an application is unopposed, then, under section 70 of the act the tribunal may make a determination along the lines sought by the applicant, if it is satisfied that the applicant has made out a prima facie case for a determination in those terms. In addition, it must be determined that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances. If the application is opposed, it then goes to mediation.",162,Representa Tives Main Committee
561,Mr Williams (Tangney) (10.28 A.m.),"I also wish to comment on the second report ofThursday, 30 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2657 Before making a determination that the tribunal is satisfied as to the prima facie case, the tribunal must hold an inquiry. However, with regard to opposed applications it has no power to hold an inquiry before mediation. So it may be obliged to conduct mediation in relation to an application for which no prima facie case could be made out if the matter were examined. The president has' proposed an amendment to the parliamentary joint committee that would rectify the difficulties arising in that situation. My principal purpose in rising to speak on this matter is to highlight the situation that has arisen since the Native Title Act started to operate and, in particular, the difficulties that have been seen and commented upon by the president. Events have moved since 30 June 1994. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mrs Gallus) pointed out, there has been no finding of native title in any case. A number of cases have been referred by the tribunal to the Federal Court but the Federal Court has not completed the hearing of any single case as yet. At the time of the debate in the parliament concerning the Native Title Bill at the end of 1993, many speakers warned of the possible unworkability of the procedures that were set out in the act. They also warned the government that the time that the government anticipated it would take for the completion of applications for native title to be heard by the Federal Court and finally determined would be much longer than the government anticipated. That seems to have been borne out. We do not know how long it is going to take because as yet no claim has been completed. Since 30 June 1994 we have also had the resolution of the constitutional challenge to the Native Title Act and the constitutional challenge to the Western Australian legislation. That has not in itself highlighted any particular difficulties in relation to the procedures, although one provision of the Native Title Act was held to be unconstitutional. The principal event to occur since 30 June 1994 to which I want to draw attention is that Justice French has progressed in his understanding of the procedures under the act and has developed his thinking in relation to some of the problems that have arisen with the legislation. On 14 March 1995 he issued a discussion paper entitled Discussion paper on proposed changes to Native Title Act 1993. I urge the government to give very serious consideration to what is set out in that paper. Justice French has made a proposal which can only be regarded as fundamental in relation to the role of the tribunal. He has identified that there are significant tensions between the role of the tribunal as a decision maker, where it appears to be exercising judicial or quasi-judicial power on the one hand, and the role of the tribunal as mediator on the other hand, where it is seeking to have the parties come to an agreement rather than determining for parties what the rights and obligations are. In commenting on that tension, His Honour has pointed out that the designation of the tribunal as a tribunal and the involvement of serving judges gives rise to a belief that the tribunal is a species of court which can deliver binding and conclusive decisions about the existence of native title. That is not the case at all. He says that those two matters adulterate the tribunal's role as a mediator. He points out that the role of the tribunal as a decision maker gives rise to second order litigation in relation to tribunal decisions. What he is pointing out there is that, although the Native Title Act contemplates that the tribunal will act as a registry and as a mediator and that decisions will be made in relation to native title claims by the Federal Court, the role of the tribunal is itself subject to second order MC 2658 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 March 1995 litigation in the form of judicial review of its decisions in relation to its role as a registrar and its role as a mediator. He also draws attention in this paper to difficulties that arise out of the decision of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In that case the High Court held that the commission was purporting to exercise judicial power in breach of section 71 of the constitution in seeking to make enforcable determinations after hearings. This gives rise to questions as to whether the Native Title Tribunal also is acting in breach of the constitution in relation to some of the decisions which are committed to it. The judge also points out that the tribunal has the unenviable task perhaps of being seen only as a place where native title claims will fail, since it has no role in relation to the finding of native title, unless there is no opposition. The usual course of events for an application before the tribunal will be that it will fail because any application that survives the prima facie claim test, in the face of opposition and in the absence of any successful mediation, will be referred to the Federal Court. The issues that are raised by Justice French in his discussion paper are very important and very serious and warrant the urgent attention of the government. Justice French sets out a process which he believes would single out the Native Title Tribunal as a mediator and eliminate the confusion of its role in relation to native title applications where it has power to make decisions. In effect, his procedure would be a court based one in which the tribunal would not act as the registry but would simply act as a mediation service. He recommends that serving judges not be involved. On the face of it, what he proposes appears to me to have considerable merit. Any confusion of judicial roles on the one hand with administrative roles on the other hand is something that ought to be avoided not only because it is in breach of the constitution but also because when a body that is committed to making judicial determinations has other roles the parties perceive it in a different way. They do not t;lecessarily accept that it is a body which is committed to making determinations after a contested hearing. They see it as a body which is also involved in, in this case, mediation. In other cases, it may be conciliation or arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution mode. But it is important, I think, that public confidence in bodies which make judicial decisions be preserved to the utmost extent, and that involves keeping those bodies involved only in judicial decision making. I commend the discussion paper to the consideration of the government. Debate (on motion by Mr Gibson) adjourned.
