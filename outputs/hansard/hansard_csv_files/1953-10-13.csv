The only information which comes to the Government from the court is the information which is published in the court's decisions.

The Minister replied that he would bring my question to the notice of the Minister for Shipping and Transport, and that he would see tiiat I was furnished with ran answer. As I liave not yet received the information for' which I asked, will the Minister take up the matter with his colleagues so that I may receive a reply without further delay? reply.

Health state whether, in his opinion, any useful recommendations were contained in the report of the American health insurance experts who were brought to Australia some months ago? If so, has the right honourable gentleman taken any steps to give effect to them, particularly to those which relate to the placing of medical benefit organizations on a more sound and economical administrative basis and of ensuring that control of the organizations and any profits that result from their operations will remain with the members of the organization?""",11,Setup

THE PARLIAMENT. whether you have noted the fact that the Prime Minister made a very important, and somewhat lengthy,, statement in answer to a question that was asked him early this afternoon about Australian uranium. Is it not correct that a statement such as that, particularly one of such importance as the Prime Minister made, should, be made after question time has passed, instead of being allowed to consume time during question, time? The making of such a statement after question time would permit an honourable member on this sideof the House to move a motion for the printing of the paper and enable perhaps another honourable member on the other side of the House to make a further statement by leave. honourable gentleman that I am fully aware of what is taking place in the House. There is only one standing order which deals with the answering of questions. It simply saysthat a question that has been fully answered may not be renewed.

As the Minister for Territories has succeeded, with the cooperation of the Australian National University, in securing a suitable home in Canberra for himself and his family at a rental of £8 a week, will he now be expected to refund the balance of the £1,000 allowance, which is £584, to the Commonwealth Treasury? all, even my colleague, the Minister for Territories, must live. I know that the honourable member for East Sydney does not recognize that necessity, but I certainly do. ter yet received a communication from the Tasmanian Premier regarding his request for approval to be given for several Dutch cargo vessels of from 400 tons to 4,000 tons to operate on the Tasmania-New Zealand and Tasmaniamainland trade routes?

Does this mean that completely new plans, specifications and engineering drawings must be made ? Will the Minister also say by what period this change has delayed the completion of the swimming pool, and by what sum it has added to the estimated cost? Could this delay and expense have been avoided? Will the Minister prepare for publication a. full statement on the matter? noticed in the Canberra Times to-day a statement that something happened at the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council regarding the swimming pool, and I personally made inquiries about what had happened to the plan. I found that, for some reason or other, the plan is being carried out piecemeal. In other words, separate contracts have been let for the pouring of cement or the I ask the Prime concrete, in one instance,and for the tiling work in another instance. I do not regard such a system as being either economic or efficient.

Are the immigrants to be accommodated in hostels conducted by Commonwealth Hostels Limited and, if so, are they to be notified in writing or printing of the full conditions under which they will come to this country, in order that we shall not have a repetition of claims by immigrants that the conditions that they found on arrival here were different from those that were notified to them before they came? conception in the honourable member's mind, to judge from his reference to an additional number of British immigrants who are to come to Australia. What we are seeking to do is to attract to this country British immigrants additional to those who have already decided to come to Australia and those for whom we have already planned. As honourable members know, we have made immigration from the TJnited Kingdom a top priority in our planning. Because there has been some diminution in nominations in Australia for British immigrants, in order to keep up the numbers we have introduced this new development under which people will be nominated, in effect, by the Australian Government, much as they were previously nominated under the Commonwealth nomination scheme. We are not restricting the nominations to particular categories of tradesmen as was done previously. We hope in this way to provide opportunities for some very desirable people who have been most anxious to settle here but who have, up to the present, lacked suitable nominees in this country. It is intended, in the first instance, that they will be housed in the hostels operated by Commonwealth Hostels Limited, but I have given full instructions, which I am satisfied will be carried out, that complete information will be given to them before they embark regarding the conditions that apply in the hostels, the rates of tariff, and the opporGovernment? If he has not yet reached tunities that will develop from them. More than 90,000 immigrants have passed through these hostels, the great majority of them having become successfully established in community life.

36,Mr Menzies,"I think, broadly,not prove to -be the right answer, I shall correct it in my Hansard proof. Cameron) -Last Eriday, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) complained about the ventilation in the chamber and. the operation of the air conditioning plant. I have in my hand a report from, the Ohief Engineer on the -matter. I shall read only a brief passage from it in reply to the question asked by the honourable member. It is as follows:Further to my reports dated 15th January, 18th August, and 16th September, 1953, with regard to the above installation I wish to advise that to date no action has been taken by the Contractors to complete the work or to rectify faulty workmanship to my satisfaction. The contract was let on 20th October, 1947, to Messrs. Bobt. Hackett& Co. Pty. Ltd. of Sydney for the installation at a Contract Price of £30,127 and to date the amount paid on the Contract is £33,277 pins extra work by Department of Works, making a total cost of £40,574. The principal of the firm of Eobert Plackett& Co. has died since the contract was let and I am led to believe that the Executors of the Estate have instructed the local firm of F. M. Higgins Pty. Ltd. to finalize the Contract. I have had at least three visits from Mr munity. The great majority of thb Higgins who has promised on each occasion to have the work completed but these promises have not been fulfilled. 1. think, from the viewpoint of the House, that the operation of this contract has been most unsatisfactory, and that if some action can be taken by the Minister for Works to bring the matter to finality, so much the better. I may add, for the information of the honourable member for Reid, that his complaints last Eriday were quite unfounded, because it so happened that the air-conditioning plant was not in operation on that day. I have carefully read the report of his statement, and I refer particularly to his description of this chamber as a. veritable death-trap, and to his statement about the number of honourable members who have died recently, and so forth. I merely tell him that if he feels that theTe is any undue risk here, there is an excellent remedy. Every one of us is a volunteer, amd resignation from this House is permitted. (Hon. Archie Debate resumed from the 9th October {vide page 1265), on motion by SIT .ABTHUE EADDENThat the bill he now read a second time. my time has almost expired, I shall not attempt to repeat the arguments that 1 advanced against the Government's taxation policy last Friday. I emphasize that the hills we are considering do not satisfy the Opposition, but we are thankful for small mercies. We accept the benefits, if they may be so described, but we assert that they are most inadequate, and do not represent the fulfilment of the Government's pre-election promises to reduce the income tax and social services contribution. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, made a scathing attack on the Government's taxation proposals and has shown clearly in this debate that the Treasurer and his colleagues have put it over the workers. The remissions of tax really benefit only the wealthy sections of the compeople will derive only a negligible amount of benefit from these reductions. I shall compare briefly the benefits that will be received by the basic wage earner with those that will be received by the wealthy and influential sections of the people. The basic wage is now slightly in excess of £600 a year. A basic wage earner without dependants will receive a tax .reduction of Is. 6d. a week, or 2Jd. a day. A man with a dependent wife will receive a benefit of £5 12s. a year or, in terms we all understand, 3id. a day. a 3£d. stamp with it. honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) illustrates the point that I am making that the Government is not fulfilling its pre-election promise to reduce the income tax and social services-contribution.

A man ""with a dependent wife and five children, -which is a great family unit in any community, will receive the magnificent sum of 4'd. a. day. Yet the Government claims that it is fulfilling its pre-election premise to reduce the income tax and social services contribution. The people will continue to be taxed directly and indirectly in a manner -unparalleled iu OUT history. A. single man in receipt of an income of £5,000 a year will receive a tax remission of £4 5s. a week. Let honourable members compare that reduction with the benefit of a -Jd. a day accorded to a man with a wife and five children by this Government that describes itself as .a tax-reducing government, f have stated these facts in order that thc people will not be misled into believing that the Government has fulfilled its promises. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) returned from one of his many jaunts to the Isle of Capri, or somewhere else, and told the populace that war might occur within twelve or eighteen months. Similar warnings were given by other members of the Government, which used the threat of Avar as an excuse for an immediate and substantial increase of tax rates. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) was one of the Ministers who said that taxes had to be increased so that we could prepare for war. He said that war might occur within eighteen months or two years. The more unpopular the Government became, the closer it brought the date of war. In other words, it kept postponing the date of the possible conflict in order that it could continue as long as possible to use this excuse for the repudiation of its election pledges. Notwithstanding the reductions we are now considering, Ministers must explain to this Parliament and to the people why over £270,000,000 more will, be collected in. tax revenue this year than was being collected when i i was elected to office in 1949. The truth is that this legislation does not provide for genuine tax reductions. Instead, it provides merely for a partial rebate of huge additional imposts that were levied by tliis Government after it came into office. The Government still collects £f7-0,'OO©,'OOQ a year more than it should collect trom the people if it wishes to qualify as a tax-reducing government. 1 do not wish to discuss this issue at length. (JOYERN M BTJT SUPT'ORTERS Hear, hear! welcome that Government supporters give to my announcement that I am about to conclude a speech Government supporters dislike more than anything else the exposure of the sins of omission and commission of this Administration to the Australian electors from this Parliament. No government in our time has been more vulnerable than the present Government to the charge that it has completely repudiated the promises that it made to the electors on the subject of taxation. The real test that determines whether the Government has, in fact, reduced taxation since it has been in office is a comparison of the amount of tax collections to-day with the amount in. 1949. The test shows that approximately £300,000,000 more is being tahen from pay envelopes to-day than was so deducted when the Government was elected to office.. So well is the Government paying off its wealthy supporters that, under the present budget, va.°t concessions are being granted to them at the expense of men and women on low incomes with as many as five^ children. Basic wage earners and others in the low income groups are called upon to make a much greater contribution to revenup b-r way of direct tax than are people in a. much more favorable position, who are leniently treated by the Government. I shall conclude on that note. I know that the Government wishes to curtail the debate because it wants to dodge the criticism to which it has been subjected on this important issue. I hope that I have succeeded in driving home to the",15,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 2 1953 Second Reading

49,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [3.26],"I first measures the Government had to takeand 1949. In those days, one had to take a sight on them with a tree or some other object to discover whether thcy were moving. But the other day I watched with great interest some work near the Hotel Kurrajong, and J. saw men working with a zest that we did not see while the Labour party was in power. People are working harder. Therefore, production has risen .and incomes have increased. The national economy is on an even keel and the -Government has been able to reduce taxes -substantially. This Government, since it came' into office, has presented four budgets-no t three, as the Opposition would have the people believe. Under the first of those budgets, taxes were reduced slightly. Under the second, income tax was increased by 10 per cent. Under the third, that increase was eliminated. Under the budget for this year, the average reduction of income tax will be 12^per cent. The Labour party says that that reduction will just offset the 10 per cent, increase that was imposed previously. Honourable members opposite would like the people to forget that the 10 per cent, increase was eliminated under the budget of last year. Income tax last year was slightly lower than it was in 1949, and now it is being reduced by another 12$ per cent. The Opposition wants the people to forget the budget of last year and the tax concessions that were given to the Australian people then. When dealing with taxation, members of the Opposition refer to total tax collection, but . when they deal with pensions they refer to payments made to individuals, not fo total expenditure on pensions. Surely they should compare total tax collections with, total expenditure on penincome tax. Honourable members opposite sions or other social services benefits. In have pointed out that a man on £2,000 1949, total expenditure on war pensions was £22,000,000, and in this year it will be £39.000,000. In 1949, total expenditure on social services benefits was £93.000.000, and in this year it will be £184,000,000. able member is getting right outside the scone of the bills before the House, which deal with assessment of taxes and the rates It is rot to succest that the very small to be charged. tions this year will be very little greater than last year, but valuable concessions have been given to individual taxpayers. Let me refer again to the remarks made by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly). I believe, Mr Speaker, that in so doing I shall obey your ruling. It would be almost impossible to introduce new matter into thc debate at this stage, but I assume it is permissible to refute arguments already presented. The honourable member for Grayndler dealt with the income tax paid by a man with £600 a year. In 1949-50, under the Chifley Government, a man without dependants and with an income of £600 a year paid £51 13s. income tax. This year he will pay £43 19s a definite reduction. This Government has been very mindful of the interests of taxpayers with dependants. It proposes to increase the allowable deductions for income tax purposes in respect of children and a dependent wife. In 1949-50, a man on £600 a year, with a dependent wife and two children, paid £26 5s. income tax, but this year he will pay only £13 ls. Some honourable members opposite have complained beecause the income tax paid by some taxpayers wil] be reduced by only £2 or £3 a year. If we reduced the income tax of such persons to a greater degree, the Government would have to pay money to them.. A taxpayer on £400 a year with a wife and two children will pay £1 2s. income tax this year, compared with £2 8s. last year. His income tax could not be reduced by more than another £1 2s. a year. As a result of child endowment payments and other social services benefits, he is receiving much more from the Government than he is paying in a year will_ enjoy the benefit of a reduction of his income tax by £53 18s. a year, whilst other taxpayers will have a reduction of only £2 or £3. As I have already explained, if a man is paying only £1 2s. a year in income tax, the greatest amount by which his tax could be reduced is £1 2s. A man on £2.000 a year paid £375 17s. income tax last year, and this year he will pav £321 19s. income tax paid by a man on a very low",17,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 2 1953 Second Reading

51,Mr Turnbull,"Tota l tax collecincome could, be reduced to tbe same degree as that of a man on a high income.. I should not have referred to that subject but for the fact that members of the Opposition do not appear to appreciate the true position. We have reached a stage of our history when the Government can make tax reductions. Perhaps the House will remember that when members of the. Opposition asked last year or the year before why the Government had not reduced taxes, I pointed out that people who went to a football match did not expect their team to win in the first quarter of the match, and that people who went to a race meeting did not expect their horse to win in the first furlong of the race. If a horse goes; to the front too early, it often fades out near the winning post. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) stated that taxes would be reduced as national production and income rose. The people realize that that promise has been fulfilled. last week or so, I have listened to members of the Government parties defending the budget. Having listened to them, I am reminded of the answer to the old saw that figures cannot lie. Unfortunately, honourable members opposite have argued as though the continual depreciation of the purchasing power of the Australian £1, which has been a feature of the reign of this Government, had not taken place. T do not know whether they believe they can get away with an argument of that type,, but, if they do harbour that illusion, let me assure them that the Australian people are not stupid enough to be taken in by it. The Australian people have bad direct personal experience of the continual decline of the purchasing power of the £1.. Because they have had that experiencej they will not accept the contention of members of the Government' parties fhat income tax has been reduced considerably because a man on £600 a year paid so much income tax in 1949 and a man on a similar income will pay less income tax this year. The people know that a man who was earning £600 a. year in. 1949 was receiving many hundreds of pounds more than the basic wage, and, in terms of real money, was getting much more than a man who earns £600 a year at the present time; It is completely misleading to attempt to compare the financial state of a man who earned £600 a year in 1949 with that of a man earning £600 a year to-day. The only way by which an adequate comparison can be made of the relative severity of taxation rates in 1949 and the present time, is to reduce the figures, to terms of real money. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) knows that since this Government has been in office, the basic wage, as a result of the continuing inflation, has increased from £6 17s. to about £12. In fact, the £1 to-day is equivalent to 12s. at approximately the beginning of 1950. A consideration of that kind is the only measuring stick by which a comparison can he made of the tax rates as they were at the end of 1949 and as they are now. By comparing the rates in 1950 with the rates, to-day, when a. £1 is worth 12s., honourable members will readily notice that in terms, of real money wage-earners are paying more in tax now than they were paying in 1950, and even after the reductions contemplated in the current budget have been made, they will still be in that position. Beducing the figures quoted by the honourable member for Mallee to their true percentage of real money, and considering that each £1 that he mentioned is now worth only 12s., after it has been operated upon by the Menzies Government, honourable members will see that to-day the average wage-earner is paying more in taxes than he paid before this Government assumed office. That is despite all the promises made in 1949 that the Government would reduce taxes, not in 1953, but immediately after it assumed office. If the Government parties harbour a belief that they have obtained some electoral support because of the tremendous burst of propaganda that preceded this budget, and because of their attempts to convince the people since its presentation that it will benefit them, they will be sadly disillusioned. They have only to refer to the results of a. recent gallup poll to perceive quite clearly that the people of Australia have not been deceived, by the Government propaganda, or by its so called taxation reductions.

It is a deliberate class able member for Watson( Mr .Curtin) must not interject. wish to bring before the attention of honourable members is the educational allowance, about which such a great fuss has been made by the Government. 3 have been amazed to discover that this Government has been prepared to make such a blatant provision for an allowance of a nature which will apply to those only on the higher incomes, and which will give no benefit to those on lower incomes. According to communications that I have had from the Commissioner of Taxation, die Government has now arranged to allow deductions of taxation in respect of school .uniforms if children are required to wear them at their -schools. The vast majority of the .children of this country do not go to schools which require that the pupils should wear special unito send them. Every high school throughout Australia requires its children to wea^ uniforms. Moreover, they are free schools. able member for Yarra has the floor. children to the Geelong Grammar School, or some other school in the Commonwealth, which I may call higher class for the purposes of description, he can claim the uniform allowance, because the numbers, I cannot, but uniforms are required to be worn by the pupils of thbse schools. Bnt in the vast majority of schools in my electorate, and in the electorates of a majority of honovable members, pupils are not required to wear school uniforms. People in the .industrial suburbs, who receive lower incomes, and who send their children to private schools, are required to pay for their children's education, but will not be able to take advantage of this concession because those schools, knowing that the parents cannot supply uniforms, do nojt insist upon the children wearing them. This taxation concession will mean nothing to the vast majority of the Australian people, and the Government concession to the persons who support the Government parties, and is of little use to the great majority of the Australian taxpayers. Moreover, if the graduated scale of taxation is considered, it is immediately noticed that the higher fhe income the greater will be the concessional allowance. A wealthy squatter who is paying taxes at the rate of 15s. in the f l will receive a reduction of ""75 multiplied by 15s.. whereas a man on a lower income who is paying, say, 3s. in the £1, will get a concession, of 75 multiplied by only 3s. Tbe concession is plainly designed to benefit those who have the most money.

65,Mr Keon,"If a man is sending hisleast have paid lip service to the principle that the people receiving ordinary incomes, who are the people who, by and large, have the most children in their families, should get some relief. This concession will apply only to a limited group of people, and to those who are least deserving of it. If the Government expects gratitude from the community and from those who send their children to private schools, then it is going to be seriously disillusioned; because the vast majority of the people, apart from those who send their children to tony colleges, will receive no benefit from this concession at all. It would be far too pessimistic for me to ask this Government to give consideration to my remarks in the future, and to direct more taxation benefits to the lower wage earners, because this is undoubtedly the last budget that the Government will ever bring down. However, I hope that the next Labour government, which will assume office about May of next year, will bear in mind the fact that taxation relief of this nature should be given to those who require it the most-that is the people receiving the lower incomes. I invite honourable members to contrast the . tender solicitude of the Government for those who are able to afford to send their children to the betterin 1951-52. These are the companies class schools and pay for their very nice uniforms and all the rest of it, with its attitude to the man on the basic wage. T also invite honourable members to reduce the figures in the schedule to terms of real money and then contrast the attitude of the Government to the worker with its attitude to those who have more of this world's goods and who support the parties which constitute the Oovernment. An examination of the reductions proposed in respect of company taxation will reveal the interests and influences that dominate the parties on the other side of the House. Every honourable member knows the terrific battle that the ordinary family man has to make both ends meet. If anybody needed relief and was entitled to it, it was the married man with a number of children. The family man has to wage a continual Mr Keon. battle from one' week's end to another to provide food, clothing and shelter for himself and his family. While the Government was contemplating the provision of this much-needed relief one would have expected that its first thought would have been of the family man and his requirements because, as honourable members on the other side of the House have already admitted, he is the person who most needs the relief and is most entitled to it. Ashas already been pointed out during tliis debate, those who stand to gain most from this legislation are people who haveshares in the big companies, and the big companies themselves. We have been told by Government spokesmen that the burden on .industry had to be lightened, that company tax was so oppressive that they were unable to carry on, and that production suffered because so much of their income was taken from them. Let us have a. look at to-day's pressin order to ascertain the position of some of the companies to which hundreds of thousands of pounds of relief has been given. In to-day's issue of the Daily Telegraph it is reported that in 1952-53. Australian Consolidated Industries Limited and its subsidiaries made a record profit of £991,906, or £100,000 more than which the Government tells us need relief running into millions of pounds. These are the companies, we are told, which cannot go ahead with plans for expansion, and could not possibly have gone ahead with production at full pressure unless they received the concessions that are about to be given to them. The balance-sheet of one of the largest Australian combines, Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, shows that last year, despite what the Government calls the onerous burden of company tax that was levied upon it, the company was still able to increase its profit by more than £100,000. I was interested to read a report which relates to Elder Smith and Company Limited, woolbrokers and merchants, a company in which members of the Government have interests. The report takes the form of an imaginary conversation between a client and his broker in relation to the company in which the client sums up the company's position in this wayIf you reckon last year's tax represented interjecting, may say about this mat9s. in the £1 on true profit, and if you reduce ter, but for the industrial laws of this the tax to the current 7s. in the £1, then country, most of the members of the last year's profit would be something like 40 Australian Country party would pay per cent, on capital. These are the companies who are to he keep.

As I have shown, the Australian peopl° had it granted relief last year one of them made a profit of to the basic-wage earner and the worker approximately 40 per cent, on capital, who earns a small margin above the even after having paid tax at the rate basic wage. of 9s. in the £1, and another was able, after paying a similar tax, to increase figures which the Government has cited its profit by more than £100,000. These in support of these bills. The first are the companies which, we were told, point I make is that the reductions had to be granted relief if production outlined must be considered in terms was to be increased. The Government's of real purchasing power. We must story is fantastic. If we examine the remember that on the basis of the C series financial columns of the daily press we index figure during the three years iu shall find that, in almost every instance,which this Government has been in office, despite the payment of tax at the rate the value of the £1, by comparison with of 9s. in the £1, large companies have its value in 1949, or in the early months been able to increase their profits. In the of 1950, has fallen to 12s. Thus, the face of the vastly increased profits earned position of the Australian taxpayer, and by the companies I have mentioned, particularly that of the small income this Government proposes to grant to earner., is now very much worse than it companies approximately £30,000,000 in was in 1949. The Australian people have further relief. I ask the Minister for not been deceived by this juggling of Labour and National Service( Mr Holt), figures by the Treasurer and members of who is temporarily in charge of the the Liberal and Australian Country House, whether he would not agree that, parties, and when they are called upon instead of relief being given to companies, to pass judgment on the tax reductions it should have been given to the family outlined in this legislation, they will man in receipt of a wage at or near the do so in the manner so convincingly basic wage, who is still required to pay indemonstrated by them in a public opinion come tax by this Government.

Labouiand National Service and Ministeifor Immigration) measures we are discussing are designed to give effect to a major aspect of the Government's tax. relief programme as outlined in the budget speech of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) on. the Oth September. The budget forecast tax relief that will, amount to more than 1118,400,000', a proposal that one would have thought would have been received with commendation and satisfaction by all sections of the community. However; there is one persistent and discordant element which is spoiling the otherwise general appreciation that has been given to this programme by the community. Mr ""WABD -Public opinion. it was public opinion, because we find that the trade unions, in placing arguments before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in. the hours audi wages case, gave glowing accounts of the economic situation of Ihe country. We find also that the New South Wales Labour Premier and Colonial Treasurer, when he brought down that State's budget, endorsed the Government's view, which is apparently also the view of the trade unions, about the buoyant state of the economy, the high degree of employment, and the promise of real tax relief. Yet on the other side of this chamber we have, a team of professional sob sisters. They have come here month in and month out since the introduction of what they are pleased to call the horror budget of 1951. and have turned tliis National Parliament into a sort of private wailing wall before which they daily beat their breasts and shed crocodile tears over the state of thc poor workers of this country, in an endeavour to convert the nation to utter and unparalleled gloom. Unfortunately for them, the average Australian realizes that he has never been better off than he is now.. It is on the practical basis of fche amount of prosperity that the average citizen is able to enjoy in the way of community amenities and private conditions that I am prepared to analyse thesemeasures.' I shall take the test suggested by the honourable membei: fiw Yarra( Mr Ivconi)'. He asked whether there had no* 1 1 been, so serioes a depreciation, of the [4.1]' The piirchasing value of the£1 that: the taxpayers who ostensibly derive tax relief from the Government's programme will obtain no real relief. T agree entirely with him that the real test of. the success of a governments economic policy is the prosperity and the material benefit's that the people enjoy as a result of that policy. I think, before I passon to other aspects of the measure, that it would be of interest to the House to have before it, a. comparison of the prosperity enjoyed by the average citizen,, including thefamily man and the other elements in the. community to whom the honourable member for Yarra has referred,, during the term of office, of the Ohifley Labour Government, of which the honourable member was a supporter, and during this Government's administration. For the purposes of comparison I shall compare the last three f u l l financial years under Labour administration with the last three f u l l financial years under this Government. The honourable member expressed great solicitude, which I entirely sharewith him although our reactions may not be the. same, for the family man. If there is one section of the community which will benefit materially as the result of the Government's programme it is the section with, family responsibilities. A comparison of statistics relating to motor vehicle registrations, the manufacture of refrigerators, and the provision of houses in the last three f u l l financial years of the Labour Government with the last three full financial years of this Government will indicate how the family man has fared under the two governments* I shall even be able to give the House a comparison in relation to a commodity which may interest the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) because I recall that during the budget debate he interjected and asked, ""What about",22,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill No 2 1953 Second Reading

The scope of debate, on these bills, however, is not wide enough to permit another speech such as is made during the debate on the budget, and I ask the Minister for labour and National Service( Mr Holt) to confine his remarks more strictly to the bills. M.r. Deputy Speaker, and I do not intend taking. However, the honourable member for Yarra attacked the Government's tax proposals on the ground that depreciation of tlie purchasing power of the £1 had reached a point at which there would be no worthwhile relief to taxpayers under the measures.

76,Mr Holt,"I appreciate the point,of money that a Labour party government would find necessary to carry out the undertakings in relation to social services that the Leader of the Opposition indicated in his speech on the budget. I have found that social services commitments in which he involved his party would cost an additional amount of aboiit £191,000,000 a year. An amount of about £71,000,000 would be necessary to meet additional expenditure on items of social services on which, he said, expendiwould never have subjected this nation ture should be increased. Increasing the pension rate to £4 a week, which he said should be the minimum standard, and abolishing the means test, would cost another £120,000,000. If effect were given to the Labour party's statements in relation to social services it would cost £191,000,000 a year. But the right honourable gentleman went a good deal further than that. He talked about the special initial depreciation allowance which, he said, should be restored. The restoration of that concession would cost another £21,000,000 a year, which would make the increased liability £211,000,000 a year. He then claimed that the Government bad made inadequate provision for the States. The programme which the States submitted to the Treasury this year was £73,000,000 above the amount actually allocated. I have never heard the Leader of the Opposition criticize the claims that the States made. On the contrary, he has argued that they are necessary for the development of this country. When he says that more should be done for the States it is reasonable to assume that he had in mind bringing the allocation of the States at least to the level of the original requests made by them. To do so would cost another £73,000,000. Therefore the Leader of the Opposition has condoned additional financial commitments that would cost another £294,000,000 a year. 'Having done so, he then claimed that our proposed tax relief of £118,400,000 a year was too little. If prospect of an alternative administration, led Iby the Leader of the Opposition, who can come before this Parliament with proposals that are so Mr Holt. utterly irresponsible and fantastic, the depreciation of the purchasing power of the £1 under this Government, about which the honourable member for Yarra has spoken, will be only a fleabite compared with the state of the £1 by the time the right honourable gentleman is finished with it. The Leader of the Oonosition has always referred sneeringly to the horror budget of 1951, as he calls it, and has made it clear that had he been Prime Minister his government to the conditions prescribed by that budget. Yet it is because of the very fact that the Treasurer, supported to a man by the Government, was prepared to introduce, proposals to restore stability, that not only is Australia now in a state of solid prosperity unequalled in its the couutry an additional history, but the Government is also able to offer the substantial tax relief provided for in the measures before us. A l though I have no doubt that the Treasurer takes a great deal of satisfaction in the fact that the state of the economy permits the introduction of these measures at present, he and his colleagues in the Cabinet will always be proud of the fact that it was the 1951 budget that really placed the economy of this country in the stable position in which it should be. We shall hold it there as long as this Government is in office. On the other hand, what sort of stability would there be in financial affairs under a government, led by the present Leader of the Opposition, trying to carry out a programme involving additional expenditure of £284,000,000 while giving much greater relief than that provided in this budget? Having regard to the commitments that have been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, it might be profitable to ask the Australian Labour party how it would finance its proposals. Although the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues have not been lacking in words to tell the people how much relief they would give to the pensioners, the family men and those who have been described by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) as "" the poor unfortunate wage plugs"", the people have to face the they have not indicated so far how those measures are to be financed.

82,Mr Holt,"Not only one Minister.believe that theve is support for 'the belief that a capital levy is contemplated by the Opposition. That is indicated hy the attitude of the Opposition and the Labour party generally to the land tax. This Government removed the land tax because it is oue form of capital levy but as soon as it did so, the State Labour governments stepped into the field and reimposed it. for Burke( Mr Peters) supports the rciinposition of the land tax. I have no doubt that he would be in favour also of a capital levy to finance some of those ambitious programmes -that the Leader of the Opposition has outlined to the Parliament. I .shall mot have the time to deal fully with all these matters, but there is another of which mention should be made in passing as an indication of the kind of frantic finance that can be expected from the Labour party if it is returned to office. I refer in particular to the measures that are now imder consideration in Victoria under which the State Government hopes to raise £1,500,000 by attracting ,to itself the lottery formerly conducted in Tasmania by Tattersall's. The proposition should command some attention from this Parliament as an indication iof the Labour party's approach to the problems of finance, and to expose fche humbug that is behind the Opposition's plans to help "" the unfortunate wage plug "" to whom the honourable member for Yarra has referred. In speaking of this matter, the honourable member could, not have selected a worse example than when he criticized a well-known company wihich he attacked because he said it had made a profit of 40 per cent, on its capital. In the case of Tattersall's consultation, the Victorian Government does not propose to make the subscriber to the lottery pay 40 per cent, on capital. It will go much farther. The subscriber to Tattersall's will pay 40 per cent, on turnover. There is not a private organization in the history of Australia that could point to such a profit. But the Victorian Government has stated that of the total subscriptions that are paid for tickets in the proposed lottery, 31 per cent, will go to the State Government and 9 per cent, to Tattersall's. By the beneficient actions of the Labour Government of Victoria, Tattersall's is to be given a. private monopoly for a period of at least ten years so that, in partnership, thu Government and Tattersall's can plunder ""the unfortunate wage plugs"" to the extent of 40 per cent, of turnover. speakers who follow the Minister for immigration ( Mr Holt) be entitled to discuss Tattersall's consultation and the proposed percentage return to the State Government of Victoria? If not, I. suggest that the Minister is out of order. The Minister's remarks have been quite relevant to tlie question of collection of taxes. sure, honourable members obviously are entitled to analyse the methods that might be adopted by a Labour government to raise finances for the remarkable proposals that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The persons who would subscribe to Tattersall's consultations are principally those on the lower wage levels. In that way, they hope to get a fortuitous return for the outlay of a small sum of money, but the Labour Government that is in office in Victoria plans to take for itself and Tattersall's, £4 in every £10 that they subscribe to the lottery for a period of at least ten years. Honourable members have already recalled in this debate, that when the Chifley Government was in office, a man with a wife and two children and receiving an income of £600 a year paid £26 a year in income tax. An income of £600 was the equivalent of the basic wage to-day. Under the present Government's taxation proposals, the basic wage-earner on that level of income will pay £13. That is equal to 5s. a week over a year. If a basic wage earner decided to invest in Tattersall's the 5s. a week that he saved by way of income tax concessions, more than £5 of the £33 that he subscribed to the lottery in a year would be taken from him by the Victorian Government in taxation. That is .the Labour party's attitude to the wage earner. The honourable member for Yarra suggested that taxation should be lifted from the basic wage-earner altogether. He said",26,Abthub Fabden Aide D By The To Continue For Long On The Line I Am

87,Mr Holt,"Whil e debating this meatliat ,a basic w.age-eanier -with, :a wife and two children had .to pay £13 a ,year .in income .tax. Tbat is only part of tlie story. He ,did not remind honourable membeus .that a taxpayer in '.that .category would r.eceiye from .child endowment alone £89 a year. L i effect, a hasic wage-earner with a wife And .tw.o children who contributes £13 in taxation gains to the .extent of £2(6 from the welfare proposals of this Oovernment. Time will not permit mc to reply in detail .to other arguments that have been advanced by Opposition members, but I shall say that they ar.e all equally specious. The Leader of the Opposition said that little money was available for the State governments because of the actions of this Government. He claimed that as a result, employment was down and economic conditions were depressed. I invite honourable members to compare the position in the three years preceding 1950 under a Labour government with the succeeding three .years during which this Government has heen in office. Tax reimbursements under the Labour Government totalled £169,200,000. Under this Government they have totalled £398,400,000. Under its works programme, the Labour Government and this Government has provided -£6:15,000j000. The Government has been watching the economy carefully and has maintained the purchasing power of money. As a result, Australia is enjoying a condition of full employment and stable prosperity and has every prospect of sound development. have 'listened with the greatest confusion to the Minister for Labour and National Service .( Mr Holt), who spun stories of millions paid here and millions paid there., ,and of benefits that the 1953-54 budget would confer upon everybody, especially the small man and ithe family man. I.shall not find it necessary to refer to many figures in order to expose the fallacy of the right honourable .gentleman's boasts. I pay tribute to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur .Fadden) who, in private life, is an accountant. Apparently he is .a most astute accountant, and he must have the assistance of financial wizards when he prepares tax measures. He and .his Advisors a.re so skilled that /jr -[44 1 he as able to pretend to .give something to every one .in the community when, in reality, .he is .depreciating the position of .a large section of the community in the interest of the wealthy .and privileged section that he represents. A few figures only need be cited in order to make thc facts clear .to ithe ordinary man. A person whose nominal income last year was £1^000 had £906 left after the payment .of income tax, if he had a wife and dependent child. This year he will jha.ve £925 left .after the payment of tax. In other words, the effect of the measure now before the House will be to increase his actual income by .approximately 3 per cent. Persons whose nominal incomes are less than £1,000 a year will benefit by less than 3 per cent. But a person whose nominal income is £5,000 a year will gain an advantage of 6 per .cent. A taxpayer whose nominal income is £1.5,000 a year received approximately £5,S04 last year after the payment of ijieome tax. This year, he wiB receive £6,709, whicli represents an increase of £90S, or about £18 a week. In other words, liis net income this year will be 17 per cent, higher than it was last year. provided £224,000,000 The Government has a .clever method of concealing the facts in order to deceive the people. The ;effect of its hudget .proposals tnis year wil] not be to give nothing to the man on the basic wage ' .£18 a year ; to the man whose income is less than £1,000, and £18 .a week to the man -whose income is £15,000. It says, in answer to our complaints, "" There is nothing wrong with our proposals because the tax schedules show that the tax on .an income of £800 a year will be reduced by 22 per .cent, whereas ihe tax on ,an income of £15,000 a year will .be reduced hy only 9 percent."" That, certainly, is stated on 'the tax 'schedules. However, in Teality, the man on the higher income will be granted a 1.7 per cent, increase of his net annual income whilst a. man receiving less than £1,000 a year will receive a 3 per cent, increase -of his net income or less. In fact, the Treasurer proposes to .take something away from .one section of the community while he pretends to be igiving something to it. The productivity of the community .will not increase as a result of the right honourable gentleman's manipulation of taxes. The",27,Abthub Fabden Aide D By The To Continue For Long On The Line I Am
88,Mr Peters (Burke) :[4.30],"Iconsumable commodities available for purchase will not become more numerous. If we assume, for the purpose of illustration, that 50 units of consumer goods were purchased during 1952-53 by the man with less than £1,000 a year, and that 50 units were purchased during the same period by the man with more than £1,000 a year, the result of this tax measure will be that, during the current year, the man on the lower income will be able to purchase slightly less than 53 units whereas the man on the higher income will be able to purchase 67 units. This is a nnanciai sleight-of-hand trick. Those who are least able to bear the burden of taxation will not be in a better position as a result of this Government's manipulation of the nnances of the community. On the contrary, their position will become worse relatively and in fact. That is the truth, and it eannot be evaded. All the red herrings drawn across the trail by the Minister for Labour and National Service, and all his talk about Tattersall's lottery, which operated in Tasmania for years under anti-Labour governments, will not affect the issue. They have as much to do with the matter as the flowers that bloom in the spring. Apparently the Minister's purpose was to pretend to the people that the Liberal party did not stand for the raising of public money by means of lotteries and that such methods of raising finance were employed only by the Labour party. That, of course, is untrue. In ""Western Australia, anti-Labour governments levied a turn-over tax on betting under which not only the people who won but also those who lost were taxed. The method of raising revenue from lotteries and other forms of gambling has operated in various States under governments of various political colours. The Minister should not try to divert attention from the weaknesses of the Government's budget proposals by introducing such issues. ber tell us how he proposes to increase expenditure and reduce taxation at the same time? The Government has been waiting to have this point explained by some member of the Opposition ever since the budget was presented to the Parliament. . Jfr. Peters. right honourable gentleman's inquiry, but I point out that I have never suggested that taxes should be reduced while expenditure is increased. I have said that, if the Labour party were in power, it would not grant tax remissions worth £18 a week to a man whose income was £15,000 a year while it granted only £18 a year to. the man on £800 and only £6 a year to the man on £400, and at the same time pretend that this would improve the conditions of taxpayers with low incomes. The Minister in his speech tried to deny the assertion by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) that the Government's tax proposals provided for more favorable treatment of companies than of the ordinary man in the community. Nevertheless, the statement by the honourable member for Yarra was correct. I refer, for example, to the Standard Motor Company (Australia) Limited, which has declared dividends at the rate of only 35 per cent! The rate of dividend not long ago was about 100 per cent., but the last dividend declared was at the relatively low rate of 35 per cent. I suggest that such companies will not reduce the prices of their motor cars as a result of tax reductions. The community generally will not gain the advantage of any remissions granted to them. The companies will continue to sell their products for the highest prices they can obtain. Prices are determined by supply and demand. If goods are in short supply and the demand is great, prices rise; but if competition becomes keen, prices come down. Obviously, tax reductions will not lead to price reductions. Had the Standard Motor Company (Australia) Limited wished to sell its cars more cheaply, it could have done so by reducing its rate of dividend below 35 per cent, before the'Government introduced its tax proposals for 1953-54. But companies do not operate in that way. They extract as much as they can from the community, and they will continue to do so. The Government should withdraw this bill and consult the Opposition with a view to re-drafting the tax schedules for personal incomes. It should, with our co-operation, devise schedules that would give the maximum benefit to the little man with",28,Abthub Fabden Aide D By The To Continue For Long On The Line I Am
89,Mr Hoit,Will the honourable mem,29,Abthub Fabden Aide D By The To Continue For Long On The Line I Am
90,Mr Peters,"I am flattered by theresponsibilities. An examination of tbe schedules shows that a single man on £800 a year, for example, will receive the benefit of a tax reduction of £12 14s. a year. A married man on the same income, with a wife and two children, will receive a reduction of just over £10 a year. Therefore, in the £800 a year income range, a man with a wife and two children will be treated less beneficially than a single man. At the present time, £800 a year is an average income. Therefore, the average man with family responsibilities is being treated more harshly than the average single man. Such is the capacity of this Government to administer justice! Furthermore, not only is the married man iu a worse position relatively than the single man but, as his responsibilities increase, his position becomes even worse. The little man is in a worse position than the big man, and the married man is in a worse position than the single man. In my opinion, the Government's taxation measures will throw upon the ordinary members of the community a burden that is neither just nor desirable. I conclude on the note that the object of statesmanship is to bring about a re-allocation of the national income under which, as f a i as possible, a greater share will be given to those who have major responsibilities, who are performing the national task of bringing up families and making provision for the future of the nation. That will not be done by the present taxation measures and, because it will not be done, the measures will not be welcomed generally by the people of Australia.

Clause, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-take n as a whole. The remainder of the bill deals with the main features of the Government's income tax proposals. The Opposition points out that they will not give effect to any of the promises made by the Government parties in earlier years. Nor do they follow the canons of taxation practice or fiscal policy. The taxation proposals to which the bill will give effect will be neither equitable in their operation nor effective as a means of achieving the major purpose of direct taxation, which is to counter inflation. The Government has blandly assumed that there is no problem of inflation in Australia to-day, that economic stability has been restored, and that the future is rosy. But that is far from the truth. Threatened price rises are more disturbing than ever before in our history, businessmen are apprehensive and leaders of industry are alarmed at the prospect that faces Australian industry. Family men are in a more difficult situation than ever before. In view of the continual inorease of the cost of living, they find it a constant struggle to provide even ordinary amenities for their families, much less the near luxuries that are the right of our these. The Opposition says that the Government has not given effect to its election promises. It has not reduced the burden of taxation on the people. Rising prices and wages have brought ordinary wage-earners into the higher income tax ing more income tax to-day than they quote the words of the present Treasurer resigned long since.

101,Mr Dajey (Grayndler) [*.58],"Th eis true that authors and inventors may receive in a certain year a large sum as a result of their efforts. To tax an income of that kind at the ruling rate would be unfair, and provision is to be made for a spreading of the incomes of authors and inventors. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has suggested that a similar concession should be extended to boxers. A boxer might earn £10,000 or £20,000 in a year, and then lus career might finish abruptly. Yet be might lose a substantial proportion of his income because he earned it in a year of high taxation. Mr Leslie interjecting, ing the honourable member for Moore( Mr wife may have before the concessional Leslie), if that is at all possible. If the honorahle member listens carefully, and if what I am saying can thoroughly penetrate, he will gain some knowledge. I believe that footballers, tennis players and other sportsmen should be covered by this clause. Many such -sportsmen earn abnormally high sums within a short period of years during the time that they have reached the pinnacle of their skill, but then they return to comparatively low-paid occupations I desire to draw the attention of the Although they earn large sums of money for a short time, they also pay out large sums for income tax. I commend the Government for bringing down this measure; but, in all sincerity,. I submit to the Treasurer that he might giveconsideration to my proposal. L now wish to refer to the concessional allowance in respect of a dependent wife. The measure proposes to increase the allowance from £104 to £130. It would be interesting to honourable members if the Treasurer would explain why that sum has been increased to £130, and why it has not been increased to, perhaps, £200. Tf it were increased to the latter figure then the Government would be able to afford some real relief to those who have low incomes. I make these submissions in a co-operative way, and would be very glad to hear the Treasurer's views about them. concessional allowance for a dependent wifehas been increased from £104 to £130, as the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has stated. However, he did not say that the concessional allowance also applies to a wholly maintained parent, husband, daughter-housekeeper or housekeeper having the care of children under sixteen years. The cost to the revenue of the proposed increase of the allowance will be £5,500,000 in a full year, and £3,600,000 in 1953-54. If the honourable member for Grayndler desires to find out what a concessional allowance of say, £200 would cost, he t has merely to perform a simple arithmetical calculation. A further concession to be allowed by the Government is an increase from £52 a year to £65 I do not mind enlightena year of the income which a dependent allowance is reduced. That reduction of liability will cost about £450,000 in a full, year and about £100,000 in 1953-54. The concession will apply much more widely than has been indicated by the honourable member for Grayndler, and he can quite easily establish the cost to the revenue of any further increase of this particular allowance. committee to clause 8, by which the concessional allowance in respect, of a dependent wife will be increased from £104 to £130. The definition of "" dependant"" has been extended in certain ways to cover other persons. I draw the attention of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to section 82G of the Income Tax Assessment Act which deals with a taxation allowance in regard to funeral expenses. In that section a "" dependant "" is defined by reference to section 82F, Part 3, of the Income Tax. Assessment Act. There are also references in that section to sections 82B and 82c. The latter section provides for the allowance to a taxpayer of maintenance expenses in connection with a parent. However, there are many cases in which a taxpayer's wife may be the only support of her parents, but in the event of the death of a wife's parents no taxation allowance is' provided in respect of thc taxpayer's income. I believe that that is an anomaly which should be rectified. Moreover, the allowance of £30 for funeral expenses is inadequate, considering present-day costs.",31,Abthub Fabden Aide D By The To Continue For Long On The Line I Am

104,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [5.6].,"I am pleased to see the Treasurer back in tbe chamber after having been laid low for some time, and I therefore take the opportunity of asking him to give consideration to my remarks. He should widen the definition of dependant, so that it will cover not only the parents of the taxpayer but also the parents of his wife. If they be dependent on the taxpayer, they, like his own parents, should come under sections 82c and 82a of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Last year, I raised the matter of certain sporting sections of the community which might be brought within the scope of section 15. Last week, I pointed out certain anomalies in connection with expenses incurred by work people for special types of clothing that they are required to wear in order to carry on their occupations. I suggest that the definitions in section 51 (1.) of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be widened to embrace those persons. I also suggest that when the Treasurer again reviews the matter of income tax allowances, or when this measure is reviewed in another place, some consideration should be given to the submissions that I have made.

Opposition) [5.13] -This measure will wig and the ermine-bu t to justice as a bring up to date, and make some amendments to, the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901-1950. It is particularly important from the view-point of legal procedure, because it will make provision for additional processes of the courts to be made effective, not merely within the Commonwealth, but also within the external territories of the Commonwealth. This bill will make use of a number of powers given to the Parliament under the Constitution. The first is the power to make laws for the provision of the service and execution of process of the courts of the States throughout Australia. It will make the enforcement of the processes of a court of any State effective, where a defendant, or a person accused or charged, may not be in that State. But for this power it would not be possible to make the judgments and proceedings of the courts of the States effective outside their own borders. Times have changed, and because of the greater facility with which processes can be executed, this bill has become necessary. In addition to that power, there is a* power within the measure to bring the Australian territories, such as Papua and New Guinea and Norfolk Island, within that not only will the judgments of the courts of the States he effective in the States, hut they will also be effective in the external territories. Moreover, judgments of the federal courts in those territories will become effective throughout the Commonwealth. The Parliament has these powers under sections 122 and 51 another place and through detailed personal examination, the Opposition believes that it should be supported. is the kind of bill that is commonly described as a machinery bill, and it may dull dry bones of the law, but that is quite an erroneous way of looking at sucb an important piece of legislation, because its sole object is to enable the principles said, man always thirsts after justice.

106,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [5.15],"Thisliving thought, embodying a series of principles and existing as a spiritual ideal which stems from the heart, which pervades men's minds, which is innate in their beliefs, and which encompasses and possesses their whole nature. Because of that, let us look at the principles of justice propose to reduce the time in which serthat underlie this bill. It is described as the Service and Execution of Process Bill. "" Service"" means provision for enabling legal process to. be brought to the knowledge of the persons against whom legal action is proposed. It is a fundamental principle of justice that a person against whom legal proceedings are to be taken should not have orders made against him under those proceedings unless he is able to contest them and to defend himself. If that principle were not applied, an order of the court would riot be recognized but would be set aside because it had been wrongly made. A l though it is essential as a fundamental principle of justice that a person should be served personally with a process if possible, another fundamental principle of justice requires that a person who has a. right shall not be deprived of that right, because he is prevented from serving a process upon the person against whom that right exists-for example, because that party has disappeared and is not able to be found. Under the act provision can be made for dispensing with service, or for substituted service, so that the person with the right may get his proceedings before the court. The provisions of the principal act relating to the execution of a judgment also uphold the principle of justice that a successful litigant should be entitled to obtain the fruits of his judgment and that, although the person against whom the judgment was given niciy have left the State in which the case was heard and gone to another State, the judgment should be enforceable against him in that other State, or, as provided in the present bill, in a territory of the Commonwealth, including Norfolk Island and Papua and New Guinea. We see a further example of the extension of the principle of justice in the provision for limiting the period of service. Owing to modern inventions such as the telegraph, telephone, wireless, and the aeroplane, it is now possible to serve a process much more expeditiously than was formerly the case. Consequently, the principle that justice shall not be delayed, a principle which is referred to in Magna Carta itself, is preserved. We vice must be effected in order to bring matters more promptly before the courts. We can do that only because of the modern scientific improvements in communications. If we turn to clause 7, which embodies a proposed new section 18, we find that when a person has been arrested he shall immediately be brought before a magistrate or justice and not sent back to the State or territory from which the warrant against him has been issued if the charge is of a trivial nature, if the application for his return has not been made in good faith in the interests of justice, or if, for any reason, it would be unjust or oppressive to return him. Tliere must be a definite case against an arrested person before he can be handed over by one State to another. It is not sufficient that it be based on suspicion or even on the finding of a royal commission. Evidence must be placed before the magistrate who deals with the matter which indicates that the charge is not of a trivial nature, that the application is made in good faith and in the interests of justice, and that it is not unjust or oppressive. In deed, it is clear from decisions based on the provisions of this legislation that judges and magistrates will not make orders if they consider that the original order has not been made under just circumstances. For example, if an order has been made against a man ex parte, without his having been served with the proceedings and having had the right to appear, and an enforcement of a warrant is sought subsequently, the judges of the State in which enforcement of the warrant is sought have said, "" No, that is not just. He has not had a proper opportunity in the first instance to defend himself. Therefore these proceedings will not be enforced against h i m "" .

[ i SECOND READING. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [5.25] I move That the bill be now read, a second time. The purpose of this bill is to make certain amendments to the Customs Act 19011952. "" officer"" as "" all persons employed in the service of the Customs "". It has been the practice in terms of section 4 to appoint persons as acting officers of customs at certain outports to perform part-time duties on behalf of the Department of Trade and Customs, but doubt has been cast on the legality of the appointment of these persons because the wording in the definition of "" officer "" in section 4 does not specifically authorize the appointment of acting officers of customs. The proposed amendment will enable the Minister to make these appointments and at the same time will remove all doubt about the status of the persons so appointed. The terms and conditions of the appointments will, of course, still be determined by the Public Service Board. Section 12 of the act provides that all -persons acting in the service of the customs at the commencement of the Customs Act shall be deemed to have been duly appointed as officers of customs. There are now no persons in the service of the customs who were appointed in terms of section 12. The section does not therefore serve any purpose and it is desirable tliat it be repealed. Under section 130A (1) the master or owner of a ship or the pilot,or owner of an aircraft may make application to the Collector of customs for permission to take on board out of warehouse, under drawback or by transhipment from the stores of another ship or aircraft, stores for the use of the passengers and crew and for .the service of the ship or 'aircraft. If these provisions were strictly enforced it would not be possible for owners of ships or aircraft to take on board stores .by transhipment from the cargo of another ship or aircraf t, thus causing unnecessary will .enable owners, with the permission of the Collector of customs, to take on board under-bond stores from any source of supply, and will thus bring the provisions of the section into line ""with current, practice. Section 163 of the act makes provision for refunds of duty to be made in certain circumstances. It is the practice for the Section4 of the act defines Department of Trade and Customs to grant refunds of duty where goods arc imported in a faulty-or defective condition caused by faults or damage in manufacture. In these circumstances the goods cannot be used in the manner in which they are intended to be used and the manufacturer or supplier makes an allowance commensurate with the extent, of the fault or defect. The section does not, specifically provide for such refunds and consequently there is some doubt whether refunds can validly be paid. The proposed amendment will remove all doubt about the legality of these payments. Another amendment to section .163 is to ma.ke provision for the payment of refunds of duty in cases where the Minister has granted a Tariff concession under a by-law tariff item in the form of a ministerial determination as provided for in clause 6 of this bill. Appropriate provision for the making of the consequential refund where applicable has been included in paragraph (d) of clause 5 of the bill. As section 163 is considered unsatisfactory from a drafting point of view, the introduction of this amending bill provides an opportunity to repeal and remake the section. The terms of proposed new section 163 will not alter the policy or the practice in relation to refunds which are allowed at the present time. Section 271 of the principal act authorizes the Minister to grant tariff concessions by means of by-laws in certain circumstances. The by-laws are of two main typeSj namely "" continuing"" by-laws which operate on and after a specified",33,Service And Execution Of Be Thought That It Relates Merely To The Process Bill 1953 Second Reading

One is case made for this provision-and it does the enormous power, which, is not new, not seem to be answerable-is that the which the bill seeks to confer upon the enormous detail of the administration of Minister.

Indeedi t may not be practicable to specify the goods, conditions and items through the Gazette until a considerable time has elapsed after the determination is made. regarding time. pressed in the provision that notice shall be given as soon as practicable after the making of the determination. The argument advanced on behalf of this provision is that it would be impossible in that type of determination to fix a specified number of days, and I accept that. The only provision which we consider should be inserted in the bill is a. safeguard in connection w i th retro-active determinations dealing with goods of a certain type. The power to make refunds of duty is exercised normally, I understand, in relation to capital goods. An illustration was given in connection with capital equipment, such as machinery which is imported for, say, the use of municipalities and shires, and. after a considerable time a request is made that the particular goods be covered by a determination and that the duty be refunded. That is a simple case, because the goods are still retained by the importer or, at any rate, by the first purchaser from the importer, so that there is no difliculty about refunding the duty. The point that we wish to be considered is the operation of the measure in relation to consumable goods. One such case arose in connection with timber some years ago soon after the Government came into office, and was debated on a motion for the adjournment of the House. A refund of duty on certain timbers had been granted retrospectively, but in the meantime the goods had been disposed of down the line, from importer to retailer. I think I am correct in stating that the result was the benefit of the refund was not carried down the line, and could not have been carried down the line at that stage, to the consumer, in an orderly progression from tailer. In consequence, that refund of duty was not sound from the administrative point of view. We propose to move at the committee stage for the insertion of an additional provision that refund of duty under a by-iaw is to be made only in cases where the Minister is satisfied that the benefit of the refund w ill be passed on. Even that proposal may require some further amendment in order to ensure that it w ill be effective. The point is that if a refund is made witb profit to the importer it should be coT h e only l i m it is exextensive with the actual course of business in dealing with the items that have been resold. Otherwise it may simply be a windfall, or portion of a windfall, for the importer. Subject to that, I have no further comments io make at this stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. B ill read a second time. In committee: The bill. Opposition) [5.39] -Claus e 6 of the bill reads as follows:6. Section two hundred and seventy-one of the Principal Act is repealed and the following sections are inserted in its stead:""271. WhereI move That, after proposed new section 273F the following new section be inserted:"" 273G. No refund of duty under a by-law or determination shall be made unless the Minister is satisfied that, in the case of goods imported for re-sale, the benefit of the refund will be passed on to the purchaser or purchasers of such goods."". The power to make a refund may be exercised a considerable time after the duty has been paid. The application for the refund would be made by the importer, who would have paid the duty. This amendment is designed to deal, not w i th capital goods, but with goods which have been sold between the date of importation and the date of the refund. There should be some limitation of the power to make a refund. The limitation I proDOse is that the Minister should be satisfied that where an importer has added to the price at which he sold the goods the actual amount, or part of the actual amount, of duty that was paid, he",36,Customs Bill 1953 Inconvenience The Proposed Amendmen T

111,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of theshould not be entitled to a refund to the extent to which that price was increased. I submit that the additional provision that I have moved is just and reasonable. It will have no reference to machinery or such capital goods that were not imported for sale. It will refer to such goods as the timber that I have mentioned, in relation to which a refund was made. In that case I believe that the importer alone received the benefit of the refund after the goods had been sold and he had passed the duty on in the price he had charged. That is substantially the point we are making, and I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council Harrison) to consider it, even if it is necessary to make some further amendment of my amendment to ensure thnt the principle is adopted. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [5.43],-The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) dealt with this matter in greater detail in his second-reading speech. I refrained from answering him at that stage because he had foreshadowed an amendment, and I considered that I sbould answer his argument in committee after he had moved the amendment. This is a matter which has been discussed in another place, and it might be as well for the committee to understand clearly amendment, its possible results and why it is not acceptable to the Government. There is no need for me to re-state the clause itself, beyond saying that it will confer no greater power on the Minister than his present power in relation to the making of by-laws. Let us examine for a moment the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and see what effect it would have. It would mean that the department would be required by law to refuse all refunds in respect of by-laws or deterincreased staff to police and completely minations unless it had evidence that the full benefit of the concession had been passed on to the consumer of the goods. I believe that that is the point about which the right honourable gentleman has shown concern. It is conceivable that some persons who had actually passed on the concession to consumers would be unable to furnish proof of such action and the department would have no option but to refuse a refund of duty. I shall make some further observations to show that the proposed amendment would be impractiable to administer. In practice, it is found that importers incur expense in obtaining benefits under by-laws in that they employ customs agents or staff to make representations to the department and to prepare the case for by-law admission. Further expense is incurred in the application for refund of duty particularly if ( Mr Eric J. an agent is employed, as is often the ease. If the f u l l benefit of the concession were passed on to the consumers, the importer concerned would lose the cost of the overhead and work involved in obtaining the concession. He could not recover the money that he had laid out in the first place to get the concessions. In addition, the onus of proof that the concession was passed on would lie with the importer. In the case of consumer goods, which one importer may sell to many consumers, it will be readily appreciated that there would be considerable increase in the overhead expense to the importer in following through the transaction from himself through several intermedia to the final purchaser. The cost of obtaining the evidence could amount to a sum exceeding the amount of the concession, and a similar cost could be incurred by the implications of the the Department of Trade and Customs in verifying the facts. The term ""actual purchaser"" is also considered to be vague. Does the term mean the ultimate purchaser, such as the man in the street, or the immediate purchaser from the importer? The wording of the proposed amendment would imply the former, as it refers to ""purchaser or purchasers "". The amendment that has been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition undoubtedly would require negative the proposed economy in staff and materials envisaged when clause 6* of the bill was first suggested by the department. It may be pertinent to draw the attention of honourable members to the two legal instruments now provided for in the bill. They are the ministerial",37,Customs Bill 1953 Inconvenience The Proposed Amendmen T

(6) of the bill provides for conditions, if any, to interfere with the business of a merchant be imposed by the Minister. Although the imposition of conditions is not mandatory, the question as to the price at which the goods have been costed and sold by the importer is an important factor. It would be investigated as a matter of course by the department before making a determination. Only in exceptional cases in the case of consumer goods, where it was clear that the goods had been costed by the importer without the duty component or sold by the importer on the basis that a refund would be granted, would a determination be made. Even in such a case, obviously the department cannot follow the goods right to the consumer. Further, if the goods have been sold to an intermediary who has not yet sold the goods and the duty is remitted and passed to the person holding the goods, how can an assurance be obtained that the intermediary will then sell the goods without the duty component? Obviously, he will sell at the best price he can obtain on the market, and in accordance with the law of supply and demand. When a standing by-law is made, it local manufacture, it was clear that the is considered that the date of operation duty had not been included in .the selling should not be ante-dated for more than a price by the importer. short period.

It is highly doubtful if the department can many times removed from the importer. The cost of obtaining the necessary evidence by the importer and the subsequent verification by the department would be considerable. One of the purposes of this bill was to simplify departmental procedures. Further, are the overhead costs, such as staff and agents' fees, involved in making a by-law application, and the subsequent obtaining of a refund, to be allowed as a .debit againsfcthe refund? How can the fact that the duty has been passed on be verified? Goods are sold according to the law of .supply and demand. Is the wholesaler's margin on the duty to be refunded also.? Carrying out the terms of the proposed amendment, would result in an interference with trade and be a form of prices control. By-laws were issued in 1949-51 with provision for duty that was refunded to be passed on. but they were found to be quite unworkable and were discontinued.

117,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forenable the Commonwealtb Government to play its part in a proposed joint Commonwealth-State plan for the orderly marketing of Australian wheat of the next three crops, including that about to be harvested. This plan requires the collaboration of the States and, before it can become operative, the States will need to pass legislation that will be complementary to the Oommonwealth legislation. This course of action has been agreed upon between the Australian Government and the governments of all the States after a long series of negotiations covering the stabilization of the wheat industry, th& orderly marketing of wheat, and the question of Australia's adherence, to the new International Wheat Agreement. It is a continuance of orderly marketing on lines which, in the marketing sense, are almost identical with the system under the Australian Wheat Board of the last five years, but without tbe provision of stabilization. It is appropriate at this point to explain the fundamental difference between plain orderly marketing, as such, and stabilization. Orderly marketing, so fatas wheat is concerned, is now accepted to mean one central authority, authorized by legislation to accept all Australian wheat, to market it to the best advantage within Australia and overseas, to pool tbe returns from all sales, and to pay all suppliers for wheat delivered on the basis of the net per bushel pool Teturn. stabilization goes beyond this. The organized marketing machinery is the same, but there must then be imposed upon it specific uniform State domestic price provisions, and the stabilization features of a Commonwealth guaranteed price for exports, a stabilization fund, and an export tax to support the stabilizaalways with the Commonwealth Cabinet. tion fund up to a certain point. When the stabilization fund is exhausted, the guaranteed price must be supported from Commonwealth revenue. The current five-year pla.n ends with the marketing by the Australian Wheat Board of the 3952-53 crop. Negotiations between the Commonwealth Government, the six State governments and the wheat industry, through the medium of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, have been aimed at devising a further plan for the stabilization of the industry to commence with the harvesting of the 1953-54 crop. This legislation is the outcome of protracted negotiations with the States and the wheat industry. The negotiations commenced on the basis of an expressed desire of the wheat industry for an orderly marketing and stabilization scheme, and an agreement by the Commonwealth Government and each of the six State Governments that they were, in principle, in favour of that arrangement. There was one clear qualification to this: That stabilization legislation, which involves a tax upon growers' wheat and the withholding of their funds, would be subject to approval of growers through a ballot. The Oommonwealth stipulated that, and the growers desired it. As was the case in the original scheme in 1948, the ballot would, of course, be in the form of a vote for or against a comprehensive legislative programme, including State and Federal legislation. This obviously necessitated agreement between the Governments as to the legislation they were prepared to pass. The Commonwealth made clear in detail its position in this regard. Tbe conditions of such an arrangement are highly important to wheat-growers, who would have the protection of a guarantee, but also the obligation of a financial contribution to a stabilization fund. The taxpayers are at least as interested, In wheat industry usage, as they, finally, are the guarantors. Therefore, the terms upon which the Commonwealth was prepared to assume this guarantee responsibility were worked out in close consultation with the wheat growers' representatives and also were at all times under the close scrutiny of the Treasury. Final responsibility rested The States, .although not party to the guarantee obligation, were at all times kept fully informed of all these negotiations, and given f u l l opportunity-in fact, they were invited-to express their views upon the provisions. The Commonwealth's offer to guarantee a return of cost of production on 100,000,000 bushels of wheat exported in each of five years, and the conditions attached to that offer, were set out in quite definite terms, and the offer was",40,Wheat Marketin Gbill 1953 Second Bea Oing
118,Mr Mcewen.,"explained to the representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation in the presence of the State Ministers at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. This offer was, of course, subject to approval of growers through a ballot. Another organization, the Australian Primary Producers' Union, which has a wheat-grower section, has been informed of the agreement reached between governments in these negotiations and has taken the opportunity to advise the Commonwealth and the Australian Agricultural Council of the views of its wheat section. The States desired that any ballot should be taken by them, as was done on the last occasion, and the Commonwealth agreed to this. All the States were in agreement on their legislation except on one point only-the local selling price, f t is common knowledge that this point produced a deadlock which lasted for months. The fact that a ballot has not been taken on stabilization is, therefore, due not to any unwillingness of the Commonwealth to assume the guarantee, but to the fact that practical circumstances not concerning the Commonwealth's position, and over which the Commonwealth had no control, prevented a ballot from being taken. Once it became clear that, due to the time factor, it was no longer possible to conduct a ballot, and pass tbe legislation and have it operative in time to handle the incoming harvest, all the governments and the growers then turned their attention to the kind of orderly marketing structure which could be established without a ballot, that is, orderly marketeconomy that the International Wheat ing without the stabilization guarantee provisions. The Ministers of the Agricultural Council decided on the 16th June that the possibility of having legislation passed after the conduct of a ballot, and before the harvest commenced, could no longer be relied upon. The council unanimously decided by resolution that, to meet this situation, there should be concentration upon an orderly marketing plan of a kind which could be established without a ballot of growers. That explains why a guaranteed price stabilization arrangement is not part of this legislation. The difficulties and delays which attended the endeavour to reach unanimity between the States on the question of a domestic selling price as a part of this orderly marketing plan are so well known that I have no intention of dwelling upon them. The important point is that unanimity has been reached and enables this legislation to be presented to the Parliament. It provides the basis upon which it will be possible to maintain orderly marketing and ratify the International Wheat Agreement. Passage of the legislation, both Commonwealth and State is, therefore, of the utmost urgency because, pending the passage of this bill and complementary State legislation, no statutory authority exists to receive for realization the coming wheat crop. I am informed that wheat is already being harvested in Queensland and the harvest will be in full swing in Queensland and northern New South Wales within the next few weeks. Upon a request made by all the States some months ago, the Commonwealth authorities drafted for their consideration a suggested State bill of a uniform character which would be complementary to the Commonwealth bill. The States have had this draft legislation for some time, and Commonwealth and State officials have had an explanatory conference. The Commonwealth Government, the Australian Agricultural Council representing all the States, and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, have all held the view that it is in the best interests of wheat-growers and of the Australian Agreement should continue and that Australia should be a participant In fact, one of the prime objectives of the whole negotiations has been to provide a basis for participation. A separate legislative proposal will deal with this matter, but I point out that, without a. central marketing authority for export wheat, the obligations devolving upon Australia through membership of the International Wheat Agreement are considered not to be capable of practical administration. Therefore, the continuance of the Australian Wheat Board in the terms of this and complementary State legislation will make it possible for Australia to ratify the* Irit'ernatioiia'l Wlieat Agreement. Indeed,, the three-year period' of this legislation is designed to synchronize 1 with the period of the extension of the International' Wheat Agreement. Before proceeding to explain the bill, I wish to make it clear that, without some arrangement of this kind, an impossible marketing situation, would have arisen. There woiild have been different wheat prices fbr flour aud bread in the several States, different prices again for stock feed, and strong pressure from every quarter for the export of maximum quantities of wheat at the higher export price. There would have been no authority competent to regulate exports, and, in any case, the satisfactory administration of an export quota and permits arrangement would have been an almost impossible task. The problem of who would bear the' cost of supplying wheat to Tasmania at the AustraJian domestic price and foregoing the higher overseas export parity could not be equitably resolved. Moreover, the patterns of interstate trade generally in wheat and flour would have become distorted owing to the operation of varying wheat prices, and the problem of carrying over stocks would have been unmanageable. Generally, a most disorderly marketing situation would have been created aud the industry itself would' havo been split asunder. As against this spectacle of chaos, the Australian pool now contemplated provides order and equity. The Australian Wheat Board, witli years of experience, in which general satisfaction has been given to the wheat growers and tbe flour-milling industry, will provide a stable basis upon whicli the financing of the crop cau be calculated. Further, the pool realization assures an equitable return to each grower, Tapmania can be supplied at the Australian price without pvoblem, flour-millers havo a convenient aud assured supply, and the International Wheat Agreement, can be ratified and administered. These comparisons give some picture of what was at risk in the recent deadlock. In such eircTimFtances, it would have been quite impossible for Australia to accept any commitments under the International Wbeat Agreement. The joint Commoner. Mctiwc.it. wealth-State marketing arrangement now intended is, as honourable members -wil seej not embodied ih' a completely new act^ but provided by an amendment of the old act. Complementary legislative, action wiH ueed to be taken, by the States to ensure, first a uniform home-consumption price for wheat, and. secondly,, the direction of all wheat to the Australian Wheat Board for receiving, and marketing on a common pool basis. I shall make a. few comments on. thc details of this orderly marketingplan. The plan is intended to cover the marketing, of the next three Australian wheat crops, commencing with the crop now about to be harvested. I h that period the States, by individual legislative action, will' direct all wheat to the Australian Wheat Board, established and maintained under Commonwealth legislation, for marketing for consumption within Australia and for exportrealization on a common pooling basis. Growers will be paid a first advance by the board after delivery of their wheat and will receive further payments as sales of wheat take place. When the pool has been wound up,''they will have received the full net per bushel return available from the operations of the pool. A part of the negotiated arrangement under which the Western Australian growers and the Western Australian Government were willing to come into the common pool, is that Western Australian growers will receive from the pool realizations a=n additional amount above other States equal to 3d. a bushel on the quantity of wheat exported from Western Australia overseas. This sum represents approximately the freight advantage which normally attaches to overseas wheat exports from Western Australia, due to the shorter freight haul from that State to the main overseas markets. !It is common knowledge that there was delay in. reaching unanimity between tbe States on a. uniform domestic selling price. Finally, the following price formula was agreed upon. The price in respect of a. wholesale sale of bulk wheat of fair average quality, free on rails at a port of export, will be the International Wlieat Agreement price, or fourteen shillingsa bushel, whichever is the lower. However, if that price should be less than the cost of production, the price then will be an amount equal to the cost of production. The ways in which the International Wheat Agreement price and the cost of production are to be determined for the purposes of the plan are outlined iin the bill. Should there not be amInternational Wheat Agreement to which Australia is a party, the price is to be 14s. a bushel, bulk, or the-prevailing by all consumers in Australia will be parity for export wheat at thebeginning of' the season, whichever is the lower. But it is never to be less than the cost of production. The figure of 14s, provides some incentive to attain the very desirable objectiveof further expansion of this great industry, which has a very important bearing on the economic welfare of this country. BeforeI conclude, I shall make somefurther comments on that aspect. I invite attention to the important fact that, whatever the Internationa] Wheat. Agreement price may prove to be, the assessed cost of production is still the rock basis of the plan. If , for instance, the International Wheat Agreement price should fall to the minimum of the price range provided in. the agreement, and if the assessed cost of production should exceed that figure, the cost of production would become the home consumption price for the purposes of the plan-. Iin the course of these general negotiaassessment of these costs has been tions, a special arrangement was approved to meet the difficulty of enabling wheat produced on the mainland to be sold in Tasmania at the common Australian price. For years this has presented a most difficult and unresolved problem. On occasions-, the wheat board has met the freight at the cost of wheat-growers, who have bitterly, and with justification, resented that being done. On occasions, the Tasmanian Government has met th-.' freight, and, as an emergency decision, on a. number of occasions, the Commonwealth has done so. This freight is extraordinarily high. I understand it has been about 3s. 6d. a bushel. If th*' price cf bread in Tasmania "".vere loaded by fhe freight, the price of bread there would be considerably higher than anywhere else, fn Australia. The arrangement which has now received general approval is that the agreed price at which wheat wilT be sold' on behalf of growers shall be loaded by a further l^d . a bushel, 1 which sum shall be kept in a separate fund ih which wheat-growers will have no equity whatever; the fund being used to meet the cost of Tasmanian freight. This loading will attach to all wheat sold on the Australian mainland and in Tasmania. loaded by another l^d. a. bushel? ing price, of sugar in Australia is loaded by anamount which enables sugar to be delivered and sold at the. same price in all States. That arrangement has enjoyed the support of all political parties and it is, I think,, an equitable arrangement. done before in connection, with wheat. done before in connection with wheat. There has always been theunsolved, problem of Tasmanian freight. I feel it is worthwhile to examine the basis on which the cost of production is actually assessed. The ca3h costs involved in wheat production have been assessed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the basis of a comprehensive Australia wide survey carried out on soundly established survey techniques. The bureau scrutinized and endorsed by a representative of. the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and also by a representative of the Agricultural Ministers of all States. There is, however, a second category of cost items which includes sueh things as the amount to be allowed as remuneration for the farmer himself, the rate of interest ou asset values and judgment on the appropriate yield to be used for the purpose of determining a fair cost of production per bushel of wheat. These are mattei'3 on which governments must make judgments, but the growers have been given an opportunity to express their views. As the cost of production was to be the basis of the Commonwealth stabilization guarantee, the Commonwealth made its decisions, on these matters.

To the extent that the cost of production is in the formula for State domestic price determination, the States also had an interest in this calculation. There is no dispute about it. The final figure derived as a result of these decisions, together with the technical assessment of cash costs, is l is . l i d . a bushel as at November, been calculated by agricultural experts 1952. This assessment has been agreed to be reasonable by all State Ministers of Agriculture. The figure will be varied annually in accordance with annual movements of the costs of production as assessed by a Wheat Costs Index Committee, and approved after consultation between the Commonwealth Minister and the six State Ministers of Agriculture.

The dollar expenditure of the earnings from wheat constituted 13.1 per sterling area as a whole on wheat alone eent. of all rural export earnings and 10.6 was the equivalent of £140,000,000 per cent, of all export income. The sterling in 1949 and £119,000,000 in decline would have been even more notice1950.

It is obviously in the national interest that, without reducing the value of our wool production, we should plan to lessen our dependence upon it by stimulating production of alternate income earners. Wheat is obviously the outstanding alternative. It is clear that wheat production could be increased without reducing wool production. It has that wheat acreage could be increased to at least 13,000,000 acres, without a return to cropping in marginal areas. On present knowledge such an increased wheat acreage would largely come in new high-yielding areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales, and in other districts where ley-farming methods can be practised with high yields. It is clear, In addition to what wheat means to our relative importance to some essential imports, we must remember that production would be of great value both nationally and internationally. During the post-war years, until",44,Wheat Marketin Gbill 1953 Second Bea Oing
123,Mr Mcewen.,"fonrtala of the Simpson Cost of Production Committee. Until 1952-53, these sales were at figures consistently less than 50 per cent, of those ruling for free wheat in the world market. In the four-year period up to and including 1951-52, the net pool returns f.o.r. ports per bushel have actually been less than the 14s. 3.7d. figure for the 1947-48 pool, although costs of production increased during the five year period following 1947-48 from 6s. 3d. to l is . l i d . a bushel. The wheat acreage declined from 13,900,000 acres in 1947-48 to 10,100,000 acres in 1952-53. Because of the initiative of this Government, and its provision, in those circumstances, of a subsidy to the stockfeeding industry, some improvement was effected both in the 1951-52 net returns and in the 1952-53 season. The final return per bushel f.o.r. ports for the 3952-53 season is expected to be about 15s. 5£d. There is striking evidence of a recovery in the wheat acreage to an estimated 10,800,000 or 11,000,000 acres for the coming season, partly due, no doubt, to expectations of more equitable treatment in respect of home-consumption sales. The case for an incentive price to induce further expansion of this great industry is clear-cut, and as I mentioned earlier, the home-consumption price, formula under this new plan is intended to go some way towards providing that incentive. At the proposed price, wheat will be still available for use in Australia at a. price at least 20 per cent, less than current export prices. I know that it is a great relief to all Australian Governments and to all sections of the industry to know that an orderly marketing plan has finally been evolved, and that its adoption will place Australia in a position to ratify the International Wheat Agreement without misgivings. I believe that even though it covers a period of only three years, this plan will provide a sound foundation on which governments and the wheat industry can consult regarding the long term future of wheat marketing in this country. I commend the bill to honourable members. adjourned. read a first time. Commerce and Agriculture) [8.33] -h y leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to seek the approval of the Parliament for the ratification of the 1953 International Wheat Agreement. That agreement is the outcome of negotiations between wheat inporting and exporting countries which commenced in the International Wheat Council in April, 1952, and terminated at a meeting in Washington in April, 1953. The object of those negotiations was to endeavour to ensure a healthy and stable international trade in wheat for a further period after the 1949 four-year international wheat agreement expired on the 31st July, 1953. Following the Washington conference, Australia became a signatory to the new agreement, as did also 41 importing countries and three exporting countries, namely, Canada, the United States of America and France. The signing of the agreement did not in any final manner commit Australia or any other signatory country to adherence to the agreement, which is dependent upon the lodgement of a formal instrument of ratification to follow the constitutional or legislative requirements of each individual country. The price and other operative provisions of the new agreement have been in operation since the 1st August, 1953, but Australia, in common with several other countries, sought and was granted an extension of time until the 31st October, 1953, in which to make a firm decision regarding ratification. The Government would not proceed to ratification without parliamentary approval, and the approach to the Parliament has unfortunately been delayed until now because of the inability of the seven Australian governments to agree upon a comprehensive orderly marketing plan for wheat, which was essential before the Government could accept obligations under the In ternational Wheat Agreement.

126,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forsuch a plan were in operation. Australia's commitments under the agreement would be quite unmanageable. As honourable members are aware, it is only a matter of days since all governments have agreed to the principles of a. joint Commonwealth-State orderly marketing plan, to which I have addressed myself in my second-reading speech on another bill at present before the Parliament. I wish to make it clear at this point that the Government intends to proceed to ratification of the International ""Wheat Agreement only after the States have legislated for the new orderly marketing plan, or it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Governin respect of a guarantee under a stabiliment that there is no room for doubt that the necessary State legislation will be enacted in the immediate future. All State governments have already given assnrances on that point. Copies of the new agreement have been circulated to honourable members for .their information and reference. I have also arranged for the distribution to all honourable members of copies of a publication by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics entitled The Wheat Situation. This includes a very useful summary of the International Wheat Agreement. The agreement will operate for a period of three years from the 1st August, .1953, and except for amendments to certain important provisions, to which I shall refer later, it is substantially the same as the four year agreement which preT ceded it. I believe, therefore, that it is United Kingdom Government to accept a unnecessary for me to elaborate on the historical background or on the general nature of the agreement. Its most important features are(a) The determination of a price range for wheat sold under the agreement through the fixation of maximum and minimum prices to operate for the duration of the agreement; and (b) The determination of a quota for each importing country. importing country may be required to purchase its quota at the minimum price under the agreement and an exporting country may be required to sell its quota at the maximum agreewith a minimum price under the old ment price. Mr MoBicen. The principal objectives of the agreement, as stated in article (a), are to assure supplies of wheat to importing countries and markets for wheat to exporting countries, at equitable and stable prices. They must be regarded as very worthy objectives, and important stabilizing factors in relation to a commodity .which, in unregulated trading times, has been notorious for the violent and unpredictable manner in which its prices have fluctuated. Moreover, the stipulation of prices in. the agreement over a three-year period will provide a valuable basis for the calculation of risks in which the Commonwealth would involve itself zation plan. This agreement comes at a time when marketing conditions and arrangements are changing. Government trading is giving way, in important markets, to open .marketing, and after a period of shortage there are now very heavy world stocks of wheat. .Australia's quota under the agreement could therefore prove important to the welfare of the industry within the three-year period of the agreement. Although enforcement of the conditions of the agreement would present a problem if the necessity should arise, the experience of the four years of the last agreement has shown that it should work. The determination of maximum and minimum prices under the International Wheat Agreement has been -a major issue, and because of the unwillingness of the maximum price of 2.05 dollars a bushelequivalent to ISs.

The maximum price undei tliis agreement must be regarded as satisfactory on present-day world wheat trade conditions, while the minimum price is well above the assessed cost-of production of wheat in Australia. The withdrawal of 'the United Kingdom, which is Australia's biggest customer for wheat, has affected the original quota provisions. Therefore, it is necessary for Australia fco ensure that her traditional wheat and flour markets can be .supplied, and ""to adjust her commitments ""to the International Wheat Agreement accordingly. In this connection a reduction of the quota allotted to India, and the inclusion of four new countries must also be taken into account. The total of the quotas negotiated at Washington was 595,000,000 bushels. The adjustments necessitated by the withdrawal of fche United Kingdom and the other factors to whicli I have just referred, will reduce the total quotas to about 421,000,000 bushels. Some further adjustments ,may still be required if several .countries which have not yet ratified should fail to do so. After consideration of all factors, the Government has applied to the International Wheat Counci] .for a reduction in Australia's quota from 75,000,000 bushels to 48,000,000 bushels. The urgency of this measure lies in the fact that the International Wheat Council will meet at Madrid on Tuesday next, the 20th October. The Government, must be in a position to indicate where it stands in the matter by that date; Otherwise, there is a real danger that the other .exporting countries may take advantage of any indecision on the part of Australia to press for the re-allocation to them or our quota under the agreement. I wish to make it very clear that the present stage in the International Wheat Agreement has been reached in the closest collaboration with the wheat industry in this country. Unlike the 1949 procedure, when the government of the day proceeded to a very late stage without taking the industry into its confidence, this Government has maintained the closest collaboration with the industry throughout. There has been continuous consultation with the grower-controlled Australian Wheal Board and with the Australian Whear, Growers Federation. At the London meeting last year, which was the firsr. meeting to discuss the new agreement, and at the Washington, conference this year the Australian delegation had the benefit, of the service and advice of the chairman of the Australian Wheat, Board, Sir John Teasdale, and a representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. In London, the chosen representative was Mr Pearce, an elected grower-member or the Australian Wheat Board, chosen noi because he was a member of the Australian Wheat Board, but because he was nominated by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation.

On the -second occasion, in Washington, the growers were represented by Mr. Stott, M.H.A., the joint secretary .of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, because he had been nominated by thaJ. organization. In fact, I may say that the Government's proposal to accede to the new International Wheat Agreement, has the .strong .support of all State governments, as indicated through the Australian Agricultural Council, and of thp Australian wheat industry. ment. have pointed out earlier, will be subject to the Governments being satisfied thai there has been, or will be, State legislation that would enable us to carry out the obligations of the agreement. adjourned.

136,(Dr. Evatt's,"vid ea Housing Agreement. It suggests that the agreement should he amended to enable tenants to purchase their homes on easy terms. It will enable consideration to be given to the problems of. an economic rent to be charged, to the need for the reduction of the interest rate, and to the writing off of certain debts contracted by the States under the agreement, which arise out of the existing inflation. The whole of the Opposition's case in regard to this matter rests upon the amendment which I have proposed. The Opposition contends, first, that hoth in the spirit and the letter there has been a breach of the Oommonwealth and State Housing Agreement by the Commonwealth. It contends that the advances to the States should not have been curtailed without due reference to paragraph 6 of the agreement to which I shall refer later. TheOpposition considers that a conference should be held at the earliest possible moment between the Commonwealth and States in relation to the housing agreement in order to remove the shocking anomaly under which tenants who are already in occupation of houses for which they have paid rent for some years are unable to purchase their homes cm easy terms. The ordinary citizen engaged in an ordinary trade venture between a landlord and himself may have all these considerations extended to him, but a tenant of a house under the housing agreement in most, if not all, of the States -som e special considerations may apply in South Australia and Tasmania-is unable to purchase his house on easy terms because of conditions in the agreement, which is now, after almost nine years of operation, displaying certain strains. The most urgently required amendment is an alteration of the agreement so that tenants of housing commission homes may be able to buy them on easy terms. To-day, unless the necessary lump sum is forthcoming, no arrangement for purchase can be made. A conference of the parties to the agreement -should be held as speedily as possible to consider the rights of tenants who aro renting housing commission homes. The Opnosition believes that the bill, to pay. If he decides to make an effort which deals only with the grant, is unto pay the rent, and settlesin. the house necessarily short and inconclusive. In Mr Haylen. K » l t t ». the face of a housing frustrationthat is grievous, extensive' and heart breaking,, there is nothing in the bill to cure this preventable, misery of the home seeker. The Government directs attention to the money expended or to> be expended under the agreement, but this sort of political strip-tease fools nobody. All the figures on housing, the amounts to be given to the States, must be cut back to size because of careering inflation. The figures must be read alongside the houses that can be built with costs at their present extraordinary high level. I shall prove by a comparison of the figures in the days of the administration of' the Chifley Government and the current figures how inflation has priced out of existence the possibility of implementing a housing plan of vigour, speed and numerical strength. The real position is not disclosed by a mei-e citation of the number of pound notes given in revenue grants under this scheme, nor is it disclosed by the bales of Treasury-bills that are used to buttress the economy. It is disclosed by the amount of real money that has to be expended to-day in order to build the same number of houses as it was possible to build for considerably less money in the early days of the agreement under the Chifley Government. If the Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes) will come down to earth from his platform in space among the inflated millions of which be talks, and give us not only the number of houses he has built, but also their rental, their erection cost and their purchase price, we shall be getting somewhere. We shall then be able to compare the record of this Government with the record of the Chifley Labour Government in connection with this matter. The hard facts of the housing crisis to-day are that housing commission homes, particularly, in New South Wales where the position is very serious, are becoming too dear to rent and out of the question to buy. Any winner of a housing ballot in New South Wales to-day is confronted with a mixed blessing. For months, and perhaps years, he has been waiting to win in a ballot, and wheu he has won a house he is confronted with the fact that the economic rent is too high for him with, i is .family because of ids desperation for a home, and in due course desires to purchase it , he finds that purchase is right out of the question, because of the inflated prices that are the result of this Government's policy. So he has moved from one frustration to another. He has moved from poor housing into a home with a ruinous rent, which he cannot buy even if he had the long-range vision of owning his own home, because the price is £3,000 or £4,000. The spectacle of a home for a basic wage earner costing more than £3,000 is the result of three evils and is the reason why we demand that there be a conference of the signatories to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The first evil consists of the inflated prices of homes, and falls fairly and squarely on the shoulders of this Government. As statistics show, that evil was not in existence when the Labour Government left office, and I can prove it later by producing comparative figures relative to housing costs. The cost of houses is to-day one of the most inhibitory factors in relation to housing construction. The second evil is the existence, over a long period, though not so much at present, of the cost-plus system. The third evil is the fatuous belief of the Government that, if left alone, prices will find their own level. There is another reason why the housing position is so -chaotic to-day. It is that non-Labour governments, both no.w and in the past, have acted like dilettanti in relation to housing. To anti-Labour governments housing is something to fiddle around with, grow all pious and unctuous about, and then hand back to private enterprise. That has already been stated explicitly by the honourable member for Lilley (. Mr Wight) and by other honourable members with whoni I shall deal later. But the Labour party is dedicated, to housing. It believes that housing is the business of the government. Honourable members opposite also say so, but they are trying to get out of the housing business as fast as they can. We say that the provision of housing is a social service, and that it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that a house is made available at a reasonable rental to everybody who is unable to purchase a house. We believe that the first objective in <a .government housing policy should be a fair rental and a fair shelter for the tenants. Another objective should be the abolition of slums and sub-standard housing. The Government, of course, has no concern with these two things. To-day, under this -Government houses have been priced by inflation out. of the reach of the worker. It is beyond understanding why the Government is 30 immeasurably smug about the housing situation. Liberal governments have never been successful with housing projects. Because their record was so tragically bad Mr Curtin, when he ""was Prime Minister, appointed a committee to investigate the position. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) was a member of it, and his contribution to debates on housing in this chamber have been of immense importance to us. Later on in 1945, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement was signed under the Chifley Government, with the aim of repairing the damage done by previous anti-Labour governments. Who will ever forget what happened when the Lyons Government was in office in 1934 ? In order to win an election, and in the face of an abysmally great housing shortage, it went to the people with the slogan, ""£10.000,000 for housing"", and another slogan which, I believe, was coined by the present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page)-a t least he was the first to give utterance to it-whic h was "" A million homes for a million souls When the Lyons Government was returned to office as a. result of that promise about bousing, it suddenly decided that it had no constitutional power to do what it had promised to do and, as a result, it built not one house. There has never been sueh a tragic denial of policy, although we have had some pretty fair examples of such denials in other directions under this Government. The great £10,000,000 housing scheme was. just a figment of the imagination. Because not one house was built under that alleged scheme the housing position deteriorated so badly during the war that the Chifley Government was forced to take resolute action to deal ""with it. The Commonwealth and State housing agreement was the result. In the years before the war the anti-Labour Stevens Government in New South Wales, now happily out of existence, was driven to desperation by the protests of the people, including the secretary of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dalziel, whose welfare work in relation to housing was truly remarkable, and was needled into putting up at least some show. This great mountain of a party in labour produced 47 small flats at Erskineville, a suburb of Sydney. Those flats are the remaining memento of 50 years of occupancy of the government benches in New South Wales by anti-Labour parties. After performing this gigantic feat under pressure, Liberal government in New South Wales expired, and, so far, it has never been resurrected and, happily, never will be. The same position occurred in relation to housing in Victoria. The relation of this history is necessary because of yearly requirements. The Chifley Gothe facts that I intend to bring forward later on. In addition to real housing experts there were a few well-meaning committees and desultory do-gooders in Victoria. It was left to a Commonwealth Labour government to attack with vigour, imagination and courage the terrific social evil of slums, bad housing and the lack of shelter which had been a running sore in the nation from the early days of its settlement. Nothing had-been done about it until the Labour Government acted. The Labour Government regarded it as an immense social evil requiring adjustment, and not as a favorable investment. Private enterprise in those days saw housing as a profitable field of investwith houses. It did not, and could not, ment. So it was hands off the landlord after the Lyons Government had been returned to office. The jerry-builder, the investor looking for a fair thing, and the enterprising real estate agent with his pockets bulging with blueprints of new developments miles from transport, were is their hey-day. But still no houses for the people! Statistics indicate that even in 1939 few houses were being built for rental. Overcrowding was the natural order. Ownership of slum property was considered "" the thing"" for dear old ladies of Vaucluse and Toorak, provided an agent handled the matter for them and they were not personally embroiled in vulgar demands for bath tubs, drainpipes, gas stoves and lavatory basins. Jfr. Haylen. After the war the ful l horror of the housing position hit the nation between the eyes. When the .Chifley Government decided to do something about housing, despite its limited constitutional power, the commission that it appointed discovered that the nation was short of 300,000 houses, and that 60,000 houses a year would be required to meet new housing demands. Add to that the 12 per cent, of new people Australia had acquired by immigration, and the size and difficulty of the problem is readily gTasped. We maintain that that problem is not now being vigorously tackled, and that a planned approach to solve it is not being made by the Government, which is ready to bail out at the slightest provocation. Up to date 57,220 dwellings have been, completed under the housing agreement, a number which, added to private building, has not taken care of current vernment, however, built plenty of houses at a price at which the worker could afford to rent or buy them. It did a marvellous job, although it was faced by shortage of man-power and materials, because those were the days of restriction. The position is different to-day, when there is. a wealth of man-power and materials available, and the inhibiting factor in relation to housing is money and money alone. The Chifley Government could not get soldiers out of the Army to build houses and could not get the saw mills and brickworks working at once. Yet in the face of these difficulties it dotted the landscape do as much as it hoped to be able to do, but at least it gave an earnest of its desire to provide houses for the people. To-day the shocking thing is that the only factor that is keeping housing in such a stranglehold as it is in at present is neither the lack of men. nor shortage of material, but money. The Labour Government did not solve the vast housing problem, for the reason? that I have stated, but it cleared thp debris, opened the road and was set fair to reach its yearly housing target when it left office. It was a game which took patience, care and, above all, good faith. The incoming Liberal-Australian Country party Government faced an infinitely easier problem. Man-power and supplies were becoming easier to obtain. Costs were not unduly inflated at that time, but soon became so under tbe rule of liberalism. Here was a chance for the Government to cope with the housing problem by carrying on the good work of its predecessors. But what did it do ? It began by slashing the housing grants by millions of pounds. It talked of money when it should have been concerned with humanity. It threw the plans of the State housing authorities into confusion and set back the housing plan in this country for at least ten years. But here is the grievous and unforgivable thing that it did. It threw carpenters, bricklayers, builders' labourers, plumbers, electaking as my yardstick, built 3,842 homes. tricians, plasterers and painters out of work and put them on social services relief. It threw ^overboard the old axiom that a progressive and fully employed building industry is the best indication of full employment. It preferred to put skilled tradesmen on the dole for the first time in fifteen years. That was the beginning of the decay of the housing programme in this country. The job that was tackled with great pride and vigoiir by the Labour. Government has become the plaything of this Government. 73ecause of the inflationary problems it faced, the Government did not want its share in the housing scheme. It believed that houses could not be usefully built in a time of inflation. Cheap money is ^ essentia], but the Government has neither the wit nor ithe wisdom to follow the dominating policy of the Labour party and the trade unions that cheap money is the requisite basis for the development of Australia. For that reason the Government is in a cleft stick. Having created the wrong climate for a great housing programme, it decided to starve the scheme to death. Here are the reasons for, and the evidence of, that fact. home an extremely mixed blessing. In the The figures that I shall cite relate to New South Wales, where the problem is most acute and costs are highest. However, the problem in New South Wales is a fair sample of the overall problem. The figures that I shall give are extremely interesting and I hope they will convey the whole of the balanced argument that the Labour party makes in relation to this matter. In 1949 the Chifley Government gave £16,748,000 to the States for housing. With its share of that sum the New South Wales Government, whose figures I am quoting, built 3,403 houses at an average rental of 32s. 6d. a week and at a cost of £1,93S for a three-bedroom house and £1,773 for a two-bedroom house. These were reasonable prices and reasonable rentals. They meant that the purchase' of a house was within the reach of a worker aggressively determined to own a bome. How different are the figures and the prospects under the Menzies Government, which expended £30,000,000 on housing in 1952. With its share of that money the New South Wales Government, which I am again According to statistics, the houses built by the New South Wales Housing Commission cost £3,246 for a three-bedroom house, and £3,060 for a two-bedroom house, and the average rent is between £3 15s. and £4 a week. These figures show dramatically the deterioration that has occurred as a result of inflation. The results of inflation could not be illustrated more poignantly than by a comparison of the prices of houses in 1949 with the prices to-day. I reiterate these prices briefly. In 1949 the cost of a three-bedroom house was £1,938 and the rental was 32s. 6d. a week. Practically the same number of houses was built out of a huge grant in 1952 but the cost of a three-bedroom house had then risen to £3,346 and of a two-bedroom house to £3,060, whilst rents had risen to between £3 and £4 a week. These figures are from the research data provided by our own admirable service in the Parliamentary Library, and by the reports of the New South Wales Housing Commission and other housing authorities. In the firstplace, the Liberal party-Australian Country party coalition, by inflation, has made the winning of a housing commission second place, it has starved the scheme of money in a desperate attempt to deal with the inflation that its own policy has created. The Government boasts of 10,264 homes completed as being the best record of construction to date. Let us see how it achieved this target. In New South Wales again, the housing figures were cut by £6,000-;000 for local building, and die programme fbr prefabricated houses was reduced from 8,000 to 851. The target of 3,S42 houses for New South Wales in 1952 was made possible only by an additional grant of £2,000,000 which the State Government made when it saw the spectacle of the Housing Commission gearing itself for a gigantic effort to take I shall quote clause 6 so that honourable up thehousing lag in this, the most populous State of the Commonwealth. It saw the programme fall to pieces when the Commonwealth grantedonly £8.000;000, although it had asked for £14,000,000 fbr housing. The Housing Commission had planned to spend £1.4,000,000, and,, most important of all, it had themen and the materials with which to carry out its plan. Had that money gone into the channels through which it was mtended to flow, the whole scheme would have sung on to success. As if was, a blight descended on it. The remnant of the plan washeTd together, but there was tragedy in the camp and the bousing position deteriorated and. has conand Housing Ministers gather around tinued to do so. The sabotage of the housing plan has been thorough and consistent. Three factors are required for housing to be efficient. Eirst, there must be control of the present unbridled inflation. Secondly, the States must have ample funds with which to carry om their building programmes. Thirdly, there must be plenty of men and materials with which to do the work. In the first place, inflation has not been checked, even by the crude device of freezing the workers' quarterly cost-of-living adjustments and letting' costs in industry go unchecked. In the second place, the Treasurer's belief that he can cope with inflation by sabotaging housing and public works has proved disastrous and the people showed that they were aware of the position in a recent gallup poll which indicated that the Government was facing certain defeat. Tn the third place, the States had the men and the materials and were ready to go on with the work. But shortage of money, not for the monstrous. He has been in a frenzy first time in our rough island story, was about it for years. Isi t that his prothe means by which frustration and decay fessional pride is piqued that so much real were again to become the watchwords. My estate is out of his reach, or is it that belief, as a layman, which is shared by he is ignorant of the social implications many legal men of experience and distincon this subject? At least he is honest, tion, is that the Commonwealth and State because he said elsewhere long ago, when Mr Haylen. Housing Agreement has been-sabotaged by this Government. The-breach occurs under clause 6 of theagreement, ih which the Commonwealth agreesto find' the money and the States agree to build the houses. There is no. ceiling to the amount to be provided, except',, of course, the general productivity and income of the nation. members will realize that the Treasurer has far exceeded his rights in his cavalier treatment of the States. It statesThe Commonwealth will advance to eauli State the moneys expended, in tlie carrying out of a housing project orthe moneys that shall hereafter be required asnotified to the Commonwealth. Treasurer. It is obvious that the States havemuch wider rights than may be dictated by the Treasurer's whim in making handouts. The Treasurer has imposed alimitatipn by tacking housing on to the loan programme and cutting the* grant up like so much ready-cooked sausage, so much here and so much therej while the Premiers like Oliver Twists to ask for a little more. In the light of clause 6 of the agreement, it is clear that the States have not received fairtreatment. The Treasurer's conduct has not been in accord with either the spirit or the letter of the clause. If this matter were testedand perhaps some day it will be tested*there would be a surprise in store for the Government. Many honourable members on the Government side of the House do not believe in this housing agreement. They have inherited it from the Chifley Government, and therefore they do not like it. It is interesting to note the opinionsof the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) on this issue. He, perhaps, expresses the tory Liberal point of view. He would like to see the end of the housing agreement. He addresses the House on this issue like a good Rotarian, waves his glasses in. the air, and tells us that the agreement is lie was frenziedly campaigning for a sat in this ParliamentThe Commonwealth and State Housing -Agreement is an insidious national tragedy . . . intended to be tlie basis of thc Uliifluy socialist State. 'l'hat being his view, how can the honourable gentleman sit behind the Governnieut and support the expenditure of millions of pounds under the agreement? lie is one of the sound men of the Liberal partj'I might even say one of the sound and fury men. His contention about the housingagreement makes my argument nil thestronger, and therefore the proposed amendment carries greater weight. There S'hould be a;n investigation by the proper authority to determine whether, in fact, this Government has not broken the terms of the housing agreement. There is an atmosphere of bad faith about rhe matter to-day which should be investigated in the interests of all. Perhaps the. quaintly phrased view of the honourable member for Bene'longthat the housing agreement is a national tragedy is now the view of the Government and it is trying to escape by the back door-in short, by cutting down on money and raising the interest rate. Both acts, or either, would do tlie trick. And, presto, something else would bo handed back to private enterprise, along wifch Commonwealth Oil Henneries Limited, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Commonwealth' line of ships, Trans-Australia Airlines and the rest of the Government-run projects whose only sin was that they were profitable and of use to the people. If the Government is trying to escape from the housing agreement, it should say so. If not, it should arrange for a. conference on housing problems and'straighten out the situation. There: is anotherproblem which re> quires a considerable amount of thought and an honest, human approach. refer to home-purchase. South Wales thore are 26j.000 tenantsof t he Housing Commission... I understand, although the figure cannot be. checked, that there are 50,000 tenants of. such home* ini the va-rious States. Ninety per cent, of them at least,, to hazard am estimate, would like to own theirhomes, even at the inflated prices of some of the more recently built cottages: However, they find themselves in an extraordinary and intolerable position when they seek permission to purchase their homes, because they are required to pay cash on the knocker. They are not accorded the facilities that are provided in ordinary commerce. The Opposition asks that this gigantic and scandalous anomaly be removed immediately. I ask the Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes) to give consideration at least to this aspect of the proposed amendment so that these people> many of whom havewritten to every honourable member in this House, .may be given an opportunity to pay for their homes on reasonable terms-, including provision for them to be accorded some equity for the rent that they have already paid. As. the Government has said, » contented home-owneris a good citizen. Here is an opportunity for the Government to help to make good citizens. The State Housing Ministers have asked, not once but on five separate occasions, that fi, conference be called to iron out these difficulties that arise under the terms of the housing agreement. However, this Government has ignored or evaded their requests. It still has not made up its mind. On yet another point on housing and the agreement there appears to be some confusion: I have seen advertisements in Sydney newspapers which urge the people to invest their money in the next Commonwealth loan so that the Government can build beautiful blocks of flats. That is absurd. The funds for housing do not come from loa.ns. They are provided from revenue. When tlie Chifley Government was iu office, it opened loan campaigns secure in. the knowledge that they would be oversubscribed in a few days without the adventitious aid of snide advertising.. The Government should put an end to this sort of misleading advertising. I wish the loan every success, and I believe that I it will be successful, but there is no need In New to befog the weary people of Australia any further about the housing problem. T come now to the nub of the situation, the interest rate. The original agreement provided that the interest rate should be 3 per cenfc Under the terms, of* the agreement the interest rate to-day is 4-J per cent. Thia ii* a crippling charge. The honourable membei"" for Bennelong and several other Government supporters have expressed an opinion on this issue that I should like to quote. The honourable member for Bennelong said on one occasion that the only factor that deterred any man or woman from owning a home was the high interest rate. Then let us have a conference on the subject if we are dedicated to the building of houses for those who need homes. Let us see what we can do about the interest rate instead of allowing it to rise with inflation so as to make it impossible for any ordinary person to own a home. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Minister to clause 6 of the agreement and Eulme) has expressed views which, fov a Government supporter, are even more radical than thoso of the honourable member for Bennelong. He has suggested that all housing loans should bear interest at ihe rate of 3 per cent, initially, 2 per cent, after five years, and 1 per cent, after ten years, finally becoming interest-free after twelve years. I wonder whether the honourable member, when he returns to this House like the gloomy Dane to-morrow, will be prepared to eat his words or to vote with the Opposition in support of the amendment. I repeat again our demand for an immediate conference of the parties to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and appeal to the Government to be reasonable with the States, especially in relation to its interpretation of clause 6 of the agreement. The Treasurer should not say in a loud and angry voice, "" Take it or leave it"". He has a solemn obligation to honour the terms of the agreement under which the States do all the work and the funds are provided by the Commonwealth from the revenue from uniform taxation. I maintain that there has been a definite breach by the Commonwealth of both the letter and the spirit of the agreement. The interest rate under the agreement is too high whether it is applied or not, and the whole housing structure will crash, as it has crashed before, and as this Government probably wants it to crash finally, unless money is made available cheaply for housmg. It is futile to talk about an interest rate of 4£ per cent, or 5 per cent. The Minister for Works, in a fit of frankness recently, spoke of white elephants in Canberra, with particular Mr Haylen. reference to the new administrative building, which, he said, would cost more than its utility would ever justify. The same result will emerge from the Oommonwealth and State Housing Agreement unless the interest rate is reduced. There will be "" Menzies Mistakes"". ""Fadden Follies"" and ""Kent Hughes Kennels"" all over the country unless the costs of housing commission homes, and interest rates, are reduced. The Opposition, I repeat, fears that there has been a serious breach of faith in relation t.> the housing agreement. It refers the invites him to say whether he, too, believes there has been a breach of the terms of the agreement which has resulted in a grave disservice to the States. We ask him to convene a conference so that he can obtain the views of the State Premiers and Housing Ministers on this most important matter. We ask him also to consider urgently-h e could do that without holding a conference of Ministersthe desirability of permitting workers to purchase on easy terms the houses in which they are living, so that they will be on all fours with the rest of the community and will not continue to suffer under a disability because of their inability to buy their houses on a cash-down basis. They should be assisted to buy them. We point out to the Minister tbe urgent need to do something about interest rates on money for housing. The housing programme of this country should be above party politics, because it is founded on the wants and needs of the people. The Government cannot shelter behind inflation or outmoded nonsense about banking. The Labour party can show the Government the way to reduce interest rates, if it is prepared to listen to our advice. A meeting of authorities charged with the control of housing in this coimtry would be of great Aalue. Housing schemes r are being delayed because the Government has priced itself out of the housing field. Rents are too high. Houses are too dear to buy on a cash basis, but tenants are prohibited from buying them on easy terms. The interest rate on money for housing is so high that, in the final analysis, it may be the last straw that will break the camel's back. If the Government continues on its present path, houses will not be built. We appeal to the Minister to consider the suggestions contained in the amendment that I have moved. seconded ? ment. for Works( Mr Kent Hughes) to speak to the amendment.

I am sorry that the honourable member for Parkes does no.t understand parliamentary procedure better than that, although he has been in this House For much longer than I have. His statements about a breach of faith by this Government .reminds me very mucli of a statement made by Mr Olive Evatt at a housing commission conference that I attended .some time ago. The honourable member must have been briefed by the Premier of New South Wales. All his quotations and figures relate to New South Wales. There has been no breach of faith on the part of this Government. When .1 .attended .a -conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers as the representative of a State, the late Mr went .astray. The people who have Chifley, who was then Prime .Minister, said, after a certain proposition had been put to -the conference, "" Gentlemen, the vote is in the affirmative but the answer it is correct. is in the negative"". Did the honourable member for Parkes consider that to be a hreach of faith on the part of Mr long discussion about the desirability of Chifley? Mr Chifley was then Prime Minister and Treasurer. When a man holds those responsible positions, he has to make certain decisions. This Government decided to make more money .available for housing.

I know that inflation has increased the price of houses, but .1 know also that, compared -with previous years, the number of houses and flats completed in Australia increased greatly last year.

He said that the then Government was examining the whole matter so that it would have some plans available as to what the future organization of the Commonwealth and the States in that field ought to be. Every one at that conference recognized that the matter was extremely complicated, and, moreover, no agreement was reached between the State Premiers themselves at the conference. It should be remembered that the agreement cannot be amended until it expires if the State Premiers do not agree among themselves to amend it. Mr Chifley also said that the attractiveness of any scheme would depend to a large extent on the rate of interest on the money that people believed they ought to pay in order to own their own homes. He pointed out that he had no desire to see any government become a universal landlord in either the Federal or the State the rate of interest charged should have sphere. He further said that his Government was taking a very active hand in the business of home ownership, and that more than 40 per cent, of the homes provided under the war service homes schemes had been provided in the preceding four years. He said that that was because the Commonwealth Government undertook the responsibility of finding the loan money. As Minister for the Interior, I have personal knowledge of the difficulties in the housing field that face us in Canberra, and although they are possibly of greater magnitude than most of the States have to face, nevertheless they indicate the nature of those common difficulties. The problem associated with adequate housing is not confined to Canberra, and it must be solved for the whole of Australia. I could put otlier arguments before honourable members, but I do not think that I need take up any more of their time in discussing this measure. believe that I have said enough to, show that the Government has no particular quarrel with the principles of the amendment except that it is impossible to hold an immediate conference. The Government cannot accept the first two lines Mr Kent Hughes. of the amendment, because it requires this bill to be passed so that while State Premiers are deciding how they should amend the scheme and while the Commonwealth is also considering the matter, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement will continue in force. If the agreement should not continue, then there will not be merely a few persons out of employment as the honourable member for Parkes mentioned; there ""will be large-scale unemployment because of the stoppage of all work under the Commonwealth and State housing schemes. For those reasons I have not been impressed with tbe arguments of the houorable member for Parkes, and the Government cannot accept the Opposition's amendment. personal explanation. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) stated that I misled the House about the rate of interest charged on houses built under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. He said that I said that been 3 per cent, and not 4J per cent. all moneys had been lent at 3 per cent. advance should bear interest at a rate not exceeding the rate payable in respect of the long-term Commonwealth public loan last raised prior to the date of the advance, or if a loan were being raised, at the date of any advance, then that advance should bear interest at the rate paid in respect of the long term loan then being raised. They are practically the exact words that I used and consequently I say that the Commonwealth is bound by the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, and that the Minister misrepresented me. personal explanation. I did not misrepresent the honourable member for I Parkes at all. I said that all advances under the agreement had been made at the rate of 3 por cent., although the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement entitled the States to charge long term Commonwealth bond rates.

I misrepresented the facts. member said that the interest rate had been raised, and it has not been raised. the statements made by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes) the Labour party has always supported the principle that the people should own their own homes. At various times misleading statements have been made by honourable members on the Government side to the effect that the Labour party is not in favour of home ownership. That is not correct, and it has never been correct in the history of the Labour party. ""No party has done more in the interests of home ownership than the Labour party, and the records of this Parliament prove that quite clearly. Therefore, when this measure came before us to authorize the raising of £37,200,000 for housing purposes under the CommonAvealth and State Housing Agreement, honourable members on this side were of the opinion that the measure was capable of improvement. Our amendment seeks to improve the bill, and to carry further our objective the agreement. However, from 1945 to of encouraging home ownership.

Judging by the enthose authorities have done outstanding thusiastic reception of his speeches by work in housing the people. The Victorian supporters of the Government, there is State Housing Commission has done all a considerable body of. opinion on that side of the House in favour of scrapping the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The people of Australia should realize what such an attitude on mean. If the agreement should be scrapped, the States would be forced to raise money on their own account because the Commonwealth loan-raising facilities would no longer be available to them. Of course, if the States had to raise the money very few houses would be built in the future, and that would have a very bad effect on housing schemes throughout the Commonwealth. The Labour party has nailed its colours to the mast. We believe that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement has been successful, although the passage of time has demonstrated that it is capable of improvement. This amendment has been put before honourable members in an attempt to so improve it. Before the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, the Victorian housing authority, raising money through the Victorian Government, was able to build only 1,300 houses at a cost of £1,250,000 in the first five years before 1953, under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, the Victorian GoHonorable members on the Government",61,Second Beading

162,Mr Bird (Batman) [10.9],"Despit ethat is possible under the existing legisvery good one, for wishing to sell its lation, and I should like to pay public tribute to the particularlyfinejob it has done for those who found it extremely difficult to obtain houses. The Minister has put before us to-night the minutes of the conference held in Canberra in Pebruary, 1953, when the Victorian Government made certain representations to the Prime Minister in relation to tenants being able to purchase their own homes. I am satisfied that the policy of this Goundertaking, wishes to ensure that the vernment is one of procrastination. It just cannot make up its mind whether or not it wants to alter the act along the lines suggested by the Victorian Premier. The reasons for that procrastination are not very difficult to find. It is because of the division within the ranks of Government supporters, many of whom want the agreement scrapped altogether. Therefore, the Victorian Government or other State governments that want to make the purchase of homes by tenants much easier than it is under present conditions cannot hope for much from this Government. The Labour party is the only party in this Parliament that has a worthwhile scheme for meeting the needs of prospective home purchasers. When it made submissions to the conference in February, 1953, the Victorian Government said that it was prepared to guarantee the repayments of prospective purchasers, the tenants of to-day. If the purchasers defaulted in their hire-purchase payments over the years, the Commonwealth nothing, because the State guaranteed that the instalments would be paid to the Commonwealth authority. it is practically impossible for a tenant to buy a home unless he happens to inherit money. If a tenant wants to buy a housing commission home, his ability to obtain finance depends upon the current trend of the money market, and also on bis possession of a substantial deposit. Under the Labour party's proposals, it would be much easier for a tenant, because we propose a low deposit, and the money would be repaid over a number of years. The Victorian Housing Commission is in agreement with the proposal of the Labour party in this Parliament that tenants should own their own homes. The commission has another reason, and a Mr Bird. houses, because the cost of maintaining its properties is continually increasing. Housing commission homes in Victoria are maintained at a high standard. They are repainted frequently and all the plumbing and other repairs are done promptly, but the maintenance bill is assuming very large proportions. Consequently, the Victorian Housing Commission, which is a very business like cost is kept to a minimum. Last year, it cost the Victorian Housing Commission £320,000 to maintain existing properties. In Victoria, our experience in regard to the purchase of homes by tenants has not been very happy. Only 96 sales have been effected. It is imperative that ways and means should be found of increasing the number of house sales. The present position is simply crying out for reform. While this Government is in power, the present position will not be improved, because half of the honourable members opposite do not believe in a housing agreement. The position might be different if they were really sincere in their protestations that tliey stand for all sections of the community, and that they stand for home ownership. However, because of their opposition to the proposed amendment I do not think they do. This proposed amendment merely seeks to accelerate a policy that will enable the tenants to buy their own homes under an easy purchase plan. The Government Government would lose should immediately discard its policy of inertia, and realize that there are many thousands of tenants who pay rent withAt present, out the slightest prospect of ever owning their own homes. This system, which prevents a. tenant from owning his own home, produces mass frustration and is insidious in its effect on individual and national morale. It is time the National Parliament reorientated its idea of housing and amended the agreement as proposed by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) in order to provide every encouragement to the potential home-owner. Another problem confronting the Victorian Housing Commission, and concerning which the Premier of Victoria made representations at the conference held here last February, relates to shop construction in housing areas. In Melbourne, at any rate, the housing commission developed large areas of land as housing settlements, in some cases comprising SOO or 1,000 homes, but they are far from the existing shopping facilities. The housewife is compelled to travel long distances in order to make purchases to maintain the home from day to day. In tbe planning of such areas sites have been reserved by the commission for shopping centres, but it has been possible to develop these shopping centre reservations could very few of those centres because State funds that were available at the inception of the agreement are now exhausted. If , as has been suggested in Victoria-bu t only half-heartedly, because even private enterprise is not very keen about it private enterprise were allowed to develop these shopping centre reservations, further delay would be involved, and extreme dimculty would be experienced by the commission in ensuring a proper range of tradesmen to meet local needs. It would be difficult to ensure, also, that shops so erected would not be of a mixed design or subsequently neglected and thus constitute permanent blemishes within the estates. The housing commission informed the State Government of this difficulty. In my own electorate, I was called upon to explain to about 300 tenants of housing commission homes that thc housing commission could not build shops to save their wives travelling up to distances of three miles to shopping centres. I had to explain also, that the Victorian Government, at the request of the housing commission, had made representations to the Commonwealth Government as to the admissibility under the .agreement of expenditure upon shopping centres, but the Commonwealth Government rejected it on the rigid interpretation of the agreement which makes np provision for shopping facilities, although they are a natural concomitant of any housing project. Certainly, the act should be amended to provide for shops in housing settlements, because at present great hardship is inflicted, particularly upon the housewife. The position in Victoria is very acute as a. result of this rigid interpretation by the Commonwealth Government which prevents the Victorian Housing Commission from erecting shops on its estates. The problem has assumed serious proportions, and there is great discontent amongst the tenants of very many settlements. For example, the settlements at Heidelberg, Maidstone, Ashburton, ""North Jordanville, East Eeservoir and East Preston are crying out for shopping centres. I suggest that, without drifting very far from even the most rigid interpretation of the agreement, the problem of the development of be solved by the erection by the housing conimission of two or even three story structures with lock-up shops on the ground floor and flats let to tenants in the normal way on the upper floors. In this way the residential purpose of thc buildings would be retained to a very considerable degree, whilst at the same time catering for local shopping needs. The housing commission in Victoria has not been able to satisfy quite a number of people. I understand that there are about 14,000 or 15,000 people whose names are on the housing commission books who have not yet received much satisfaction. It is quite easy to understand just why those numbers are very high, because the greatest obstacle to people acquiring their own homes, metaphorically speaking, under their own steam, is the high rent or purchase price required. Present home prices have risen by 350 per cent, to 400 per cent, above those of 1939. In that same period, the basic wage has risen by 212 per cent., retail price's have risen by 146 per cent., and food prices have risen by 192 per cent. As I mentioned, home prices have increased between 350 and 400 per cent. The intending home purchaser who wants to purchase a house without the assistance of any government-constituted authority such as the War Service Homes Commission, finds that the loans for building have not kept pace with the steady rise in the cost of living. In 1939, the State Savings Bank in Victoria allowed a maximum loan of £1,500 for a house. To-day, it is only £2.000, an increase of 33^ per cent. The War Service Homes Commission allowed £950 in 1939. It now allows £2,750, an increase of 190 per cent, on the 1939 figures, but even that is not enough, because to-day the intending home purchaser finds that the cost of an average two-bedroom timber or veneer suburban June, 1952, they borrowed £6,525,000, villa is between £2,650 and £3,500. With but in the year ended the 30th June, 1953, the cost of fencing and paving and the they were able to borrow only £5,050,000. cost of land, the price of the house and The borrowings were reduced as a direct its surroundings jumps to between £3,000 result of the credit restriction policy and £4,000. In Victoria, as in quite a number of Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Carver, other States, there are co-operative housmake one shudder at the future of housing schemes, but they have received absoing in Australia. To say the least they lutely no assistance because of the credit are most disquieting. Mr Carver stated restriction policy of this Government. that 64,457 houses were commenced Tn Victoria, the maximum amount that during 1952-53, which represented a fall home-builders can borrow under the coof almost 20 per cent, from the 80,000 operative housing scheme is only £2,400. houses commenced in 1951-52. That deTherefore, if they want to build a house cline was the direct result of the malthey have to provide a deposit of £1,000 administration of this Government in in hard cash, as well as provide for furniapplying its vicious credit restriction ture. It can be seen that it is practically policy. Mr Carver also said that 76,000 impossible under existing conditions for houses were completed during 1952-53, a young couple to commence the battle or .1,289 fewer than in the preceding year, of life without considerable difficulty. If and that the number under construction they do get a home under the conditions at the end of June, 1953, was 70,891, or I have mentioned, when they pay back thc 12,187 fewer than at the 30th June, 1952: loan in weekly instalments and pay rates, Surely the Government cannot be insurance, and perhaps pay for roadpleased with those figures. It is merely making and sewerage, they must find at paying lip service to the ideal of home least £5 a week. That means that, with ownership.

That figure is far in excess of the 15 per cent, which was regarded as a safe maximum built in Australia decreased as the result prior to the war. Those are frightening of the policy applied by this Governfigures, and they show in no unmistakment, but also the number of persons able manner why the housing commission engaged in the home-building industry in Victoria has such a large number of has considerably dropped.

The figures recently published by the Acting Not only has the number of homes the Victorian Housing Commission rentals fixed during the quarter ended the 30th June, 1953, were as follows:-TwoTwobedroom ThreeType. slcitpout. s. d. Brick Brick veneer Timber 64 0 66 0 69 0 The commission is very perturbed about these high rentals. It realizes that many people who have been living under deplorable conditions for years cannot afford to take the opportunity of securing a housing commission house because of the high rent charged. The commission desired to find a method of reducing rentals. Under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement rents are calculated in accordance with a formula set out in the first schedule to the agreement. Thei formula contains six items, only one of which is constant, namely, annual amortization, which is the amount which the housing authority is required to pay annually at the appropriate loan interest rates on the capital cost of the dwelling over 53 years. The remaining five items are dependent upon conditions which are outside the control of the Commonwealth. As the sole revenue of the Victorian Housing Commission is obtained from rents, which are calculated in accordance with the formula, no reduction of rent can be made unless it is accompanied by a reduction of the commitments of the commission. The commission has made representations to the Commonwealth that the period of the amortization allowance be extended from 53 to 73 years. If that were done the rental of a house which is now fixed at 40s. a week could be reduced to 37s. 5d., and a rental of 60s. could be reduced to 56s. l d . a week. These are not large reductions, but they would constitute amove in the right direction and would be of some value to the tenants who experience difficulty in paying the high rents required of them. The Victorian Government has submitted a very good case to the Commonwealth urging that the amortization period be extended to 73 years. The period of 53 years was originally fixed as the estimate of the life of a house, but events have shown since the agreement was made in 1945 that the life of a house may be considerably extended by proper mainbed mom. and bedroom. tenance and repair. The houses owned by the Victorian Housing Commission are maintained at almost 100 per cent, effis. d. s. d. ciency. The commission expended more 71 0 74 0 76 0 than £300,000 on maintenance work alone 67 0 69 0 71 0 last year. Thus, depreciation is but a very minor item and the amortization period might well be extended to 73 years, able member any figures to show how maintenance costs compare with the rent paid by the tenants? assured me that maintenance costs are increasing, but that it regards such expenditure as good business and it is confident that the houses which it has erected will last for possibly much longer than 73 years. We should make a concerted effort to reduce house construction costs. The Victorian Housing Commission has shown laudable endeavour in that direction. It is always looking for better and more economic methods of construction. Becently the commission built a new group of flats with pre-cast floor slabs and load bearing walls. I am assured by the commission that this innovation will result in a reduction of rental of the flats from £3 l is . to £3 6s. a week. The commission is adopting the very latest construction methods. Another grouch that the Victorian Government has against the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is that it is unable to obtain sufficient money to provide for slum clearance. The Victorian Housing Conimission has commenced the rebuilding of a slum area .in Fitzroy. able member's time has expired. It was interesting to hear the extraordinary remarks that were made by Opposition members on the subject of housing, particularly when one realizes that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement which was so extensively discussed by the two Opposition members who have spoken on the bill",62,Hughes Th E Honorahle The Part Of Government Supporters Might

166,Mr Cramer (Bennelong) [10.40],"to-night waa the direct product of the Labour party and that it was intended to provide money for the creation of a tenant community. When the agreement was first proposed by the Ohifley Government it was challenged by the then Opposition. The bill to give effect to the made in connection with housing in agreement was piloted through this House, by none other than the well-known socialist, Mr Dedman, who then occupied the position of Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. When the then Opposition challenged Mr Dedman on the question of home-ownership he replied in the phrase which has become known to every person in Australia, ""We do not want the people to become a nation of little capitalists "". That statement is on record and cannot be denied by Opposition members, no matter how they may try to wriggle out of it. The Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes) has very effectively replied to the amendment so proposed by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). We see nothing obnoxious in the proposal that a conference of Commonwealth and State representatives be held to consider the agreement and in the people who are now tenants becoming the owners of their own homes. Indeed, that is in complete accord with the ideals of this Government. But to accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes would be completely foolish. I do not know whether the honourable member realizes that money for the housing programme comes from loan funds and that the amounts allocated to the States for that purpose were agreed to by the State Premiers at meetings of the Australian Loan Council. To all intents and purnoses the amounts allocated were the amounts approved by the State Premiers themselves. I do not think that it is necessary to reply in detail to the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Batman( Mr for these properties will, by reason of Bird) because obviously neither of them know very much about the housing problem. Indeed, the honourable member for Parkes knew so little about it that he read almost the whole of his speech. Both honourable members merely repeated the parrot cry of the States. The housing agreement and the position in which we Mr Cramer. find ourselves to-day in relation to it is the visible evidence of a hangover from the previous Labour Government's socialist orgy. The honourable member for Parkes paid me the compliment of repeating statements which I have Australia and the application of this agreement. I have repeated those statements over and over again ever since J have been a member of this House. In every speech I have made on housing I have urged the Government to cancel or alter this obnoxious agreement. I make no secret of the fact that I believe that it is most dangerous and objectionable. I shall give honourable members some examples of the inherent dangers of the agreement. First, it is a most powerful instrument that one could imagine to bring about complete socialism. Secondly, it creates a frustration to home ownership and encourages irresponsible citizenship. Thirdly, it discourages personal expression and pride in family life and ultimately lowers the national standard of housing. Fourthly, it places private citizens at a complete disadvantage to compete with the State governments in the acquisition of land, the supply of building material, the provision of services and the employment of labour. Fifthly, it creates an atmosphere of insecurity in the investment of private capital in real estate and building. Sixthly, it is wasteful and uneconomic and places an unknown liability upon the taxpayers. Seventhly, the provision of and commitment for large sums of money for renting projects by the States curtails the availability of finance to assist home ownership. Eighthly, in the hands of unscrupulous Labour governments it can, and has in fact, been used for manipulation of electorates and for preferential party political purposes, and finally if the agreement is allowed to continue over a number of years, the State Government organization that provides maintenance the conditions of the agreement, be immense and cause colossal losses to the nation. Those facts are sufficient to show that this is a very dangerous agreement. Only a year ago the Labour party in this Parliament and in all the States was f u l l of praise of the achievements of the agreement and of the State housing commissions that were established under it. While the Opposition was sounding these praises, however, the housing position in Australia was becoming progressively worse. I shall not deal with the position in Queensland -at length, because the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) will no doubt -deal with that subject, but it is public knowledge that the Queensland Housing Commission, particularly in relation to its handling of prefabricated houses with money provided under the agreement, has -engaged in action that is little short of a public scandal. Only recently the New South Wales Government appointed a special committee to investigate the operawonder the people are revolting against tions of the New South Wales Housing Commission, and was shocked by the state of affairs disclosed by the investigation. houses. Because housing is a politically nothing new. It was such a shock to the Labour Government in New South Wales that it is completely divided about what it ought to do with this socialist baby. Some members of the New South Wales -Government want to hand the Housing -Commission's activities over to the Rural Bank, and others want to hand it over to the State Department of Public Works. Still others want them abandoned altogether. The investigation disclosed that there was a backlog of more than 33,000 unsatisfied applications for Housing Comwe have our Cahills, our Cains, and mission homes. While that backlog has been in existence the commission has been wasting money in . resuming land unnecessarily, and it has been stated that it is holding, in subdivided and unsubdivided areas, up to 50,000 lots. Cumberhave done very little about it. I chalsome overhead and the general cost -structure have reached a stage at which it of the Labour party generally, in regard is impossible for the people who are offered such homes, after having waited for them for a long time, to -commission is obliged to charge. The -committee disclosed that the commission -expects to finish 900 homes in the next six months, but that 540 of them would have to be rented to people who are now in housing settlements, and only 360 could be made available to meet the backlog of 33,000 unsatisfied applications. The honourable member for Parkes mentioned the great block containing 309 flats which the New South Wales Housing Commission has built at Milson's Point in Sydney. That block will cost more than £1,250,000 and the rents that will be asked for one-bedroomed flats will be as much as £4 a week. The New South Wales Government has made regulations to prevent families with children from occupying such flats. It is little wonder, therefore, that there is at present a demand for the amendment of this piece of socialistic legislation. The New South Wales Auditor-General recently disclosed that the losses incurred by the New South Wales Housing Commission had reached the colossal total of £1,228,923. No the operation of this socialist measure and against the socialist idea of building popular subject and because the Labour party knows that this Government stands for home-ownership and will no doubt do something about it before the expiration of this agreement, we have heard ceaseless propaganda from all over Australia in the last six months about housing. We should not forget that this agreement is the brain child of the Labour party, and that all that this bill seeks to do is to give effect to the agreement, which does not terminate until 1956, ten years after it was adopted. That is the only reason I shall vote for the measure. But now our Gairs in the various States crying out to the Commonwealth that they want to finance the sale to the tenants of housing commission homes. They have been a long time thinking about it, and lenge their sincerity, and the sincerity to that matter. The facts do not justify the claim that the State Labour governments wish to sell these homes to the pay the rents that the tenants, but show that since the inception of the agreement the total amount of money expended, excluding the amount this bill provides for, is more than £141,000,000. More than 57,000 houses have been built by the various States. Each State has said from time to time that it would sell these properties to the tenants, but in New South Wales only 4.5 per cent, of the properties built by the Housing Commission have been sold.",66,Hughes Th E Honorahle The Part Of Government Supporters Might

172,Mr Cramer,"I shall not waste certain controls were enforced includingM maladjustment of accommodation is evident. Nobody who occupies a rented cottage that is still subject to control ever gives it up even if only one person lives in it where one lived before or vice versa, because they dare not lose it. That is the result of the obnoxious controls that exist in Victoria and New South Wales in particular. Another type of housing accommodation consists of the owner-occupied houses that are not subject to controls. They are affected by the same vital changes in the disposition of families as time passes. A house that was not subject to control in 1939 could not possibly be lot now to the satisfaction of the owners. No one will let such houses because they will not subject themselves to existing controls. In all the suburbs of the capital cities and throughout Australia there are numbers of honies that have always been owner-occupied. The accommodation in many of them is not occupied to 25 per cent, of their capacity because of controls. An authoritative calculation indicates that 70,000 more families throughout Australia eould find homes if the housing that is available could be adjusted properly to the requirements of the people. I make it clear to honourable members that I am not advocating an arbitrary removal of rent controls in their present form. That would cause a great deal of difficulty and much injustice to certain persons who are not able to pay the rents that would be asked, but the matter could be adjusted gradually within the economy. No harm would be done if rent controls were removed immediately from all new buildings and all old buildings that were not previously subject to controls. If those controls were removed, the use of those buildings would be obtained. If that action is not taken, the dwellings will not be available for the people generally. No new dwellings for rental will be built. Another problem associated with housing is the financing of houses by the issue of new money. The idea has been held by all governments and by those within this Government that new money should be applied to new homes and that preferential treatment should be afforded that class of housing finance. That has I lie effect of freezing the free transfer of existing homes to such a point that it has had a detrimental effect upon the building industry and the proper use of homes. A ll those factors are operating against the welfare of the people. If the housing problem is to be solved and, if the building industry is to be stabilized and costs reduced, those objects will be attained only by the free transfer of all real estate in a competitive market and the restoration of confidence in private investment. Unless that is done the housing problem will not be cured except by a socialist State. It is of no use to cry that the problem cannot be solved. All that is required is an honest approach to the problem by the Australian Government and the State governments together. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Cahill, urged recently that this matter should be taken out of the realm of party politics. I agree that housing is too important to be made the subject of party political argument. The happiness of many people is at stake and so also is the future of this country. It is time that the Commonwealth and the States approached the problem honestly together. I believe that a pledge should be given by all governments that every citizen shall be given the inalienable right and opportunity to own his own home. That is the most worthwhile charter that could be given to the people. It can be done if we have courage and longsightedness. I believe that a national housing fund should be established as part of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank and that it should make money available to the people for home ownership at a low rate of interest. cent, and 2 i per cent, if possible over a long term of years so that the finance would reach the people directly, not through housing commissions and State governments, but through agencies that had contact with the people, such as the building society movement throughout Australia, which was initiated by a non-Labour Premier, Sir Bertram Stevens, and has done magnificent work. It is not fully developed in States outside New South Wales, but it could be one of the agencies to provide money for the people.

That is of great importance if we wish to preserve the proper freedom of the able member's time has expired. people. Only in that way can justice be done. As a first step, there should be a national conference on housing. However, before the conference is held, the Premiers and the representatives of the Australian Government should obtain the advice of experts who are familiar with housing problems. I am afraid that many individuals at the head of affairs in the States-I do not want to mention names-are ignorant of matters in relation to housing with which they are required to deal. Often, when they speak at conferences on the national housing problem, they do not know what they are talking about. The housing problem should be discussed in complete honesty. A conference to deal with specific diffigovernment in 1945. The other honorculties that have arisen should be called at the earliest possible moment because the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement cannot be effectively amended unless the relationships between the Comsuffered by people in his trade who have monwealth and the States are completely overhauled. Many matters are at fault under the housing agreement, and these must be set right. There is much more at stake than the sale of Housing Commission homes. ""We are in agreement on that point. There is no dispute about it. The governments of Australia should ascertain at a national conference the means by which widspread home-ownership can be made possible under conditions that people portion of home-owners in Australia, can afford to meet. There should be a frank discussion at the conference of the fundamental causes of the obvious but, not necessarily real housing shortage. The delegates should get down to tin-tacks and ascertain the full facts. Finally, there should be a proper uniformity of approach by the States to existing controls. The present system should be examined with a view to inducing confidence in the investing public. Unless this is done, our houspublic instrumentalities alone. The day ing problems will never be satisfactorily solved. I sincerely trust that Ministers who take part in such a conference will obtain expert advice from men who Mr Cramer. thoroughly understand the subject of housing and its associated difiiculties. right off the track unless they heed such Two honourable gentlemen on the Goverument side of tlie House have participated in this debate. The first to speak was the Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes), who did not speak with very great conviction on this subject. All one needs to point out about his administration of the portfolio is that he held it for no more than a year before its title was changed from that of Works and Housing to Works. This was because his first year of office nearly coincided with the conclusion of the first financial year in which the present Government so gravely flouted, defied and broke the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which was inaugurated under a Labour able gentleman, the honourable member for .Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), I concede, spoke with great conviction. He spoke with all the conviction and frustration been baulked and irked by the fact that housing commissions result in fewer commissions for the sale of land and fewer continuing commissions for the collection of rent. He referred to a nation of tenants. That aptly describes the condition of this nation before World War II . One of the most significant social changes of the last decade has been the increase of the prowhich has been a direct result of the policy of Labour governments in making finance readily available for those who want to build homes and finance them over the course of their working years. We believe that it has been a desirable change. If there are to be landlords in Australia, the inevitable tendency is that they shall be public instrumentalities, and of the private landlord is gone.

If thc honourable member for Bennelong is sincere in his criticism of this measure, he can easily do his part to bring the housing agreement to an end.

178,Mr Whitla M,"If the provisionhas benefited Liberal voters as much as it has benefited Labour voters. voters, whether they have houses and shops in the suburbs or rooms in the city, have the occupancy of their premises secured by the landlord and tenant legislation of the various States and they rejoice in the opportunity of having to pay only pre-war rentals. Liberal businessmen would be the first to object if any Liberal party leader advocated the removal of rent controls and the removal of restrictions on evictions. Surely that is the test of the sincerity of the honourable member for Bennelong on this subject. I shall now indicate the breaches of the Oommonwealth Agreement which have been committed by the Government. In 1951-52, the State of Victoria claimed and, under clause 6 of this agreement, was entitled to receive £16,000,000 for public housing. present Government refused to give the Victorian Government more than £9,000,000. In the same year, the State of New South Wales sought, and should have received under the agreement £14,000,000. It was given £S,500,000. I'll the last financial year the States asked approved at the meeting of the Australian. for £47,000,000 They said that they could spend that amount and therefore they were entitled to it under the agreement. The Government fo'bbed them off with £30,000,000. In this financial year the States have asked for and are entitled to receive £50,300,000, and they have been fobbed off with £37,200,000. Honourable members will notice that this year the South Australian Government will receive £4,500,000 under the agreement. That allocation will reduce the amount available to the other four States-New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and AVestern Australia-to £32,700,000, which is only £2,700,000 more than they received in the previous year and which represents the smallest increase that the Government has ever made in allowances under the agreement. It is the smallest proportional increase that has been made in any of che eight years in which the agreement has been in force. It is plain that the Government has broken this agreement. The right honourable and learned Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the honourable and learned Minister for Supply( Mr at a later date. Beale), who passed through the chamber Mr Whitlam. a few minutes ago in such splendid Liberal regalia, and the honourable and learned member' for Balaclava ( Mr Joske) will not deny that fact. They are tongue-tied because the agreement has been breached. South Australia will not fare very well in this, the first year that it has benefited from the agreement. It asked for £5,000,000 and will receive £4,500,000. New South Wales asked for £17,900,000 and will receive £12,450,000. Victoria asked for a similar amount and will receive £12,000,000. Queensland asked for £5,400,000 and will receive £4,500,000. Western Australia asked for £4,125,000 and will receive and State Housing £3,750,000. The States asked for those amounts at the last meeting of thc Australian Loan Couneil. The Minister for Works said in his second-reading speech that these allocations had been The approved at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council. This matter has nothing to do with the Australian Loan Council. The Commonwealth is bound by an agreement to provide this money and the Minister has merely endeavoured to evade the issue by stating that the matter was Loan Council. If the Government does not like this agreement it can put an end to it. However, this subject was considered at the Australian Loan Council meeting, where the Commonwealth Coordinator-General of Works reported on it and stated that the States could carry out works to the value of £284,000,000 if they could obtain the necessary finance. He recommended the approval of that sum. He said' Funds arc sought primarily to meet commitments and to enable work in progress to continue. Works in progress require £210,071,000 in the coming financial year an;l continuance of housing, even at the present tempo, involves a measurable quantity of new works. The Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works recommended the allocation of £2S4,000,000 to the States for housing and other works. The Government will allow the States only £200,000,000. It has reduced the allocation for housing from £50,300,000 to £37,200,000. I ask for leave to continue my remarks Leave granted; debate adjourned.

A number of proposals have been canvassed at Geneva in connection with the Japanese application for admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs nnd Trade and the Australian delegation is keeping the Government informed on developments. However, it would not be desirable to indicate publicly, while negotiations are proceeding, the instructions the Australian delegation have been given. 2. Whatever may be the outcome of tlie discussions at Geneva, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade cannot be made effective between Australia and Japan except wit h the specific consent of the Australian Government. I assure thc honourable member that the Government will be guided by Australia's best interests in this matter. the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr of bagasse newsprint with interest,-but it is B -[40 ] Wentworth) asked the f o l l o w in g quest i o n :Is the Prime Minister aware that a technical report was recently presented to the Congress of tlie United States of America regarding the residues left after the extraction of sugar from sugar cane? If the Prime Minister is aware of this report wil l he hnve it examined by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial liesearch Organization witb a view to ascertaining whether its conclusions are adaptable to Australian conditions? I now advise the honourable member The answers to the as follows:I presume that the report referred to was a statement made by the Secretary of Commerce (United States) and reported on page 4924 of Olicmicdl and lUnyinCeriny Neics of thc 24th November, 1952, which reviewed investigations into the manufacture of newsprint. These investigations were made at the request of the Anti-Trust Sub-Committee of the House Judiciary Conimittee. The ComOrganization has seen the statement and has reported on the possibilities of the project from an Australian viewpoint. The United States Bureau of Standards studied seven existing procedures including four preparatory processes for the manufacture of paper from bagasse. The work was carried to pilot plant stage and the newsprint produced was used by the United States Government Printing Oflice to run 100 copies of a sample issue of the GongresxioHUl Record. The samples were considered satisfactory by a panel of newsprint executives of leading newspapers. Production costs, including costs of raw material, electric The answers to the power, steam and chemicals were estimated to be about 1.0 per cent, lower than the corresponding figure for newsprint made from wood. The De La lloza process produced a satisfactory paper and the other processes showed promise for successful development. Newsprint is produced to-day on high-speed paper machines usually operating in the region of 1,500 feet per minute. The requirements for such high 1 speed operation are exacting and during the process of formation of the paper, particularly when it js in the wet web form, careful control must be exercised. It was therefore felt necessary to carry out further investigations into the producing of bagasse newsprint on a standard paper machine at commercial speeds and its use in fast runs un a standard newspaper press at economic speeds. It is also considered necessary to study more carefully the economic factors aflecting availability of bagasse in the United States and its territories, including demand, storage, falling and transportation of the raw material. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is watching the development",75,Victoria State Electricity Commission

191,,"Mr MENZIES -On the 15th September,considered that further development overseas would be necessary before the installation of plant in Australia should be contemplated. Until a larger measure of success is achieved overseas the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization does not think it desirable to spend time investigating in Australia such matters as availability of bagasse for newsprint, cost of replacement of bagasse by other fuels and other facts affecting the cost of the raw material. The positiou regarding surplus bagasse has changed appreciably over thc last few years in some areas due to the introduction of different'types of cane, and further changes eould easily take place before it is necessary to consider the installation of an actual plant producing newsprint from bagasse. Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is taking steps to see that it is kept fully informed of overseas developments in this respect. Ori thc 15th September, the honourable member for L e i c h h a r d t ( MrB r u c e ) asked the f o l l o w in g question:The question that I wish to ask the Prime( MrL u c h e t t i ) asked the f o l l o w in g quesMinister relates to his promise to investigate t i o n : a report made by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to the a statement on the refusal of ihe Capital honourable member for Mackellar.

If the Prime Minister is not in tbe facts. I ask the Prime Minister to find a position to make a statement on the matter out whether the report furnishes an estimate at present, will he cause inquiries to be of the cost to the millers and the growers made, witli the object of providing an adequate tlirough thc loss of thc bagasse as a fuel. I answer to be made to the charge that conl ask him to ascertain what the cost would be development in the western New Soutli Wales lo the millers of completely altering the district is being retarded by lack of finance? boilers in order to use other forms of fuel.

'GOVERNMENT .LOANS ANDFINANCE . tlie honourable member for P o r t A d e l a i d e ( MrT h o m p so n ) asked the f o l l o w in g question:W ill tlie Prime Miuister inform the House whether the Government will re-consider the terms of the current Commonwealth loan? The terms of the loan provide for the issue of long-term and short-term investment, but in the cose of the short-term loan the minimum amount that may be invested is £1,000. Many persons are prepared to subscribe xo the short-term loan, at the lower rate of interest, because they do not want to tie up their money for a long period. W ill the Government consider reducing the minimum subscription, to the short-term loan from £1,000 to £100 at the same rate of interest? I now advise the honourable member as follows:All short-term issues of public loans raised since 1947 have been subject to the condition that the minimum subscription is £1,000. It was evident, from analysis of the results of short-term issues prior to that date, that short-term securities did not appeal to small investors and that printing of bonds of the smaller denominations was not warranted. Therefore, the minimum subscription for shortterm issues after the date stated was fixed at £1,000 with the approval of the Australian Loan Council. This limitalion can, of course, The Commonwealth be removed or modified by the Loan Council, and is in fact already under review, but it is now too late to do anything in this direction in connection with the public loan now open. the honourable member for M a c q u a r i e Is the Prime Minister in a position to make It appears t h a t the in q u i r y relates to a in the L it h g o w d is t r i c t.
