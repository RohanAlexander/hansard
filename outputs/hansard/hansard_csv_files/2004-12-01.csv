A long-planned ceremony to mark the raising of the freedom and heritage flag at the Vietnam War Memorial in Cabravale Park was planned. The memorial is one of very few in Australia which commemorate the service of Australian forces in the Vietnam War. The memorial has two bronze figures. One is an Australian soldier and the other is a soldier of the army of the Republic of Vietnam. This fine memorial was dedicated in 1991 by the then Governor of New South Wales, Peter Sinclair. Earlier this year the New South Wales chapter of Vietnamese Community in Australia approached Fairfield City Council, proposing to jointly meet the cost of erecting two permanent flagpoles at the memorial. Council erected the flagpoles and last Sunday’s ceremony was planned to mark the raising of the Australian flag and the freedom and heritage flag of the VCA. I should point out to the House that the freedom and heritage flag consists of three red stripes on a yellow ground and is therefore similar to the flag of the former Republic of Vietnam, or South Vietnam. Apparently word got out about the raising of the flag and concern was expressed by the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam through our embassy in Hanoi and also through their embassy in Canberra. As a result, Fairfield City Council was advised by DFAT that it was not the practice of the Australian government to fly the flag of former nations. Similar concerns were expressed to council by the office of the New South Wales Governor and the office of the Premier of New South Wales. Who would have believed that flying a flag in Cabravale Park would create an international incident! But Fairfield City Council was placed in the awkward position of meeting the request of a large and important local community in the face of strong pressure from governments. Before making representations to council I checked with the Vietnam Veterans Federation, which had no objection. While council has allowed the flag to be flown on special occasions, it has not approved it to be flown on other days of the year. This has left the Vietnamese community very upset and angry. It is entirely appropriate that the yellow and red flag be flown at the Vietnam War Memorial. Many members of the community fought side-by-side with Australian forces. They have the right to fly their flag, honour the sacrifice of their fallen comrades, be proud of their heritage and hopeful for their future.

BILL (No. 2) 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 is the second major piece of legislation designed to implement the recommendations of the Keniry inquiry, which was set up in the wake of the Cormo Express fiasco. The review of the livestock export sector, undertaken by Dr John Keniry, made a number of recommendations that focused on strengthening the regulatory framework for the sector. Most of those changes were contained in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (Export Control) Bill 2004. Labor amended that bill to strengthen the accountability of the industry through the minister to the parliament and to the wider Australian community. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 is designed to give effect to the second aspect of recommendation 2 of the Keniry review: Industry should be responsible for research and development and management of quality assurance systems to support its members to translate best practice standards into outcomes consistent with best practice: its activities should be funded by compulsory levies. This bill provides a legal framework for the collection and disbursement of a new compulsory levy which will fund the research needed to drive improvements in this industry and in the way it conducts itself-especially research into ways of ensuring the ongoing welfare of the animals being shipped and traded. This bill is similar to the one that was introduced by the government in August but which failed to get through all stages in the parliament before the election. The previous bill that was submitted by the government was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for a thorough examination. The legislation we have before us today in the Main Committee incorporates the sensible recomMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Statements By Members
240,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),Order! In accordance with standing or,156,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment
241,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (10.00 A.m.),"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestrymendations made by that committee. Once again, Labor has been able to use the processes of this parliament through the Senate committee system to improve legislation put forward by this government. In the end, the recommendations of the committee were supported by both Labor and coalition members of the committee, and the government has incorporated most of the recommendations of that Senate committee in the bill that we have before us today. The bill provides the basis for introducing greater flexibility for the disbursement of funds derived from the collection of compulsory levies by allowing for an industry organisation representing livestock exporters to be determined as a marketing body and as a research body for the purposes of receiving revenue derived from a compulsory levy applied to the livestock export sector, and by enabling the matching funds provided by the Commonwealth for research and development to continue to be provided to an industry research body. It is expected that the minister will determine LiveCorp as the industry marketing body and as a research body for the purposes of receiving revenue derived from the compulsory levy. This bill will allow the compulsory levies to go directly to that body. LiveCorp would then decide how those funds would be used, within parameters set up by the legislation and subject to the statutory funding agreement. In the past, most research in this industry has been channelled through Meat and Livestock Australia. While, under this legislation, LiveCorp will now be responsible for its own research and development and will be accountable for it, it is expected that much of its research and development will continue to be channelled through MLA. This is because only MLA and not LiveCorp is eligible to receive dollar for dollar matched Commonwealth funds for research. In its explanatory memorandum, the government has stated that it does not anticipate that these new arrangements will result in any increase in the matching Commonwealth funding for MLA. The government has based this assumption on the premise that LiveCorp is unlikely to increase the contribution it makes to MLA above the current level derived from existing voluntary levies. In evidence given to the Senate inquiry, Commonwealth officers offered the view that the limitation on the Commonwealth’s dollar for dollar matching funding for MLA research and development is an incentive to keep contributions at current levels and not to increase them. If we look at the bigger picture in this whole agricultural industry services area, since 1996 the Howard government has privatised the research and development functions of key industry sectors in agriculture, including the meat, horticulture, wool, pork, egg and dairy industries. We on this side of the House have not opposed these privatisations outright, but we have objected to the minimal accountability arrangements proposed by the government. Labor amendments have strengthened some accountability arrangements, including, with respect to the dairy industry, the tabling of the industry owned company annual report and financial statements related to levy and matching payments expenditures. We need to keep in mind that these particular bodies are in receipt of significant public moneys. In the early stages of the development of these statutory funding agreements, there were significant structural weaknesses in the statutory funding arrangements that were being proposed by the government. Industry owned service bodies are directly accountable to industry members under Corporations Law. However, they are also accountable to government through a funding contract specifying requirements, including audit, access and reporting obligations. MAIN COMMITTEE The accountability provisions now included in this bill are at least equivalent to similar measures Labor and the minor parties have forced on the government, such as those that now apply to the operation of Dairy Australia. We on this side of the House were not satisfied that the accountability measures included in the similar bill presented to the previous parliament did measure up to the standards that we have insisted upon in the past for bodies such as Dairy Australia. That is one of the reasons why we referred that bill to a Senate committee, and of course that Senate committee has made recommendations relating to the statutory funding agreement and to the tabling of LiveCorp’s annual report in the parliament by the minister. These particular accountability requirements came out of recommendations that were made by the Labor Party and coalition members on that particular committee. It is a matter of public record that the Democrats opposed this particular trait and opposed those particular recommendations at the time. However, they were supported by government members who saw the wisdom of tightening up the accountability arrangements in this particular piece of legislation. I find it quite extraordinary, and it just amazes me, that with all its recent experience with similar privatisations the government tried to foist the original bill on the industry and on this parliament. We all know that the incompetence of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in this area knows no bounds. Single-handedly, his incompetence almost brought this industry to its knees. Of course, we have had the Deputy Prime Minister admitting that government policies in relation to this particular area of policy have failed and have gone off the rails. That is a scathing indictment not only of the minister but also of the government that he represents, because when the red meat industry comes into disrepute in the eyes of the public over animal welfare issues it really does cast a shadow over the whole industry. When I get around to farmers, as I do in this portfolio area, and when I talk to industry leaders, they are aghast and appalled that a minister of the Crown could let the situation in the live export area drift to the extent that the whole red meat industry’s reputation was called into question in the wake of the MV Cormo Express fiasco. We all know the particular incident, and we know that on that particular voyage the larger issues dealing with animal welfare and mortality rates in this industry were not so much an issue mutially, on the voyage itself. There were particular circumstances in the Middle East and actions of government that exacerbated a difficult situation. But when you go back and look at the history of the industry, the lead-up to the particular incident was where we saw the monumental failure of policy and the incompetence of the minister. That is what has got so many red meat producers angry-angry that their livelihood and reputations have been besmirched because of the actions of a few live exporters who have failed to maintain the integrity of the standards one would expect from a civilised agricultural producer like Australia. When I spoke to those representatives some five years ago, in the early days when I took on this portfolio, I put the live exporters on notice that either they cleaned up their act or I would clean it up for them if we ever got into government. I made it quite plain to them that better standards were expected of them in an animal welfare sense. Most red meat producers in this country are acutely aware of the need to maintain appropriate standards of animal welfare which meet community expectations. Most of them do it day in and day out on their farms and further up the value-adding chain. Therefore, it is a greater disappointment when MAIN COMMITTEE they come to the highest levels of government, where regulatory frameworks are put in place, that a minister is so incompetent and fails so miserably to insist on appropriate standards, puts the trade in jeopardy and puts the reputation of red meat producers generally in an unfavourable light. There is an increasing awareness in rural communities generally and in the red meat sector that appropriate standards of animal welfare are now being insisted upon by the Australian community and that this issue will overtake those communities and the red meat sector if action is not taken now to insist on the highest standards in every dimension of production and trading arrangements in this sector. That is the reality of a red meat producer’s situation today. I think farmers appreciate it, and that is why they insist on these standards on their farms. It is disappointing when we see elsewhere in the value-adding chain that people do not meet their particular responsibilities. Labor has always insisted on strong and appropriate accountability mechanisms for moneys collected as compulsory levies and where matching Commonwealth funding may be involved-even if, as in this case, that matching funding comes indirectly through an organisation. We will continue to insist on appropriate accountability arrangements. That is why I was staggered when the government introduced this legislation. Having had the benefit of experience over many, many years of debating these new structures in this parliament and having had the Senate committee system examine deficient legislation that has come out of the minister’s office and from the government on these matters, the government then comes onto the floor of the parliament again with a bill that fails to address some fundamental accountability arrangements for this sector. In doing so, it fails the genuine live exporters and it fails the red meat industry. That is the reality. Here we are again going through a process whereby we put this legislation to the scrutiny of a Senate committee. At last we have got in the legislation recommendations that were agreed upon collectively by Labor and coalition members of that committee. If that does not tell the minister something, it ought to. Of course, it leads one to question what will happen to these sorts of issues once 1 July comes around and the government has command of the Senate. On our side of the parliament, we will be watching those developments with interest, but I do have some confidence-not in this National Party minister, who has failed the red meat industry, but in the Liberal chairman of that committee, because on most occasions when I have had cause to deal with him on these matters, he has been able to put the interests of primary producers above partisan politics, consider the issues and bring his considerable expertise to bear on these matters in the interests of farmers. WhilstI have no confidence in the minister and neither do many primary producers, because he has essentially lost control of his portfolio, looking to the future we are relying on the goodwill that had been built up in that Senate committee process to ensure that these matters are appropriately examined in a bipartisan way in the interests of primary producers. Let me put on the public record that we on this side of the House will cooperate in a genuine way with the Liberal chair of that particular committee to ensure that primary producers’ interests are represented. I have no confidence that the minister has any control of this particular area of policy, because his past performance speaks for itself. Almost single-handedly, his incompetence nearly brought this trade to its knees. Indeed, as a result of his incompetence there are MAIN COMMITTEE now large and significant questions being asked in the public arena about whether this trade should continue. If public debate moves against the trade to the extent that public pressure restricts the trade, nobody needs to come back to the opposition, because we have done everything in our power to ensure that there are appropriate accountability arrangements in the legislation for the benefit of genuine live exporters and in the interest of the community. It has been the minister’s incompetence that has raised the stakes in the public arena. The blame must be sheeted home and placed at the feet of a National Party minister who in many areas of policy has lost control of his portfolio. It is a matter of public knowledge now that the Prime Minister is running the water debate. During the election, we had the unseemly situation of the Minister for Trade stealing Labor’s dairy policy and, what is worse, making announcements on it. We have seen in the live export area the Deputy Prime Minister taking the lead and taking the running on the issue. The current minister has been sidelined. I have many dealings with the minister. Essentially, he is a decent man. But you have, Minister, responsibilities in your portfolio that you cannot avoid and walk away from, and this is one policy area where your incompetence has put the whole trade in jeopardy. I am pleased that the Senate committee recommendations have been picked up in this legislation. It is important that we get a piece of legislation that is consistent with the standards that are being applied in all other areas of policy. Sensible recommendations have been picked up and placed in this legislation. The red meat industry can be thankful for the good work that was done by our Senate colleagues and the fact that in the past the opposition has insisted that these standards be rigidly applied and proper transparency and accountability arrangements be the order of the day for this parliament. previous speaker, the member for Corio, seemed to imply that it carries a lot of things that it does not. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 in the first instance provides a change to long standing principles whereby in this case the minister will be able to direct compulsory funds-or the matching funds provided by government to voluntary levies-to more than one industry body in the particular industry involved. There is a need for that that I will touch on shortly. That particular decision, overlooked in the original legislation, is not surprising. It has never been the practice of governments, Liberal or Labor, to operate in that fashion, but there were needs in this regard. Those needs have been recognised, and the government brings a simple amendment to the House to resolve that matter. In terms of the sort of aggrandisement of the recommendation of the Senate committee that the member for Corio provided, that is in fact a simple recommendation that has been accommodated by the statutory requirement to be placed on the minister to table the livestock export body’s annual report. That is a worthy recommendation, but it is hardly earth shattering. Of course, once it was drawn to the attention of the minister-who was called incompetent about 50 times by the member for Corio-the matter was corrected, and so it should have been. Transparency is something with which we all concur. But I think it quite remarkable to have this carry-on about the competence of the minister. Furthermore, he made comment on the appropriate standards for animal welfare, and made a clear inference that the industry and those who provide sheep to the exporters do not follow MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment
242,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (10.22 A.m.),"This is an interesting piece of legislation. Thethem. There is no evidence of that whatsoever. In fact, it has been clearly demonstrated statistically, for instance, that the mortality rate of live sheep or cattle being exported has been in steady decline. I am disappointed that I could not lay my hands on a bar graph that I did have in my bag for quite some time. As I recollect, it showed the mortality rate for live sheep exports at below one per cent-which would probably be less than what would occur in a normal farming situation-and for cattle it was something like 0.03 per cent. Unfortunately, we do have mortality in the farming industry out in the paddock for a variety of reasons and some mortality will always occur when sheep are being transported. The issue of community concern has been the gross misrepresentation of this trade by the media. There is no greater offender than 60 Minutes, which we know was quite prepared to produce 10-year-old morgue film relating to how animals were treated on their arrival in another nation-not during the process of live export, but when they got there. Of course, the clear inference was that the Australian people should not be selling animals to these people. They are sovereign countries. They have religious rites relating to the slaughter of animals with which many of us would not concur. They have a need for live animals because their refrigeration and other meat-handling facilities are not up to standard to carry the large number of animals they require. We see media coverage on this from time to time from around the world. The last one I remember was on a cooking show about meat being sold somewhere in China. The meat was hanging up in the open, as it does in many of those countries. That is their tradition, and it is not for the member for Corio to suggest otherwise. Nevertheless, over the years there has been extensive negotiation between governments on this matter concerning what happens to the animals after their arrival. There is nobody in this place who believes-and I am sure neither the member for Corio nor his leader believes this-that they should be able to legislate about what happens in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or Jordan. Of course they cannot, and the reality is that that is a problem with which we have to deal. Furthermore-and he did at least make reference to this-the issue that enraged the Australian people was better known as the Cormo Express. The Cormo Express was kept at sea at the wrong end of its trip, if one might say that, in terms of temperature and all those things. In fact it was stopped, when movement was required to provide the vessel with a degree of ventilation. The reality was that 10 per cent mortality occurred with the sheep that were locked up in those circumstances for some months, I think-or certainly for over one month. They were shipped around the place until they could be unloaded in Eritrea. Anybody who holds that particular journey up as an example of what is normal practice in the export of live sheep is misleading this House. It is outrageous. It was a set of circumstances that nobody wanted. Let me add that the government of course immediately cancelled againquestion? the MV Cormo Express? Did the government have an understanding with the end users that they would be taken off the ship? Why was that undertaking not fulfilled?

245,Mr Tuckey,Certainly.,161,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment
246,Mr Danby,"Can the member for O’Connor tell me the rate of mortality for the sheep onnot know the answer to that. But I have just mentioned that my recollection is that the total mortality rate was 10 per cent, which in the circumstances is surprising. In the circumstances, I would have expected a much higher mortality rate. It is, if anything, an endorsement that the vessel had quite a reasonable level of accommodation for the transport of livestock. It is a vessel that is designed to carry sheep from Western Australia to the Middle East, where it is anticipated that they will be unloaded immediately the vessel is berthed. When I look at what the circumstances were, I am reminded of a comment from a person on that vessel-who I thought was a veterinarian, but maybe not. He said that he knew they were in trouble as the vessel was being tied up, because there were no trucks waiting on the wharf, which was traditionally the arrangement. In other words, the arrangement by which these sheep are exported is that they are loaded expeditiously, the vessel goes to sea where it functions in the best form, and on arrival they are unloaded expeditiously. With the Cormo Express that did not happen. The member for Corio has reminded us that that was something quite different. Let me say that unless we have an arrangement, as I hope is being negotiated, for a quarantine facility to which we have guaranteed access and where any disputes as to the livestock’s health can be resolved by getting the sheep off the vessel then we should never return to exporting to Saudi Arabia. By comparison, the circumstances in Kuwait have been that we have never had a delivery rejected. Is it not amazing that we apparently only select unhealthy sheep to go to Saudi Arabia? Clearly, statistically, that is an impossibility. I think we have to realise that this trade has become quite sophisticated. The quality of the vessels has greatly improved. But in response to community concerns, the government has taken a voluntary code, with some additions, and has made it into legislation so that it can be administered by government officials. Let me repeat that this legislation relates only to two or three issues. The first and most important one is that the minister will be entitled under this legislation to distribute funds accumulated in various ways to a variety of recipients rather than to one recipient, which has been the traditional arrangement. It is a real problem at the moment that activists believe they can take commercial responses to the way in which we handle our livestock here in Australia. I refer of course to the PETA people, who have attacked live export. They would not know anything about it. Some English woman living in America is apparently their spokesperson on these matters. They go to a firm-is it Abercrombie and Fitch?-and say to them, ‘We’re going to walk up and down in front of your shop and we’re going to take out advertisements that say that you are cruel to sheep because you sell wool clothing.’ How Abercrombie and Fitch, in the first instance, would have been able to establish that the clothing they sold was manufactured from Australian wool is beyond me. Furthermore, unfortunately, very few times do you buy a woollen suit in America, relative to their turnover. Interestingly enough, I might add that 65 per cent of our wool goes to China-in particular the higher microns-and the reality is that they have just had controls placed on the export of their socks to America. They have been attracting so much of that market that America has applied one of the provisions available under the WTO to slow down the exports. In other words, while everybody is worrying about Abercrombie and Fitch, who do not sell wool suits in any quantity worth mentioning, the average citizen of America is buying socks that no MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment
247,Mr Tuckey,"I cannot say whether the dead sheep were taken off the vessel. I just dodoubt, to a high percentage, contain Australian wool. I bet they will not stop buying them because of the threats of PETA, who want to get in amongst the American or the European elite and attack us. I was disappointed that the farming and wool growing industry responded in the way they did on those matters. I support their efforts to have less intrusive means of protecting sheep from flystrike. But to suggest that you stop the process until you have something better shows that you have never seen a flyblown sheep. It is in fact true animal cruelty. Isn’t it amazing! I know what I would have done as a response. I would have been walking some of those sheep up in front of Abercrombie and Fitch’s premises to let them have a good idea of just what is cruel and what is mildly cruel. That is one option that is left. But there is another thing in all of this. I am not sure whether they are still sponsors of 60 Minutes, who blatantly misrepresented the circumstances of this. I do not know whether it was a bit of self-aggrandisement or to pick up on a few things. I think one of their presenters has a hang-up about this issue. The last I heard was that the firm Toyota, which would rely heavily on the agricultural sector and the prosperity of sheep producers to market its products, was sponsoring that program. I have told my constituents, while we are in the business of starting to put bans on people’s business, that they had better start looking at who sponsors these particular shows that so aggressively attack our industries. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you know that they have done so with the Tasmanian forest industry in an equally blatant and misrepresentative fashion. It is worth noting and passing on to people who want to parade up and down in front of retail premises some advice given to me as forestry minister by the then national president of the world rainforest growers association. He said: ‘Do you know why all of that smoke is pouring out of Sumatra, blacking out Malaysia and creating all of these problems? The greenies went to the major timber retailers of the world and campaigned in front of their premises to save the rainforests.’ So the people of Third World countries who were getting a revenue from sawn timber through a process that has never destroyed a forest have gone and knocked the whole lot down, burnt them out and replaced them with palm oil. Of course, nobody walks up and down in front of McDonalds and says, ‘Don’t buy this product because it is cooked in palm oil.’ Yet that has destroyed a rainforest and is doing so progressively within Brazil and Indonesia every year. You can go in with a chainsaw and you might even clear-fell but, unless there is massive soil erosion or something, which should be prevented, the trees will grow back. But if you rip all of the roots out and replace them with palm trees, you will see how much rainforest grows there: absolutely none. This is how stupid these people are. They forget another great principle, which is that national poverty is the greatest threat to the environment. When you destroy a nation’s opportunity to invest, produce and export, people take very little care of their livestock, forests and everything else. You do not have to travel too far from Australia to see exactly that. So the sort of negative attitude that is applied is that we should not export these sheep. For a start, if we do not have enough meat works operating in Australia, any move to interfere with the flow will cause the price to collapse. Furthermore, the Middle East will go on buying from Somalia or somewhere else which, maybe unfortunately, deals with the animals in exactly the same way. But there is plenty of evidence that, as a result of our entreaties and those of others, even that particular aspect of the live MAIN COMMITTEE sheep trade has improved dramatically. So, all in all, I welcome this legislation. It is a sensible response to changing circumstances. In fact, LiveCorp will do a good job. Let me say in the minister’s presence that I welcome the negotiations we have, but I must pass on to him a criticism that I frequently hear from those who deal with the Middle East in marketing their products. We do have to conduct our negotiations more at ministerial level. I appreciate the minister’s heavy workload, but the message that constantly comes to me from the people I represent is that, to use an Australian colloquialism, the people over there prefer the organ grinder to the monkey. I do not make the allegation that our officials who travel over there are monkeys. But there is a clear example. These people have their own traditions and they have a lot of princes and others who are given responsibility in these areas. They want us to negotiate at that level and I hope we will. I am firmly of the view, and I have said so in my local media, that it is pointless going back to Saudi Arabia until we have approved on-land quarantine facilities where, if there are any questions over the health of the animals we deliver, they can be off-loaded from the vessel. It is obvious that, as with the use of trucks and other treatments of animals, they are not perfect. Yet they are a necessity for trade-particularly for a country like Australia, which is a continental island and a long way from so many of its customers. I totally support the live sheep trade. I criticise people, including the media, who use emotionalism and arrant misrepresentation to put a slant which is not supported by the statistics on this trade. As I said, on my last reading the mortality rate for live sheep exports is somewhere below 1 per cent, and it is something like 0.03 per cent for cattle. Those are the points I wish to make. I support these particular initiatives, including, of course, the statutory requirement for the minister to table the livestock report. I do not think that the industry has anything to hide. I think that generally they do a good job. There may be other examples from time to time but nothing compared to the threat to the livelihood of many farmers from a fellow chucking ham around in feeders. I think that is what should be reported and prosecuted. thank the members who have contributed to today’s debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, the shadow minister for agriculture and fisheries and the honourable member for O’Connor. I think the honourable member for O’Connor has made a very substantial contribution to this debate, and it is a pity that his comments were not heard by a wider audience. I am sure that he will make sure that some of the comments he has made do receive wider exposure. He did make a number of points that I think are very important in this debate and need to be heard in the wider context. As honourable members will be aware, the MV Cormo Express incident led to the government setting up the Keniry inquiry, which has provided a comprehensive set of recommendations designed to restore confidence in the live animal export industry. Many of these measures are now in place, including important changes to the regulatory regime for the control of livestock trade through the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. These amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Industry Act 1997 that the House is considering at the present time put in place the industry structures and funding arrangements that are needed so that the live animal export industry will be responsible for research and development and management of enhanced quality assurance systems. They put in place a livestock export marketing body and a livestock export research body to receive the funding raised through the MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment

Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd remains as the industry research body and the industry marketing body for the whole of the red meat industry. It alone will receive dollar-for-dollar eligible matching government research funding. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, this bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives-in the previous parliament. It has come back again because there was insufficient time before the election for it to pass through the Senate. The Senate did spend some time on a committee review of the legislation, which made one or two relatively minor amendments. I think these amendments will add to the bureaucracy associated with these arrangements. The original accountability measures were strict, and I think they would have been satisfactory for the purpose. However, I have accepted the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee’s recommendations that, in addition to the other accountability procedures that were already in place, the body’s annual report, the funding agreement between LiveCorp and the government, and a statement of compliance with the conditions of the funding agreement will all be tabled in the parliament. The changes to the legislation incorporate those arrangements. to give way? made by the member for O’Connor that no further live sheep exports be undertaken to Saudi Arabia until they have satisfactory quarantine arrangements on the ground on the other side? fact immediately after the Cormo Express incident shipments to Saudi Arabia were suspended. I made statements at the time that there would be no resumption of the trade until we were satisfied that sheep could be successfully unloaded in that part of the world in the event of there being a dispute in the future. That clearly includes a provision for there to be a satisfactory quarantine facility to take the animals, even if it is only on a temporary basis, while any issues in dispute are resolved. We have also indicated that we would require a memorandum of understanding at a government level to underpin whatever new arrangements were put in place to assure the safety of the trade, should it resume. The Saudis have indicated to us that they are making substantial progress in relation to the construction of suitable quarantine facilities and that they may be available quite soon. However, we would still require the development of a memorandum of understanding to make sure that there are arrangements in place so that a repeat of the Cormo Express incident simply does not occur. The comments that the honourable member for O’Connor made are completely in keeping with the policy announcements that the government has made in the past and with my views on the issue. Returning to the summing up and going back to the provisions in this piece of legislation: LiveCorp will work to ensure its members achieve best practice animal health and welfare.

By providing quality live export measures such as these, Australia is able to maintain a high standard in the international live export trade. The live export industry is an important part of the wider livestock and red meat industry in our country, providing valuable export income for Australia. Indeed, the beef industry and the sheep industry are two of the great icon Australian industries. I take the opportunity of this debate to pay tribute to a prominent member of this wider industry. I refer to one of the leading figures in the Australian meat industry, Mr Masaru Hinohara, who passed away in Tokyo last month. Mr Hinohara, or Ken as he was known widely around Australia, was a director and finally Chairman of Nippon Meat Packers Australia Pty Ltd and played a vital role in supporting Australia’s primary industries and building our beef export market. Mr Hinohara came to Australia in the early 1980s to establish the company’s trading office based in Sydney. He worked tirelessly to grow the company to become the second largest beef processing and exporting operation in Australia. The Nippon group has facilities in Mackay, Oakey, Texas, Toowoomba and Chinchilla in Queensland and Wingham in New South Wales. They all provide trade opportunities for Australia and employment for a very large number of Australian workers. Ken’s presence and drive in the industry will be sadly missed here at home and in Japan. He certainly played a significant role in the development of the Australian meat industry over a large number of years. On behalf I am sure of all members, may I express sincere condolences to the Nippon meat group and management and to Ken’s widow and family in Japan. I commend this legislation to the Main Committee and thank all of those who participated in the debate. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November, on motion by Dr Stone: That this bill be now read a second time. Bill 2004 is not as interesting as the legislation just debated by the House-I suspect we will not be hearing any such colourful contributions during this debate as we heard from the member for O’Connor during the previous debate-but it is an important bill. It makes changes to the rules governing the two main superannuation schemes for public servants. They are the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. The bill deals with the determination of superannuation salary: the level of remuneration that is to be used in calculating superannuation benefits on retirement or resignation. Given the complexity of many of the salary packages for the individuals who will be affected by these changes, it is important that the superannuation salary be properly set, otherwise it creates an opportunity for unjustified windfall benefits. In the absence of legally MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Agriculture Fisheries And Forestry Legislation Amendment
254,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.51 A.m.),"The Superannuation Legislation Amendmentauthorised determinations, it is possible for a salary package to be rearranged to the recipient’s benefit and a challenge made to the validity of a determination. The legislation will affect a small number of superannuation scheme members: senior public servants such as departmental secretaries and statutory office holders whose superannuation salaries for the purposes of calculating benefits on retirement or resignation from the Public Service are determined by individuals or entities other than the schemes themselves. These other individuals or entities include the Remuneration Tribunal, ministers and other office holders in the Commonwealth parliament, and employing bodies that have been authorised to make such decisions by the Remuneration Tribunal Act. The legislation is needed because the determination of superannuation salary under the current law can only be done by the Remuneration Tribunal. The problem of unauthorised individuals or entities determining superannuation salary has arisen because the Remuneration Tribunal has in some cases delegated its authority, which it was not entitled to do, and because some individuals and entities assumed they had legal authority when they did not. The following two problems arise from the current situation. Firstly, it leaves the government open to litigation over the determination of superannuation salary, because the determination has no authority. Secondly, there is a loophole that could be exploited which results in an employee receiving a superannuation benefit far above that justified by the level of contributions made by that employee during their employment. This opportunity to exploit the current system arises because the superannuation salary is determined at commencement of employment and is based on the salary package at the time. The setting of the superannuation salary is meant to prevent employees changing the packaging arrangements so that they can cash out at a higher rate of salary that does not reflect the contributions they have made to their superannuation. The lack of legal authority for the determination of superannuation salary means that it is possible for an employee to avoid it and indeed challenge it in the courts. This legislation gives legal authority to these entities to determine superannuation salary and effectively closes that loophole. The legislation includes provision to protect past determinations made in good faith but without proper legal authority. Labor therefore supports the provisions in this bill. perannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, dry as it may be. There are some very important principles that we must look at here. The issues, as outlined by my colleague opposite, are important. Public Service superannuation contributors need to have their rights and entitlements properly defined, so it is very important that we have the amendments in this legislation in place to ensure that their super entitlements are well and truly carefully laid out and that all the t’s are crossed and all the i’s dotted. This legislation is part of the many changes that we need to be pursuing to ensure that our superannuation entitlements and our schemes across the board in Australia are relevant and are able to move along with the times. The obligations the superannuation schemes of various sorts have and the circumstances within which they must work are changing all the time. We must work to address those issues as well as the overall demographic changes as they apply over time. There are, as we know, many significant demographic challenges that apply in Australia. I think superannuation is one area where they apply particularly keenly. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004
255,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.55 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak on the SuWe of course have an ageing population. People are living longer. Both of those factors mean that our superannuation contributions are facing a bigger burden over time. It is important that we provide for the retirement of all Australians. The age pension cannot remain as the staple source of income for people in their older years. The prime source of retirement income must shift, and it must shift to superannuation. We need to protect people’s superannuation savings. We need to create incentives to boost the average pool of super available to retirees, and we need to avoid occasions where super which has been painstakingly saved is subsequently wasted or lost. Lump sum payouts that do not preserve sources of income for the retiree obviously create a hole in the system that has to be picked up somewhere. Naturally, of course, as usual it is the taxpayer who has to come along and pick up the pieces. People need to be able to enjoy their retirement, but people cannot just blow everything on a world trip and expect taxpayers to pick up the tab. A major problem is the need to make super flexible enough to take into account changes in the economy. Arrangements which were suitable when interest rates were high are no longer suitable when rates are low. If you look across the world, you can see that the economic drivers are many and varied. In Japan, for example, interest rates have been zero per cent for a long time. That is a very different environment, and the types of strategies that people can adopt to provide for their retirement income in that environment are very different. We need systems that ensure that people are able to transit from one strategy to another as the times require. Even the recent surge in the property market that we have seen at home is an example of how changing circumstances can impact on people’s capacity to generate a retirement income. We need flexibility, with basic protection built in. This legislation addresses an important key ingredient in the process. This legislation makes changes to the two main superannuation schemes for public servants and other government employees. The schemes are the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. The legislation changes the provisions that describe superannuation salary for members of the schemes. As the member opposite outlined before, in describing what is someone’s superannuation salary-that is, your salary for superannuation purposes-you need to be very descriptive and exact. If there is any room for debate about that question, quite obviously that debate can be resolved or can be sought to be resolved through the legal process to the benefit of the employee concerned. It may not have been the intention that was initially ascribed to that salary. Where the remuneration and other terms and conditions of appointment for these scheme members are determined under Commonwealth acts of parliament, the bill allows those determinations to set their superannuation salary to be determined for their superannuation salary for the CSS or the PSS. The determinations might be made by a minister, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Remuneration Tribunal or by employing bodies authorised to make determinations under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. The bill validates a number of such determinations which have already purported to have set superannuation salary, when in fact there was no legal authority for this to be done. Of course, it ensures that that any benefit that has been paid or is being paid from the scheme will not be reduced because of this validation. I will have a look at the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, just by way of noting what provisions apply. Members can contribute between two per cent and 10 per cent of their suMAIN COMMITTEE perannuation salary, as outlined and described within this legislation, to the PSS Scheme. The percentage rate of salary that can be chosen will help determine the size of a contributor’s retirement benefit, with the lifestyle that they will subsequently enjoy when they leave the work force. The default rate for contributions is five per cent of salary. There are two basic factors that affect the amount of PSS benefit that a contributor can accumulate. These are a 10-year rule and a maximum benefit rule. Basically, the 10-year rule means that for up to 10 years the employer can contribute a maximum of 16 per cent of superannuation salary, and beyond 10 years an employer can contribute up to 21 per cent of the superannuation salary. The maximum benefit limit that applies does mean that contributions to the scheme, the total amount, can grow to the maximum allowed under the scheme, which is administered by the Australian Taxation Office. So that outlines basically the operation of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. The government has a proud record of supporting flexibility and helping to provide protection for participants in superannuation schemes across Australia. There has been a range of recent initiatives to encourage flexibility. I endorse all those initiatives and encourage the government to continue to strive all the time to refine its legislative program to ensure that we are identifying issues that can assist people and can make the schemes more flexible and more attractive, to ensure that over time we do get a cultural shift-a recognition of superannuation and a willingness to support and rely upon it. Here are a few examples of things that the government has done to provide improved flexibility within the system. Under the schemes and the changes that the government has introduced, couples who split can now split their superannuation. There is now a superannuation spouse rebate which allows individuals to make contributions on behalf of a low-income spouse. There is now a provision that enables proceeds from the sale of a small business, where that sale is being used to create a retirement income, to attract capital gains tax relief, and that of course provides a big incentive to those recipients and is an endorsement of the very valid process to support those recipients in their retirement. There is now also a provision under the government’s legislation for low-cost superannuation accounts, which are known as retirement savings accounts. These can be offered by banks, credit unions, building societies and life insurance offices. Obviously, once again the low-cost nature of those accounts provides an incentive and helps to drive interest in superannuation and support for it. There have also been changes in relation to self-managed superannuation funds. These are important because they are small style superannuation funds. In the past, they could be subject to the full prudential requirements applying to larger funds. Quite obviously, that is something which is overly burdensome and negative; it is a huge disincentive for people to engage in those funds. Those requirements have been blotted out. What we have now is a system in which these self-managed superannuation funds are regulated by the Australian Taxation Office under a system that is far more user friendly. There is dual annual indexation of the Commonwealth civilian super pension. There are 100,000 people involved in that and that twice-yearly indexation in line with the CPI is very important to those participants. A pension bonus has also been introduced. What happens there is that if people defer claiming their age pension and remain in the work force instead they get a tax-free bonus to reward them for making that decision. MAIN COMMITTEE Those changes by the government have been very significant. I want to endorse the need for the government to continue to seek changes and to continue to look at provisions, small as they may be within the system. Today, I highlight the example where we are picking up on just one minor deficiency, targeting it and seeking to address the problems within it. I urge the government to continue to pay particularly close attention to the difficulties of and provisions applying within superannuation legislation. I urge the government to continue to refine it and make it more attractive and to continue, over time, to build a more flexible, cost-effective and less bureaucratic system to enable people to provide for their retirement. The government is doing that and it is continuing to develop these various superannuation provisions into the future. On 25 February this year the government released a policy paper to promote further flexibility and to reduce red tape. I urge members to focus on that policy paper and to continue to offer up ways in which to provide even more incentive. In the 2004-05 budget, a total of $2.8 billion worth of superannuation incentives was announced which are to be introduced over the coming four-year period. Important among those was the inclusion of the co-contribution scheme, under which the government will give $1.50 for every dollar of voluntary personal contributions. That means employees on incomes of up to $58,000 can receive a superannuation co-contribution. It also means that those contributions go up to a maximum $1,500 for employees on incomes of up to $28,000. That range of projected changes has been opposed, particularly the co-contribution scheme, by the Labor Party. The Labor Party has said it wants to abolish the co-contribution scheme. That is obviously a backwards step-we need to be pushing forward with our support for superannuation-and the Labor Party, among all parties, I would have thought would recognise the value of providing such a powerful message to people to be contributing to their super. I urge the government to continue in these changes. I give recognition to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration and others involved in the process and urge them to proceed with this legislation and other legislation in order to provide greater flexibility for superannuation contributors. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (11.10 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to sum up this debate. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is indeed a very important bill. It proposes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, and the rules for the administration of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate, particularly the member for Blair, who made a very important contribution. The purpose of this bill, as the member for Blair said, is to make specific provision to allow the superannuation salary for secretaries and certain Australian government office holders who are CSS or PSS members to be set in certain determinations of remuneration made by the relevant minister or a Presiding Officer of the Senate or the House of Representatives. The bill validates the setting of superannuation salary in such determinations that have been made in the past, while also ensuring that no benefit that has been paid or is being paid will be reduced because of the amendments of the bill. The bill is necessary to confirm the validity of determinations of superannuation salaries, as I said, made in the past, including those of such members who are secretaries of a department. Let me reiterate: this does not reduce the entitlements of office holders. It ensures that MAIN COMMITTEE former secretaries or certain office holders who may have had a benefit based on a lower superannuation salary than an amount set in a relevant determination will be entitled to a benefit based on the higher salary in the determination. The bill will not increase public servants’ remuneration. The amendments confirm the original intention that superannuation for secretaries and office holders whose remuneration is set in a determination based on total remuneration should be based on a component of that total remuneration rather than being linked to their cash salary. The original Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 acknowledged existing arrangements under which remuneration determinations made by the Remuneration Tribunal under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 could set superannuation salary for CSS and PSS members. These provisions were included for the purpose of consolidating all provisions that authorised superannuation salary for CSS and PSS members to be set in remuneration determinations. It has since been recognised that the bill also needed to apply to other remuneration determinations under the Remuneration Tribunal Act-for example, determinations made by employing bodies for principal executive officers within the meaning of the act. The original bill included provisions for validating past determinations of remuneration which did not include any determinations made by the tribunal. The bill will now validate past determinations made by employing bodies under section 12C of the Remuneration Tribunal Act in respect of principal executive officers insofar as those determinations relate to superannuation salary. AgainI thank all the members who have taken part in this debate. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (11.14 a.m.)-Labor supports the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, which will make minor amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. Under the national classification scheme, as many in the House would be aware, the Classification Board is responsible for the classification, on application, of films, computer games and certain publications. The Classification Review Board makes fresh classification decisions in response to an application for review of a decision of the board. The national classification scheme plays a very important role in our community in providing guidance for consumers of film, computer games and literature, but also has a very important role in classifying material provided to it by the Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies who are seeking information upon which to base prosecutions, particularly for the sale, distribution and use of pornographic material and child pornography. It is MAIN COMMITTEE important to note that only applications for classifications that are made by law enforcement authorities will be affected by the changes in this bill. Applications are made regularly by police for unclassified material to be classified by the board, with this classification then being used as part of many prosecution processes. These amendments in the bill will remove any doubt about the validity of decisions made by the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board only where there have been minor technical difficulties in the application process. The amendments will have effect on applications by law enforcement agencies made both before and after commencement. The provisions do not operate to validate classification decisions that might be defective for reasons other than minor technical deficiencies contemplated by the act that are related to the application, nor do they prevent any challenges to a board or review board decision based on some defect in the decision-making process, as is appropriate. Remember also that these changes have no impact on applications that are made by industry for classifications and any defects that might be found in those applications or in decisions relating to them. The classification decision-making process will remain vigorous and interested parties under the act will continue to have the right to appeal. We understand that the government is of the view that all decisions made by the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board remain valid, even where there has been a minor procedural error in the application process. Nevertheless, Labor strongly agrees with the government that it is important that this parliament makes this abundantly clear by the amending provisions of this bill. While it is true that there is an element of retrospectivity in the operation of these amendments, Labor considers that the government’s arguments that the changes are appropriate and will not result in any substantive injustice are sound. Labor has been briefed and, whilst it is not appropriate in this place to discuss the details of any law enforcement applications publicly, we are satisfied that the government amendments are appropriate. It is important, I think, to note that no act which was legal prior to the introduction of this bill will become illegal following its commencement. Labor believes that the parliament has an undeniable obligation to support our law enforcement agencies in their continuing effort to fight against the production, transfer and possession of child pornographic material. This includes removing even the most minor or technical legal uncertainty wherever it may exist. Under these circumstances Labor will support the bill because we believe that all governments, and in fact all members of this parliament, must be clear and unequivocal in their intent to prosecute serious child pornography offences and to take action that ensures that our laws and procedures are appropriate and permit this action being taken. The production, trade and possession of child pornography is abhorrent. There can be no qualifications on our condemnation of it. This parliament would be being derelict in its duty if it did not take every available step to ensure that the trade does not continue. The recent arrest of those found in possession of child pornography by the state and territory law enforcement agencies is a vital part in a worldwide effort to stamp out the production, distribution and use of child pornography. The parliament, we believe, must do all it can to ensure that this practice is stopped and that those involved in such activities are prosecuted. Labor is happy to add MAIN COMMITTEE its support to the measures in this bill that ensure a rigorous classification regime remains and a strong system of prosecution can be based upon it. We commend the bill to the House. speech and thank the Labor Party for their support. I rise to speak in support of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004. What we see can have an effect on the way we think and how we treat others. Children in particular are most susceptible to the learning of bad habits from unrestricted television viewing. Most parents monitor what their children watch on television and what they access on the Internet. Adults too can be influenced by what they see, and can I say the entire advertising industry lives by this truism. As a society we have agreed to regulate viewing by the classification of certain publications, films and electronic games. In this way we have sought to maintain certain standards which the majority of people regard as fair and worthy. Perhaps as adults we may sometimes feel we should be able to view any film, regardless of its content, because we do not expect that it will cause us to act violently or treat others differently. This may indeed be the case in some instances, but when you live in a society you have to remember that not all people react in the same way. Most of us would not drive dangerously even if there were no speed restrictions on our roads, but the laws are there to stop those who would. Most of us would never dream of injecting of poison into our veins, but there are those who do inject themselves with illicit drugs, so we have laws to stop them from injuring themselves and laws which punish the suppliers. Regulation by classification falls into the same category. We have as a community deemed certain things unsuitable to be seen by children of certain ages and a few things unsuitable, perhaps even dangerous, to be seen at all. Indeed, the amendments that this bill will make to the classification act will ensure prosecutions for child pornography and related offences do not fail for technical reasons relating to the applications for the classification under the act. The need for this amendment follows the receipt of advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. We are indeed fortunate to have received such advice, because the last thing any of us want to see is the failure, on a technicality, of any prosecution relating to child pornography. I have spent much of my time, both as a parliamentarian and before entering the parliament, working for the improved safety and protection of children. A whole industry now exists which grows rich on the proceeds of producing and selling pornography. Pornographers seem to go to even greater lengths to make their subjects look younger and younger. Those who actually break the law and use underage models deserve to face prosecution and penalty for their crimes. This bill further strengthens our commitment to combating child pornography and protecting our children. There is an element of retrospectivity in this bill, because it seeks to validate decisions made by the Classification Board or the Classification Review Board both before and after the commencement of these measures. Again, we must ensure that nothing we do aids or abets criminals, particularly those who abuse children. Retrospective legislation is therefore, in this instance, both fair and just. I commend the Attorney-General for bringing this legislation before the parliament. I know that the Attorney is committed to providing adequate safety mechanisms to ensure that children are not abused by pornographers. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2004
256,Mrs Draper (Makin) (11.19 A.m.),"I congratulate the member for Gellibrand on a greatI also wish to commend the Attorney and his predecessor, the Hon. Daryl Williams QC, MP, for honouring the commitment to conduct an operational review of the Guidelines for the classification of films and computer games 2003. The guidelines first came into operation on 30 March 2003, with the agreement of the state, territory and federal censorship ministers. I believe that this review is sorely needed, and I eagerly await the outcome. Members of the Classification Board are asked to make decisions regarding the classification of films and computer games in accordance with classification tools and contemporary community standards. Naturally, there is a subjective element in the decision-making process, and this is to be expected. There will of course be occasions on which some of us may not agree with the classification given by the board, while on most occasions we will agree. I do have strong concerns, which I know to be shared by many in the community, about some of the decisions made in recent times. Keeping in mind that decisions must take into consideration contemporary community standards, I would like to know why a film which included a nine-minute explicit scene of a pregnant woman being raped and beaten was ever granted classification to be shown in Australian cinemas. Whose standards applied when the decision was made? Certainly not mine and certainly not those of the Australian community. I speak of the film Irreversible, which appeared in Australian cinemas in 2003. One reviewer summarised the film as rape, revenge and exploitation with artistic pretensions. Another describes how the camera looks on unflinchingly as a woman is raped and beaten for several long, unrelenting minutes and as a man has his face pounded with a fire extinguisher in an attack that continues after he is apparently dead. I do not understand how the board could give this film anything other than an RC-refuse classification-status. Both the previous and the existing guidelines suggest that sexual violence should only be implied and not detailed. Gratuitous, exploitative or offensive depictions of cruelty or real violence should not be permitted. These are the very guidelines which are supposed to be used by the board when it makes decisions. How can they get it so wrong? We see the continual output of more and more films of this nature, and my fear-and the fear of many-is that many of these films will make it to our suburban cinemas. It is a well-known fact that the increased amount of violence now shown on television and in cinemas has produced a desensitising effect on us all. Something that would have horrified our grandparents barely raises an eyebrow today. We have become accustomed to seeing human mutilation on the big screen, along with every form of sex act and the downgrading of the English language-all in the name of freedom of expression, so-called. With every new form of visual degradation that the filmmakers with their perverted imaginations can produce and show on screen and television, a part of our humanity is diminished. Why is it that we insist on the exposure and punishment of child abusers, yet ignore the fact that our advertisers and filmmakers are depicting erotic and sexually suggestive scenes of childlike young adults to sell their products? How is it that we can decry the incidence of sadistic and violent crime in our communities, yet pay little attention to the increasing violence in films? Are any of us really so naive as to believe there is no correlation between the two? Another film has come to my attention which further raises questions about decisions made by the present classification board. The film entitled Birth has several scenes which can only be described as a paedophile’s dream. First, we have an adult woman offering herself for sex MAIN COMMITTEE to a 10-year-old boy in a restaurant. Later, we have the two in a bath, appearing to be naked, where the 10-year-old boy kisses the adult woman and describes her as a future wife. I have absolutely no doubt that if the sexes were reversed and a 10-year-old girl was being exploited in this way by an adult male the outcry would be deafening. We need to get this right. We need to come to terms with the situation and recognise the dangers of allowing this sort of material to continue to infest our cinemas. We are here today to approve a bill that tightens the laws to stop child pornographers. At the same time, the classification board has given an MA15+ classification to the aforementioned film, Birth. What is even more heart breaking is that, when the Australian Family Association-or any other community group-seeks to appeal against such a classification decision, they are expected to pay a fee of $3,470. Such a cost is obviously a deterrent to members of the community seeking to appeal a classification decision and, in my view, it ought to be reviewed. However, I commend this bill to the House and I look forward to supporting future legislation that will be as equally strong in its defence of children and community standards. tions, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, which in part has some minor technical adjustments in terms of how this Commonwealth legislation will operate and have effect, particularly in New South Wales and the Northern Territory. I understand that both the Northern Territory and New South Wales will be changing their legislation as well to make some adjustments to ensure that the intent of the original legislation is valid, is seen to be valid and can be properly delivered in the way that the originators of the legislation intended. Normally in this House, supporting a bill that has retrospective parts to it is something at which people would look absolutely askance. Rightly, they would be concerned that there was something significantly wrong with making a retrospective application to decisions that have been made previously, that people might have their rights trammelled under that retrospectivity and that there could be a major change in relation to their situation and the situation not only in the community but indeed before the law. But, in discussions that have occurred between the government and the shadow minister, the normal worries that one would have about this have been allayed based on the government’s contention that classifications of materials that have occurred in the past will stand. This bill seeks simply to fix basic procedural problems or difficulties, to cover off problems or difficulties there may be in the states and to ensure that, where people have perpetrated those things which are amongst the vilest acts that any human being can do-namely, the despoiling of young children and the pursuit of that despoliation from year to year, month to month and week to week, and the destruction of those young lives-their convictions can be absolutely assured. The most recent context to this, as we know, is that across Australia there have been very major programs in place for a considerable time. An operation has been conducted by state police in cooperation with federal police and other agencies. That has resulted in a significant number of people being arrested. If there was any possibility at all that, given the current state of the law, any single one of those individuals charged with grave offences might be able to get off on a technicality, I think it would be incumbent upon us as laypeople before the law to ensure that the intent of the original legislation at a state, territory and national level was asMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill No 2 2004

Therefore, we could be asked to correct any deficiencies that are there-not with the fundamental classifications, but simply in terms of procedural matters. I am sure that the member for Banks, a very well-qualified lawyer and practitioner, would be one of those lawyers in the House who would in normal circumstances be reluctant to look at any question of retrospectivity. Or maybe he might not be too reluctant. ments of other legislation and to taking away people’s rights or seeking to deprive people of their liberty through a change in the substantive law, then you would rightly say that, if there was a fundamental change in that substantive law and a person could be found legal ex post facto-that is, after the fact or after they had committed an act-so that they could later be arrested for an act which was legal at the time and then be imprisoned, that is the sort of system you would normally associate with regimes that did not have much time for the rule of law or with banana republics that are known to have virtually no law whatsoever. We are not dealing with that here. What we are dealing with is people who have perpetrated or are alleged to have perpetrated significant and vile acts, where all of the best resources of state, territorial and national agencies have been directed towards gaining evidence on what these people did and closing down a really nasty and vicious gang of people linked with others internationally as part of a trade. It is not just the acts themselves but also the distribution of material related to those acts. Fundamental to this is the distribution through the Internet and other devices of photos and materials directly relating to the originating acts. These are the two areas where properly these people will come before the courts. We need to ensure here that, when they do so, they meet the full rigour of the law without any outlet for some smart practitioner to say, ‘There’s a technical deficiency so they should get off.’ Why should any individual charged with so grievous and heinous a crime as this be able to resort to the fact that there was something wrong in the way the paperwork was done or there was something wrong with the way people interpreted that paperwork? This is strange legislation, but it goes to the reality that young children have been badly and greatly affected and will have their lives completely destroyed by people who have no concern whatsoever for their individuality and no concern for their very persons. They have no concern for the fact that children have been robbed of their own sense of self, not once but multiple times because of the spread of those photos and other materials through the people who are part of this and because they will have to relive what has happened to them once throughout the rest of their lives. I can think of no good reason why we would not support this bill, because it goes to significantly protect those people who are the victims at the base of it. I want to quote the shadow Attorney-General, Ms Roxon, because what she had to say in this regard puts it very neatly. After outlining a similar argument to the one I have put, she said: Under these circumstances Labor will support the bill because we believe that all governments … must be clear and unequivocal in their intent to prosecute serious child pornography offences and to take action that ensures that our laws and procedures are appropriate and permit this … We could do nothing else, because the activities of people who practise paedophilia both here and overseas are such that they affect not just themselves but the youngest and most innocent MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill No 2 2004

We cannot leave any situation open where their safety, their security and their privacy could be in peril. I completely support all of the provisions of this bill. In doing so I trust that, in future, all of those people apprehended under Operation Auxin will be brought to the courts and, where they are proven to be guilty, they will be given appropriate penalties for the vicious and uncompromising acts which they have undertaken. This bill should ensure that, as should the bills in the New South Wales and Northern Territory legislatures. Apparently the significant difficulties that might be there for those two jurisdictions are not there for other jurisdictions. I commend the bill to the House. tion (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 and to see such strong bipartisan support for it. The bill makes minor but crucial amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The amendments contained in this bill relate to the processes involved in having material classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification and to how those processes directly relate to criminal prosecutions of child pornographers. This government is 100 per cent committed to combating child pornography, and the bill arms our various law enforcement agencies with the legislative tools to bring this about. Over the past few months, Australians have seen, heard and read about a national crackdown on child pornography called Operation Auxin. ‘Shocking’, ‘sickening’, ‘appalling’even these words seem inadequate to describe either the apparent extent to which the exploitation of children through pornographic activities has been carried out in Australia or the foul and reprehensible actions of those involved. The scale of Operation Auxin is unprecedented. Almost 200 arrests have been made across Australia, and more than two million-note that figure-pornographic images of children have been seized from computers, videos, DVDs and the like. The general public, quite understandably, has been stunned at the apparent scale of pornographic activities involving children in Australia, but perhaps the most disturbing aspect is the professions of those who have been arrested. School principals, teachers, police officers, child-care centre owners and even an electorate officer have, along with 200 other Australians, been arrested and charged with offences including child sexual assault, child sex tourism and possessing, downloading and distributing child pornographic images. But there are other mind-boggling statistics stemming from this ongoing investigation. Six men have committed suicide since being charged and questioned. As at the beginning of November, 708 suspects had been identified and 469 warrants had been executed Australia wide, resulting in 228 arrests or summonses. A total of 2,260 charges have been laid. Those are incredible figures. The fact that the porn ring had links to organised crime groups in Russia and eastern Europe meant Operation Auxin had wide-ranging and cross-jurisdictional aspects to its nature, involving the Australian High Tech Crime Centre, the Australian Federal Police and state and territory police agencies. Each and every person involved in the crackdown deserves commendation for their work, but as legislators responsible for ensuring that child pornographers receive due attention and punishment befitting their crime we have a direct role. One important aspect of doing this is to close any legislative loophole which will allow these evil people to escape prosecution. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 will do just that. The bill has been brought before the MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill No 2 2004
260,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.38 A.m.),"I am pleased to be able to speak to the ClassificaHouse to ensure that criminal prosecutions for child pornography and related offences are not dismissed because of technical reasons relating to the way applications for classification of material has been made. In short, it will ensure that a classification decision on seized material will not be deemed to be invalid if the application contains some minor error, such as referring to the wrong section number of the classification act. The amendments in the bill only relate to technical errors in the application process and do not alter an individual’s ability to challenge faulty or defective decisions that might have been made by the Classification Review Board. These amendments close a bureaucratic loophole which offered an escape route to child pornographers-an action that all right-thinking Australians would support. Law enforcement agencies need to be given every opportunity to pursue suspects. The overarching problem facing law enforcement agencies when it comes to seizing material or images relating to child pornography-and then when it comes to processing and prosecution-is one of strictly defining exactly what child pornography is. In its 1999 paper titled The commercial sexual exploitation of children, the Australian Institute of Criminology sensibly suggests that assessing such material is essentially a subjective matter. What one person considers child pornography might not necessarily fit the definition of another, according to their different moral, cultural, sexual, social and religious beliefs. As it stands, investigators must have seized material classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification before proceeding with prosecution. That process involves lodging a copy of the seized material and accompanying paperwork with the OFLC and then waiting for the board’s decision. On occasions, quite understandably, law enforcement agencies have made minor clerical errors in lodging the paperwork associated with the material being assessed. Prior to this amendment bill and to complementary legislation which is now being considered by the states and territories, these minor administrative slip-ups could result in a criminal case being dismissed on the basis that an item’s classification could be declared invalid. The amendments contained in this bill are, in a sense, retrospective, because they apply to classification decisions made before their commencement. They will validate board decisions where a defective application was lodged, and they will do the same in respect of the Classification Review Board. To my way of thinking, this is sensible legislation being put in place for the protection of the general community and children in particular. Quite rightly, the community is on its guard against child pornography and paedophilia. I applaud the recent comments by the member for Kingston to join the push for stronger legislation to protect children from Internet sexual predators. This government abhors the abuse of children and underage teenagers. We have a raft of safety measures in place to shield those young people in dangerous situations from potential predators. For example, teaching staff require clearance before entering schools. In some instances, state governments require the agencies not only to give that clearance but also to present printed material attesting to the person’s suitability to enter the classroom. In Queensland I think we refer to that as a blue card. It seems to me wholly and totally inconsistent to go to these lengths to protect children from the moral corruption of potential predators, who might abuse their bodies, without removing the simple impediments to successful prosecutions. This is even more important when we look at the uphill battle we have already faced in terms of ridding Australia of child pornography activities and material. Just one serious obstacle is the all-pervasive nature of the MAIN COMMITTEE Internet and overseas-hosted web sites. The Internet and new digital technologies have many benefits and advantages, but they also have created new opportunities for people with sexual interests in children to produce, distribute and collect child pornography and engage in other types of paedophile activity. The year 2001-02 was the Commonwealth’s first year of censoring Internet content. I remember the debate well. I remember that some members opposite-and I am not saying this in a strictly pejorative sense-argued at the time that, because it was too difficult to do, we should not do it. But the very extent of what we have seen over recent months in the matters I have just discussed-and the way we have seen the Internet abused over recent times-should lead us all to believe that even though these things are difficult we should not duck them. The Australian Broadcasting Authority investigated 550 complaints about Internet content, and around 275 of those involved pornography and paedophilia. Our law enforcement agency estimated that around 85 per cent of child pornography seized in Australia is distributed via the Internet. The Internet gives child sex offenders the means to trade in such material and, more frighteningly, to abuse children. It provides offenders with a forum to access children, identify potential victims, groom them and then arrange to commit offences against children in the physical world. How often we have read in the papers about young, impressionable people being caught up in the Internet and trapped into these situations. Equally, we have heard of police officers who have posed as paedophiles and have been able to crack some of these animals who prey on children, and I commend those officers for their work. The Internet is also a perfect tool for sex offenders to form networks and clubs and exchange information. It is near impossible to get accurate statistics about child pornography activities given that a significant amount of material is exchanged or bartered rather than distributed in the course of formal cash transactions. Notwithstanding the difficulties in quantifying the extent of these activities, the government has already introduced tough new laws cracking down on Internet child pornography, including the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Act (No. 2) 2004. This particular legislation that we are dealing with today is another part of that fabric to close the doors on people who would exploit children and distribute pornography and use it in video games, films and the like. This legislation means that people who use the Internet or the classification system or whatever to transmit and make material on pornography or abuse of children available will face up to 10 years of jail. I think this is a very important piece of legislation. It might sound technical in its nature but, as I said, it is part of the fabric that brings a screen down between the pornographers and exploiters on one side and the innocent children and young people on the other. I commend the member for Makin for her suggestion. I think that a fee of $3,000 to appeal these matters is too high. I suppose that was looked at to make it hard for the exploiters, but we have to understand that, at times, those appeals are mounted by people who are trying to enforce tougher standards. I think $3,000 is far too much to enter the appeal process. With that one reservation, I commend the bill to the House. opportunity of thanking all of those members who have spoken on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004. First, if I may, I will address the shadow minister and member for Gellibrand and thank her for her full support for MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill No 2 2004
261,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (11.52 a.m.)-in reply-I first take thethis measure, which was also endorsed by the member for Blaxland in his speech. The member for Gellibrand made it clear that Labor supports the bill, is satisfied that the amendments are appropriate and gives unequivocal support to the enforcement agencies with respect to the prosecution of child pornography. I also appreciate the very thoughtful contributions of the members for Makin and Hinkler. They ranged a little more widely in their comments. I will address those in due course. It is important to understand the background to this bill. These are minor amendments but they are to ensure that prosecutions for child pornography and other offences do not fail because of technical deficiencies in the application for classification from law enforcement authorities. I might just say that this arose because some comments were made by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police about the time it might take to obtain classification decisions. I said this to departmental officers at the time. He also adverted to technical and possible legislative problems. I asked him whether he knew of any legislative problems and he said that he did not know of any, but it was a question of the speed with which the decisions were taken. I asked for a thorough review of the operations. During the course of that review it became apparent that the request for classification had been made on forms that did not advert to child pornography but rather to classifications for other purposes. It was quite apparent that members of the legal profession when properly instructed might argue that a request on a form that was not the right form might lead to a failure to advance adequately the prosecution’s case, notwithstanding the fact that the material had been classified properly in accordance with all of the guidelines. Obviously in relation to matters as important as this, if we are dealing with child pornography-and people ought to be prosecuted for dealing with that material-you do not want the prosecutions to fail because somebody finds some technical flaw of that sort. So this law is to enable the parliament to indicate its intention that the classification decision should be considered valid where there is a defect or deficiency related to the technical application requirements of the act. It has broader application than the specific matter I have raised, in case there are other errors of that sort-of a technical nature. I do not believe there are. I am advised there are not. I am so advised now. But it is for more abundant caution that we are seeking provisions to ensure that those classification decisions can be relied upon in relation to pursuing prosecutions, and if other situations emerge in future the bill will also deal with that. There is no legitimate reason why a person should be able to escape prosecution, conviction and punishment for serious child pornography offences or other criminal offences under state and territory classification legislation merely because of a technical defect or deficiency in the application of the act. I am glad that that proposition has been endorsed so fulsomely and I thank the members of the opposition for that. The member for Makin raised a number of other issues and I will briefly deal with them. She asked about the operational review and indicated that she was looking forward to an outcome. So am I. The Office of Film and Literature Classification is currently conducting a review of the first year’s operation of the guidelines for classification of films and computer games. The purpose of that review is to assess whether changes to the film and computer games guidelines have had an effect in changing classification standards, including whether the guidelines are increasing the amount of sexual violence permitted. The review will be exMAIN COMMITTEE amining classification decisions made before and after the introduction of the guidelines and a report is expected towards the end of this year; that means it is imminent. She also asked about materials that have been classified-the films Irreversible and Birth. The issues regarding Irreversible will be discussed in the report on operational review. On the matter of Birth, the classification board classified it as MA, Mature Accompanied, with consumer advice of adult themes and medium level sex scenes. In reaching its decision it considered elements of the film, including adult themes and sexual activity. The board was of the opinion that such content could be accommodated within those guidelines, and that was the decision that was taken in that particular instance. The issue of fee waiver was also raised by the member for Makin and the member for Hinkler. It was the situation in October 2004 that the Australian Family Association submitted an application for review of Birth and an application for waiver of the prescribed classification fees. The director of the board decided against the waiver and subsequently the Australian Family Association withdrew its application for review. The relevant section is section 91 of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 and the fee waiver provisions are under that section. It was an on-balance decision by the director. His decision regarding fee waiver can be tested. It was not in this instance but it is a reviewable decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am advised, and I offer these comments to both of the honourable members, that the Office of Film and Literature Classification will be reviewing the fee waiver principles in the new year and hopefully I will be able to offer some further guidance after that review has taken place. If each of the honourable members would like to make a submission to the Director of the Office of Film and Literature Classification in addition to the remarks that will be drawn to his attention from this debate, they are welcome to do so. I thank the Committee for the support for this bill. I hope it will have a speedy passage elsewhere. I would like to see it dealt with within this period of sittings. Question agreed to.

There is scarcely any issue more important for this parliament to be discussing than that of water. Water is important all around the world and it is important to all of us. It is sometimes observed that, in future, wars will be fought over access to water. An astonishing and unacceptable number of the world’s men, women and children live and die without access to decent water for either drinking or sanitation. We here in Australia are in a position of particular MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Classification Publications Films And Computer Games Amendment Bill No 2 2004
262,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (4.30 P.m.),"I am delighted to have the opportunity tosignificance. Australia is the world’s driest inhabited continent and yet is just about the world’s largest per capita user of water. Our use of water has simply not been sustainable. It has not been sustainable in our cities and towns; it has not been sustainable in our rural areas either. We can see this increasingly in the declining state of our water reserves and in the declining health of our rivers and waterways. The dwindling state of our water reserves is well known. Throughout this year, as I have travelled to many different towns and electorates, particularly during the election campaign, people have wanted to talk about water. In Bowen, in the Dawson electorate, the topic was the need for water to sustain the coal industry in the face of declining water from the present dam. In South Queensland, in the electorate of Forde, I visited a river that children used to dive into, which is now reduced to a trickle. In Western Australia things are even worse. Perth has had such a dry spell-exceeding 25 years-that its underground aquifers are being progressively dried up and there is a major question mark about the source of its future water supplies. On this basis the Western Australian government is examining radical options to secure Perth’s future drinking water, such as the installation of a $350 million desalinisation plant. The large capital cities of Melbourne and Sydney are on serious water restrictions and there is little likelihood of the situation changing any time soon. Indeed, the Victorian government announced recently that some of these restrictions will be made permanent. Many smaller towns and cities are also on water restrictions and have been for some time. Our rivers are suffering and stressed as a result of the amount of water that we have been taking out of them for our domestic, industrial and agricultural needs. The most striking example of this is the poor state of the Murray River. This river, and the Murray-Darling Basin which feeds it, has been a mighty source of prosperity and life for this country since European settlement. It is at the heart of our agricultural prosperity. It sustains many regional communities. It is essential for the drinking water of Adelaide-an issue which no doubt some of my South Australian Labor colleagues, like the members for Adelaide and Hindmarsh, will speak about with real feeling later in this debate. But it is in a state of decline. Levels of salinity have been on the rise. This rise has been masked temporarily by declining inflows from the Darling River and seized upon by that right-wing think tank the Institute of Public Affairs to pretend that there is not a problem. But there is a salinity problem in the Murray River and its catchment and if we do not take steps to address it then over time there is no doubt that it will threaten the river system, including its capacity for agricultural production. In other words, we will kill the goose that lays the golden egg. As well as an increasing salinity, the river has shown increased susceptibility to blue-green algal blooms, and its ecological richness is taking a hammering. River red gums are dying and native fish species are in decline-during the last parliament the government was forced to place the Murray cod and the trout cod on the endangered species list. Waterbirds are also in decline. Dr David Paton, an Adelaide academic who conducts regular surveys of migratory wading birds in the Coorong, a famous coastal wetland area in South Australia, has found an alarming decrease in the numbers of these birds over the past decade. But the Murray River, sad and unsatisfactory and all that its state is, is far from the only example of a river in poor and unsustainable health. Rivers feeding Sydney, like the Hawkesbury and the Nepean, have been infested with weeds. The rivers feeding Victoria’s Gippsland MAIN COMMITTEE Lakes bring with them the nutrients which feed algal blooms. Many other lakes and waterways around Australia have been in a state of declining water quality. These things are known-indeed, they have been known for years. In the minister’s second reading speech he sets out the background in a section entitled ‘Water in Australia’. Although they have done it with less passion and conviction, essentially they have made similar points to those I have just made, and there is not anything in their ‘Water in Australia’ section with which I would disagree. They conclude that there is enormous pressure on some of our major water resources and that we need to improve our national effort in managing those resources. The problem is that they say the water issue is important but they have totally and utterly failed to back up their words with actions. The Prime Minister has notional carriage of this bill and this issue, but in the last parliament-and apparently in this one, too-he subcontracted out the issue of water to the National Party leader, John Anderson, and the rest of the National Party. The National Party have been absolutely unwilling to do anything which might put Australia’s management of its water resources on a sustainable basis, for fear that their constituency will rise up against them. The National Party have not acted in the national interest; they have acted on the basis of sectional interest. When the Liberal Party have been confronted with the consequences of this inaction-for example, in the shape of the declining Murray River-rather than take on the National Party, they have taken the politically convenient path of blaming the state governments. For years their refrain has been: yes, the Murray River is in a bad way; the states must fix it. This has been for them a political solution to the problem; it has not been an actual solution to the problem. For years, they have sat on their hands while the scientific evidence rolled in about the need to restore environmental flows to save the Murray. They did nothing. They did not restore a single litre in environmental flows. From Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meetings to COAG meetings, they prevaricated and obfuscated, refusing to act. They dropped the ball with regard to Labor’s pioneering work back in 1994. The minister’s second reading speech correctly acknowledges: Truly national water reform commenced ... with the original COAG Water Reform Framework agreed by Commonwealth and state governments in 1994. Then the second reading speech jumps to the signing of the National Water Initiative in June this year-10 years later. Back in February 1994, the Council of Australian Governments agreed upon a strategic framework for necessary water reforms, covering water pricing, institutional arrangements and sustainable water resource management and community consultation. However, after the Howard government was elected in 1996, that work was left to gather dust on the shelf while the National Party took over and scuttled Australia’s path towards water sustainability. I have no doubt that had it not been for Labor’s energetic pursuit of water issues in the last parliament-and, in particular, Simon Crean’s commitment to finding 1,500 gigalitres in environment flows to save the Murray River, a commitment subsequently reiterated by Mark Latham-we would not be having this debate today. Under duress, the government is accepting that there does need to be national leadership on water issues and that it is not good enough to say that it is up to the states to fix it. We have before us the National Water Commission Bill, which establishes a new National Water Commission as an independent statutory body. Labor, having called many times for national leadership on this issue, will support this bill and assist its passage through the parMAIN COMMITTEE liament. However, we are under no illusions about the government’s real views on water: they want to do as little as possible, and they want to draw it out for as long as possible. So we will need to continue to put the pressure on for action. The moment that we stop watching them is the moment that they drop the ball again. In supporting the bill, we would not want it thought for a moment that we consider the government’s handling of water issues to have been satisfactory. Accordingly, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) its failure to take the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for both our farmers and our rivers seriously; (2) its failure to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency -allowing the COAG water reform process of 1994 to stall, and failing to provide any environmental flows for the Murray in over 8 years; (3) its failure to adopt Labor’s National Water Policy Framework, and ensure that Commonwealth funds are directed towards securing environmental flows; and (4) its plan to fund the Australian Water Fund by taking money which the States have earmarked for essential services such as schools and hospitals”. Let me go to the first of our criticisms of the government set out in this second reading amendment. I grow increasingly astonished at this government’s failure to take climate change seriously. This is a government-The Nationals in particular-which claims to represent farmers, and yet it sits on its hands while climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions condemns them to a dry, waterless future. There is little point in having a debate about whether water should be allocated to irrigators or kept in the rivers for environmental flows if we do not have any water to argue about in the first place. Yet this is precisely what the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and other scientific experts are telling us is on the cards for Australia. I mentioned earlier in my remarks how Perth has dried out in the last 25 years. Its climate has literally changed. In my home city of Melbourne, its reputation for constant drizzle is a memory. I have not carried an umbrella around for years. Brisbane’s water storages were at 50 per cent capacity in late October, Sydney’s at 44 per cent and Perth’s down to 37 per cent. CSIRO research commissioned by the New South Wales government shows that annual average rainfall in New South Wales has fallen by 14.3 millimetres a decade since 1950. Victoria’s Department of Sustainability and Environment produced regional estimates of climate change impacts in Victoria by the years 2030 and 2070. They showed rainfall decreases of up to 15 per cent by 2030 and 40 per cent by 2070 for the Mallee, Wimmera, North Central and Goulburn Broken regions. Gippsland and Western Victoria are facing up to 10 per cent rainfall loss by 2030 and 25 per cent loss by 2070. And that problem will be made worse by temperature increases-in the Victorian regions, typically up to 1.6 degrees by 2030 and five degrees by 2070. So in other words you get less rain and higher temperatures causing more evaporation and moisture loss. These are very serious figures. Unless we get serious about climate change, in the years ahead Australia will become one big desert. I am astonished that the Howard government appear to be relaxed and comfortable with this prospect. The minister’s second reading speech MAIN COMMITTEE admits that climate change is one of the factors putting, in his words, ‘enormous pressure’ on our water resources. Yet the government steadfastly set their faces against any of the things that we need to do to tackle climate change. They will not ratify the international climate change treaty, the Kyoto protocol. They will not set up a system of emissions trading. They will not increase the mandatory renewable energy target. The Nationals MPs scoff at the mention of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, yet in doing so they condemn those who they claim to represent to the bleakest of futures. What an appalling abdication of responsibility. What an appalling dereliction of duty. I am pleased that at least one organisation is doing its job in representing farmers’ interests in this matter. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has called on the Howard government to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change. I hope that it is not too long before the National Farmers’ Federation and The Nationals get the message and do likewise. The bill establishes the National Water Commission as an independent statutory body with two key functions: first, assessing the implementation and promoting the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement; and second, advising on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under the Australian water fund. The commission will conduct the scheduled 2005 assessment of commitments under the national competition policy water reforms, which was to have been undertaken by the National Competition Council. It will also undertake an initial stocktake of Australia’s water resources and water management arrangements. The bill assigns to the commission a central role in relation to the Australian water fund. During the election, the government promised to spend $2 billion over five years via the Australian water fund. This is separate from the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality and separate from the $200 million previously promised to restore environmental flows for the Murray River through the Living Murray initiative. The government has indicated that the Australian water fund will be divided into three components. $1.6 billion of that will be invested over five years in the water smart Australia program to accelerate the uptake of smart technologies and practices. Two hundred million dollars is allocated to the raising national water standards program. It is claimed the program will support projects such as a nationally consistent water accounting system and working with communities to conserve rivers with high environmental values. Finally, $200 million is allocated for a water wise communities program-a five-year program to promote a culture of wise water use. Community organisations will be provided with grants of up to $50,000, allocated on a competitive basis. The National Water Commission will make recommendations for the government’s final decision concerning the first two programs. It will also administer them. The water wise communities program will be administered by the Department of the Environment and Heritage in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The bill provides that the commission will be in the Prime Minister’s portfolio, that three commissioners will be nominated by the Commonwealth and three by the states and territories and that the commission will meet at least eight times a year. I want to return to this proposal shortly. I will also have something to say about clause 44 of the bill, which prevents the commission from making its assessments or recommendations public unless the minister agrees. The National Water Commission is to implement the National Water Initiative. In turn, the National Water Initiative comes from the New South Wales, Queensland, Victorian, South MAIN COMMITTEE Australian, ACT and Northern Territory governments having signed the agreement to participate in the National Water Initiative. Western Australia and Tasmania have not signed it. The federal government has tied the national water plan to the $500 million Living Murray initiative. Both the Western Australian and Tasmanian governments believe that the National Water Initiative is too skewed towards the Murray-Darling region and not to other problem areas. The Western Australian government has expressed concern that the agreement offers little benefit to Western Australia and is not appropriate to their state. It is argued that Western Australia is at a very different stage of the development and understanding of its water resources to many areas of Australia, which brings with it a different set of priorities, issues, challenges and opportunities. The National Water Initiative may result in Western Australia having to commit to complex management, monitoring and planning before there is a need for this level of management, and there are likely to be significant disadvantages for Western Australia in being tied to a highly prescriptive model or timetable. The Western Australian government feels that it is important to ensure that Western Australia retains the flexibility to implement change in a way and in a time frame suited to its needs. I turn to the content of the National Water Initiative. It sets out objectives, outcomes and actions for the ongoing process of national water reform in the following areas: first, water access entitlements and planning; second, water markets and trading; third, best practice water pricing; fourth, integrated management of water for environmental and other public benefit outcomes; fifth, water resource accounting; sixth, urban water reforms; seventh, knowledge and capacity building; and finally, eighth, community partnerships and adjustments. Full implementation of the National Water Initiative aims to result in a nationally compatible system for managing surface and ground water resources for rural and urban use based on market mechanisms, regulatory solutions and water resource planning. If you have a look at this set of purposes, you can see from that list that the National Water Initiative is quite different from the Living Murray initiative, which is supposed to be all about saving the Murray River. It is, therefore, absolutely inappropriate for the government to keep insisting that the National Water Initiative and the Living Murray initiative must be linked. I have seen the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, reported in the Financial Review and heard him in question time a day or two ago saying that you cannot decouple these two. Why on earth not? It is simply just another excuse for inaction on the part of the federal government to demand that these two projects be linked. They used this line in forcing the states to sign up to the National Water Initiative. The states were basically told in June that, if they did not sign up to the National Water Initiative, the government would give them nothing of the previously agreed Living Murray money. If anyone doubts this, they should ask themselves why the two states that did not sign up to the National Water Initiative were Western Australia and Tasmania. The answer is obvious. These are the two states that have no connection with the Murray-Darling basin. Without the Living Murray money, there was no incentive for them to sign up. And, indeed, the government put no money on the table at the time for the National Water Initiative-a point I will return to. I have indicated that Labor supports this bill and this commission in the hope that they will finally provide some national leadership in tackling Australia’s water crisis, but there are two specific provisions with which we take issue. Clause8 provides that the Commonwealth govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment appoints the chair and three of the six commissioners on the new commission. Labor believes that there needs to be a greater emphasis on consensus regarding the making of appointments to the commission between the Commonwealth and the states, and Labor will seek to amend this legislation accordingly. Clause 44 prevents the recommendations of the National Water Commission concerning which projects are to be funded under the Australian water fund being made public without ministerial consent. The opposition believe these recommendations do need to be made public, and we believe clause 44 should be deleted. The opposition are only too well aware of the capacity of the National Party to rort government funds for its own political and electoral benefit. It is an issue that we have been only too familiar with in allocations under the Natural Heritage Trust, Envirofund, Roads of National Importance and, most recently and notoriously, the Regional Partnerships fund. Tens of millions of dollars have been allocated to projects in breach of program guidelines, and the one thing these proposals all have in common is that they have been in seats which either the National Party holds or it seeks to hold. We intend to do everything we can to make this process public and transparent. We do not want these recommendations to be behind closed doors. We do not want the proposed Australian water fund to go the same way as the Natural Heritage Trust, Envirofund or the Regional Partnerships program-that is, large amounts of taxpayers’ dollars achieving political benefits and advantages for the government, not a public benefit. As well as these issues of detail, our second reading amendment criticises the government for its plan to fund the Australian water fund by taking money which the states have earmarked for essential services such as schools and hospitals. I said earlier that all along the Howard government has tried to avoid any national responsibility for water issues and tried to buck-pass to the states. I also said that at the time the National Water Initiative was signed the Commonwealth government had not indicated to the states how it proposed to fund the initiative. And so it came to pass that during the federal election campaign the Howard government announced that it would establish a $2 billion Australian water fund and that $1.6 billion of this money would come from future national competition policy payments, which the states regarded as earmarked for them. To take this money from the states would jeopardise state funding for essential services such as schools, hospitals, police and so on. This proposed method of funding was denounced at the time by both state governments and federal Labor. It shows that the federal government still believes that water is the states’ problem. The fact is it has not changed at all on this issue; it has just got more cunning-‘mean and tricky,’ as one of its former party presidents memorably described it back in 2001. In the time available to me, I want to turn to how we believe water could be managed better in this country. In the first place, our commitment to the Murray River is well known. We have made a commitment to finding 450 gigalitres in environmental flows in our first term of office-enough water to keep the mouth of the Murray open. We have made a commitment to finding 1,500 gigalitres in environmental flows over a full 10-year period. We want to save the whole river system, not just parts of it. The rest of our approach is set out in Labor’s framework for a national water policy, released in June this year. In the time available, I want to draw some of its features to the attention of the House and commend it to the House as solid, detailed and well-thought-through policy. MAIN COMMITTEE Identifying the river systems that have escaped degradation and developing a plan to protect them will ensure that we avoid the problems of salinity, water quality and loss of biodiversity which are now sadly characteristic of so many of our waterways. Labor would implement a national system for classifying Australia’s major rivers, to identify those that need attention and those that need protection. Many parts of Australia’s river systems are sick and need urgent attention. Without attention, they will only get worse. We are committed to saving Australia’s rivers, to saving the Murray through Riverbank and to ensuring through that program that we provide assistance to holders of water access entitlements to achieve on-farm efficiencies with a view to meeting our targets for environmental flows without jeopardising overall agricultural production. We want to investigate opportunities for strategic investment in off-farm water infrastructure. We want to ensure recognition for those who have already invested in water efficiency measures when reviewing water allocations resulting from enhanced environmental flows. We intend to establish an environmental flow trust to manage environmental flows, because we know that there is more to saving our rivers than simply putting more water into them. We would work with the states to ensure that all major water catchments in Australia have properly resourced, statutory, community-based catchment management authorities. While the Murray is the most significant river in Australia that warrants urgent attention, many of Australia’s major rivers are stressed or dying. We are committed to improving the health of all our major rivers and we want to use the experience in saving the Murray to improve the health of other major rivers identified under a national scheme for classifying rivers as those rivers which are in need of repair. Experience tells us that meeting Australia’s future water needs by simply extracting more water from our rivers will not be sustainable. The focus for meeting growth in future water needs must be on water reuse and recycling, on improved efficiency and on technological solutions such as desalinisation. We need to recognise that it is not just a question of action in the regional areas, although that is incredibly important; it is also a question of better water management in urban Australia. In Australian households, each person uses around 350 litres per day and yet the national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we did more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey or household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages as well as to boost our environment and our economy. An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for all sorts of purposes: irrigation of city parks and sports ovals; industrial purposes; cooling water; recharging natural aquifers; using safe, treated urban effluent on crops; and many more. We want to work with the states and territories to improve the water quality and environmental outcomes of urban water management. We want to work with the state and local water authorities to dramatically reduce the amount of water being discharged via ocean outfalls and we want to use the COAG process to implement voluntary and regulatory initiatives which would promote water-saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water-saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual-flush toilets and increased use of grey water. Water is a critical issue for this country. The government must do better. There simply are no excuses for inaction now. We are supporting this legislation. The government should stop blaming the states and stop lookMAIN COMMITTEE ing for excuses; it should get on with it and do the things that need to be done to put this country on a path to water sustainability. (Time expired) portant community based initiative. In terms of the COAG agreement of 10 years ago, this has been a long time in the making. Water is something that we essentially take for granted. Until we do not have any, we presume it will be there, so I welcome this very important piece of legislation. Australia is a very diverse place. As you go through the memorandum you can get a very clear picture about run-off and about where the water is coming from, where it is going to and what it is used for. Perhaps we should start with the National Water Initiative, which has eight points. The first refers to water access entitlements and planning. The second refers to water markets and trading, which has been a much discussed and debated issue over recent years. The third refers to best practice water pricing. I do not know what is regarded as an international price for water, but certainly in my part of the world the going rate is around $1 a kilolitre. It has been said to me in recent months that we pay nothing for our water. We actually pay approximately $1 for the transport of water, so we virtually value water at nothing in this country. That is something that I have pondered quite considerably in recent months. The National Water Initiative’s fourth point refers to the integrated management of water for environmental and other public benefit outcomes. That is common sense. There is a lot of focus on the environment, and with 20 million people we have to become increasingly sustainable. The initiative’s fifth point refers to water resource accounting, which is a much tougher area. For example, in my own electorate it is said that to pipe water from the Murray River to the Upper Spencer Gulf may cost $3 a kilolitre-three times the actual price we pay-and yet that is an estimate. It is something that is debated-but it is barely transparent and it is certainly not discussed. Therefore, there is a great challenge for us in water resource accounting: to know what the actual costs are and then to develop systems which give us far better value for the water that is being provided and the mechanisms of how we provide it and how we use it. The sixth point refers to urban water reform, and I guess when we see the amount of greenery in much of the driest state in the driest continent-South Australia-we must wonder whether there is a better way of using that water. That is not popular. Nevertheless, we have to question how well we are using our water when we use it for, perhaps, aesthetic reasons more than practical ones. With regard to knowledge and capacity building, there is plenty to do there, as there is with community partnerships and adjustments. The National Water Initiative endeavours to put this down and it tries to bring us into the 21st century, to this sustainable position. The debate about how much money and water will be involved will no doubt be ongoing, and the amendments from the member for Wills will be part of that debate. But one thing is for sure: unless we as a nation are prepared to embrace best practice and look at this with all the capacity within our power, we are not going to pass on a very satisfactory outcome to the next generation.

264,Mr Hatton,I second the amendment.,189,National Water Commission Bill 2004
265,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (5.01 P.m.),"The National Water Commission Bill 2004 is an imWe have seen headlines in recent weeks and months that say that Sydney is running out of water. I do not quite agree with the member for Wills, who mentioned that he had not carried an umbrella in Melbourne for a long time-if he went to the Melbourne Cup, he would have needed a very big umbrella-but climate change is also going to be part of the debate. I do not agree that we are about to become a desert-I come from a region that has between, say, 300 millimetres, or perhaps a little less, and 400 to 500 millimetres of rainfall per annum. I think it was in 1977 that a world expert told us that we were about to become a desert. The next year we had record rainfall, and the same expert was there warning us-he put on another hat, this time looking at things from the emergency fire service perspective-that we had to be very careful because we were about to burn ourselves out. In other words, 12 months after we were about to become a desert there was so much vegetation that we were about to be in such trouble that we were going to suffer the havoc of fire. That is what we live with in Australia: we live with these great variations. That is what we will always deal with. In over 200 years of European settlement, we have but scratched the surface of an understanding of the place. We have a lot to learn, and this bill goes a long way towards doing that. I think that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and its executive officer, who is known to many of us, will-with the states and the Commonwealth, of course-bring a vital focus to these issues, but let us always remember that the practical variations in what we are dealing with are things that will always challenge us. In the few minutes that I want to take up in this place today, I would like to reiterate that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is an example of inability, in my opinion: even though it has done a lot of good work, it shows the weakness of federation. I hope that in this process-within the federation and within the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states-we can bring a result that enhances not just the Living Murray initiative but the National Water Initiative as well. That is another area in which I am in some disagreement with the member for Wills-quite frankly, I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: I do not see how you can decouple the National Water Initiative and the Living Murray; I think they are very much part of the same question. But we have the responsibility, which this bill goes to the heart of, of embarking upon this initiative in a way that brings us far better outcomes than those brought to us by the squabbling of the last 80 years-or however long it has been. So that is the challenge in front of us. I welcome the bill. In summing up, as a South Australian I would like to say that I have a little sympathy for Western Australia and Tasmania, the states that are particularly concerned, in the sense that in the specific part of the world I come from and live in-not my electorate, which has various contacts with and reliance on the Murray River, mainly as piped water-we have absolutely no contact with the River Murray, like much of the rest of Australia, I suggest. So my warning and my plea would be this: let us not get excessively preoccupied with the Murray-Darling, important as it is. Water is important to every Australian, whether they live at Cape York, in Perth, in the Kimberleys or Tasmania-I nearly said Van Diemen’s land! I really think that we are starting to come to grips with this issue, but let us not be preoccupied with the Murray River only-and I say that as a South Australian-because the issue of water, for whatever purpose we use it, will not go away. When we consider that advice from one of the wisest people about water that I know in South Australia, we are valuing water at MAIN COMMITTEE nothing and all we are doing at the moment is paying for the transport of it. Let us hope the National Water Commission Bill 2004 can enhance that and bring us to a sustainable state. important bill, and it is one that is not just timely but overdue. This process was initiated in 1994, two years before the end of the Keating government. Here we are a decade later and finally the initiative that was taken at COAG has been brought to fruition. A decade is simply too long for this initiative to have taken to come to fruition. Given that the problems are pressing-and they have been for the last 10 years-and that the Commonwealth and state governments identified in 1994 that water problems for Australia were pressing, critical and needed to be resolved as fast as possible, this government has been utterly tardy in coming to terms with these issues. The government can blame the states or the fact that the Labor opposition has a position in regard to water policy that differs somewhat from theirs. They can argue that they have not been helped by all the parties concerned, but I do not think any of that is valid. What is valid is the fact that this government have been entirely tardy in their approach to these problems and have demonstrated in the more than eight years that they have had charge of the government benches that they were not focused on these issues critical to Australia’s future. I do not pretend that these are easy issues to resolve or that they could have been resolved by 1996. They were not. The process was initiated, and a year and a half or two years of work was done by the Keating government and the state governments to identify a mechanism through which we could get some resolution of the issues. What we now have in the National Water Commission is part of the story, in terms of sorting out the difficulties that we have not only with the Murray and the Living Murray initiative but with water allocation generally throughout the Murrumbidgee, the Riverina and in terms of dealing with questions of water usage Australia wide. The fundamental purpose of this bill may seem slight when we come to deal with it-if you have a look at what is provided here, it does not seem to be all that much-but the fundamentals are pretty important. The first purpose of the bill is simply to set up the National Water Commission as an independent statutory body and to ensure that it has the capacity to undertake two key responsibilities. The first of those is that it should assess the implementation and promote the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement. The second is that it should advise on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under components of the Australian water fund. Both of those responsibilities are important, because they go to this being a key initiative of the Commonwealth but entirely dependent on the interaction between the Commonwealth and the states. The previous speaker alluded to the problem that, when you deal with any issue that really is federal in nature where you have contested interests in relation to the utilisation of a resource-and we have seen a contest over those water resources between different states and different users-it is a difficult process to put something into place. But the government have had plenty of time to do this, and they should have brought this in much more quickly. The bill assigns to the National Water Commission a central role in relation to the $2 billion Australian water fund. Specifically, it provides that this is of such significance that it will be placed in the Prime Minister’s portfolio. The significance is great enough to say that there is no other minister in the government who should have charge of this but the Prime Minister MAIN COMMITTEE",189,National Water Commission Bill 2004
266,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (5.11 P.m.),"The National Water Commission Bill 2004 is anof Australia himself-that this is a key initiative in relation to the government and a key initiative in terms of the responsibilities that the Prime Minister will undertake. If that is the case-if it is so important and so significant-you would expect that, in all of the time that this Prime Minister has been in charge of the joint, since March 1996, he would have been able to speed up the process in forming this body and resolving the issues in regard to water. Secondly, the bill provides that there will be three commissioners nominated by the Commonwealth and three by the states and territories, and they will meet at least eight times a year. And so they should, because the issues they have to deal with need to be advanced as fast as possible. Despite what the member for Grey indicated about Melbourne’s weather during the Melbourne Cup, that actually underlines one of the problems we have. If the science is right-if the majority of CSIRO scientists are correct and world opinion is correct in regard to this-then the number of torrid weather events that we have and the severity with which they are expressed in different parts of Australia will increase. Australia’s weather will become in part less predictable and more severe. Indeed, part of the measure of just what has happened in the changes is that we now have not just the cane toad working its way inevitably through the Northern Territory but also the growth of rainforest in the Northern Territory in areas that were grasslands. Associated with the growth of those rainforests there is an infestation of dengue fever carrying mosquitoes in the Northern Territory. Things have changed. Australia is changing. Climate change seems to be expressed in that simple move-expressed by the environment itself. The nature of northern Australia is changing, and the weather patterns have a part to play in that. The weather patterns are an intimate part of changes in climate. Australia will have to deal with increased rainfall in the north and a change in the biota in northern Australia, but the likelihood is, if the scientists are correct, that in southern Australia we will have a much drier continent than we have had in the past. Although the member for Grey did not think it was right in terms of the drying out of Australia, if one listens to Tim Flannery, a noted Australian biologist who has been lauded by the Prime Minister and ministers in this government, in his recent book Country-and he first outlined this in Future Eaters and then when, not all that long ago, he spoke to the regional committee that I chaired in the last parliament and the one before-he put an entirely compelling case in regard to the rapidity with which temperature changes are happening and impacting on Australia. The fact is that the graphs are going almost off the scale. We are virtually reaching an exponential change in temperature in Australia. If you were in Canberra yesterday you were a bit protected from it, but it was 42 degrees in the shade in Sydney-an all-time record in November. Part of the strangeness of this is winter type temperatures through part of November oscillating very quickly into very high summer. We have experienced that over the last number of years. Of course, if you speak to some meteorologists, nothing ever changes, because if they get a big enough database they can look at it as mere fluctuations from day to day. It all has some precedent in relation to it. But I think that you can almost feel the changes that are happening in our experiences, in the regularity of the seasons. The regularity of the seasons in my youth and the youth of the member for Fowler-and indeed in your youth, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin-has simply gone. It has been completely blown away. We have argued that, if you look at what scientists in Australia and world wide have said about temperature change and climate change, one of the key things we should be doing-and it is said here in the amendMAIN COMMITTEE ment-is signing up to the Kyoto protocol and signing up to the fact that we have a problem because we have a fossil fuel based economy. We are carbon beings, but we also burn a lot of carbon: carbon based human beings utilise that rich store that we have from the geological past. But, in doing so, we create significant problems. We have a special part to play in trying to turn around the way in which Australia uses those natural resources and in trying to lessen the impact on global climate change. The government argues that the costs of that are too great, that doing it would not really make all that much difference and that it is unnecessary to go further. With the press of time, even those countries that are laggard in regard to Kyoto, such as the Russian Federation and even the United States, seem to be stepping inexorably along the path to eventually signing Kyoto, many years after it was first signed up to by the initial signatories. It must be clear that as people in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in the world are feeling big changes in weather events, we are feeling them here. If we had problems with water before, we certainly have them now. The level and intensity of the drought that we have experienced in the last few years have been commented on by one farmer after another and by the appropriate bureaus in Australia. We know a great deal more now about the major climate influences of El Nino and La Nina, but the difficulty we have is that we do not have the best and most appropriate responses at a federal level, or indeed a state level, to deal with them. We have a broad outline of where we need to go. There is an increasing understanding that home owners in Sydney need to take steps to ensure that they use water in the best possible way that they can. Indeed, the state government has just brought in regulations which indicate that, if you do not get a place built by March next year-and, even if you are making extensions to a home in Sydney, if they are not done by March next year-there will be a extra cost, in the order of $10,000 for each household making extensions or for new homes, to use water wise systems to use water better and to conserve water within the metropolitan regions. I think that is a sensible thing to do, because we in Sydney and in the other major cities have experienced significant problems as well in terms of the way in which water has not hit the catchments. It has hit our properties further towards the coast, but in the catchment areas we have not been getting significant water until recently and therefore the levels of our dams are seriously low. I note that the same problem is evident here in Canberra, as it is in other parts of the country. A concentration on these matters is absolutely called for. We think that the government has been extremely slow in taking this up. We do not think you can be laggard with regard to this. I will go to further elements of the second reading amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister. The first, which I have already spoken to, is the failure of the government to take seriously the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for both our farmers and our rivers. The second is their failure to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency, and I have spoken about that. We had 10 years where they could have pressed forward but they did not. They have not dealt with the problem of environmental flows in the Murray River. Indeed, there is a contrast between that and the best science around the place, which is linked with Labor’s approach to this problem. We have argued that 1,500 gigalitres should be reintroduced into the Murray. The government have chosen not to take that approach. What they have chosen to do is to have a much smaller amount and to argue that there are iconic sites along the Murray that you can save bits and pieces of-that that is a good MAIN COMMITTEE enough way to do it: you do not look at the whole river, you just look at those iconic sites and say that you cannot do much more. It is useful for us that the shadow minister who dealt with this today and now has a responsibility for regional development was the shadow minister for the environment in the last parliament. I was in South Australia with him when he and the former leader Simon Crean announced our policy with regard to the Living Murray. They pledged Labor to the much higher goal of not just trying to do a spot check on this system but, rather, trying to deal with the Murray as a complete living entity. All of those people in South Australia who are at the end of that river and who depend on it not only for their living but also as their major water resource need to know that there should be more cooperation between the states. The federal government needs not only to pay up with regard to it but also to play a role which encompasses a willingness to really fix this as fast as possible. If the states are tardy, then the federal government should get onto them. Those who come from those states where there are the most significant problems for the people who are dependent on the river-that is, the farmers in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, who need this resource-need certainty with regard to it. We argue that the government’s failure to adopt Labor’s national water policy framework and ensure that Commonwealth funds are directed towards securing environmental flows is another fundamental fault in the government’s approach. Lastly, we argue that the government’s plan to fund the Australian Water Fund by taking money that the states have earmarked for essential services such as schools and hospitals is not really a bright idea. I would argue that we have seen this mob do this before. We know that, during the election campaign, the states rightly indicated their concerns and said that they would not be signing up to a National Water Initiative that was predicated not on new money but in fact on taking the bundle of money that was already available to the states, which they would use for those absolutely essential services and their administrative functions. That global amount of money would have something pinched out of it to the order of $1.62 billion which would be put aside for this Water Initiative. It is a cheap way for the Commonwealth to do it, but the states have argued that it is not realistic or sensible to give with one hand and take with the other. But we have had plenty of experience with that since March 1996. Given that this government has been re-elected to office, no doubt the states will have to contend with the fact that the Commonwealth will try to strip them bare while at the same time arguing that they are not doing enough in regard to this. So, in relation to all the key measures that we have outlined regarding the deficiencies of this bill, we think that the government should rethink, front up and really seriously take Kyoto into account. Having finally got to the plate, they should also move forward as fast as possible with the COAG water reforms. We think that they should not take that money from state competition funds. We think that should come from new money, and we think that Commonwealth funding should be directed to making sure that environmental flows in the Murray are absolutely secure. You cannot do this just as a spot process, where you think you have one part fixed because it has enough iconic status; you have to deal with the whole problem. The broader part of that is that you cannot deal with this out of context. If Tim Flannery is correct when he says that Australia is drying out-and certainly the physical nature of the changes we have seen in the last few years in particular seems to indicate that it is and his MAIN COMMITTEE views seem to be borne out by what is happening, with the northern part of Australian becoming wetter and the bottom part drying out even more-we have to be not only a lot cleverer in what we do with our water resources but also a lot quicker in the actions we take with regard to them. The government have been tardy so far. They should speed up their approach and ensure that, now that they have this bill and will have an independent secondary authority, they quickly move to allay the fears of the states and ensure that water security for all Australians is made good as fast as possible. bate on the National Water Commission Bill 2004, which is legislation that will enable the establishment of the National Water Commission. It is an extremely important piece of legislation, and I note with considerable satisfaction that the commission is to be an independent statutory authority. Because of the association I have had with him in the past, I am also pleased that the chief executive is to be Mr Ken Matthews, who was previously Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and then served at the Department of Transport and Regional Services. I am sure Ken is well enough experienced to take on this task. However, I sincerely hope that in doing so the advice the commission give to government will be based on facts and substance and not on the outrageous media hype that has driven this debate around Australia over a significant period-to, in my mind, the great detriment of the quality of the political process. I lay that criticism on both sides of the House, because I see circumstances that are well documented being ignored in pursuit of a few votes, which, as the most recent election proved, were not there anyway. I hope that in ensuring Australia’s water supplies in all their facets over a long period into the future-and to the benefit of humanity and the environment as we know it-we can, as a collective, look to the evidence that has been put forward from time to time and to the historical facts that are significant. Let me say, in commencing, that we do not use up water. We cannot destroy it. It is composed of two elements, and we can change it to hydrogen and oxygen by a couple of processes-typically electrolysis-but fundamentally, in pursuit of the needs of humanity and animals and so on, we tend to pollute it. Nature has been quite clever in preserving it. It has done so with an old-fashioned method called putting plenty of salt into it. It has put it out there in things we call oceans and it has created a system of evaporative distillation to bring it back over our landmasses. We all know that those landmasses tend to generate precipitation and, as a consequence, we can get water which is of benefit to us because it does not have any salt in it. Then of course it is delivered down the drainage channels of our nation, which just happens to be one of the oldest geological structures that people occupy in the world. Those water channels have been degraded. They are very shallow generally and they have a habit, as I have often said of the Murray-Darling system, of being the stormwater drains of the nation. Historically, they discharged water when it was raining-or when the snow was melting in a few limited areas-and the water rushed off to the ocean, where it was reconverted to salt water. When we look at those circumstances, we should be asking ourselves why it is so difficult to clean the water-that has never been lost-in a manner that makes it suitable for our needs. We are a nation that has relied heavily over many years on a market economy. I think it is reaMAIN COMMITTEE",191,National Water Commission Bill 2004
267,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (5.32 P.m.),"It is with considerable pleasure that I join the desonable to say that the extent to which we want to consume water-notwithstanding that we will not retain any of it, either in our bodies or elsewhere-will decide how much money we want to spend on retaining it and reconstituting it so that we as humans can get benefit from it. That should be the fundamental starting point. There is plenty of debate about whether we should use that water to irrigate certain crops which we could buy more cheaply from Asian nations-rice being the classic example. There are plenty of arguments about whether we should use it in its purest form to water our lawns and gardens. They are all relevant and they have all been sidelined. As a collective in this place we have let silly people drive us with untrue statistics. I was very fortunate to join the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry while it was having its inquiry on water, and I had some good colleagues from the Labor Party-Sid Sidebottom in particular. When I joined the committee we were considering the report. Looking at the evidence, I saw all this conflicting advice coming from so-called scientific advisers. The different pieces of advice were so far apart. When I said to the other members of the committee, ‘What do you think of this?’ they said, ‘We asked them all for responses to what Bill said and what Jack said, but we never got them.’ So we decided to get them all in the room together.You can consult Dick Adams and a couple of others about what an enlightening process that was. There just happened to be a woman there, Dr Jennifer Marohasy, whom I would love to see as a board member on this water commission. She took some of the other so-called more respected scientists apart. She did it in a very simple way. She produced factual evidence. When we consequently came to the view that the whole decision on water was being made on the minimum of scientific data, we put out a report saying, ‘For goodness sake, take a deep breath. Don’t cancel the money you’ve got. There are problems but get some better facts.’ My boss and all the other ministers told us we did not know what we were so-and-so talking about, and Jennifer chose to write an article for the Australian, which gave it the headline, ‘Howard goes with the flow on Murray’. She referred to some other articles that had been published in the Australian, with headlines like ‘For cod’s sake, Murray needs stronger flow’. She pointed out that the only report on fish stocks that had ever been delivered to government was a research project that was undertaken in about 1996. This was the quote she used from it: A telling indication of the condition of rivers in the Murray region was the fact that, despite intensive fishingby scientistswith the most efficient types of sampling gear for a total of 220 person-days over a two-year period in 20 randomly chosen Murray-region sites, not a single Murray cod or freshwater catfish was caught. Dr Jennifer Marohasy said: Most remarkably, at the same time and in the same regions, commercial fishermen harvested 26 tonnes of Murray codwhich only proves that the scientists were lousy fishermen. That has been well published: she quotes two articles. She went on to advise us in a committee hearing. I watched the body language of the other scientists there: they were rubbing their foreheads. She looked at one bloke and said, ‘You MAIN COMMITTEE have said on your web site that salinity levels are rising in the Murray.’ That is something that I think most of us believe. Yet, as she pointed out in this article and in evidence to our committee, salinity levels have been declining at Morgan-the point where they take water for Adelaide-for 20 years. Other scientists were telling us that the water tables were rising. She pointed out that, according to the data-the actual record-they are going down. In response to that, one scientist said, ‘Yes, but it is a drought.’ Wait a minute! We know it is a drought. But why say that they are going up in a drought when you know they are going down in a drought? I came to the conclusion that most of these people were taking a 20-litre bucket of water out of the river and making any modelling decision they wanted-and the operative word was ‘modelling’. I will focus for a minute on the Murray River. I must get off it in a minute, because it is not the start and finish of our water problems. The question we have to ask in relation to environmental flow is: is the ecology a reversion to what the river was-our biggest stormwater drain-or is it some recognition of what we have now and how best to manage it? Managing it means, more particularly, how to supply that quality of water which is so important to us humans. We are not short of water; we are surrounded by it. It is just not useful in the form in which nature has provided it. You can imagine what the oceans would look like they if they were full of freshwater. They would be terribly green. I had a recollection about a photograph. I am happy to pass that photograph around. It appears on the front page of our report. It hangs over the fireplace in the Berri Hotel. The Berri pub just happens to be across the road from the Murray River. It is a photograph of the December 1914 Berri Primary School picnic, held in the middle of the river. As you will note, in the foreground is a bit of water and sitting in that is a sunken dinghy with half the freeboard sticking out. In other words, the puddle was less than six inches deep. That was the state of the river in 1914-and we are being told that the end of the world is tomorrow! The river, as Sturt discovered, ran and flooded, and that created certain ecological outcomes. That is quite right. Then it went dry. All of a sudden we have a drought-remember that in the 200 years that Westerners have been associated with this nation there have been 40 years of recorded drought-and we have a situation where ‘the end of the world is tomorrow’. The committee were all surveyed out and inquiried out on this issue. In the first inquiry, 22 responses to the river’s circumstances-or its health, as we have chosen to call it-were included in the evidence that we received. Of those, only seven related to river flows, and five of those represented areas where there was too much water. So we are down to two of 22 items of improvement that require increased river flows. The other 15 appear to have been forgotten. I will admit that my side of politics is no different from any other. I do not know whether it was just that the South Australians were happy when they were the last capital city in Australia to impose water restrictions. They retain a thing called Lake Alexendrina where half of the water that flows across their border evaporates. They could fix that by shifting the barrages at Goolwa to the other side and letting it become very much as it was when Sturt discovered it when he kept running aground: half salty. We talk of the Coorong having to be saved by keeping the mouth open. Traditionally, if you want the original ecology, I would argue that the river mouth probably closed off once every three years. Scientists have said that it was possibly one in 10, and I would not argue with that. What is more, it probably never was where it is MAIN COMMITTEE now; it has changed. That is all fine. WhatI am asking is: why have we suddenly focused on this simple, single, nicely packaged political issue that might do nothing for the river and is going to cost a packet? There could be better solutions. I am not arguing here that we should do nothing. I agree with the member for Wills that it is an issue. We do not destroy water; we simply pollute it to a point where it is not useful, although there is a degree of usefulness then, particularly in industry. But why are we not harvesting the runoff from our streets? By coincidence, all the water that runs off from this city and off the roof of this building ends up in the Murray-Darling river system. It is drunk a number of times on its way to Adelaide, where it is also drunk. As I have said, that could be some reason for the lousy beer there. But the fact is that nature does that purification, to the point where we purify it. We spend huge amounts of money purifying water to put on lawns, which do not need to have water purified to that degree. Why do we not insist that new subdivisions have a proper water collection system and a dual piping system so that we do not spend all that money purifying water that is going to go on lawns, which could even benefit from some of the impurities. By the way, all the sewerage water from this city goes into that same river system, as it does at Albury, Wagga Wagga and other big towns, and it works. In other words, our cities should be harvesting their street and roof water and pumping it back to their dams. I am saying all these things because I hope that Ken Matthews and his committee will sit down one day and say, ‘What is this all about?’ I will revert to the Murray River for a minute. When we concluded our day of evidence with all the scientists in one place, we got one unanimous decision: there was far too much focus on the volumetric issue with the Murray-Darling river, that we were wrong to go down the road we have gone down and that we should have been looking at all the options. Of course we should pipe more water. I found myself as conservation minister arguing with the Western Australian Court government about the idea of extending the Ord River waters in an open channel. We should not have any of them. I add that there are other factors against it with the Ord River. Of course there are good ecological reasons. But we must remember that, when Sturt got to the Darling, it was as salty as the sea and he referred to salt springs rising. There is a section of the Riverland where we have used salt bore interceptions and pumped the water away to a place called Stockman’s Flat and there is a distinct reduction in the incidence of salinity in that segment. Yes, it costs money; but it works. I am sure the member for Brand would agree with me that in Western Australia we have to do that with the groundwaters that are increasing the salinisation of our farmland. I might ask him, with his sort of brain, to consider what we might do in the future with that water by using solar voltaic panels to electrolyse that water where it is. I can tell him we can buy off the rack at the moment a container sized electrolyser like the ones that are being used in some areas for the new hydrogen buses we have in WA. Maybe a farmer will generate his own hydrogen while reducing his water table. What is more, when he gets the generator for a hydrogen generator it will probably be an independent unit that he will plug into his header. He will go out heading, come back and plug it into his tractor and go somewhere else. We have all these wonderful opportunities in front of us, and we have the narrow focus of a thing called environmental flows. I do not know what that means. I could not get any scientist to tell me what it means. But the people of South Australia think it means more water for AdeMAIN COMMITTEE laide. I assume an environmental flow has got to get to the ocean. The fish will be celebrating, but I am not really sure what other good it will do. As I said, I do not want to lay any criticism anywhere but I plead with everybody present to talk among their own party members and ask, ‘Have we got this right?’ I sincerely hope this lady, Jennifer Marohasy, is made a member of the board, because she will sort a few blokes out. I think that would be valuable. We have got to get away from making this an issue where someone thinks there are some votes. It is a huge issue and, as members will gather, being talkative I could go on for another hour on this. It is a different problem everywhere. But I have to plead that we shift it to one side. I plead that we really and truly one day get down to the reality that water only ever becomes impure: we never lose it. It is always somewhere, and it is a question of how we spend the money to return it to a state in which we can use it in our various ways. I have often said we should pump some of my salt water up to Kalgoorlie and let them desalinise it with all the waste heat they have up there. It is quite practical but, anyhow, I will stop at that point. I do plead that we look again. People should look at that report. It was provided in good conscience and it was supported by some good Labor people, because we were quite worried. would the member for O’Connor like to seek leave to table the document he has referred to as part of his submission? another one. Having said that, I will say that I think the member for O’Connor and I agree on one issue, which is that water is a precious resource. The National Water Commission Bill 2004 represents a statement by the Commonwealth parliament that we, their representatives, have taken heed of their requirement that we as a community get serious about improving the quality of our water and also accepting that there is a finite amount of it. It is for that very reason that the opposition, whilst it has some misgivings about some aspects of the bill, actually supports the bill. I also remind the member for O’Connor that in terms of harvesting water from metropolitan areas-this is a serious challenge to him-the provisions of the bill actually provide for a water wise communities program. That program is in the order of $200 million over a five year period, with grants of up to $50,000 allocated on a competitive basis. I only hope that his former senior minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, treats the potential allocation of these moneys on the basis of merit rather than in the manner in which he has allocated the scarce resources in the regional portfolio on the basis of where a particular project sits in a seat on the electoral pendulum. Let us take the politics out of this serious issue and make sure that these hard-earned taxpayers’ dollars are actually used to make real progress with respect to harvesting water and looking after this scarce resource in the future. It is in that context, as I have said, that the opposition supports the bill. I also support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Wills and shadow minister for the environment. I foreshadow my support for the more technical amendments to be moved by the member for Wills with respect to trying to improve and overcome some of the weaknesses in MAIN COMMITTEE",195,National Water Commission Bill 2004

270,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (5.52 P.m.),"I must say it is a hard act to follow.the National Water Commission Bill 2004, including locking in states’ rights in terms of representation and a capacity to be properly heard in relation to the allocation of financial resources available under this potential act. This will assist us as a community in making progress on the all important issue of water. I think it is also important that we have some regard to the historical nature of this bill. The National Water Initiative was originated by the Labor Party as part of its 1983 microeconomic reforms under the initial Hawke government and refreshed through the 1994 COAG water resource policy. As a successful government on microeconomic reform and as a party that is actually proud of its economic achievements, Labor believes that water is a precious resource. I say that because it allows us as a society to achieve a number of economic, social and environmental objectives, ranging from industrial and rural use to domestic needs, environmental protection and recreation and aesthetic appeal. I am pleased that the government has finally heard the message that was initiated by the Labor Party in its microeconomic reform process back in 1983. As a community, we have to accept that water is finite. It is therefore the responsibility of all governments to ensure that each use balances the social, economic and environmental objectives of our community. We must therefore allocate it fairly and, importantly, use it efficiently. It is clear that a strategic framework is required to ensure that it is used efficiently, distributed fairly and that issues such as environmental flows, salinity and land degradation are not forgotten. It was also under the previous Labor government that this framework was initially developed. If you listen to the minister responsible, the Deputy Prime Minister, it is as if we were never involved in trying to initiate real progress and sound work on the issue of water. In 1994, COAG endorsed a water reform framework which recognised that we collectively need to take responsibility for water management. This agreement recognised that water reform is a national issue that requires cooperation between state, territory and local government in association with the Commonwealth government-not the potential confrontationist model which could be the end result of the bill before the House this evening. It is also good to hear that the Deputy Prime Minister is intending to speak in this chamber on the value of water and the need to use it efficiently, and that he has accepted that it is his responsibility to do something serious about this question. But we should not forget that it has taken the Howard government-a government that likes to talk about its reform in terms of economic performance-nearly nine years to build on the 1994 COAG agreement, yet little progress has been made over that long period. It has taken the Howard government nine years to get to a committed position on the issue of water reform. Consider what has actually happened over that nine-year period: demand for water in Australia has increased; we have been gripped by drought; environmental issues such as salinity and land degradation have become paramount; and the community has become aware of the need to conserve and manage our water resource. Where has the Howard government been? During the recent election it all of a sudden discovered, for example, that the Murray is a major problem confronting Australia. It is also the responsibility of states and territory governments to continue to press the Commonwealth government with respect to putting in place a proper National Water Initiative through COAG. The opposition condemns the Howard government in relation to the funding of the National Water Initiative because it has shown up the mean approach of the Howard MAIN COMMITTEE government in terms of actually working with the states and trying to get a genuine commitment and a corporative working relationship between state, territory and local governments in association with the Commonwealth government on this issue. The truth is that the Howard government has failed in its core commitment to fund the water initiative with new funds. It is also important to note that the record shows that, in developing its water initiative, it has misled and cheated state and territory governments. The states correctly endorsed the water initiative and they rightfully did it in good faith on the basis, suggested by the Howard government in the lead-up to the endorsement of the water initiative, that this initiative would be funded with new money. The states worked on the basis that the Commonwealth would honour its commitment and provide adequate recognition to the serious issues at hand. What do we find at the 11th hour? Right in the midst of the recent Commonwealth election, the record shows that the Howard government yet again reneged on its commitment, just as it reneged today on its commitment announced during the election to have finalised by 1 December the announcements it made with great fanfare about a Tasmanian forest industry policy. But1 December has come and gone and the Howard government, despite a major announcement by the Prime Minister at Launceston about putting in place the details of that forest policy for Tasmania by 1 December, has breached its commitment not only to the working communities of Tasmania that depend on that policy for their future but also to the electors of Australia at large, because his announcement on forest policy was one that received widespread reporting in terms of trying to garnish votes in the lead-up to 9 October. That takes me back to the issues of promises and good faith. Instead of allocating new funds from a projected surplus of more than $20 billion, the Howard government has effectively robbed state and territory governments. In essence, it has robbed Peter to pay Paul by funding the water fund through the redirection of national competition payments and therefore potentially, post 2007-08, it has put at risk further progress on microeconomic reform at a national and state level. This decision also, I believe, flies in the face of cooperative Commonwealth-state relations. It calls into question the real commitment from the Howard government to water reform because it is robbing state and territory governments to pay for its policy. The end result is that the government has taken away from state finances what should be theirs to spend, as a result of their achievements on microeconomic reform, on education, hospitals, roads and other essential services. It is their money. They made the progress in accordance with a program of microeconomic reform originally initiated by Labor in government. This actually represents a dividend on that achievement for improvements in services at a state and territory level as a result of those agreements. What are we left with at a state and territory government level? They are now expected to pay twice. They have lost the funds that were promised by the Commonwealth as a result of microeconomic reform and they are now expected to put their hands in their pockets again and effectively match the Commonwealth in participating financially in making progress on water reform. I do not accept that state and territory governments should have to pay twice. It is a Commonwealth problem in association with state and territory governments, yet the Commonwealth is putting no new money into its water reform strategy. I would also say that, in terms of the national competition policy, which was initiated by the Keating Labor government, we should not forget that that reform yielded significant ecoMAIN COMMITTEE nomic benefits to Australia. I refer to the Productivity Commission’s recently published review on national competition policy reforms. It reported that the national competition policy has been a major contributor to Australia’s strong economic performance over the last 13 years. For example, it reports that for the five years from 1993-94 to 1998-99, more than half of which was under the Keating government, productivity growth rates were the highest they had been for some 40 years. In this period average household income grew by some $7,000. The report also notes that productivity growth has been slow since 1999, the period of the Howard government. As pointed out by the state and territory premiers and chief ministers in their letter to the Prime Minister of 16 September 2004, the Productivity Commission found in 1999 that competition reform would generate some $4.6 billion in additional revenue for the Commonwealth government. The significance of this is that, of this $4.6 billion, some 80 per cent results from state and territory government microeconomic reforms. The Productivity Commission’s recent review of national competition policy reforms also clearly supports this previous finding. The commission noted: The increase in Australia’s GDP and national income has also resulted in a substantial increase in taxation revenue-as the NCP agreement on competition payments anticipated. So it has been progress by state and territory governments that has earned them a right to these national competition policy payments. It is therefore wrong that, after the state and territory governments have done the hard yards, the Howard government turns around and, under the guise of water reform, in essence takes that money off them. State and territory governments remain committed-as does federal Labor-to the water reform process begun under the Hawke and Keating governments. It is Labor in action doing the hard yards yet again. The difference is that Labor is always prepared to pay its way and reward those who are prepared to do the hard work-in this instance, state and territory governments-and it is always the conservatives who want to take the easy option and run away from their responsibilities. The unilateral decision of the Howard government to redirect national competition policy payments demonstrates that the Howard government are not really interested in or committed to the principles embodied in the agreement before the House this evening. It is also a further example of the Howard government talking the talk but not being able to walk the walk because they are cowards when it comes to hard economic reform in Australia. They are more interested in taking credit for reaching landmark agreements and announcing a series of infrastructure projects than they are in delivering real benefits to the Australian community. I note that National Party MPs seem more interested in announcing projects determined in a corrupt political manner, to be funded out of funds, rather than doing the hard yards on the ground to get it right by following due process, securing fair funding and working with the states to achieve long-term goals. That is the real challenge to the Howard government with respect to the water wise communities program. Will those grants be given in a non-political way, or will they yet again be used for pork-barrelling purposes by the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services-the minister responsible for the bill before the chamber this evening? MAIN COMMITTEE During the election campaign we saw the Deputy Prime Minister announce a $20 million project, the Macalister Irrigation District irrigation project, in the marginal seat of Gippsland, and De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson, who has recently risen to ministerial status, pledging an unspecified amount to the development of the Urannah Dam in the seat of Dawson. Where is the paperwork concerning the justification in terms of economic return to Australia for those projects pork-barrelled yet again during the election campaign? I simply suggest that they are probably writing the paperwork at this very moment. What happened to the due process in relation to these announcements? Is the water wise program going to be handled in the same way-that is, no due process, using taxpayers’ money for corrupt, short-term political purposes?

We want honesty and integrity-something that the Howard government is not known for, as has clearly been displayed during question time in the last couple of days with respect to the management of the Regional Solutions programs throughout Australia. They were corruptly managed during the election campaign, and time will show that we have a minister in charge of that who is incapable of doing the right thing by the Australian community. He is corrupt when it comes to pork-barrelling and the management of Regional Solutions programs in Australia. He is a disgrace to the Australian community.

I commend the bill, the second reading amendment and the amendments to be moved by the member for Wills to the House. on how well we use our finite natural resources-particularly our scarce water resources. Water is so important to all Australians. Our country is the driest inhabited continent. While we have around five per cent of the world’s landmass, we have only one per cent of the world river flow. As more and more families escape the flurry of Sydney for the relaxed way of life in my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast this rapid population growth is placing pressure on our local water resources. Indeed, population growth throughout Australia and its variable climate are placing pressure on water availability for all Australian cities and towns. The Australian government has established the National Water Initiative, which will play a vital role in protecting and improving our dwindling water supplies. The National Water Initiative was signed by the Australian government and state and territory governments-minus Western Australia and Tasmania-at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 25 June this year. It will be possible for Western Australia and Tasmania to become parties to the National Water Initiative at a later date, should they wish to do so. The National Water Initiative sets out the processes for ongoing implementation of water reform actions, and central to this is the establishment of the National Water Commission. The purpose of this bill is to establish the National Water Commission as an independent statutory body with two key functions: firstly, assessing the implementation and promoting the objectives and outcomes of the historic National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement and, secondly, advising on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under the Australian water fund. The establishment of the commission will enable timely delivery of our election commitments, the Water Smart Australia and Raising National Water Standards programs. I have no doubt that this pact between federal and state governments will pave the way for major national water reform. Establishing the commission demonstrates the government’s strong commitment to getting on with the job. It shows the government’s commitment to implementing the National Water Initiative, improving water resource management in Australia and providing $2 billion in financial assistance over five years to accelerate the development and uptake of smart technologies and practices in water use across Australia.

The first two elements of the Australian water fund will be administered by the commission and the latter by the Department of the Environment and Heritage. Under the Water Smart Australia program $1.6 billion will be invested over five years to accelerate the uptake of these technologies across Australia. Funds will be made available directly to projects, taking into account the financial contribution offered by local government bodies, state and territory governments and/or industry. To gain greatest effect from these investments, competitive bidding will be the primary mechanism for allocating grants. This process will ensure that the Australian water fund is used directly on projects and that funds are not diverted to unnecessary and wasteful administration. Locally, we are very keen to get a share of the federal funding to assist our options to improve our diminishing water supply. I am very pleased to see that both Central Coast councils are taking a joint approach to obtaining funding under the $2 billion water fund. In fact on Monday the joint Gosford-Wyong water authority will have the opportunity to meet with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon. Ian Campbell, to discuss and put forward their funding proposal and options for improving our water supply for evaluation and comment by the minister. On behalf of Gosford and Wyong councils, I say a big thank you to the minister, who kindly fitted us into his busy schedule. In addition to and building on the Australian government’s involvement in solving the environmental problem at Tumbi Creek, Wyong Shire Council and I are keen to examine the processes for gaining Commonwealth support for further environmental works on the Tuggerah Lakes system. Senator Ian Campbell, during his visit to the Central Coast in September, established that the Tuggerah Lakes could be one of 20 projects to be managed under the federal government’s $2 billion National Water Initiative over the next year. My electorate would be delighted with this sort of assistance, and I would be very grateful to work closely with the minister in the coming months to protect and restore the jewel of the Central Coast-that is, Tuggerah Lakes. Our water catchment is our most precious asset on the Central Coast and it is something we must work hard to protect. I will continue to work with all levels of government to ensure that this happens. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be poured into Australian local governments to help them improve water management practices as a result of the coalition’s water policy and it is my intention that the Central Coast gets its portion of the funding pie. This program is great news for councils that have historically lacked financial resources for new and innovative water projects and was a means by which the federal government could fund a wide variety of projects. Examples of the types of projects that would be eligible include improving river flows; on-farm water use efficiency improvements; desalination of water for use in cities and towns; recycling and reuse of stormwater and grey water; more efficient storage facilities, such as underground aquifers; alternatives to ocean outfalls and better management of sewage in our coastal cities and towns; improvements in irrigation infrastructure; and developing water efficient housing design. Ironically, while the Australian government continues to work closely with local councils across Australia, achieving real on-the-ground results for communities, it is disappointing that the state government never came to the party locally. Particularly when it came to providing a MAIN COMMITTEE one-third share for funding for the dredging at Tumbi Creek, the state government was not to be seen. My constituents are very grateful for the Howard government’s generosity that allowed us to double our funding and offer $1.3 million to cover the federal and state share of the funding. Now, returning to the matter at hand, better management of water demands better information and better capacity for measuring, monitoring and managing our water resources. The Howard government recognises that we need to lift Australia’s national capacity to manage water resources if we are to achieve our National Water Initiative outcomes. The coalition government will therefore invest $200 million over five years to support a nationally consistent system for water management under the Raising National Water Standards program. This would involve water accounting, including automated data collection at monitoring stations; national standards for water accounting and metering; and improved hydrologic modelling of priority water sources. A nationally consistent system for collecting and processing water related data is important to create confidence in decisions by investors in the water market and the water industry, more broadly. Secondly, as information on ground water resources is currently patchy, which can lead to poor resource management, the program would look at strategic ground water assessment. Thirdly, the program would involve working with local communities to improve the conservation of high environmental value water systems. Through planning, voluntary conservation agreements and improved knowledge, we can avoid the kinds of costs in remediation we have seen, for example, throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. Finally, there would be a water efficiency labelling scheme for household water appliances, and development and implementation of the ‘smart water mark’ regime for household users. The Water Wise Communities program completes the coalition’s $2 billion water fund and builds on other initiatives to improve the use and quality of our resources. As I said earlier, this branch will be administered by the Department of the Environment and Heritage, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Interest within my electorate about this initiative that promotes a culture of water wise use has been phenomenal. The response I have had from my constituents-letters and phone calls-seeking information on how to get involved in this important initiative has been second to none. It is a delight to see people eager to get involved in water use efficiency. Local communities, local businesses and local government play an important role in the efficient use and storage of our precious water resource. By acting together, nationally and locally, we can improve the management of our water resources to deliver on-the-ground results that meet the needs of our rural and urban communities, our industries and our environment. The National Water Initiative sets the basis for water access entitlements, best practice water pricing, water resource accounting, urban water reform, community partnerships and adjustment. When fully implemented, it will result in a nationally compatible market and a regulatory and planning system to manage surface and ground water resources for rural and urban use, and it will lead to major national water reform. The National Water Initiative and the creation of the commission demonstrate the government’s dedication and commitment to reforming water resource management across Australia. The government’s $2 billion Australian water fund builds on the coalition government’s investment in the $3 billion Natural Heritage Trust, the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for MAIN COMMITTEE Salinity and Water Quality, the successful Greencorps initiative, the National Landcare Program and the Envirofund. Due to its sound economic management, the coalition government can make significant investments in water solutions and deliver more on-the-ground results for current and future generations. Through the coalition government’s leadership, the signing of two historic water agreements-the National Water Initiative and the Living Murray initiative-has set the national water reform agenda for the next 10 years and beyond. These coalition led agreements have laid the foundation for increased agricultural productivity and better environmental outcomes. They will lead to improved management of our water resources across the country and into the future. The Australian government, local communities, farmers and industries are getting on with the job of improving our land and water management. This is a fund for practical, on-the-ground water solutions. This bill will make a real difference to our water efficiency. It will create opportunities for our industries, for investment and for jobs, and it will protect and restore our environment. I commend this bill to the House. Commission Bill 2004. This bill establishes the National Water Commission as an independent statutory body, with two key functions: firstly, assessing the implementation and promoting the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement and, secondly, advising on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under the Australian water fund. As my colleague the member for Wills has noted, Labor are supporting the bill, but we do have an important second reading amendment, as well as a specific amendment to provisions of the bill. The development of a framework to address the efficient and sustainable management of Australia’s water resources has been on the agenda of federal governments since 1994. Once again, it was a Labor government that put a big issue on the Australian political agenda. In 1994, the Council of Australian Governments agreed upon a strategic framework for necessary water reforms covering water pricing, institutional arrangements, sustainable water resource management and community consultation. In my view, the government has failed to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency, allowing the COAG water reform process of 1994 to stall and failing to provide any environmental flows for the Murray in the more than eight years it has been in office. This is on top of the government’s failure to take seriously the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for our farmers and our rivers. It is well accepted that the issues of climate change and water use are closely connected. The failure of the government to engage in the international debate over climate change is a disgrace. It is simply not good enough for an advanced industrial country such as Australia to bury its head and behave selfishly in relation to what is clearly the world’s greatest environmental challenge. I note that the Howard government Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has described himself for many years as a sceptic on global warming and climate change. I note that this has changed somewhat recently. In an interview on the Insiders program on 25 July this year, Senator Campbell stated that he was not a sceptic any more. He now describes climate change as ‘the biggest environmental challenge’. Well, hallelujah! Welcome to the sane world of environmental policy debate, Minister. Once the minister was provided with a bit of factual information and a bit of science, he stated in that interview that Australia was ‘well placed to play an important role’ in addressing climate MAIN COMMITTEE",204,National Water Commission Bill 2004
280,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (6.24 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the National Waterchange. Like many Australians, I therefore look forward to the government joining the overwhelming majority of the advanced industrial world and ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Such a step would be playing an important role, but I will not hold my breath. As with most things this government does on the environment, its words are vastly different to its actions. The debate is taking place on 1 December. This was the day when the government, according to its own deadline, in its policy and in the Prime Minister’s statement in Tasmania on 6 October, was going to release the detailed maps outlining precisely what areas of the great Tasmanian forests would be saved. This was the day when we would get the details of the 170,000 hectares. That day is today, and yet again there is no response. That was the government’s self-imposed deadline, and the environment minister says that that timetable was ambitious. It was the minister and the Prime Minister who set that deadline, but, once again, it was all about politics, not about substance, just like the government’s approach to the critical issue of water. Nevertheless, the bill before us today is a small step forward. Adopting strategies for managing our water use is clearly worthwhile, albeit overdue. Setting up the National Water Commission is a good idea. However, in isolation and without a proper policy connection to the phenomena of climate change and other issues such as deforestation, land use, sustainable energy and pollution, the government’s broader water policy is not comprehensive and risks not meeting its own targets as a result of in-built flaws. It is now well accepted by governments, scientists, the community and now even the Howard government’s new Minister for the Environment and Heritage that the emission of greenhouse gases associated with industrialisation and strong economic growth from a world population that has increased sixfold in 200 years is causing climate change and global warming at an alarming rate. The rate of global warming is simply unsustainable in the long term. I agree with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that, by ‘long term’, we do not mean centuries ahead. The impact will be felt within coming decades unless steps are taken to arrest global warming. Indeed, we are witnessing at present the significant impact of climate change. When I say ‘unsustainable’, I am agreeing that global warming is not a phenomenon which will merely cause problems of adjustment. Global warming is a challenge so big and irreversible in its destructive power that it could radically change our planet. The impact of climate change on water supplies for our farmers and our rivers is a very real threat. It should never be understated. Issues such as evaporation rates are very real issues for water users. For example, a rise of less than one degree Celsius significantly impacts on water volume. Climate change and its impact on fundamental issues such as water supply is a real problem that requires courage and vision if it is to be dealt with. Unfortunately, both of these precious political commodities are in short supply in the Howard government. The Howard government prefers to play short-term politics with such issues. As British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, stated in a major speech on climate change on 15 September this year: … the challenge is complicated politically by two factors. First, its likely effect will not be felt to its full extent until after the time for the political decisions that need to be taken, has passed. In other words, there is a mismatch in timing between the environmental and electoral impact. Secondly, no one nation alone can resolve it. It has no definable boundaries. Short of international action commonly agreed and commonly followed through, it is hard even for a large country to make a difference on its own. MAIN COMMITTEE The words of Prime Minister Tony Blair have resonance not only on the important issue of climate change; they also underscore my earlier point that government policy on all major environmental matters, be it water policy or climate change, must take a holistic and systematic approach to the issue and the proposed solutions. Historically the development of Australia’s water resources has brought benefits to all Australians. However, past policies and investments have not always recognised our variable climate and river flows or the natural limits of our rivers and landscape systems. It has been accepted for many years that Australia needs a national water policy framework that articulates a long-term vision for the management of rivers and water resources across the nation. This policy must meet the needs of our rivers, industries, rural people and urban communities for generations to come. It is only with such a long-term approach that we can sensibly and sustainably manage the use of water in Australia. Our approach must not only address resource security and river health but it must also embody sound science and respect the interests of water users. This approach to water use was set out in a landmark joint statement issued by the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation on 23 July this year. These two groups are not ones who put out that many joint statements. The only other one I can think of was in relation to Landcare and that was more than a decade ago. So, when these two respected organisations put out a joint statement on a matter of critical national importance, it is worth taking a close look at it. Their statement has a direct bearing on the bill before us today. The joint NFF-ACF statement calls on the government to commit to implementing a robust national framework providing guaranteed and tradable water entitlements with strong safeguards for river and landscape health into the future; establish a Commonwealth-state fund and plan to achieve ecosystem health and sustainable water use with defined structural adjustment, particularly within the Murray-Darling river system, over the next 10 to 15 years; establish an audit and assessment of our northern rivers to inform future decision-making, planning and the sustainable development of new opportunities; implement a national heritage rivers reserve system to protect rivers of agreed high conservation values over a 10-year period; and ensure a secure new source of funds to help address these and other environmental and natural resource management needs. In general terms, I agree with this approach. In the same way that our response to climate change would throw up opportunities for the development of alternative energy sources, so should a positive response to the challenges of water use and management create new opportunities. For example, to draw on some of the good research done by the NFF and the ACF, reforming our water entitlement and trading systems would unleash dramatic improvements in water efficiency and productivity, facilitate investment and help to achieve our environmental objectives. Securing river health, through improved flows and science based management, would benefit not only the environment but also agricultural industries and recreational users. Strategic investment in a long-term water policy would build confidence, catalyse better use of our resources, enhance the opportunities and resilience of rural communities and provide significant benefits to the nation as a whole. Unfortunately, the government’s policy on water did not rise to the challenge. As I noted earlier, in 1994 COAG agreed upon a strategic framework for necessary water reforms covering water pricing, institutional arrangements, sustainable water resource management and MAIN COMMITTEE community consultation. Most states and territories signed the National Water Initiative agreement in June 2004. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.36 p.m. to 6.49 p.m. velop a nationally compatible market, regulatory and planning based system of managing surface and ground water resources for rural and urban use that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes. In September 2004, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister finally released the Liberal Party’s long-awaited water policy, Securing Australia’s Water Future. The policy revealed that, of the total money pledged for the fund, the government expected the states to contribute $1.6 billion from funds allocated to them under the National Competition Principles Agreement. Not surprisingly, the state premiers reacted to this. This decision was quite clearly in breach of national competition policy agreements. Such is the Howard government’s weak commitment to this critical area of national policy that, after dilly-dallying for eight years, it now wants to play chicken with the states over the money. The policy is the government’s primary water program, targeting water use efficiency, recycling and reuse. This policy is a basis for delivering the Australian water fund a $2 billion program over five years. The Commonwealth is now establishing the National Water Commission to drive the national water reform agenda. The National Water Commission will be an independent statutory body responsible for providing advice to COAG and the Commonwealth on national water issues and to assist with the implementation of the National Water Initiative. This bill assigns the commission the dual role of assessing the progress of Australian governments in water reform and advising on and administering Commonwealth financial assistance under the Australian water fund. While Labor will ultimately be supporting the bill, the government’s water policy has a number of specific flaws which I would like to touch on briefly. Firstly, the smart water fund has been committed to the series of projects listed in the election policy paper. Surely this undermines the policy commitments that projects will be assessed on a competitive basis. Secondly, the government has made it clear that its water wise communities program will support projects up to a value of $50,000. The water wise communities program has a total value of $200 million over five years. This will mean that more than 4,000 projects will be administered by the department. To put it mildly, it is very unlikely that there will be much project quality control and accountability for this expenditure. Thirdly, there is limited focus on securing and returning environmental flows to stressed systems. As a result, project funding is skewed to private benefit. Fourthly, a major criticism of the Natural Heritage Trust has been that catchment and bioregional investments have been made in the absence of clear, measurable environmental quality targets. This $2 billion Australian water fund potentially cuts across the targets based approach of regional delivery, ignoring the important lessons that have arisen from the Natural Heritage Trust. Unless spending under the Australian water fund is linked to time lines and targets for river health, the fund could well be wasted-like water down the drain, if you excuse the analogy. I sincerely hope it is not, but the structure of the fund gives serious concern it might be wasted. As we have seen with the government’s rorting of federal funding for regional projects during the election campaign, its attitude to the basic principles of financial management MAIN COMMITTEE",207,National Water Commission Bill 2004
281,Mr Albanese,"The aim of the government’s belated National Water Initiative is to deand accountability is one of arrogance. There are many issues and questions that should have been addressed by the government in the development of its water policy and management of the Australian water fund. These issues go to the heart of how good public policy should be developed and how public money should be managed. I am sorry to say that, on both counts, the government has let Australia down. I would like to finish my comments on the National Water Commission Bill and national water policy in general with some comments about the urgent plight of the Murray River. It is of utmost importance that federal and state governments sort out their differences and come together again on water and place restoring the Murray to health as an urgent priority. The ACF and numerous other environmental and community groups are calling for the government’s national water policy to ensure the Murray and other river systems are restored to health while supporting efficient and productive water use for farmers. A leaked Murray-Darling Basin Commission report on the decline of the Murray River red gums highlighted the consequences of a failure to act on river health. This leaked Murray-Darling Basin Commission report shows the number of river red gums counted as stressed, dying or dead has risen from 51 per cent to 75 per cent just over the last 18 months. I agree with the ACF that these findings are alarming. The federal government must take urgent action to save the Murray’s red gums and floodplains. The stand-off over funding for the National Water Initiative must be resolved and the desperate plight of the Murray must be dealt with urgently. The Murray is Australia’s most important river and it is on its last legs. In November 2003, the federal government committed to giving the Murray 500 billion litres within five years. So far, no water has returned to the Murray-not a drop. Earlier in 2004, Labor made an election commitment to allocating $500 million over four years to secure increased flows for the Murray. Labor’s commitment included adding 1,500 gigalitres in annual environmental flows into the Murray. That is the equivalent of adding three times the volume of Sydney Harbour. We remain committed to taking leadership and direct action on saving the Murray River. The desperate plight of the Murray River has been on the national agenda for many years. However, it has taken the Howard government more than eight years to bring together a policy framework for addressing its plight and the broader issue of water management. As I said earlier, these issues go to the heart of how good public policy should be developed and how public money should be managed. I am sorry to say that on both counts the government has let Australia down. It would be a good start if the Howard government stopped dilly-dallying and playing chicken with the states over the funding. The federal government has to take responsibility for the delays. Its lack of leadership and accountability on these issues is telling. These issues are ones of national importance and they are for the national government to show leadership on and to resolve. The fact that there is not a single National Party member participating in this debate-it was moved by the Deputy Prime Minister but there is not one National Party member on the speakers list-shows the contempt that the National Party have for regional and rural Australia. I urge members to support Labor’s amendments to this bill. The introduction into this parliament of the National Water Commission Bill 2004 will in time be seen as a significant step in Australia’s history, as it is part of this country’s move to achieve sustainable use of our water. MAIN COMMITTEE",210,National Water Commission Bill 2004
282,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (6.57 p.m.)During the last parliamentary term, most of the states and territories agreed, along with the Commonwealth, to the National Water Initiative. This in itself is a significant achievement. However, cooperation between governments on this matter must continue if real progress is to be made. The bill establishes the National Water Commission. This will be a statutory body with seven commissioners, four nominated by the Commonwealth and the other three nominated by the states. The National Water Commission will have two main roles. The first role involves assessing the implementation and promoting the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement. The second is advising on the financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under the Australian water fund. The importance of that first point cannot be overstated. We know that in Australia we have incredible variations weather wise and incredible variations in access to water. We have floods in the north at times when there is absolute drought happening elsewhere. When you look along many of the coastal parts of Australia there is rain falling one day and so much of it is in the sea the next day. We have competing interests right across the nation. We have quite substantially growing cities. I was talking with my colleague the member for Fairfax the other day. He was telling me that in his region about 1,500 new people every month go onto the electoral roll, which gives you some idea of the incredible growth of that part of Australia. Irrigated agriculture is another competing interest. We need to be drought proofing many of our other agricultural industries. Salinity also has to be dealt with. In the last parliament I chaired the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation and the last report we did was into salinity and the science behind many of the problems. that report, which we are awaiting a response to. It was brought down not long before the election and contains some great recommendations. Those recommendations are relevant to this bill and I know that the government will be considering those recommendations. There are so many competing interests with climate change and the environment. If we do not get this right now, the country will suffer not for decades but probably for hundreds of years. The National Water Commission will really be the key driver to address these issues. It will evaluate progress and implement outcomes, objectives and actions of the National Water Initiative and report to COAG. It will assess commitments under the national competition policy water reforms and it will undertake an initial stocktake of Australia’s water resources and water management arrangements. The reason for the National Water Commission being established within the Prime Minister’s portfolio, even though the real work over a long period of time towards this was done by the Deputy Prime Minister, is that issue of COAG; it really needs to be done at that highest level between the Commonwealth and state governments. But I emphasise the incredible work done by the Deputy Prime Minister to get this to this point. Right at this moment he is in the House of Representatives alcove area launching senior research fellowships for Land and Water Australia. He takes such a strong interest in all aspects of water and I know he is keen to see this bill passed by the parliament. The second role of the National Water Commission relates to the Australian water fund. There are three programs in all in that fund: the $1.6 billion water smart Australia, the $200 MAIN COMMITTEE",211,National Water Commission Bill 2004
283,Mr Hatton,It was a good report.,212,National Water Commission Bill 2004
284,Mr Nairn,"It was an excellent report, as the member for Blaxland says. He assisted withmillion raising national water standards program and the $200 million water wise communities. The member for Grayndler rabbited on earlier about details of water wise communities. That program will be administered by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The first two of those programs will be the subject of responsibility by the National Water Commission. Some of the projects that would be eligible under the $1.6 billion water smart Australia program were set out in a document we put out during the election campaign. It covered things such as improving river flows, on-farm water use efficiency improvements, desalination of water for use in cities and towns, the recycling and reuse of stormwater and grey water, more efficient storage facilities such as underground aquifers, alternatives to ocean outfalls, better management of sewerage in our coastal cities and towns, improvements in irrigation infrastructure, and development of water efficient housing design. A full range of projects could be funded under this program. When we look at all of those programs together, we get the whole picture. It is not just about water storage or water efficiency in the way it is used; it is about its treatment, its reuse and ensuring that the whole cycle is as efficient as possible. Things that could be involved under the national water standards program include water accounting. A nationally consistent system for collecting and processing water related data is needed-so that could be one part of it. Strategic ground water assessment is another aspect. By working with local communities, we can improve the conservation of high environmental value water systems-and some studies have really emphasised this-so some planning work can be involved in that. Water efficiency labelling schemes could be involved-the establishment and promotion of a six-star rating for household water appliances and the development and implementation of a ‘smart water mark’ regime for household gardens, including garden irrigation equipment, garden designs and plants. That is setting some of the standards that we want to see applied not just in some parts of the nation but right across the board, and there is $200 million over five years to support that program. AlreadyI think there have been a number of projects identified that could be funded under the water smart Australia program. Some of those projects, which I am sure will be of interest to many of the members in the House, include ‘waterproofing’ Adelaide through capturing, storing, using and reusing stormwater or through greater reuse of effluent, thereby placing less demand on the River Murray. I do not think anybody would deny the problems that Adelaide has had for a long time. Anybody who visits Adelaide knows that it is always a bit iffy about its water. Hopefully we will see in the future that people will not recognise Adelaide in that way. Other examples could include cost-efficient recycling of water to provide increased water supply and better environmental outcomes, such as the Mackay water-recycling proposal, the South-East Queensland water use efficiency and recycling program or the use of high-quality recycled water from the Melbourne Eastern Treatment Plant, aimed at closing the Gunnamatta outfall. Projects could include improving water use efficiency in new urban developments and improving irrigation channel systems. There are a number of those systems, and probably the standout one is the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline proposal. Currently we have so many of those channels in open areas, so much evaporation and so much loss. That is a major project that could come in under this program. Projects could include investment in new channel control technologies, applying desalination technology in the MAIN COMMITTEE appropriate areas, improving accounting for water use, and increasing understanding of how our rivers, wetlands and estuaries work. There is some work up in the Queensland river areas particularly in relation to that. Also, there should be a recognition that levels of water extraction in excess of what is sustainable cannot continue, and in some instances targeted assistance to individuals and communities may be in order. There could be quite a number of projects, and I know that there will be many others that members will bring forward. In my own electorate there are already quite a number of obvious areas that need assistance. My whole electorate currently, for the first time ever, is the subject of exceptional circumstances assistance because it has been in drought for so long. Every square kilometreevery square inch, in fact-of my electorate of Eden-Monaro has exceptional circumstances at the moment, which tells you about some of the problems that we have, water wise. Down on the coast, both the Eurobodalla and the Bega Valley councils have problems with water, and they will be exacerbated over the coming weeks as so many of the people who live in Canberra and elsewhere flock to the coast for the Christmas period and put an additional strain on those areas. But there are some really interesting projects already coming forward. Last week, for instance, I met with some of the directors and other staff of Bega Cheese. They are trying to help their farmers to achieve very efficient use of water on farms to maximise their output but at the same time to have the best possible environmental outcome as well. Industry is working with local government which is working with, hopefully, state government and hopefully also with federal government to package those sorts of situations together so that it is a question not just of getting some more water for a particular farm but of the whole process-starting with capturing some of the water that is disappearing out to sea within 24 hours so that it can then be efficiently used for agricultural production and also for a better environmental outcome. The Cochrane Dam on the Bemboka River, where quite a number of the farmers basically control the level of flow from that dam, is probably a good example of that now. Right through this drought period of the last couple of years, through good management of that water, they have been able to keep flows in the Bemboka River for environmental purposes and still irrigate their farms in part as well-right through that very dry period. If we could extrapolate that good management right across the Bega Valley, everybody would benefit. Other parts of my electorate-Nimmitabel, for instance; a little town between Cooma and the coast-have been on level six water restrictions almost constantly, or at least on and off, for the last couple of years. Level six restrictions mean that you cannot put anything on your garden. In fact, at one stage they had council staff out there checking water meters to make sure that nobody was using too much water. It was that bad. Fortunately, there is a bit of water in the McLaughlin at the moment and they are all able to have a shower regularly now, which they could not do for some time. So there are some real problem areas, and I know this is duplicated right across the nation. We have a problem in Queanbeyan with water, but that is probably more a case of the ACT and New South Wales governments needing to finally get down and talk. At the moment, the ACT government, through their arrogance, are virtually acting as de facto planning approvers for anything happening in Queanbeyan. They are preventing virtually any new development in Queanbeyan. That needs to get sorted out ASAP. This is all part of the water issue. MAIN COMMITTEE I will have an ongoing involvement in this over the coming months and years, having been appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and this being within the Prime Minister’s portfolio. He has asked me to assist him to further this initiative. Certainly, I have an interest for a variety of reasons. Firstly, what is happening in my own electorate will keep me on the ball with work on this; that is for sure. Secondly, as I mentioned before, there was my role in chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation and the work we did on salinity in the last parliament. The third area is my former profession. As a surveyor and a mapper, there are many aspects of this that I have a particular interest in. In fact, my old professional industry body, which is now called the Australian Spatial Information Business Association and which was previously the Association of Consulting Surveyors-which I was the deputy chair of prior to being elected to parliament in 1996-did a consultancy for the Deputy Prime Minister, along with ACIL, to look at the issues of property rights with water. They put together an excellent report to the Deputy Prime Minister looking at similar use of the Torrens type system and applying it to water. These are going to be real issues that we have to grapple with in the coming time. Some great work has been done by my old profession in assisting in that way. I am a bit amused, I suppose, by the feinted opposition that the opposition have shown to this bill with their amendment. If you read it, you will see that it is not really an amendment; it is just a political statement on the bill. I guess it is their right to do that. But I think it would be better if they would just come on board and work with us on this. They always bring up climate change and Kyoto. It seems that there may be some conflict between the member for Wills and the member for Grayndler. I am not sure who is the shadow minister for the environment, but I know that the member for Wills always trots out the old comment: ‘Sign Kyoto and you solve all the problems of the world tomorrow.’ I guess it is a bit like the situation during the election campaign, when the Labor Party were lacking any economic credibility, so the powers that be said, ‘Quick, Mark, race out and sign a piece of cardboard and that will give us credibility.’ People think that signing the Kyoto protocol solves all the climate problems overnight, which is just a nonsense. It also seems that, when the opposition talk about the issues of water and the environment, the only thing they can ever talk about is the River Murray. It is as if the River Murray is the only river that exists in Australia. If you look back at some of their speeches, you will see that they always go back to the River Murray. In this so-called amendment they criticise the funding aspect of the legislation and say that the money was earmarked for schools and hospitals. But they forgot to mention in the election campaign that the Labor Party were going to use the same money from competition payments to fund Medicare Gold. So they were going to use money for something that was totally unsustainable. We are using money for something that will give us a sustainable use of water for the future. The Howard government has the runs on the board with the National Water Initiative, but the innings has only just begun. Ensuring the sustainability of water use will require a team effort. The team is ‘Team Australia’-not just the Australian government but all the governments of Australia need to be part of this team. There is much more to do, and I look forward to working with the Prime Minister, other colleagues and the states and territories in addressing the most important issue facing our country over the next few years. This bill is a further step in the process, and I commend it to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE this debate on the National Water Commission Bill 2004, and I am really pleased to see the new-found interest of the Liberal Party in water issues. The question I would put to this chamber today is: where have you been for the past eight years? I think it is symptomatic of the confected concern that you have for water and for rural communities that the National Party are not even represented in this debate. No wonder they are going backwards in rural and regional areas, and no wonder members on the Liberal back bench are always getting in our ear about how they would like to be rid of the National Party if they could. You only have to be around this place for a couple of years to realise that the National Party is not only on the nose in rural communities but on the nose in the coalition itself. NowI think you could fit them all in a phone box. I would have thought that at least one of them would have slipped out of the phone box, come into the Main Committee and participated in the debate on the greatest issue that the country is going to face. That is according to the honourable parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. SoI say to the honourable member for Dobell, who is here holding the fort for this ramshackle government that has just been re-elected: go out and drag the National Party members in here to participate in this debate if it is so important and so significant to this country. This bill finally brings to fruition the process of water reforms started by Labor more than a decade ago and first formalised by COAG back in 1994 as the strategic framework for the efficient and sustainable reform of the Australian water industry. Let there be no doubt about this particular fact: it was Labor in government that had the vision to start this process. Labor in government was the visionary in tackling what the parliamentary secretary now says is the greatest issue facing Australia. That was back in 1994-a decade ago. The issue of water reform fell right off the agenda during the first two terms of the Howard government. During this period, the government took its collective eye off the ball as far as COAG and water reform were concerned. The honourable member for Franklin came into the House in that fabulous class of 1993. In 1994, this issue was put fairly and squarely on the national agenda by Labor in government. What did the newly elected Liberal Prime Minister do in his first term in office, which began in 1996? He shied away from COAG like Dracula from a stake. He would not go near COAG to deal with what the parliamentary secretary now says is the most important issue facing Australia today. If it is important now, it was doubly important that we got on top of this issue back in the mid-1990s. We have effectively lost years because of the sheer incompetence and the lack of vision and political will of this government. In 1996 the Labor government handed this government a unique opportunity to deliver real long-term water reform. But, as history has shown, instead of picking up the issue and running with it the government allowed this issue to fall right off the radar. Instead of action from this government on this issue vital to our national interests and vital to every urban and regional Australian, we have had eight wasted years. Luckily, the issue never fell off our agenda. It never fell off our radar and it did not fall off the radar of organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation. It took until 2003 for the Howard government to give this issue the recognition it deserves. It took until August 2003 to get to the point of reaching agreement with the states on the key elements of the National Water Initiative. Then you tried to portray it as a national water iniMAIN COMMITTEE",212,National Water Commission Bill 2004
285,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (7.15 P.m.),"I am very pleased indeed to participate intiative when it did not even have the state of Tasmania and the state of Western Australia in the cart. You can waste $100 million on useless advertising to save your political skins and get you re-elected but you cannot turn a few tens of millions of dollars the way of the states of Tasmania and WA, with their unique water problems and situations, to get them in the cart for a truly national water initiative. If the Prime Minister had maintained the momentum on water reform that he inherited from Labor, we could have been at the point we are at now six years ago. We should have been having this debate back in 1997 and 1998. But at least now-and thank goodness for small mercies-we have dragged the coalition, as we always do, into the 21st century to confront the real issues facing Australia today. At least we have this bill on the table to debate. The bill before us today establishes the National Water Commission as an independent statutory body and it gives it two key responsibilities. The commission will assess the implementation of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement and will promote its objectives and outcomes. It will also advise the government on expenditure under two of the three programs of the Australian water fund. The water smart program will accelerate the development and uptake of new and better technologies and best practice in the use of water in urban, rural and regional Australia. Why has it taken until now for us to have a water smart program for urban areas? Every time it rains in my electorate of CorioI like getting out and having a run in the rain-I am an old country boy. I run with my clothes on. I go out and have a run in the rain. I go down to Rippleside Park and there is the stormwater belching into the bay. Of course, on more than one occasion I have taken myself out of the political arena and, as John Citizen running at Rippleside Park, I have asked, ‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we had a government with vision that would establish a water smart program so that we could address this particular issue of waste and reuse of urban water?’ I guess it is great that the coalition has finally woken up to the fact that we have to get smart with the science and innovations to not only get on top of this problem but also create real wealth in regional as well as urban areas from the technologies that are going to spin off from this national effort. The raising national water standards program will provide funds to improve the way we measure, monitor and manage our water resources. Thank goodness for that particular element of the program. A third program, water wise communities, while part of the Australian water fund, will not be a part of the remit of the National Water Commission. Instead, it will be jointly administered by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. To my knowledge, the National Party minister who handles the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio is not participating in this debate. Of course, he has had the water issue, like so many others, taken out of his area of responsibility and now it is in the Prime Minister’s responsibility so that he can try to drive some action on this issue. How incompetent can you be? I would hate to be in the minister’s position, to have this key area of policy snatched away from me by a Liberal Prime Minister who points the finger, pats the head and says: ‘Sit down over there. I’ll handle it now, you dill. You’ve done nothing over a long period of time and now it is time for some real action.’ Labor has some quite general, and some quite particular, concerns with this bill. The general concerns were dealt with in the second reading amendment flagged by my colleague the member for Wills. Our second reading amendment, which has already been read to the House, MAIN COMMITTEE expresses concern about the threat of climate change; the government’s failure to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency and to adopt Labor’s national water policy framework; and the government’s plans to fund the Australian water fund by snatching money away from the states. These particular issues have been alluded to in the debate already. As always with this government, the devil is in the detail. We are concerned that under this legislation, in its current form, the role of the parties to the agreement-in essence, COAGin choosing and appointing commissioners and in determining spending priorities under the Australian water fund will be very limited. In effect, the Commonwealth has the final say on the appointment of commissioners, even those representing the states and territories, which is dealt with in clause 8 of the bill. It seems to have the only say with respect to expenditures from the Australian water fund, dealt with in clauses 7(5) and 24(1) of the bill. I am particularly concerned about the impact of confidentiality provisions contained in clause 44. I know every member on this side of the House, given the propensity of the Prime Minister and his ministers to rort these particular programs blind, has fairly legitimate concerns that ought to be tabled here in this debate and considered by the government. It is absolutely imperative that the decisions and recommendations of the National Water Commission are open to public scrutiny from urban communities, farm communities and regional communities as well. Clause 44 requires that the assessment made by the National Water Commission can only be made public with the agreement of the federal minister. You never stop, do you? You never stop laying the groundwork to rort program after program-and you have got form. If we were to go back over the past decade, as far as Australian politics is concerned, the crass rorters of programs that should be there for the Australian people and in the national interest have been coalition ministers. Secrecy in decision making has been a watchword of this government. Australian taxpayers will be contributing around $2 billion to the Australian water fund and taxpayers are entitled to know that projects funding funded out of the Australian water fund have been subject to proper scrutiny by the National Water Commission, and they are entitled to know whether the minister has taken or rejected the advice of the commission. The confidentiality clause included by the government in this bill will severely curtail the public’s right to know the basis of decisions about where and how taxpayers’ money will be spent. Clause 44 ought to be removed in the public interest. The Howard government has form when it comes to avoiding due process and dodging scrutiny of the expenditure of public moneys, particularly in regional programs. I am pleased to support the second reading amendment proposed by my colleague the member for Wills, particularly that section of the amendment relating to the failure of the Howard government to take seriously the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for both our farmers and our rivers. That failure is encapsulated in the second part of the second reading amendment, namely this government’s lack of urgency in tackling the water issue as evidenced by the failure of the government to activate the COAG process early in its first term of office. Only now, some eight years later, have we got a belated agreement between the Commonwealth and the states on water. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
