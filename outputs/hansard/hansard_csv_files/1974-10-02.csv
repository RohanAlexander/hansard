The CLERK-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petiuon of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be burdened with additional psychological strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most nnancial benefit from our society should give the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice-the care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficiently, and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones and Mr Morris. Petitions received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representauves in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia purchase the entire contents of the said Hotel from the respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The humble inefficiencies in medical services and will utimately petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. showeth: Your petiuoners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petitions received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representadves in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: (1) Your petiuoners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entided to economic support for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Further, they believe that this economic suppon should be in the form of per pupil grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school (2) Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per pupil gram additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxation and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the current grants being made to children in non-government schools to at least 50 per cent of the cost of educating children in government schools, thus enabling the nongovernment schools to continue to exist and fulfil their function of educating Australian children. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Mathews and Mr Staley. Petitions received. Palace Hotel, Perth To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of The House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia do humbly petiuon the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that it might take such steps as may be necessary either to direct the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to preserve and restore The Palace Hotel or itself acquire the said Palace Hotel St George's Terrace, Perth on its present site so as to preserve and restore it in perpetuity. Further we do humbly petition this honourable Parliament to make such funds as may be necessary available to owners thereof. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bennett.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Wilson. Petition received. the Acting Prime Minister. Yesterday the Acting Treasurer said that the penal tax provision on so called unearned income was justified and he argued for it. It is reported that the honourable member for Blaxland argued in a Caucus committee that the provision is totally unjustified. In the spirit of honesty that the honourable gentleman spoke of yesterday, will he say unequivocally which side he is on today and which side he was on when Cabinet was reaching its conclusions to apply the new tax in the Budget? Mr HaydenI rise to order. As the record of the ParUament will show, yesterday I said that a surtax on unearned incomea surtax and not just any sort-woul d be justified. I rather gathered that without necessarily being totally committed to any view the honourable member for Chifley expressed a similar principle. When the Acting Treasurer rose to his feet I thought that the Acting Prime Minister had passed the question over to him. Mr HaydenI was just pointing out that as usual the Leader of the Opposition is wrong on both counts. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-The question that the Leader of the Opposition has asked is based on rumour and speculation. I attended the football with him on Saturday and I think there has been a bit of a carry over. Transport: Is it a fact that as a result of decisions taken by this Labor Government shipping freight rates between Tasmanian ports and the mainland have in effect been subsidised to the extent of $3m? the question that has been asked by the honourable member for Franklin. I am aware of the interest which he and all other honourable members and honourable senators on the Government side from Tasmania have been displaying in freight rates. I have noted just recently quite a deal of criticism of the Government's decision to increase shipping freights by 25 per cent and talk of what the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country Party or other members of the Opposition would do if by some mischance the Opposition became the Government. Let us have a real look at the Opposition's record-and this is important. In August 1970 there was an increase of 1216 per cent in all Tasmanian general cargo freights; in July 1971 a per cent increase in freights between Sydney and Tasmania; an 8 per",17,Petitions

7,Mr Charles Jones,"I am interested incent increase in July 1971 in freights between Melbourne and Tasmania. Now let us look at what the Opposition did in regard to freight rates in August 1972, just before remarks on this point: Honourable members will it was rolled in the election in December 1972 and at a time when it was in full flight as the government. It then increased by 25 per cent the freights between Melbourne and Tasmama by the removal of the concession on dense cargoes. There was a 12 per cent increase in SydneyTasmania freight rates, then an increase due to the removal of concessions on heavy cargo which was the equivalent of a 22 per cent increase in freight rates for those commodities. There was a 20 per cent surcharge applied on hazardous cargoes, an 18 per cent increase due to the removal of the concession on industrial machinery and a 17 per cent increase in the freight rates on newsrates. Overall, ANL's increase was long overdue, print. That was not a bad sort of record for the then Country Party Minister for Shipping and Transport to have on the eve on an election. YetI have heard of statements that have been made by the Leader ofhis Party as to what the Country Party would do about freight rates. This Government examined the question of freight rates charged on goods shipped to Tasto the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the lender mania, and it examined freight rates as a whole. of last resort facilities which the Reserve Bank of As the result of numerous meetings between all Australia in its capacity as the central bank the members of the Government in Tasmania should normally accord to the banking system. and the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime MinisDoes the Minister realise the fundamental ter and myself, we worked out a formula difference between the present AustraUan system whereby assistance could be given.

FinaUy, what rate is charged by the sistance to Tasmania, but we did something Reserve Bank to the various member banks for about it in the previous Budget. Mr Donald CameronI rise on a point of order. Last night during the adjournment debate I complained about the lack of opportunity being given to back benchers to ask questions. The Minister is taking up half the morning with an expose on Tasmama. Why does he not make this matter the subject of a general debate? answer as brief as possible. I suppose there are many questions to come from both sides of the House. recall that in the Budget of last year the Government paid a subsidy of $lm on the 'Empress of Australia' to ensure the continuation of that ship carrying not only cargo but also tourists and people who are interested in Tasmania to and from that State. This Government is interested in what has happened. The 25 per cent increase in freight rates which was introduced by the Austrahan National Line should be compared with, for expample, the increase in charges by the Union Steam Ship Co. in 1974. That company increased its freight rates by 38.29 per cent and other shipping companies increased their freight if we want to ensure that it operates on an even keel. Honourable members opposite can support the Australian Shipping Commission Bill which is before the House at the present time, which will ensure that the ANL pays its way. this fadlity? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-I am aware of the widespread view that the rate of interest in this respect is high and may cause difficulties that could be avoided. I am not specifically aware of the rate of interest that is charged but I will have that checked and inform the honourable member. There are differences between the powers in Australia, especially in the operation of the Reserve Bank as a lender of last resort, and those in the United Kingdom and the",19,Tasmanian Shipping Freights

10,Mr Wentworth,"My question is directedUnited States of America. Undoubtedly the position could be improved in those 2 countries as well as in Austraha. I am satisfied that the powers and scope of the Reserve Bank are adequate, although undoubtedly they could be improved. I think it is most important that at any time these powers should be adequate, that they are seen to be adequate and that they are sufficient to justify the confidence of the community in the ability of the Reserve Bank to do its job. I have that confidence and I hope it is shared by everybody else.

15,Mr Snedden,"D o not play politics. How canposidon will remain silent. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-I will arrange to have a written explanation given to the Leader of the Opposition. I think that this general position was a very favourable one. I was most impressed with the attitude taken by the Shah when he was here. I think that his visit means that we could very well be opening a new chapter of history in relations between Australia and Iran and across the Indian Ocean in general because that country is extremely significant in that part of the world. The Shah explained to us that he has taken a view of the importance of Australia in his assessment of the outside world.He said that it was not a very old one-it dated back less than 2 years. I think that there was some significance in that. But the right honourable gentleman will agree with me that there is not a great deal of difference between his view and mine on the importance of independent AustraUan ownership and, I think, on the role played by such bodies as the AustraUan Industry Development Corporation.

It prepared a report which was then referred to a working group comprised of representatives of the Department of Transport, the airlines and CSIRO.

When the report is avaUable to me in sufficient numbers I will table it. I have a copy of it in my room. I propose to make a copy available in the ParUamentary Library. The interesting part about the working group's report is that the toxic gases such as hydrogen cyanide were considered to be a major hazard. It found that smoke, flame and superheated gases were very important considerations, bearing in rriind their concentration in aeroplanes at the time when people were being exposed to them.

In view of the stronger competitive position which New Zealand farmers wUl therefore enjoy compared with AustraUan farmers and in view of the Minister's comments, wiU he now support a general reference on superphosphate to the Industries Assistance Commission, in addition to the Umited and narrow reference which the Commission is already considering and which relates only to the new land areas of Western Australia? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-I am aware of the statement made by the Prime Minister, and it coincides with the statement in this respect which I gave in the House yesterday in answer to a question on this subject. Both the Prime Minister and I realise the significance of Australia as a food producer and the rising demand which will take place in the rest of the world over the next decade or two because of the dramatic increase in the standard of Uving of so many millions of people which is Ukely to take place in those decades. I do not think that the description of the superphosphate bounty as a welfare provision is a new one. In my opinion, it has been a welfare provision for a long time for quite a number of people who did not need it, especially the wealthy farmers who got most of it. It was very largely as a result of this welfare provision by which previous governments were wUling to make the assistance available to primary industry that we decided to bring an end to the existing arrangement and refer the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission, albeit on a narrow basis. Yesterday I said that I believed that although this reference was a narrow one it would allow the Industries Assistance Commission to give to the Government advice on which we could decide upon the matter of superphosphate assistance in general. I am satisfied that that is so. UnlessI can see much greater evidence than I see now of the necessity to widen the reference, I would think there is no need to do so.

Is the Minister yet able to announce any grants for Tasmama under this scheme, and has he any detaUs of them? somebody would ask me a question about this matter because I heard some very Ul-informed remarks from the Opposition side yesterday about the unemployment position in Tasmania and the alleged indifference of the Government to the Tasmanian position. I have had very strong representations made to me by the Minister for Defence and by the honourable members for Braddon, Denison, Franklin and Wilmot. These honourable gentlemen have been on my back, to coin a phrase, for the last couple of weeks. I am very pleased to be able to say that 18 projects have already been provisionally approved for Tasmania under the regional employment development scheme; another 12 projects have been approved subject to additional conditions being met; and a further 11 projects are under consideration. Of the 18 projects so far approved, nine are recreational projects submitted to my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and covering the district employment areas of Devonport, Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. These projects alone wul cost over $400,000 in total, with the Australian Government contributing a direct grant of more than half that amount.

Will the honourable gentleman tell this House and the Tasmanian people that, consistent with the response of the Minister for Labor and Immigration, this Government is prepared to spend on employment projects throughout Tasmama no more than this Government was prepared to spend for the purchase of a major painting?

My point of order is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has no right to make a speech in the course of asking a question. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition not to debate his question. Is he aware that the level of unemployment in August was worse than the most serious level of unemployment during 1972? Has he seen reports in today's Press that unemployment during September increased by around 16,000, which figures exclude school leavers? Are the reports true. Will he explain to this House in a serious response, unlike that of the Minister for Labor and Immigration, what poUcies the Government proposes to adopt to protect the jobs of Australian workers, not simply in Tasmama where the figures are grave, but everywhere in AustraUa? Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-The level of unemployment in Tasmama is higher than the Australian average. I listened to the answer given by the Minister for Labor and Immigration to the question asked by the honourable member for Denison. I listened to the detaUs of the projects that were named by him. I know from my own travelling in northern Tasmama on Friday how welcome each and every one of those projects will be. I know from my own knowledge that at least a dozen of them were put to me on Friday as necessary jobs that the people in that area wanted to be done, and that the people there were looking forward to getting finance very soon to do them. I assured them, while I was there that the Government would quickly respond in respect of that and the response has been quick. Had the Leader of the Opposition had enough sense to agree to have that list incorporated in Hansard insead of obstinately refusing to agree to it, that list could have been recorded properly, as it should be recorded, but of course he would not do that. I think that the Minister for Labor and Immigration was not only exercising his responsibility, but he was exercising it well. I am satisfied that those projects for which more than $lm is immediately being provided-and that, if necessary, is the beginning of it-wil l go a long way towards meeting much of the immediate needs not only for employment but also for very useful work in the areas that he has detailed. of that answerof the Opposition that he just cannot rise to his feet and burst out into a speech.

That course was not adopted by the Minister for Labor and Immigration, and it is wrong for the Acting Prime Mimster to disgrace himself and the office that he occupies by pretending that there was obstruction on the part of the Opposition.

He blocks all new exports of uranium, while he dribbles out bits and pieces of policy ideas in this House in response to questions from his own back benchers-polic y proposals that have not even been before his own Party or his own Cabinet. still preparing proposals to go to Cabinet and his Party. So the honourable member does not know. It is a matter for real concern that we have the Prime Mimster making pronouncements before the United Nations when those pronouncements are completely lacking in firm policy support at home. The Mimster must take the earliest opportunity to present to ParUament a comprehensive and coherent minerals and energy poUcy statement. Uranium is one of the world's key strategic resources. AustraUa is relatively well endowed with uranium ore. There are very large resources in this country. There was a high level of exploration activity during 1972 and major discoveries in the past 3 years have meant that our claimed reserves are in excess of 300,000 tons, of which about 220,000 tons are located in 4 areas in the Northern Territory. These reserves make AustraUa one of the world's major potential sources of uranium ore. The Minister has placed a ban on new exports of processed ore-that is, yeUowcake. Existing contracts are to be met from the Mary Kathleen deposits in Queensland. This is a relatively small low grade deposit owned by Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd and the existing null there is to be upgraded with Government nnancial support through the Atomic Energy Commission. In addition, the Minister has proposed that the existing stockpUe held by the Atomic Energy Commission be used to meet some of the existing contracts. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. sitting for lunch I was mentioning that the cream of the uranium ore is in the Northern Territory. The original plan for the companies there was to develop thendeposits with separate nulls and to process the ore into yellowcake for export. The largest single null being proposed was to have a capacity of 3,000 tons with an eventual aggregate production possibly of around 8,000 to 9,000 tons. However, a total freeze has decended upon the industry. If the previous Government's poUcies had been in operation we would be seeing at least one of these mills almost coming into economy. Meanwhile, the world energy crisis has forced up energy prices. Consequently the theoretical market value for our uranium has escalated. The Minister, of course, claims that this is a vindication of his poUcy of keeping the ore in the ground. Like the hoarder, he gloats and exults over the value of his buried treasure. What a negative policy. But it is more accurate to say that Australia is simply being denied the fruits of the world price boom for uranium ore. The Minister's intentions for uranium have never been properly spelt out. As far as I can gather, the foUowing seems to be the situation: The Government, through the Atomic Energy Commission, is to establish a null in the Northern Territory to process uranium ore from all sources into yellowcake. The yellowcake is eventually to be used by a 100 per cent Australian-owned nuclear enrichment plant. From then on, only enriched uranium wUl be exported by Australia. Until then, existing contracts will be met by Mary Kathleen and the Atomic Energy Commission. This leaves open a large number of very important areas of uncertainty. Uranium developers do not know whether the Minister plans to acquire their ore compulsorily. They do not know what return they wUl be allowed on their capital investment. They do not know to what extent they wUl be allowed to reaUse the considerable returns to be made from uranium processing and export. The developers of the large Yeelirrie uranium deposits in Western Australia and at Lake Frome in South AustraUa do not know what their future is. They do not know where the proposed mUl in the Northern Territory is to be located, what its capital cost will be, or what the ore transportation costs wUl be. We do not know the relative efficiency of such a plant, which would have to handle widely ranging grades of ores, compared with mUls at the individual sites. If the mill is in operation in 2 years time-and I question that there is no indication as to what is to happen to the yeUowcake between then and the time the enrichment plant gets into operation. To debate the Minister's uranium policy is to spar at shadows. A nuclear enrichment plant would cost a tremendous amount of money-a t least $2,000m and possibly $3,000m. Since the Minister's stated objective is 100 per cent AustraUan ownership, presumably this money is to be obtained from the Australian taxpayer, the Australian capital market or by overseas borrowings. Iran is now being asked to participate in the Petroleum and Minerals Authority to help nationalise the industry. In other words, foreign",27,Australia S Uranium Resources

70,Mr Anthony,The Minister said that he is,28,Australia S Uranium Resources
71,Mr Anthony,"Before the suspension ofthecapital is asked to take over private enterprise in Australia. At the moment, the market for the products of this plant look good. Enrichment has never been commercially tested. All plants to date have been government controlled and built mainly for military purposes. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the future market. Nobody knows what the cost of enrichment or the price of enriched products will be in the 1980s. Much depends upon the movement in energy prices. Enrichment technology is developing rapidly* under the impetus of rising fuel prices. At this stage the choice is between the well-proven diffusion and the fairly complex'centrifugel method. All major nuclear countries except Japan have assured suppUes of uranium until 1985. It would therefore seem at this stage that the major potential market for enriched uranium will be Japan. Unfortunately, Japan is not wUUng to meet Australia's conditions for participation in an enrichment plant. Since this question offinancingand market oudet is the key one, the Mmister should be telling the ParUament what assured partners are willing to provide technology, capital and markets for an AustraUan enrichment plant. If an enrichment plant is not a goer the future for our industry obviously Ues in the export of yellowcake. An enrichment plant would be a huge venture. If the diffusion process is used, the energy input would be absolutely enormous. Vast quantities of water would be required. The potential market would be nuclear reactors. A lot of international work is being done on fast breeder reactors, which would greatly reduce the demand for enriched uranium in relation to the relatively inefficient Ught-water reactors in use today. As a reasonable guess then, our large deposits pipeline grid? Is it to be exported?

Is he dogmatic everyrightto an adequate return on their investin his statement that there be no increase in the ment. A sensible means of ensuring this would be to allow a Umited flow of exports of yellowcake to proceed until the enrichment proposal is resolved. Since the resolution of the enrichment proposal is so important, we should not be too rigid in insisting on 100 per cent Australian ownership. The important thing is to get moving, to make sure that the commercial prospects are sound, to line up assured partners, and to exercise adequate control. Above all, we need now a publicly announced uranium policy so that investors and customers know where we are going. Since uranium is a strategic reserve, there are grave foreign affairs implications in blockading exports of such a vital commodity. From the domestic viewpoint, we should be integrating uranium policy with a national energy policy. What are to be our requirements for uranium? How much of the products of an enrichment plant wul we need ourselves? The Minister talked earUer of meeting an increased percentage of our energy demands from natural gas. What about his proposals for converting natural gas into hydrocarbon liquids? What is the future of solar energy in Australia? Is there any future for generation of power by tidal forces in north-west AustraUa? What are the proposals about coal conversions about which the Minister has talked so much? Instead of a coherent policy, we have a hotchpotch of half hinted at proposals. Off the NorthWest Shelf the Woodside-Burmah consortium waits and waits for a decision on its natural gas. The Minister has compulsorily acquired it but has not said what he wants to do with it. Is it to be converted to petrol? Is it to join the national price of oil, even for new deposits? The point I am making is that you cannot have already said to the House this week that we did a uranium policy in complete isolation not only not propose to temporise any further, that we from a foreign affairs approach, but also from a would use the residual powers which we unnational energy policy point of view.

That letter is dated 21 August 1972. That is the type of thing that we inherited from the former Government. Is the Leader of the Country Party prepared to allow me to incorporate these in Hansard-yes , or no? leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)Sir Reginald Swanz, Minister for National Development, Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T., 2600 Dear Sir Reginald, The principles enunciated in this letter were raised in Sydney on 7 August when the Secretary of your Depanment and other omcers together with the Secretary of the Department of the Interior were good enough to meet with potential uranium producers to discuss matters of common interest. One such matter which particularly affects the Department of the Interior is referred to in a letter of today's date addressed to Mr Hunt, a copy of which is attached for your information. There are two specific matters which the industry wishes to place before you which are now stated under the respective 2. The six companies which presently intend to produce Australia Limited, Queeensland Mines Limited. Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited, and Western Mining Corporation Limited) are now parties to an arrangement which 3. The world uranium market will be in substantial overuntil the early 1980s. It is believed that the demand/ supply situation will be in balance in the mid-1980s and that 1980s. 4. The greatest danger to maintaining the world marketing arrangement while there is a market surplus is that further substantial uranium deposits may be discovered and brought into production (or come under consumer control) by companies not a party to the arrangement. 5. If this happens, the total market available before, say, 1980, will be insufficient to accomodate such new producers. The orderly marketing arrangements may then prove unworkable. 6. As the Government has expressed its strong wish to have orderly marketing of uranium, the Government might consider whether it should be prepared to take action to prevent new discoveries from upsetting such an arrangement. 7. The previously named producers will be able to meet Australia's share of the world market well into the 1980s. 8. The minimum position would be for the Federal Government to decide that it will not grant export permits for uranium to other than the previously named producers from already known deposits, until such time as the world market situation improves. 9. In the Northern Territory the Federal Government could also refuse to issue any further exploration licences for uranium until the market situation improves. The Commonwealth Government cannot prevent the issue of exploration tenements in the States, but would probably influence the States by taking this action. 21 August 1972. 10. The operation of the existing Northern Territory exploration licence ordinance requires that an exploration licensee may explore the entire area granted to him for a maximum period of only two dry seasons, thereafter reducing by half to a maximum retention for any part of the original area for a total of five years. In these circumstances, farm-ins for parts of such important resource areas as those held by Queensland Mines (4,000 square miles) and E.Z -Peko (2,720 square miles) are being sought by a number of interests which are not parties to thc world producer arrangements. 1. The uranium discoveries in Northern Territory and Western Australia in recent years have given Australia world ranking as a potential producer of uranium. There is little doubt that further discoveries will be made. 2. The markets for Australia's uranium are overseas. Because of uranium's strategic importance as the main source of energy in the future, all consuming countries are dealing with uranium on a national policy level.",30,Australia S Uranium Resources
77,Mr Speaker,Order! Is leave granted?,31,Uranium Resources Policy
78,Mr Anthony,The Minister can include them.,31,Uranium Resources Policy
79,Mr Speaker,"There being no objection,3. Producing countries, specifically Canada, are recognising the need for a national policy regarding uranium and in this respect we attach a letter of 22 June 1972 from Mr O. J. C. Runnalls, Senior Adviser, Uranium and Nuclear Energy to the Government of Canada, setting out the position in that countiy. 4. We believe Australia should also have a national policy regarding uranium. Uranium is expected to be an increasingly important fuel resource of the future and in view of the Canadian experience of overseas ownership of its mineral resources and indeed our Australian experience in the alienation of our major mineral resources to overseas ownership and control, there is yet time to follow the Canadian example of securing to Australian ownership and control this new important energy source. 5. Such a policy could be considered on two levels: (a) Australia's position in world markets, (b) Uranium as a strategic mineral. 6. The Commonwealth Government could enforce such a policy by announcing that export permits for uranium will not be granted to any future projects with less than the requisite major Australian equity. 7. The Government may also wish to place limits on foreign ownership of Australian deposits for stategic reasons. In this connection exploration for uranium is being undertaken by a number of overseas companies, none of which is a party to the world producers arrangements. 8. It would appear reasonable for the Government to decide that all future uranium finds in Australia should be under Australian control, i.e. at least a majority equity interest. In this connection the pohcy estabhshed by the Canadian Government is of particular interest. 9. Overseas companies holding exploration areas before the new policy is effected could be encouraged to follow the example of Moranda Australia Limited and to plan for at least SO per cent Australian ownership in anyfindsthat may be made on their areas. 10. The best estimate of the uncommitted uramum market through to 1980 is 75,000 tons UsOs and for sales emerging in the 1980s there is already in Australia adequate proven uranium to maintain Australia's competitive position with the world suppliers. Thus there is no urgent need to bring into production new uranium sources within the next decade. 11. The cost of establishing uranium production relative to the sale value of the product is possibly the lowest of any mineral so that two matters follow: (i) That to develop its own uranium resources is comfortably within the capacity of Australia's domestic capital resources, (ii) On the other hand to overdevelop the milling side of this industry in its infancy would would place undue stress on the borrowing credibility of the emergent Australian producers. The above is submitted as matters which it is believed merit serious Government consideration and in view of the splendid relationship which is emerging between Government and the uranium industry we are encouraged to believe that such consideration will be generously given. Yours sincerely, 21 August 1972 The Hon. Ralph J.Hunt, Minister for the Interior, ParUament House, Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 Dear Mr Hunt, On Monday 7th instant representatives of potential uranium producer (that is those companies who have defined economic resources) met representatives of government including Mr George Warwick Smith, Secretary to your own Department, and Mr Lloyd Bott, Secretary to the Department of National Development, who was accompanied by Mr D. J. Gates and Mr W. Ricketts. Those representatives of industry whose mining titles are located in the Northern Territory raised amongst the matters discussed at that meeting the very serious problem which they are encountering regarding the detaUed exploration of their Exploration Licences under the requirements of those licences. The operation of the existing Northern Territory exploration licence ordinance requires that an exploration licensee may explore the entire area granted to him for a maximum period of only two dry seasons, thereafter reducing by half to a maximum retention for any part of the original area for a total offiveyears. The right to convert selected prospects or areas of interest to long term mineral tenure under leases or other mining tenements is very dubious under existing conditions. Application for leases in the Northern Territory uranium provinces have been held up for over eighteen months since court hearings have determined applications legal in all respects and recommended approval. In these circumstances, farm-ins for parts of such important resource areas as those held by Queensland Mines (4,000 square miles) and E.Z -Peko (2,720 square miles) are being sought by a number of interests which are not parties to the world producer arrangements. Such farm-ins are considered adverse to the long term interests of the Australian community and particularly to the Australian uranium industry. In fact as far as many of these interests are concerned, these are antagonistic to the nearby interests of Australia as the discovery and exploitation by any of these interests wUl immediately subtract from the market otherwise available to AustraUa and jeopardize the large investments in the new uranium mining and milling plants being planned for both the Northern Territory and Western AustraUa. A slowing down of the rate of work would also result in a more systematic approach and more effective use of exploration funds. Mineral exploration in the South Alligator uranium province in the Northern Territory would benefit technically by a slower rate of exploration. The area is practically unique in being one of the only uranium provinces in the world in a low lying tropical area where lateritic and semi-lateritic cover is developed ubiquitously. New techniques for effective uranium exploration have to be developed and each new technique as it is appUed has to be patiently tested for its effectiveness. Much more efficient exploration will result by a systematic approach to the problem of uranium exploration over an extended period. Should existing exploration Ucence holders be shown to be satisfactorily exploring the areas in their possession, tenure Chairman of Directors. be shown not to be satisfactorily exploring their area, the areas it is then suggested should revert to the Crown for reallocation to Australian interests in accordance with policy from time to time as required. The implementation of a policy generally in accordance with the requirements suggested above could in no way prejudice Australia's expon of uranium concentrate, as between MKU, the Nonhern Territory mill and the Western Australian mill there could exist capacity to expon not less than 12,000 tons UjO« per annum by 1980, which total market tonnage could not be considered available by that date. Concurrently with this submission to you a submission is also being made to the Mimster for National Development comprehending matters also raised at the same meeting and as these two problems are in some measure reciprocal we have taken the liberty of enclosing with this letter a copy of the letter forwarded to the Depanment of Nauonai Development, and with the letter to the. Department of National Development a copy of this letter to you. It is the belief of the uranium industry that although the rewards of this industry will not be of great significance before the end of the 1970s, that AustraUa will develop a very important uranium industry into the 1980s and beyond, and the Uttle time left should we beUeve be used to Australia's best advantage. Yours sincerely, Japan that we would honour contracts entered into right to within a couple of months of the election despite the fact that the contracts were made at excessively low prices. Demands have been made since by Queensland Mines in particular to try to panic the Japanese. We have assured them that delivery will be made, that we have the stocks to make these deliveries, and the stocks are at Lucas Heights at the present time. We can provide all commitments up to 1980 out of those stocks. Country Party has already spoken.

We want to see the shareholders get some cash flow and that is easily done with the price of uranium today. Beyond that, we want to make sure that we know exactly where the technology is going. Of course, it would suit the purposes of the Opposition to discredit the Government's proposals on the eve of a visit by the Japanese Prime Minister. The Opposition has already had the discomfiture of the Shah of Iran saying that he beheves in government to government trading. So do we. resume his seat.

If he does not I will have him removed from the House. Opposition to waste the limitedtimethat is available to me. Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. The rnnling plant that we propose happens to be identical with the size of that which the Ranger interests planned to introduce. There again, let me say that the Ranger people have clearly known right from the start what the policy of this Government is. The market is now right. We propose to mill uranium and mill it in sufficient quantity to see that there is a cash flow to the people who have had faith for many years in the companies in which they invested. At the same time we will, in the period whilst the major plant is being constructed, be also able to consider which technology ought to be finally introduced. There are plenty of nations which are only too anxious to come in with Australia to establish an enrichment plant. I reject utterly and completely as false and deliberately misleading the statement that was made by the Leader of the Australian Country Party. We have no intention of reserving everything for that purpose. There must be a cash flow for people who have waited very patiently. What a remarkable return they will get. At the sametime,we are sure that the people of Australia also will get a remarkable return. It certainly will not be a royalty of the order of 1V4 per cent. It will be a proper participation and that is the basis upon which we will operate. We do not want to see 3",31,Uranium Resources Policy

If the Minister only studied what is going on in other parts of the world he would understand to give it to Australia? They wUl only want to trade off their technology for some benefit to Australia? These are the sorts of answers that we need. The fundamental point as I see it is that 1974 is the ume when we must set about building the base of industry which will provide both the income and the wealth within that industry and the technology which we can use in the 1980s and beyond to the end of this century. Unless we build the base within the industry itself, we will not be able to compete in the world energy scene and, in particular, on the world nuclear energy scene because uranium enrichment will become an international industry. Austraha must put itself in a position now where it can participate in that internauonal industry when it comes about within the next 10 years. What are so often forgotten are the tremendous leadtimesthat are involved in developing the technologies in this field and building the plants, whether they be nuclear reactors or uranium enrichment plants. Lead times of from 8 to 10 years are involved. When the Minister speaks of being in a position in 216 yearstimeto make a choice between the gaseous diffusion and the centrifuge process, he should bear in mind that it will be another decade before we will have that enrichment plant.

Secondly, there was a 3Vi hour debate last Wednesday night by the resources committee of the Caucus on uranium. On both counts the right honourable member is so far from the mark that it is not rectors of Peko-Wallsend Ltd, to Sir Reginald funny. In the last 2 years we have heard bleatings to labour the point on a couple of paragraphs of from the Leader of the Country Party and aU the the letter which was written by that gentleman to other lobbyists opposite that the Government has not spelt out a policy on uranium. Today the Mmister outUned some of the reasons why it has not. They are connected with the Woodward Committee. That Committee did not bring down its report until May of this year, and the Government could not act before it received the report. Then there was the gazettal of the uranium regulations under the Atomic Energy Act. The maximumtimeelapsed before these regulations were disallowed in the Senate. They were not disallowed within a week of their being put down because that would have been too convenient. They were disallowed towards the end of the time in which they could have been disaUowed so as to foul up the Minister for the longest period possible. Despite aU this obstruction by the Opposition the Minister is proceeding under the Atomic Energy Act. The premise upon which the Leader of the Country Party bases his argument is that we should be exporting uranium and capturing what markets are avaUable. He refuses to recognise that for 20 years the Liberal-Country Party Government of which he was a member at one part had an embargo on the export of all uranium from this country. It was not until the AustraUan Labor Party came into office that we had to flog off everything at any price we could get for it. In the last 18 months we have heard story after story on this subject. There was one in the 'Australian Financial Review' of 11 July 1974 that overseas interests in uranium stockpUes may be on the wane. That was taken from a paper deUvered by one of the producers to the Australian Institute of Mining Metallurgy Conference. At the same time as we have had these persistent stories about how our uranium is going to be worthless the price of crude oil in the world has been climbing dramaticaUy. It must be common sense to anyone that an equivalent amount of BTUs, whether it comes from uranium or any other energy resource, must be as valuable and must be inflating in price at the same rate or something near it as the price of oil is inflating. There is the additional value that uranium is able to be stored and stockpiled, which cannot be done with lots of other fuels. So the point wUl never arrive at which our resources are worthless. The Minister referred to a letter which was written by Mr John Proud, the Chairman of DiSwartz in August 1972-that is, a few months before the Labor Government came to office.

In relation to marketing policy the letter states: The Australian Government has asked the Australian proLeader of the AustraUan Country PartyI do not ducers to come to an arrangement which will ensure orderly know what does. That demonstrates that what he marketing of uranium and will maintain the price of uranium is saying is completely untrue. Everybody in the at a reasonable level during the market surplus. I emphasise the words 'during the market sursupply situation and that we would be foolish to plus '. The letter continues: The six companies which presendy intend to produce which have been given the option of taking up uranium in Australia (Peko-Wallsend, EZ Industries, their selling rights-the producers' club-ar e letNoranda Australia Limited, Queensland Mines Limited, ting their rights pass beyond them to the next Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited, and Western Mining Corporation Limited) are now parties to an arrangement which producer because they are waiting to sell at the would meet the Government's wishes. The world uranium market will be in substantial overdo. supply until the early 1980s. It is believed that the demand/ supply situation will be in balance in the mid-1980s and that there might be a shonage of uranium towards the end of the 1980s. The greatest danger to maintaining the world marketing arrangement while there is a market surplus is that further substantial uranium deposits may be discovered and brought into production by companies not a party to the arrangement. In other words, messing up their httle plan. traUan Country Party dispute that there is still an over-supply situation. In paragraph 8 on the subject of a uranium resources pohcy the letter states: It would appear reasonable for the Government to decide that all future uranium finds in AustraliaListen to thisshould be under Australian control, i.e. at least a majority equity interest. In this connection the policy established by the Canadian Government is of particular interest. Paragraph 11 of the letter reads: The cost of establishing uranium production relative to the sale value of the product is possibly the lowest of any mineral so that 2 matters follow: (i) That to develop its own uranium resources is comfortably within the capacity of Australia's domestic capital resources. honourable member to table that document. Why did the honourable member not come into the chamber at the start of the debate? the honourable member for Bl&xland is not a Minister he is not required under the Standing Orders to table the document. (ii) On the other hand to overdevelop the milling side of this industry in its infancy would place undue stress on the borrowing credibility of the emergent Australian producers. If that does not answer all of the criticism of the know in the industry knows that there is an oversell into it. In fact the countries of the world right price. That is precisely what we intend to Taking up the point made in the letter, the Minister has said that the AustraUan Government will set up its own mdl to refine uranium with a throughput to meet the demands at the time. He mentioned the figure of3,500 tons. That figure may vary. The point is that the uranium producers are going to be treated fairly. The contracts which the Liberal-Country Party Government criminally signed 3 weeks before the election, at which it lost office, which had to be a graft situation of one sort or another, were for $5honourable member for Blaxland is getting pretty close to the knuckle. Mr Deputy Speaker; I am going to say it. The contracts were signed for $5.25 per lb. The price is now $12. The projections available to most of the industry indicated that it would be $12, but the previous Liberal-Country Party Government signed those contracts just before that election. Those contracts are going to be met to the letter because the Australian Government has ratified them and the decisions of one Australian government have to be upheld by the next Australian government. Our contracts have to be honoured and they will be honoured from the existing stockpUes that are available to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and that will be avaUable from the production flowing from the re-opening of the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. The Government has decided to underwrite the cost entailed in that re-opening, which will bring 1,050 tons into production per annum and which wUl supply those contracts until 1980. Three years after its re-opening the new plant will be able to produce from 3,500 tons upwards for a",36,Johns Proud Do Not Cease I Ask The Honourable Member For

The price will be something like an acceptable price. There will not be a selling into an over-supply market. That is our policy. The Opposition knows fundamentally what is our policy. It has been a wait and see pohcy. But there has had to be a wait and see attitude in the sense that we could not act before the Woodward report came in. When the Woodward report came in the Opposition had its stooges in the Senate reject the Minister's regulations, but he has adequate other powers under the Atomic Energy Act and there is no way in which the Opposition will be able to frustrate the Government's will to introduce what is a correct pohcy for AustraUa. It is a valuable energy resource. There has been idle chatter about fast breeder reactors, which are a thing of the future and which are nothing Uke as developed as the enrichment plants we are talking about. As a major part ofhis argument the Leader of the Australian Country Party is saying that the value of our resources wUl be depleted because they wiU become redundant due to the introduction of fast breeder reactors. Even if they were to be introduced as soon as they came off the production Une they would not be introduced in sufficient quantity before the year 2020. So we have another 40 years of production, another 40 years of power to be suppUed by conventionaUy enriched reactors. There is no reason why the price of uranium wUl not keep escalating and there is no reason why this Government wUl not allow a maximum return to the people of Australia and the uranium producers of AustraUa. for the discussion has now concluded. AGED PERSONS HOSTELS BILL 1974 BUl presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first be dealt with during the limited time that the time. Second Reading Security) (3.3)I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The Aged Persons Hostels Act came into being meeting their commitments. Many others have on 29, September 1972, its purpose being to deferred action on buUding urgently needed hosstimulate the building of additional hostel actels. The level of construction costs has undoubtcommodation for needy aged persons. This legisedly been a restraint on the development of this lation is complementary to the Aged Persons program recently. Most honourable members Homes Act, and eUgible organisations wUl rewUl be aware of the need for more hostel ceive entitlements on the basis of 2 beds for every accommodation for the aged and particularly for unsubsidised bed they currently operate, or one bed for every 2 beds subsidised in thefirstfew years of the Aged Persons Homes Act on a $l-for-$l basis. The intention of the Aged Persons Hostels Act was that reUgious, charitable and other voluntary organisations having an entitlement under the formula I have just mentioned would be able to use their entitlement to erect hostels without having to make any contribution to their capital cost. The amount of the grant was specified in the Act as $7,800 per person accommodated plus $250 per person for furnishings. The purpose of this BUl is to give effect to the Government's announcement in March 1974, and referred to on a number of occasions since then, that the capital grant payable under the Aged Persons Hostels Act would be increased from $7,800 to $9,000 per person accommodated in a hostel approved under this Act, retrospective to 1 April 1974. As most honourable members are aware, increases in maximum subsidy limits can be made administratively under the Aged Persons Homes Act but hitherto this has not been possible under the Aged Persons Hostels Act as the maximum amounts which can be approved in respect of capital expenditure and furnishings are stated in this legislation in specific terms. In order to allow a greater degree offlexibUityand to enable changes in the amount of grants to be made more readUy in the light of changing costs, it is proposed that the specific amounts detailed be deleted from the Act and provision made for the maximum amount of the grants to be determined by the Minister for Social Security in future. I might add that this problem does not arise in respect of the Aged Persons Homes Act as the latter does not specify maximum amounts of subsidy. The Government's intention was to introduce this legislation at a much earlier point in time but it has been delayed by the double dissolution and other very important matters which had to House has been in session since then.

110,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for Social costs in thattimehave resulted in some organishostels in which personal care services can be provided for those who have become frail but who do not need nursing attendon. Unfortunately lack of suitable hostel accommodation in the past has resulted in the less acceptable and more expensive nursing beds being utilised for such persons. Honourable members will be interested to know that with the concurrence of the Treasurer ( Mr Crean), a working party of officers of the Departments of Social Security and Treasury has been looking into questions associated with the maximum subsidy limits such as methods of cushioning the increased building costs of projects approved prior to and since 1 April 1974 and the feasibility of introducing zone loadings in respect of projects in country areas. It is known that many organisations with entitlements under the Aged Person Hostels Act do not propose to use them. The reasons are varied but mainly are that they are fully extended in administering the accommodation they have already provided or they may have a small entitlement which would be inadequate to enable them to provide a hostel of a size that would be an economic proposition, or they may feel that they have not the necessary expertise to enter this field of care of the aged. In order that these entitlements will not be wasted and to add further stimulus to the legislation, the Bill introduces a provision which will enable an organisation which does not intend to take advantage of its rights to transfer them in whole or in pan to another ehgible organisation, subject to the approval of the Director-General of Social Security. The measures in this Bill should enable this 3-year program to more readily achieve its object of encouraging the quick provision of accommodation of the aged of the type most needed.

The Budget Speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) ate the value of a meals-on-wheels service it is contained a great many items concerned with necessary to recognise all the functions involved. this country's welfare services. Several of these Primarily from a purely medical point of view are concerned with care of the aged and include the aged person is supplied with a hot appetising an increase in the rate of subsidy payable under meal which will contain most of the nutrients the Aged Persons Homes Act from $2 for $ 1 to required for a minimal daily intake. This alone $4 for $ 1 as from 1 January 1975, and also for a 25 per cent increase in the rate of personal care subsidy paid in respect of aged residents in hostel-type accommodation. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to one of the items mentioned in the Budget Speech, namely, to increase the rate of subsidy payable under the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act by 5c per meal-that is, from 20c to 25c for each meal delivered or 30c if the meal includes an approved VitaminC supplement. This represents an increase of 25 per cent on the basic rate. One of the most traumatic effects of growing old is for people to find that with increasing frailty they can no longer maintain their independent way of life in the dignity of their own homes. From social, humanitarian and economic viewpoints it is obviously preferable for aged people to remain in their own homes rather than build institutionalised accommodation to house them. This means, of course, that attention has to be given to the provision of a range of domiciliary services upon which the aged person may depend according to his or her particular requirements. As honourable members will know, the Government meets two-thirds of the State's expenses in providing home care services for the aged under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. These may include housekeeping, shopping, sitter, linen, and handyman services. 1 might add here that whilst many very good services have been developed in some States, the Australian Government is far from satisfied with their rate of growth. I hope soon to examine ways and means by which a greater coverage of these services can be obtained. As a complement to home care schemes, meals-on-wheels services play an important role meals to the homes of frail elderly persons. The main burden of the work in preparing and delivering meals-on-wheels is undertaken by voluntary helpers who give their time and the use erly people who for varying reasons cannot prepare their own meals. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Australian GovernAustralia for their continuing assistance in supporting this worthwhile service.

But in many cases the social contact with the meals-on-wheels volunteer is equally welcomed by the aged recipient. Not that the nutritional aspect has been overlooked, for this is a matter which has been of considerable concern to both the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) and myself. In order to ensure that both the meals-on-wheels organisations and the aged persons are aware of the nutritional aspects, the nutrition section of the Department of Health has produced 2 pubUcations. One is entitled 'Welcome to Meals-on-Wheels' and explains to the aged persons what other items of food they should consume each day to supplement the deUvered meal. This pubUcation has been distributed by the Department of Social Security. The second pubUcation is a rather more comprehensive document entitled 'Meals-onWheels Food Guide' which is designed to provide meals-on-wheels organisers with a valuable guide to planning highly nutritious meals. It is expected that this publication wiU be distributed by my Department later this year. I ought to acknowledge the contribution made by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) in this field when he was the Minister for Social Services.

It is estimated that meals-on-wheels services will dehver more than 5 mUUon meals during 1974-75. On that figure the annual cost of this measure wUl be $250,000.

This BUl seeks the approval of ParUament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the AustraUan Government for overseas borrowings by the Papua New Guinea Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $20m prior to achievement of independence in 1974-75. The proceeds of the loans will be used by the Papua New Guinea Government to finance public works and services. In the 1972-73 financial year the Papua New Guinea Government made itsfirstoverseas borrowing on the international capital market. This borrowing, which was guaranteed by the Australian Government under legislation simUar to that now before the House, was for an amount of 50 nuUion Deutsche marks. Under the Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Act 1973 guarantees for loans of 5 bUUon yen and 50 mUlion Swiss francs have also been given. ParUament has also, on a number of previous occasions, approved similar contractual guarantees by the Australian Government in respect of loans to Papua New Guinea from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. It is proposed that arrangements for the borrowings for which this Bill provides contractual guarantees will be concluded prior to the achievement of independence by Papua New Guinea. Loan possibUities on overseas markets are currently being investigated by the Papua New Guinea Government. The form of guarantee that is customarily required in international capital markets is similar to those that have been given to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to the Asian Development Bank in respect of borrowings by Papua New Guinea from those institutions.

The Bill accordingly provides for such undertakings to be given. The Bill is purposely couched in general terms in respect of the currencies and the precise forms of the proposed borrowings so as not to restrict the Papua New Guinea Government's choice as to the particular overseas markets in which it finally decides to arrange the loans. The provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government will materially assist Papua New Guinea in negotiating favourable terms for the borrowings as well as enhancing its status as a borrower on overseas capital markets.

In 1973-74 these were semiing passage of similar legislation in that year. government and local authorities whose Payments authorised under this Bill may be individual borrowings for the year exceeded made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or $400,000. For 1974-75 the Loan Council agreed from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing to increase this amount to $500,000. There is no authority is included. Following arrangements settled at the June individual borrowings amount to $500,000 or 1970 Premiers' Conference, the Australian less. The 'larger' authorities program includes a Government undertook to provide, on a continupermanent addition of $ 10m to the New South ing basis, a portion of the State Governments' Wales allocation and temporary allocations of Loan CouncU programs in the form of interest$9,584,000 for Queensland for restoration of free grants in Ueu of what would otherwise be flood-damaged assets to above their pre-flood borrowings by the States, in order to help the standard and $6m for Western AustraUa under States finance capital works, such as schools, arrangements made between the AustraUan and poUce buildings and the like, from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The savings to the States in debt charges arising from the capital grants are estimated to have totalled $74.8m to the end of 1973-74, and to amount to $59.7m in 1974-75. At its meeting in June 1974, the Loan CouncU approved programs for the State governments totalling $934,919,000, consisting of a basic program of $925m and a temporary borrowing allocation of $9,919,000 for Queensland to finance the additional cost of restoring flood-damage assets to above their pre-flood standard and to cover the cost of re-siting and constructing new assets to replace old assets destroyed or abandoned because of flood damage. In September 1974 the Australian Government proposed and the State governments agreed that the basic program should be increased, by 10 per cent, to $1,017,500,000. This increase is to be formally CouncU.

Of this amount, the Australian Government will provide or support more than $2,579m or over 40 per cent more than in 1973-74.

The amounts for each State are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Under clause 5 of the Bill payments may be made either from Consolidated Revenue Fund or Loan Fund and clause 9 provides for the necessary appropriation of these funds. The extent to which the payments will be met from Loan Fund will depend on borrowings during the year, which cannot be estimated in advance. Clauses6 and 7 of the Bill authorise the Treasurer to borrow funds in the period from the commencement of the Act to the end of December 1975, up to the total of the amounts of the grants payable in 1974-75 and in the first 6 months of 1975-76. This borrowing authority will be reduced by the amount of any borrowings made before the commencement of this Act, under the authority of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act 1973, which may have been used tofinancegrants made in the first 6 months of 1974-75.

In 1965 the State proposed Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The present rate of 414 per cent will be increased to 5 per cent from 1 December 1974. Since the transfer of the tax to the States in September 1971 pay-roll tax has been payable in respect of salaries and wages related to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory under legislation applying only in the Territories. Since1 July 1974 the Territory rate has been 4'/4 per cent, the same rate as levied by the States from 1 September 1973. Following the Premiers Conference last June the Premiers foreshadowed an increase to 5 per cent in the rate of pay-roll tax in the States. Legislation to bring the rate up to that level as from 1 September 1974 has already been introduced into some State parliaments. There is no good reason why Territory emand charges comparable with those borne by employers in the States. Accordingly, this Bill will bring the Territory rate into line with the rate applying in the States. The increase to 5 per cent will apply first to wages payable on and after 1 December 1974 and included in pay-roll tax returns due for lodgement on 7 January 1975. I commend the Bill to the House.

Following lengthy discussions with the State it wasfinallyagreed to employ consultants to study and report on the most efficient, economic means of providing a standard gauge link to the interstate network. Maunsell and Partners were appointed consultants and a report outlining the intended scope of the project was presented in March 1970. Following a change of government in South Australia the earlier proposals were again raised and it was not until January 1974 that the consultants were able to submit their master plan for the works to be carried out. Some other minor matters were raised by the State and finally the formal agreement was signed in May by both the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and Premier of South Australia. The new standard gauge line involves construction of a high capacity railway from Adelaide approximately 192 kilometres to link with the transcontinental standard gauge line at Crystal Brook. The route will follow the general line of the exisung broad gauge railway from Adelaide to Red Hill and then deviate on a new alignment to Crystal Brook. Included in the project are standard gauge connections from Snowtown to Wallaroo, to industry at Mile End and Port Adelaide and the livestock sidings at Pooraka. The work entailed is to be carried out by the South Austrahan Railways as constructing authority under the supervision of my Department and is expected to take over 5 years to complete although standard gauge trains should be able to operate to the Adelaide metropoUtan area within approximately 3 years of commencement. The consultants estimated the total cost of the project to be about $81m at January 1974 prices. In common with other standardisation projects which were previously undertaken, the AustraUan Government is committed to meeting the total initial cost of the project; 70 per cent of the total expenditure wUl be treated as a non-repayable grant and the State wUl repay the remainmg 30 per cent of the expenditure plus interest over 50 years.

This BUl seeks the ratification by the Parliament of an agreement made between the Australian and South AustraUan Governments for the construction of a standard gauge railway from Tarcoola on the Trans-AustraUa RaUway, to Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Honourable members wUl recall from previous statements I have made in the House that agreements had been reached in April with the South Australian Government for the comstruction of the railway. The construction of a Une from Tarcoola to Alice Springs was an option open to the AustraUan Government in the RaUways (South AustraUan) Agreement Act of 1926, but instead the present narrow gauge Une from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs was constructed. The possibility of constructing a standard gauge Une from Tarcoola was not again considered until 1966 when the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner took the initiative and examined the advantages of a completely new route. I emphasise that it was the Commissioner who took the initiative and not the then Liberal-Country Party Govern-",42,Adelaide To Crystal Brook Railway Bill 1974
119,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle,"Ministerflooding in Central Australia in living memory occurred this year and that services on the Central Australian Railway were virtually suspended for 3 months, with serious consequences for the people of Alice Springs and the Northern Territory. In 1968, the then Government decided to investigate the relative merits of an improved road link as against an improved rail link. The resulting study led to the conclusion that the economically preferred course was to go ahead with the standard gauge railway, but that a fully sealed road to Alice Springs was also justified. In July 1970 approval in principle to construct the line was given and negotiations to obtain the consent of the South Australian Government for the construction of that part of the line within the State were begun. These negotiations proved to be protracted and it was not until earUer this year that I was able tofinaUyresolve the numerous difficulties raised by South Australia.

Second Reading Dr CASS (Maribyrnong-Minister for the Environment and Conservation) (3.39)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will be aware of worldwide concern for the conservation of wUdlife and of places of natural, scenic, scientific and recreational significance. The environment produced by the bUlions of years of evolution which has Despite the excellent initiatives taken in some been wiped out. Many other species have been endangered. The area of our vast continent professional service to enable the Australian Government, for the first time, to bring a coordinated approach to the management of nature conservation resources in the areas under its direct control. The Bill is the product of 18 months of careful work and thought and is a major initiative aimed at overcoming the inactivity of the past. I will also soon be introducing a Bill to make finance available to the States for nature conservation purposes and a Bill creating a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. An amount of $9m has been provided for national parks and nature reserves in this year's Budget. The Council of Nature Conservation Ministers set up on this Government's initiative will, I hope, help in the development of a national approach to the conservation of our unique fauna and flora. The National Parks and Wildlife Service will also facUitate co-operation with the States in the national nature conservation effort, and the meeting of Australia's obUgations under the increasing number of international agreements for the conservation of wUdUfe to which this Government has become a signatory. Its functions wiil include education of park rangers and the provision of assistance to other countries in nature conservation matters. The BUl makes special provision for agreements with Aboriginal people for the operative conservation management of their land and its wUdUfe resources. In land vested in the Service, regulations wUl be made where necessary to meet the special needs of the Aboriginal people while ensuring that overall wUdlife conservation objectives are met. In aU cases, there wUl be consultation with the Aboriginal people and proper consideration of their traditions and culture which have so much to contribute to the heritage of this nation. The Government has dealt positively with the question of mmerals in national parks. Where minerals occur in a park or reserve, no operations for their recovery may take place except in accordance with a plan of management approved by both Houses of the ParUament. We beUeve that ParUament itself should make the vital decision on whether operations for the recovery of minerals should take place in a park or reserve and then only hi the genuine interests of the nation. Under the BUl, the Service wiU be able to manage parks for a variety of purposes in addition to nature conservation, such as tourism, recreation, and for scientific investigation. With the passage of this legislation the dition to nature conservation, aimed at halting Government wUl move quickly for the proclaman's unthinking degradation of the total mation of a number of outstanding areas. Foreenvironment, the genesis of life on this planet. most is the proposed Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory, which the then Minister for the Interior in July 1970 referred to in the following terms: . . . the area's ingredients of scenic grandeur, interesting and unique flora and fauna and cultural and historical elements, if blended and managed successfully, could produce a great park for public interest and enjoyment as weU as making a major contribution to conservation. We agree with this assessment and wUl be proud to proclaim this long-promised, world class, national park. We will also proclaim Gudgenby National Park in the AustraUan Capital Territory, promised but not estabUshed by a former Goverament. In commending this Bill to honourable members, I would Uke to stress that it is high time that this ParUament enacted legislation on behalf of all Australians to permit the Australian Government to play its proper part in the conservation of our national heritage, which indeed is part of a world heritage becoming increasingly precious to mankind. I regard this Bill as a significant part of this Government's response to the growmg awareness of our fragile world. It exemplifies our wUUng acceptance of the obligation to set the example required of a national Government. In conclusion I would like to say that this action accords with the sentiments of the AustraUan Labor Party platform where it is recognised that 'man Uves within and depends upon a complex natural system which must be protected and managed as a whole'. The platform further states: The advance of agricultural pursuits and the expansion of cities and their industries have been the cause of much of the natural habitat of Australia's native flora and fauna being severely reduced and in some cases lost completely. Our natural heritage should be fostered and our natural landscapes protected for the sake of social, cultural, educational and scientific purposes as well as for Australia's future tourist potential. To achieve this protection the Australian Labor Party in its platform has pledged to 'conserve for future generations adequate samples of Australia's unique flora and fauna by the development of a comprehensive system of national parks, nature and recreation reserves'. This Bill is a vital step and wUl be complemented by further legislation. This wUl deal with important aspects of environmental concern, in adDebate (on motion by Mr Hunt) adjourned.

These amendments to the Bill were proposed in the Senate by the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Murphy) on behalf of the Government. The effect of the first 2 amendments is to remove from the Bill clause 12 (hnes 30 to 36) and paragraph (b) of clause 13 (line 39) which gave to authorised officers power to examine persons on oath or affirmation and imposed a penalty for failing or refusing to be sworn or to make an affirmation. The Government proposed these amendments because it considers it to be improper and unnecessary for legislation to give powers of this kind to officers unless there are special circumstances making this necessary. Clause 11 of the Bill gives authorised officers powers to require answers to questions and to require documents etc., to be produced. These powers are considered to be so adequate for the adrrdnistrative tax collection purposes of this Bill as to render unnecessary the additional power to examine on oath or affirmation.

House)Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this BillI would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Commonwealth Banks Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on the 2 measures at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I shall allow that course to be followed. tralian Tourist Commission BUl and the Commonwealth Banks Bill seek authority for the Commonwealth Development Bank to provide finance for the establishment or the development of undertakings involved in the tourist industry and to widen the operations of the Australian Tourist Commission so as to include the promotion of domestic tourism.

The Australian Tourist Commission Bill 1974 proposes that the existing Act be amended to broaden the powers of the Commission beyond its present jurisdiction of encouraging visits from overseas tourists to include the promodon of travel by Australians in their own country. The Opposition Parties, of course, suppon both Bills. They are positive and constructive proposals designed to assist an Australian industry which contributes significantly to the quality of life in this country. However, the House will recall that the proposal to expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank into tourism was first outlined in the Liberal-Country Party's 1972 policy speech. The Opposition Parties are very much aware of the significant contribution which this industry makes directly to the Australian economy. We made, our position clear during the debate on the earlier legislation on 3 April and it is not my intention to repeat here in detail what I said on behalf 'of the Opposition Parties on that occasion. Nevertheless, since the passage of that legislation through the House on 3 April a number of disturbing features have emerged in the Australian tourist industry which require comment in the context of this legislation. The Australian National Travel Association has sought a full scale inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission into the tourist industry. The Association has pointed out that the hotel and motel industry's average return on shareholders' funds decreased from 6.9 per cent in 1970 to 1.8 per cent in 1973. Statistics provided by the Association demonstrated that the industry ranks last of all AustraUan industries in terms of profitabiUty. This, of course, must be reflected here as an issue of very great concern. The rapid decline in industry profitability must be considered in the Ught of a travel gap the value of which has increased from $52m in 1968 to $220m in 1973. Even with the very substantial cost pressures which are now prevalent throughout the industry, there is no evidence that the present Government has yet adopted an effective national tourism poUcy. The report prepared this year by the Department of Tourism and Recreation devotes some 8 pages to tourism in a total of around 52 pages. I regret, in the light of that observation, that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart), who is in charge of the tourist industry so far as the activities of the Federal Government are concerned, is not in the chamber.

I would have thought that the business could have been so arranged between the Minister and the Leader of the House, seeking of course the best result in this Parliament for a total examination of the tourist industry, that the Minister would have been present for this debate. Mr DalyI am very receptive. I wonder whether in that sense I could ask him, through the Chair of course, a specific question because it so happens that I have a copy of the minutes of the proceedings of a Caucus meeting held on Tuesday, 29 September, headed 'Urban and Regional Development Caucus Committee'. This is Caucus committee No. 5. Page2 of the minutes tells me of a presentation which the Minister for Tourism and Recreation made to that Committee on the subject of the Travel Agents Bill. The Minister for Services and Property, with his usual indulgence and sense of democracy and open government might tell me whether he is prepared to have the minutes of this meeting incorporated in the Hansard record. Mr DalyI will ask the Minister when he gets here whether he would not mind this being done. I have not seen the document to which the honourable member refers. I am not a member of the Committee. I have a few interesting documents of the honourable member's in respect of which I hope he will extend the same consideration to me later. table that if he stops telling Ues about me I will agree not to tell the whole truth about him and on that basis I know who wUl be the more embarrassed of the two. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation, according to the minutes of the Caucus committee, is understood to be bringing forward a matter for discussion with the committee. It is called the Travel Agents Bill. I regret that this is one of the few initiatives that the Minister has under consideration at present.

For many years this year wUl be spent well. The main beneficithe Commission has been extremely successful in aries from any domestic tourism increase, let its overseas promotional activities. Australia, in fact, relies heavily on the AustraUan Tourist Commission to provide expertise and ultimately to seU our tourism in overseas countries. EarUer this year the Commission was charged with the extra responsibUity of entering the domestic tourist promotion field. The aim of the Government was quite simple and was clearly defined. It was to induce and encourage more Australians to travel in their own country. With the speed and efficiency which is characteristic of the Australian Tourist Commission, it has produced a handy Uttle tourist guide book and has launched a massive newspaper, magazine and television advertising campaign all under the same slogan: 'AustraUa, a Land of Things to do'. But I understand that that is only the beginning of the Commission's involvement in this field of domestic promotion which in the past was left to State governments, travel associations and the private sector of the community. The cheap jibes which came from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition make me wonder why in the 23 years in which the Opposition was in government it did absolutely nothing for tourism. I understand that the Australian Tourist Commission wUl expand its activities and, after aiming at the youth market will turn its attention to the middle age group-in which I could be classed-and also to the famUies and even to the elderly. There are even elderly members of ParUament in this House. By offering all ofthose groups sufficient information and, even enticement, to make them discover their own country, I feel there is a place within tourism for those who do not want to be run off their feet, who do not want to get in a Pioneer bus-that is not a plug I went to New Zealand in January of this year.

The going overseas. The ones who are jealous are honourable member for Banks( Mr Martin) has those who do not go. Those poor people have to suffer'the slides which are shown to them by the other people who have been overseas and who pound their ears about it. The people who travelled overseas probably, in reaUty, did not enjoy their trip but because of the large outlay involved they have to convince others that they did enjoy it. When they come home they show you those eternal sUdes and you have to sit through them. I feel that there should be more co-operation betweeii Federal, State and local bodies, railways, coach companies and people involved in other areas which cater for the traveller. In the United States of America we have the famous Greyhound buses hurtling people across the States for a Very Small fee. In Europe they have the EuraUpass which is a marvellous combination ticket'for trains, buses and even boats.

I have pleasure in commending the BUl to the House.",49,Australian Tourist Commission
144,Mr Calder (Northern Territory ),"said somewhat uncharitably, I feel, that the people in the tourist industry need prodding. I hope I heard him incorrecdy, but I would say that they need active assistance. Previous governments, not only this Government, have given minimal assistance to the tourist industry. I would hope that the introduction of this legislation is merely a first and a very significant step towards recognising one of our major income earners. Proposed new section 6 of the Act provides that the Commission is to consist of no more than 9 members, two of whom are to be nominated to represent all the States. Of the remaining members, one is to be a pubhc servant. Where others are to be drawn from, I do not know. As the member for the Northern Territory, I ask why there is not a Northern Territory member on that commission. The last I heard was that the Northern Territory produces $28m a year from tourism. It should be borne in mind that as a conservative estimate a dollar spent by a tourist is worth $3.50 when it is circulated around a town. That means that a colossal amount of money has gone into the public pocket. It is rather inconsistent with general representation that there is not someone from such a famous tourist area as central and northern Australia on that Commission. I would hope that when the Commission is reconstituted this omission will befixedup. We in the Territory have something to offer; we have something that is of far greater fascination than most other tourist centres in Australia. I will not expound that point because honourable members know that as well as I do. At this moment when our other major industries, that is the rnining and pastoral industries, are under heavy attack from this GovernmentI am talking generally about AustraUa but in particular about only one-sixth of AustraUa because I represent one-sixth of it-it is significant that the tourist industry can be of great assistance to the economy. I urge the Government to pay very close attention to this part of AustraUa. Proposed new section 15 of the Act states that the Commission is established for the purpose of encouraging visits to AustraUa by people from overseas and of travel in AustraUa. Surely if encouragement is to be stepped up, the funds required to encourage people to visit AustraUa should be stepped up also. I suppose somewhere along the Une the Mmister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) wUl teU us what sort of financial encouragement is to be provided. It is noticeable that hitherto the Commission has been lacking in funds and has been unable to engage in overseas promotion. There wUl have to be an increase in tourists from overseas if this encouragement is to be proven successful. I expect that with the buUd up of the encouragement, which seems to be the whole purport of the Commission, and also with the devaluation of the AustraUan dollar American tourists and tourists from various other countries wUl again come to AustraUa. I would point out that, as in the past, accommodation, places at which to eat as well as transport, rail and road facUities wUl be stretched or over-stretched by a long way. As the Australian Tourist Commission Bill and the Commonwealth Banks BUl, which allow for the financing of tourist facUities by the Commonwealth Development Bank, are being debated together, I would ask the Bank to take a more sympathetic view towards assisting the building up of tourist facUities. Local operators are now faced with increased taxation, greatly increased operational costs and increased fares and freight rates. Whether these tourist facUities be at the Blue Mountains, Portsea, Alice Springs or anywhere else, people wUl have to pay increased fares to get to them. There is also a shortage of materials fbr buUding or enlarging premises. Anyone in the business wUl know what it is Uke to have premises half buUt and bemg unable to get mirrors or sliding windows ortileson the roof etc. It is a very real problem. One form of assistance could be of great help to the private operators who wUl carry the brunt of the influx of encouraged visitors. No depreciation aUowance has been extended to the tourist industry in the past and if such an allowance were made today and it were earmarked for development and improved programs, then I am sure that some of these tourist facUities would get off the ground and would be in a position to supply accommodation or assistance in whatever manner to a far greater number of people. The profitabiUty on tourist operations has fallen very considerably. In fact, many operators would be making only a marginal profit at this time. By the time the Coombs report and various other things bite, a lot of these people could go broke. There has been a tremendous increase in costs both to the traveller and to the person looking after him, and both these groups are being very heavily disadvantaged. SoI ask the Government to look at the points that I have made with regard to that matter. Again and again we find tourists who arrive at a place at which no accommodation is available becoming disillusioned. The road and the raUway Une connecting Atice Springs both have been unserviceable at times this year because of wet weather and the town has been overrun by tourists. Because there has been no spare accommodation, no nothing, people have become disappointed, disillusioned and frankly disgusted with the whole deal. There are many things that have to be looked at. I am looking to the Commission to do that. I am certain that the Minister will give it the benefit ofhis great interest in tourthe tourist industry also find it suitable work beism and that it will go ahead. I only hope that it is not really meant to be a means of taking over from the States and private enterprise in this field. I do not think that is the case. I am certain that the Tourist Commission's activities will be a great step forward in providing assistance and attractions for tourists. While I am on my feet I would like to make ance of payments and from the taxation revenue one more suggestion with regard to Darwin. If we are able to finance our domestic projects, Darwin were to be made a free port it could bewhich in a rather circulatory way means the tourcome a tremendous tourist attraction, sitting as it ist industry. does at the bottom of the Indonesian Archipelago.

I am sure that would be a very successful way of attracting tourists. I hope that the Commission, with its representative of the in the activities of the tourist industry in AustraUa Northern Territory, wUl give more consideration is the contribution it can make to the developto the provision of real assistance to tourist operment of regional areas. One has only to consider ators. I am certain that the Minister wUl ensure the expansion of a town like Swan HU1 over and this is so. to say very much in this debate.

The peak loading of several tourist attractions coincides with a time that is suitable for them to leave their cluldren and find employment.

Ipeople to take a one-day return railway trip to Healesville and spend the time there looking at the tourist attractions which are going to be developed, such as the Lilliputian town depicting ail the large and well-known structures of Melbourne, and the well-known Sir Colin McKenzie Sanctuary and so on there. That would be a rationale for the support and continuation of the railway service. In turn tourism would build up and provide the infrastructure that could provide the other necessary cultural activities. Another opportunity for development could arise with the removal of the Army medical school from Healesville. It will soon be removed to an area closer to the hospitals of either Sydney of Melbourne, which will be an important move. Its removal means that a very large guest house, a golf course and other faculties which have been provided for the use of officers in the past will be left vacant. Here we have an opportunity to use it as an accommodation centre for tourist attraction and so on. WhatI am trying to get across to the House is their carrying capacity.

Now it is time to extend the resources threatened. The Kakadu National Park is being established and expanded but it is threatened. The common threat is that very soon, unless strong management policies are developed, the increased tourism wiU exceed the tourist carrying capacity of these parks. The tourist industry must realise that if it is to maintain its asset, retain its asset and develop and profit by that asset both individually and nationally, it must develop management poUcies which wUl preserve that asset. I mention my own electorate again because it happens to be situated within a radius of about 40 mUes from Melbourne, thus being ideal for one-day and 2-day trips from the metropolis of Melbourne. The Dandenong Ranges, the Upper Yarra VaUey and the Great Dividing Range come into that area. The national parks which are within one day's travel and return of Melbourne are the Doongalla Reserve, the Ferntree GuUy Park, Sherbrooke Forest and the Lysterfield Reserve. AU these have already reached First and foremost the 2 BUls before the House Australia than it was and it is now dearer to travel overseas than it was. Reflected in this 12 The Government is to expand the functions of available to developers from the Commonwealth Development Bank to the services or tertiary industries-in this case tourism. Another aspect of this expansion of the activities of the AustraUan Tourist Commission is the promotion of domestic tourism as weU as international tourism. It is weU enough to generate more people from outside to provide increased earnings but it is equally important to generate increased travel opportunities to indigenous AustraUans. As the working week becomes shorter, as the tension of modern Ufe in the cities becomes stronger and as the desire for escape from it becomes stronger the opportunities should be provided at weekends for one-day and 2-day trips. There will also need to be provided one-week and 2-week trips such as to the Centre, to the Great Barrier Reef and to the other mternationaUy known natural and geographic features. The AustraUan Tourist Commission was established in 1967 because of the recognition of the need for a central organising agency. But until this Government took office the Commission was limited virtuaUy to name only. What is needed and what wUl be provided is that the Commission be more of a guide, a catalyst, a promoter-as well as an integrator. I beUeve that that is what this Commission wUl do under its expanded role. Particular attention should be given to the smaU tourist projects. It is true that we need large scale hotels of international standard, but more and more we need to provide facUities for the average suburbanite to get away from it all, to escape modern Uving, to get away on day trips and 2-day trips to something different-to what Professor Ovington has described as the outback syndrome. We need to escape to our more primordial surroundings, our environment, and to imbibe something more natural than the artificial Ufe we have created in the cities and the suburbs.

The Budget provides $2.25m for the developclose to AustraUa, continued to be our most ment of tourist attractions. The Government has important market representing one-quarter of announced that it wUl widen the criteria on the total visitors and spending $34.6m in this which this wUl be based. In fact $4.1m wUl be country. However, individual Japanese visitors spent on assistance to the tourist industry. The La Trobe electorate offers many examples of tourist activities close to the large metropolises. I do not wish to be parochial but I want to emphasise that. For example, I believe that this Government should assist the developing museum at the Police Paddocks in Rowville. There is unpareUeled scenery in the Dandenong Ranges, in the national parks I have mentioned and in the waterways of the Upper Yarra Valley. Art galleries and restaurants have been developed there to make it a unique area on the outer fringes of the metropolises. HealesvUle has a very active promotion committee. There is the sanctuary, and now it is developing its Lilliput town to depict in one-twelfth scale the more important and renowned engineering feats of Melbourne. I cannot understand why the regional area which the State Government has developed wUl extend from the EUdon Weir right down to Flinders near the penguins which the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lynch) mentioned and praised, and quite rightly so. It seems to me that this region offers little in the way of connection or co-ordination in a link. This means that it is still bound with parochial emphasis on profit to the town, to the individual or to the local government in the short term. I beUeve that what the Minister has suggested in this legislation as the expanded role of the Australian Tourist Commission and of the Development Bank wUl help to turn that parochialism into a national identity and a national purpose. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (4.44)-I rise to support the BUl to amend the AustraUan Tourist Commission Act 1967-73. As the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) stated in this House, the Bill was introduced on 19 March originaUy and, whilst debate did take place, it lapsed on the occasion of the double dissolution. As previous speakers have indicated, tourism in AustraUa is indeed very big business. Last year overseas tourists spent SISOm. These tourists came mainly from New Zealand, the United and Japan. There were 472,000 of them-a n increase of 10.7 per cent over 1972. The income cent. Both increases are higher than the world As one would expect, New Zealand, being so",52,Australian Tourist Commission
146,Mr Lamb,"You farmers should understand States of America, Britain, Papua New Guinea",54,Australian Tourist Commission
147,Mr Lamb,"D o not worry, my friend. I have averages for 1973. This information comes fromspent more money than others, amounting to $410 during a visit, at a rate of $24 a day compared with $16 by Americans, $9 by New Zealanders and $5 by Britons. Tourism is a growing industry and more than half of Austraha's population are now consumers of travel and tourism. The industry's income generation is estimated at $2,400m or 8 per cent of the gross national income. It is a growth industry with a capacity to double in size every seven or eight years. It provides an acceptable alternative industry in the non-urban areas. Its growth is related directly to the increased leisure and the rising personal disposable income of the AustraUan citizen. The more leisure hours that people have in AustraUa the greater the abUity of citizens to travel and so increase tourism in AustraUa. The industry employs at least 10 per cent of the AustraUan work force, primarily in thefieldsof transport and accommodation. It is a major employer of female labour. It also employs a high proportion of casual workers. Travel and tourism can generate additional employment thus contributing to overcoming substantial seasonal, structural and technological unemployment occurring in other industries. The travel industry contributes to local, State and federal authority revenues not only through direct taxation but through the heavy throughput of products subject to excise, such as fuel and Uquor. It contributes a high incidence of payroll tax, road tax, Ucence fees, sales tax on consumables, vehicle Ucence fees and inspection fees on transportation. Its contribution to Federal revenue funds was $33.2m last financial year. However as the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) knows, and as has been reported in various tourist articles, AustraUa has an adverse balance of trade. The figures for December 1973 show that 319,000 short-term visitors came to AustraUa whereas the short-term departures were 460,000. Receivables amounted to $139m and overseas spending $359m. There was a gap of $220m. This represented an increase of 25 per cent over the previous year. This is a serious situation. People in the tourist industry in AustraUa and particularly the Minister would recognise this fact and I am sure would be doing all they could to arrest this situation and to make our balance of trade more favourable from a tourist point of view. The AustraUan Tourist Commission is doing a splendid job overseas. It is interesting to note in the Budgetfiguresthat the allocation to the Department of Tourism and Recreation is to be increased this year. It is estimated that $8,356,000 wUl be spent this year as compared with $6,317,000 last year-a n increase of more than $2m. I know that the Minister would have Uked a bigger increase to enable him to promote our tourist industry both overseas and within AustraUa. The vote has been increased by $2m this year and no doubt he has his sights on a still higher vote next year. The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Act to enable the Commission to enter the domestic tourist promotionfield.This work was previously left to the State governments and various tourist associations. I pay a tribute to the State governments for the effort they have made in their respective States in promoting tourism and in granting financial assistance to tourist associations. The New South Wales State Government has conributed to tourist associations in New South Wales and I have no doubt that other State governments have done likewise in their States. My association has been with the North West Tourist Association in the north of New South Wales. In my electorate there are 2 associationsthe North West Tourist Association and the Hunter Valley Association-bot h receiving grants of approximately $10,000 from the State Government. This, with finance from local governing bodies, has enabled them to employ full time tourist officers who have done a grand job in promoting tourism in their respective areas. The State governments and local governments have played their pan and I have no doubt that the Tourist Commission, through the Minister, wUl co-operate to the full with State and local government authorities to increase the promotion of tourism. My own electorate has a .<»reat tourist potential. I am pleased that coach )mpanies in New South Wales are taking full advantage of this potential. Weekend tours and weekly tours leave Sydney and Brisbane and pass through my area. The tourists inspect the vineyards which are a great attraction at Pokolbin and elsewhere. Tourist coaches are taking full advantage of this attraction. Near Maitland are the lovely surfing beaches, Lowstone Dam, Lake Liddell, Glenbawn Dam and Keepit Dam, all great tourist attractions. The State tourist associations are doing aU they can to assist their promotion and I am pleased to say that this industry is developing. We must develop our own internal tourist industry to cater for overseas tourists. Devaluation most certainly wUl help overseas tourists who come to Australia. In my travels overseas I found that people complained that Australian costs were too high and that our dollar was under-valued. I feel that with the devaluation of the AustraUan dollar we will see in Australia more visitors, particularly from the United States Wool Industry Bill 1974 of America. This could help our great tourist industry considerably. This Bill is being debated cognately with the Commonwealth Banks Bill. No doubt the Commonwealth Bank has provided considerable finance for this industry but with our present high costs and a high interest rate of 1 l.S per cent it will be difficult to secure Debate resumed from 1 October (vide page finance for tourist propositions and for facUities 2024), on motion by Mr Crean: for tourists.

I conclude on the following 4 general points. The Labor Government has done a good deal in a short dme as a reforming government. at which social change can be introduced. in the sense that we took over a deformed economy, but I wiU not go into that in detaU now. In such fields as health, social security and help for Aborigines and in other areas such as education, the Labor Government has tried in a way that the Liberals did not to introduce genuine social reform. Many of the changes introduced are irreversible and whether the AustraUan Labor Party increased by 55 per cent. There were other significant increases in pension rates. I ask for leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out 'Labor's Record on Pension Increases'. leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

From the economic point of view, it is a very difficult period to be in office. It is more difficult than at any other time since World War II . It is very difficult to make decisions on economic matters when conditions are changing quickly. Variables such as exchange rates, commodity prices, rates of inflation in the major nations, and output and employment are extremely uncertain. It follows that nerve is needed in the economic management. In conditions of uncertainty, there is always a danger of 'ad Hocery', that is, too many ad hoc decisions. Lags in economic policy mean that we must try to judge the future, make what we beUeve are the correct decisions and then wait. We must resist the temptation to over react and to panic.

The alternativesavage unemployment-is certainly completely unacceptable. ment by the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) of 17 September which we are debating in the House today is not a Budget. It is a fraudulent claim by those who presume to give it that title. It is, in fact, a prescription for disaster and is almost as bad, or probably just as bad, as the prescription for disaster that was brought down in this House by the Treasurer last year. There are more narcotic elements in the ingredients of this Budget, or this paper, than there were last year. It is not a Budget because it does not meet the fundamental requirements of any Budget in an EngUsh speaking community which beUeves in democracy and the Cabinet system of government. In the first place it does not map out the trend of events as foreseen by the Treasurer and the Treasury in the Budget year. It does not indicate the problems that are likely to be faced and the remedies and policies that are bemg adopted to overcome the problems that the Treasurer, the Treasury and the Cabinet of the country believe wUl emerge. It does not-thi s is of paramount importance-se t out a strategy for sound economic and iinancial management of this country. Where can we find anywhere in this document at all a comprehensive, internally consistent and effective series of remedies which are Ukely over the whole field of activities-that is the Budget, exchange rates, monetary and interest rate poUcies, wages policy and a psychology that can be designed to ensure that all the ingredients are there and are brought together consistently-to ensure the better welfare of the people of this country? In addition we cannot find anywhere in the Budget at aU policies that are directed towards the main elements that are essential to the growth and the progress of this country. Let me look first of all at growth and progress2 words that I Uke to use together. Where do we see in any part of the statement itself or the statements that are attached any forecast of the way in which the economy is to grow and grow in a way which wUl be productive and wUl be the sound foundations on which future developments and better opportunities and Ufe style wUl be created?

I mentioned thefigureswhich apmumty, to those who are suffering hardship and plied when we were in government. It has been to those who are bordering on the poverty line in this country. Looking at the facts in the statement where can we find any reference to the remedies for the increasing unemployment, to increasing mflation and to the problems associated with our balance of payments? Where can we find in the statement in this Budget any analysis of problems associated with the credit squeeze, Uquidity and the money supply? Ever since I have been in this Parliament, a period now of listening to 26 Budgets, statements of that sort have been included. In fact, I now have to say and have to confirm that one does not find them there. One does find a prescription for the difficulties I have mentioned. Where do we find in the statement or the statements attached anything relating to a balance between demand and supply in the economy or our international balance of payments or an understanding of those problems that are so critically important if we are to know where we are going and if business is to have confidence and the people are to know that they are being satisfactorily and reUably governed? The tragedy of it all is that this Labor Party, when it inherited the reins of office, had the whole world in its arms. It had the voters worshiping at its feet, but it no longer has them there. It had them there because we were not ableI do not know why-to press these arguments resolutely and in a determined and conniving way ourselves. Our growth record was something of the order, in real terms, of 714 per cent for non-farm production. Judged by the implicit price deflator index we had inflation down to 2.2 per cent. It is now running at 18.8 per cent and probably wUl run much in excess of 2214 per cent this year. Even in terms of the consumer index we had inflation down as low as 4.6 per cent. We brought unemployment down in the month of October to 88,000. What is the figure today? Honourable members should remember that when we were in government we mcluded school leavers in the raw numbers of unemployed. I am pretty reliably informed that the number of unemployed in September rose by 15,000, bringing the full crudefigureup to about 123,000.1 beUeve another 20,000 can be added because of school leavers.

Let us look at what I think should have been done and what sort of Budget should have been brought down. First of all I say that when one looks at the increase in expenditure and in revenue one must be driven to the conclusion that it is wickedly bad. There was an increase in expenditure of $3,980m and an increase in receipts of $3,700m. If there was a figure of $ 1,000m two or three years ago there would have been outcries from every section of the commumty that this was too big. Last year the figure of $2,000m was bad; this year thefigureof about $4,000m is infinitely worse. It must compound ail the problems we have and make the difficulties even more intense than they are at the moment. My recommendation undoubtedly would have been that at least $2,000m should have been chopped off eachfigure.I shaU outUne how I would use that amount. First of aU tax concessions of about $ 1,000m are looking at. The rate of decrease in the money would have been provided over the whole scale supply in either case in seasonally adjusted terms of the tax range giving at the margins an is between 12 per cent and 13 per cent per inducement to work harder and to do better for annum. This is a prescription for disaster and every section of the commumty. Obviously we nothing can save us from the consequences while would concentrate the heaviest cuts to the people this economic stupidity goes on. So what would I who are in the greatest need. Greater assistance do? I would have no hesitation in the monetary would have been given to the States to prevent field in permitting the Reserve Bank to go on indirect tax and action would have been taken by with its poUcy of open market operations by purthe Commonwealth to cut down inflationary chasing effects of indirect taxes. Then we would have given incentive both to savings and investment. Even Dr Jim has now recognised and agreed either accepted or endorsed by a bank it has now with this proposal in one ofhis recantations and permitted them to be bought at a rate of about 11 changes of plumage and poUcy. No country, per cent or 11 Vi per cent. whether it be Libera!, sociaUst, authoritarian or whatever it might happen to be, can progress unbe going into the money market to raise funds less it invests and no country can invest unless it through Commonwealth bonds and securities. is prepared to save and to give incentive to savNor would I try to convert maturing loans.

The Labor greater incentives to savings through the assurGovernment permitted new and increased adance companies. These and other remedies are vances to run riot last year with all the damage it necessary if again we are to carry out the ideas of caused, particularly with regard to certificates of Dr Jim and if we wish to work our way and prodeposit. Such developments were permitted to duce our way out of inflation and inflationary go too far too rapidly, with all the difficulties pressures. We can do that by the kind of incentives that we are now proposing. Turning then to monetary andfinancialpolicy, money base today is being steadUy reduced and that can only have disastrous results. I have heard it said by members on the Government benches that the money supply is being Uberalised or being increased. But only in the last 2 days thefigureshave come out relating to the money base, as it is called. There are 3 different ways in which it can be interpreted, but there are only two that are strictly relevant-that is, the actual money or cash in the community together with current accounts, or cash in the community, current accounts, plus deposits in the savings banks. If one looks at thefiguresthat have just been produced by the Reserve Bank, it is critical that one should look at the rate at which changes are occurring. There was a vast increase in the money supply in the early part of last year. It tapered off until about February and remained static for some time. Now, let us remember it is the rate that we bonds in the money market. Recently it has carried its operation a little further than usual and in relation to commercial bills that are I would be absolutely certain that I would not critical importance that we ease the money supply. The overkUl has occurred. I believe we have to take one other measure these changes are causing today. I beheve we must increase the new and increased advances, certainly by S50m or $60m a week, but preferably to somewhere close to $ 120m a week to permit this to be done. I have pressed for long that on the international exchanges there should be a devaluation or depreciation of the Austrahan currency by 12 Vi per cent. I must admit that I did not tliink Reserve Bank is now trying to achieve. He rather this should be done until about the middle of the March quarter of next year. But it has been done and whilst it has been done prematurely the main thing is that it has been done. In addition the residue of the special variable deposits-the deposits that have to be made on money borrowed overseas and brought into AustraUa-mus t be removed. I understand that the Reserve Bank wants to cling to the money, but that is a greedy outlook. As it costs more to borrow under this system I think that the residue ought to be removed immediately. The2 year and a day rule relating to short term loans should also be taken off.

This is part of a 3-year project costing the Federal Government some $10m. The decision by the Government to recognise the plight of parents with handicapped children is one of the most pleasing features of the social welfare document. I know from the number of people who have contacted me personally just how much this measure will really mean to them after years and years of neglect. The increase of the subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act will play a very tangible role in meeting some of the difficulties being experienced by many religious and charitable organisations which are coping remarkably well with many of the problems that escalating costs inevitably bring about. The increase in repatriation benefits has been welcomed by all Service organisations. One is reminded of the absence of comment on this measure by so many members of the Opposition. All the organisations are now well aware of the increases and I will not trespass on thetimeof the House in repeating them. But perhaps I could be permitted to just mention two or three of the most significant new measures in the repatriation field. These new and very welcome initiatives are listed on page 9 of the Budget Speech: Free medical and hospital treatment for any condiuon will proposed 25 per cent increase in freight rates bebe provided for all Australian ex-servicemen and women tween Tasmania and the mainland. who were interned as prisoners of war. This is another issue which was long neglected by the former Government. All ex-service personnel, irrespective of whether they had service in a theatre of war, who suffer from malignant cancer, will be provided with any treatment necessary for that condition. These benefits will be introduced during the Budget sittings. Funher benefits will be introduced from tbe Autumn of 197S. The means test on service pensions will be abolished for those aged 70 and 74 years. A further 25 per cent of all war pension payments will be disregarded as income for service pension means test purposes. Ex-service personnel who had war-time service in the defence forces of other countries of the British Commonwealth and who are now residing in Australia, and have done so for at least 10 years, will be eligible to apply for service pensions. These are new initiatives introduced by this Government which were long ignored by the previous Government. Does any honourable member opposite suggest that we cut back in this program? I turn briefly to the field of Defence Service Homes and I welcome the increase in the maximum loan from $12,000 to $15,000 and the easing of the eligibility conditions. that? those people who have a limited capacity to know that you are developing into a parliamentary bore. I want to turn to particular issues that vitally affect my own State of Tasmania. There is of course, and always will be, a necessity for national governments to recognise particular geographical problems, and the metaphysical problems of the honourable member. The continuing difficulty being experienced by all sections of the Tasmanian community can nearly always be traced back to the acute and seemingly never-ending problems of freight rates so delicately touched on by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. I will have more to say about that in a moment. We do not have the advantages in Tasmania of road or rail alternatives and the whole economy of the State can be brought to a standstill if we are priced out of the market by the disadvantages of excessive freight rates. In last year's Budget there was a provision for a $lm subsidy to be paid to the Australian National Line. This amount, of course, will continue in this Budget and again next year. This move most certainly has been welcomed and Tasmanians have been gratified to see at last a national Government recognise an act to overcome this disability. Therefore I was delighted to hear that the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) had announced that there would be a freeze in the However, associated with this acute problem of freight rates are other factors. Unless there is an improvement in the arrangement for shipping services to and from Tasmama and unless there is a greater expertise in evidence in regard to the State's requirements, the situation will not improve. Unless there is a greater and more acute sense of industrial responsibility, no matter what this Government might do, the situation will always remain critical. I intrude these observations because if there is not a willingness to display a corporate sense of goodwill and common sense the position of Tasmania will always be one of great difficulty and the State will always have these problems. I would now like to refer to some comments on freight rates that were made by the Leader of the Opposition last evening. He came storming into this chamber in his usual bull-like fashion as if he had suddenly discovered Tasmania and talked in his predictably pious fashion about freights. He should be the last person to raise that subject because he was the Treasurer who presided over a 25 per cent freight rate increase to Tasmania in less than 18 months.

167,Mr Sherry,"My friend, you are one ofhumbug the Leader of the Opposition really is. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the plight of local government. We all know that he is not the sharpest member in the House but he conveniently forgets, or does not know, of the grants to local government made by the Grants Commission. Those grants were announced in this place only 2 months ago. My own electorate of Frarikhn-in which the Leader of the Opposition was so desperately interested-receive d more than $350,000 under this arrangement. The right honourable gentleman informed us that he sent out hundreds of telegrams to municipalities. Lord knows how much that cost the taxpayer. What did he discover? The Leader of the Opposition must have known that the granting of these moneys by the Grants Commission was then in train. The Leader of the Opposition must be exposed because he opposed the Government in giving local councils a vote and a voice at the Australian Loan Council. Yet, he has the temerity to stand in this House and say that he is the Lord Protector of local government. Yesterday we saw his crocodile tears. We heard his phony concern for Tasmania, his propositions which are as shallow as the man himself, the piece de resistance-hi s attack on the Government for introducing the tree-pull scheme-and his attack concerning the plight of the Tasmanian orchardists. Does he not realise that it was his government-of which he was then a member of the Cabinet-whic h introduced that particular measure? What an incredible man the Leader of the Opposition is. How the Country Party tolerates him I will never know. Yesterday he claimed that the $15m for Tasmania under the StatesOrder! The honourable member for DarUng Downs wiU remain sUent. Speaker. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the $ 15m for Tasmama under the States grants legislation was not enough. This was the amount asked for by the Premier of Tasmama. The Leader of the Opposition always says: ""The Government is not doing enough. It is not giving enough money'. But in the very next breath the Leader of the Opposition slams this Government for spending too much money. How inconsistent can one be? The Leader of the Opposition is consistent in one way and that is in his inconsistency. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition yesterday no one in Tasmania would ever take him seriously. He totters into this House with his tattered policies trailing behind him. He is the Liberal Party's Falstaff lurching from one embarrassment to the other. The honourable member for Darling Downs may well lurch from here before he is here much longer. The honourable member suffers from a twofold disadvantage. This honourable member herewho keeps interjecting. The honourable member for Darling Downs has an undisciplined tongue and a very slow rate of cerebral progression. I can excuse the latter but not the former. The decision of the Government to proceed with the new terminal at the Hobart Airport at a cost of $1.3m is most welcome indeed. This is long overdue. The Opposition, as is its practice, does a lot of talking but takes very Uttle action. The decision to update the capital city airport in Hobart, which for a capital city facUity at the present time is nothing short of disgraceful, is welcomed. The Hobart Airport has been in a disgraceful state for a number of years. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) for tolerating the many hours of argument put to him by my colleague the honourable member for Denison( Mr Coates) and myself to have this airport receive the highest priority. I am glad to say that work on the Hobart airport has already commenced. Mr Donald Cameron-It is a pity he did not do something for Brisbane. would. I want to turn now to the proposal in the Budget for assistance to the Tasmanian apple industry. If there is one industry that has been quite savagely mauled in the last decade it is the apple industry. The industry has an expertise unequalled anywhere. It has a product that is also unequalled. The people involved in the apple industry have an energy second to none. Domestic and, more particularly, external forces have created a very difficult and critical situation in the apple industry. The provision of $2.6m, following agreement between Tasmama, Western AustraUa and Queensland that the Federal Government wUl support a guarantee scheme for the next season, is very welcome.

I am deUghted at last that this tax-becaus e that is what it was-ha s been aboUshed. I hope it never returns. I warmly welcome the provision in the Budget for an additional $6m for the AustraUan CouncU for the Arts. As most honourable members wtil be aware I have constantly and consistently supported in this House a greater governmental awareness of and participation in the Arts. The scope and breadth of any Budget cannot be covered in a single speech. That, of course, would be impossible. I conclude with the same sentiment with which I began: The Budget is a document that maintains the thrust and momentum in the social welfare and educational fields. It seeks to continue the great experiment begun in December 1972. It certainly wiU not solve many of the current difficulties but I beUeve it is a very genuine and sincere attempt to reconstruct the priorities of the nation. I reaUse that the Budget does not satisfy the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, we all know that the Leader of the Opposition has a monumental capacity for believing that he is the repository of aU knowledge. He is a splended example of the observation that ambition is the last refuge of the faUure. I support the BUl and reject the amendment. (5.38)-This Budget was out of date before it was written. It has been by-passed by the flood ofeconomic events, and is now almost irrelevant to the situation which confronts our nation. It is not only the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) whose thinking lags behind the times. Opposition speakers have talked about stagflation confronting usa combination of stagnation and mflation, with prices rising and production in the doldrumsthe condition to which the Government brought AustraUa straight after its re-election in May. But here in October it is no longer stagflation which confronts us, but its more terrible twin, slumflation-a combination of inflation and slump. Business has been squeezed into impotence, our overseas funds are ebbing away, unemployment greater than any in the last 20 years is already with us, and much heavier unemployment is in prospect. All thetimemflation goes on and prices must soar to keep pace with costs. This is no longer stagflation-it must be recognised for what it is, slumflation. In the halcyon days before Labor got into government-whe n it was stUl the Oppositionits leaders delighted to castigate us for what they described as our 'stop-go' economic policy. Because we used both the brakes and the accelerator, as occasion required, we incurred their criticism but at least we kept the AustraUan economy moving forward at a relatively steady pace and we kept unemployment within relatively narrow bounds. I say 'relatively' because in the press of human affairs complete evenness is not practicable. Some variations of pace are inevitable but at least we kept thesefluctuationswithin narrower Umits than did most of the world over those two decades. But this Labor Government has done just the opposite. In the last 2 years, Australian inflation has been worse than that of most countries, prices have risen faster and unemployment has worsened more rapidly. 'Stop-go' indeed! Rather the Government changes policy from day to day, almost from hour to hour, denying now the principles which they proclaimed immutable only a few minutes ago. Nobody knows what it will do next, and the whole country suffers from its confusion. 'Stop-go' indeed! Rather it is like when the traffic light shows green and the constable at the crossroads is at the same time giving you the stop sign. But when all is said and done, the Budget is not the sole or even the principle determinant of the economic climate. The deterioration was in train before the Budget was presented, and even though the Budget may aggravate our troubles, there are more massive and sustained forces at work. I am not one of those who believe that the level of Government spending is the main cause of our current inflation, and I do not join in any appeal to cut it back in total. Indeed, in the period of slumflation which we are now entering, the stimulus of public expenditure may well be justified as a measure of pump priming which the economy would temporarily require. The prime cause of our current ills has been a Government miscalculation-it has faUed to appreciate the time lag between the imposition of economic restraints and the working out of their effects. Granted that some credit restriction and related actions were necessary early this year or even before, why did not the Government understand that the measures it took then would not have their real effect for many months ahead? Not realising this, the Government followed one packet of restraint with another packet and still another. Then, when the effects of the first restraint started to appear, we were already committed to the second and the unnecessary third.",64,Summary Table
174,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"In its clumsy way, for instance, the Government without the kind offiddlewhich the Minister for has brought the building industry not just to reLabour and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) cession but to incipient collapse. Its tariff policies has suggested, because I beUeve that it will be have brought unemployment instead of just more difficult to preserve industrial peace if we price restraint.

By thetimethe first dose started to act in the normal way, the other doses would be irrevocably in the pipeline, and their consequences would be still to come. This is what this inept Government has done to our once prosperous and stable AustraUan economy. To return for a moment to the motorist's metaphor, the brakes have been appUed inexpertly and we are in a skid. We must regain control of the car before we get into a bad collision. The first thing to do is simple: Ease the wage indexation without tax indexation, the squeeze.

In passing, let me add that I believe this indexation should apply to all award wages and salaries do not preserve full wage relativity. In the days when the price rise was relatively slow-unde r the Liberal-Country Party Government it averaged less than 3 per cent per yearannual wage adjustments, made substantially in advance were reasonable enough; but today, when prices are rising at some 5 per cent per quarter or over 20 per cent per year, quarterly adjustments, quarterly wage indexation, seem only fair. But here comes the other snag in the Government's proposals. As money wages rise, the tax on them rises more than proportionately, because our system of income tax is progressive, and the higher the wage the greater is the proportion of it taken in tax. Accordingly, under rises in money wages, so that the real wage-the net take home pay-remain s stable.

That effect can be seen from a table which I have in front of me. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. Order! Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

If he fails to do so, I would hope to find an opportunity of moving the necessary amendment in the House. It will be said, of course, that the Treasurer has based his Budget on continuing inflation. Indeed he said as much at page 88 of the statement attached to his Budget Speech and circulated in the House. It will be said by some people that nothing should be done to increase the deficit of than Tax on total taxable income $ $ 13,680 3,285 + 50cforeach$linexcessof$ll,400 18,240 4,425 + 55cforeach$linexcessof$13,680 22,800 6,933 + 60c for each $ lin excess of $18,240 45,600 9,669 + 64c foreach$l in excess of$22,800 24,261 + 67c for each $ lin excess of $45,600 $570m estimated by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. I do not share this view for three reasons. First, with the outflow of funds overseas, the liquidity of the Australian banking system will need some replenishment if we are to avoid a complete economic collapse. The statutory reserve deposits of the trading banks have now almost run out, so there is not much margin for increasing bank Uquidity by reducing them further. Some other way must be found, and a federal deficit would be one device-no t the only one, of course-avaUabl e for this purpose. In the circumstances an increased cash deficit in the Commonwealth Budget might well be desirable fbr its own sake. Second, although the Treasurer has announced an estimated deficit of $570m, this is not a correct figure. It has been arrived at by a Tax on Adjusted fiddle-by cooking the books. I do not, of course, Table Table say that this is the first time that this has occurred. When we were the government we did the $ $ same, though never to the same degree. Let me 120 109 explain. If honourable members look at page 20 290 259 of the Budget Paper No. 10-that is, the state530 470 ment of national income for 1973-74-the y wUl 820 733 1,160 1,038 see, tucked away there, a very reveaUng figure 1,540 1,355 whose significance, apparently, has not been 1,960 1,765 generally appreciated. There is there a table 2,420 2,185 showing an amount of $4,124m spent in the year 2,880 2,641 by public authorities on capital works. That table gives also the source of those funds and $2,967m-that is, 72 per cent-is stated to have come from the 'surplus on current transactions', that is, from revenue, and nearly all of it from Commonwealth revenue. Thus when the Treasurer announced that the Budget result for 1973-74 was a deficit of $293m he was most misleading. This 'deficit' was arrived at after charging nearly $3,000m of capital works against it. By any normal accounting method, the Treasurer should have shown a very substantial surplus for last year. Apphcation of the same principles would show a very substantial surplus in his current estimates.",67,General Adjusted Rates Of Tax Individuals

180,Mr Wentworthi Would Hope That,"Tbird, while the fight against inflation is still important, it is no longer our top economic priority. Under present circumstances our top priority is acuon to ward off a slump which has been brought on by an unhealthy pre-occupation with the inflation problem. Unless we deal with mounting unemployment and gathering business bankruptcy we can find ourselves face to face with an economic and social collapse, which, however much it may be relished by those whose avowed aim is the destruction of the whole fabric of our society, must surely be abhorrent to men of goodwill. Measures against inflation, which are already too sustained and toorigorous,will, if continued, produce this collapse. It is no use our economic doctors telling us that the operation was a success but the patient did not have the strength to survive it. Ourfirstconcern must be the survival of the patient-the AustraUan nation. For those 3 reasons I do not think it at all irresaccept that. WhatI do say is that if that were true ponsible to envisage a further reduction in taxation in this Budget. Such a reduction might weU produce a cash 'deficit', which would not only be an acceptable way of relieving bank Uquidity, but would also leave a substantial real surplus on any normal accounting principles in the Budget where capital expenditure is not charged in total against revenue. No, the nresponsibtiity would not Ue in tax reduction. Rather it would he in the continuance of the credit squeeze and related measures, which have already brought the AustraUan economy to the verge of coUapse and which are spreading a wave of unemployment far worse than this generation of Australians has ever known. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. foUow a number of honourable members from both sides who have dealt with the economic issues as they see them, pointing out the problems of AustraUa and the solutions that they put forward to those problems. I propose to take a somewhat different approach tonight. In the fairly short period of time avaUable to me I intend to deal in particular with the assistance given in the Budget to the State of Queensland. In Queensland we have a Country-Liberal Party Government. This Government and in particular the Premier, the Honourable Johannes BjelkePetersen, have been constant critics of the AustraUan Government since the very day it was elected. It is accused of being parsimonious and mean to the the State of Queensland. It is constantly suggested whenever Commonwealth money has been given to the States that this Government is doing no less than would be expected, that it is merely returning to the people of Queensland the money that they have paid in revenue. Of course, that is in part true. On the other hand there has been a whole range of suggestions that the Commonwealth should be doing more to cut back expenditure. I have heard it argued severaltimesin this House in the course of this debate that expenditure should be cut back. But of course the great dilemma is: In which area do you cut back expenditure? I have not heard any suggestion that expenditure to the States should be cut back, either to Queensland or to any other State. There seems to be some concept that expenditure in private enterprise is more worth whUe and less inflationary than expenditure in public enterprise. The proposition is always advanced that the money spent in State activities gives a greater return to the people than the money spent in activities of the Commonwealth. I do not surely a great deal of money that the Commonwealth is voting in this Budget by way of direct grants to the States must be well spent. I therefore propose to deal with some of the major areas in which assistance has been increased to Queensland under this Government. Once again in this Budget, following the pattern of the previous Budget, the greatest single area of increase is for education. If one looks at the grants to universitiesI propose to compare the ngures for the last complete year of the rule of the former Liberal-Country Party Government in 1971-72 with the proposals for the current year-the comparisons in terms of generosity to the State of Queensland must be obvious. inflation? on? I think that we all accept that there has been a certain measure of inflation around, and rather more than any of us would have hoped for. I felt that the honourable member for MackeUar( Mr Wentworth) suggested in some aspects of his speech that there was something wrong with providing for inflation in the Estimates of the current Budget. Any Australian government bringing down a Budget at thistimethat failed to provide for inflation, which extends not only to this country but also to the rest of the world, would be irresponsible indeed, particularly in those areas in which the States depend so much on Commonwealth revenue if they are to carry out their activities.",68,General Adjusted Rates Of Tax Individuals

183,Mr Cross,"May I deal with that a little laterIn 1971-72 the Commonwealth provided grants for universities totalling $ 11 m. In this year ment. During the election campaign in May Mr the Commonwealth is providing over $53m. I accept the fact that there is an offset of $7,800,000 arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States, so the actual increase in Commonwealth assistance for Queensland would be $7,800,000 less than $53m. In 1971-72, the last Budget of the Liberal-Country Party Government, the Commonwealth provided $5,636,000 in grants for colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges. The amount proposed for this year is $34,565,000, a handsome increase. The grants for technical education in 1971-72 totalled $1,238,000 as compared with an amount this year of $6,815,000. Of course, this is a new area of Commonwealth involvement. I think we would all agree, following the report of the Kangan Committee on Technical and Further Education, that one of the great contributions being made by the Australian Government towards education at the moment is the much needed expansion into the field of technical education. In 1971-72 the amount voted for the State of Queensland in grants for schools was $7,955,000. In the current year it is proposed that $56,838,000 be spent. That is for both government and non-government schools. If we extract from that the non-government schools we find that in 1971-72 an amount of $5,604,000 was paid and in the current year it is proposed to pay $19,107,000. In housing, which is another problem area, the amount has doubled from $10,500,000 to $20,900,000. Let me refer to roads. Last week the Queensland Government was threatening to sack people in the Main Roads Department in Brisbane because of the lack of funds. The money made available to the Queensland Government for roads this year will be $71,457,000 as against $45,360,000 in the last year of the Liberal-Country Party Government. I turn now to payments for natural disasters. I do not pretend that this is something on which one can make a a comparison year by year because it depends upon what the current disaster happens to be. In 1971-72 Queensland received $6,889,000 as compared with $26,100,000 proposed to be spent this year as a carry-on from the $27,859,000 provided in 1973-74 because of the great disasters that hit Queensland, other States and other parts of northern Australia at that time. A new area of expenditure is urban pubhc transport. In this year's Estimates an amount of $7,757,000 is provided by way of assistance to the Government of Queensland. I would like to expand the discussion on that aspect for the moHooper, the State Minister for Transport, made much play in the Press in Brisbane about the fact that the Commonwealth was strong on words but not very strong on deeds. He said that money had been promised for urban public transport but that none of it was forthcoming. The documents associated with the Budget Speech point out that some of this money would have been paid earlier if the legislation had been passed through the House. The States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Bill was introduced in this place on 4 April 1974. That Bill lapsed when the double dissolution took place almost a week later and it was put before the Parliament when it resumed in July. Mr Hooper was either deficient in the information provided by his Department or completely uninformed on this question because it was in no way the fault of this Government that the money was not flowing under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) legislation prior to the present time. Let me mention some items of interest so far as assistance to the State of Queensland is concerned. Provided in the Estimates this year will be $1.2m for the first part of stage 2 of the Wynnum public nursing home. It is estimated that only $300,000 of that will be spent in the current year. There is a grant for community health facilities and servicesa new program commenced by this Government. The amount of $5,129,000 has been paid. Again we have evidence of the approach of the Queensland Government. There are places in Queensland where community health centres are being built with Commonwealth money. Of course, they are being opened by the State Ministers and bwlt by the State departments. No credit at all is being given to the Commonwealth Government. It has been said of several of these: 'We intended to do this anyway.' Even if that were true, the fact that this large amount of Austrahan Government money is now available is surely a great help to the people who will benefit from the presence of these medical centres. Another new program provided for in this Budget is the school dental schemea scheme where the training of dental nurses commenced at the beginning of 1973. The program is now expanding. When the Labor Party looked at the question of what could be done in the field of dental health some years ago it was put to us by the Australian Dental Association that the most constructive thing we could do was to ensure that every child in the course ofhis or her primary or secondary education was given adequate dental treatment and taught the principles of proper care of their teeth. It was said that if at the end of their compulsory schooling we turned out teenagers with healthy sets of teeth we would be getting better value for the expenditure of public money than we could get in any other area of dental health. That may be a question for debate but the fact of the matter is that for this new program from which we expect great things $3,852,000 has been provided for Queensland in the current Budget. The grant for health education campaigns is increased from $48,000 in 1971-72 to $160,000 this current nnancial year. The proposed expenditure relates primarily to new programs concerning drug abuse and smoking, both very much matters of enthusiasm for the Minister for Health, the honourable Doug Everingham, the honourable member for Capricornia. Of course, in this particular area of health education, considerable amounts of money have been given to private organisations quite apart from the Health Education Council. In 1971-72 the government of the day prosupport vided $91,000 as grants for senior citizens Commonwealth money for this project. The first centres.

An amount of $880,000 is provided for the Glenlyon Dam which will affect not only Queensland but also New South Wales because it is adjacent to the border. Provision is made for $2m for the Julius Dam at Mount Isa. For the second stage of the Ross River Dam $2.56m is provided of which it is expected that $600,000 will be spent this year. A further $2.5m is provided for the Eton Irrigation scheme near Mackay. The sum of $315,000 is proposed for the Fairbairn Dam and $454,855 for the Dawson River weirs. Mr Speaker, I am sure you will remember that the Burdekin River Dam was an area of controversy in North Queensland for many years. Prior to the 1949 election the late E. M. Hanlon, the Premier of Queensland, approached the then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, for assistance for this work. Assistance was promised. The former leader of the Country Party who, at that time, was the member for DarUng Downs, the honourable Artie Fadden, pledged Commonwealth for the Burdekin River Dam. The money now being provided is the first reflection of works on the Burdekin River. Of course I accept the fact that we are not building the BurAnother major concern for all Queenslanders and those people interested in the beef industry Other Commonwealth programs in Queensland should be mentioned because major items of expenditure are involved. I was happy last year to see that $122,000 was spent on the flood warning system in the Brisbane River Valley.

For the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation an amount of $1,070,000 is provided for afisheriesresearch laboratory at Cleveland Point and an additional $779,000 for the Indooroopilly-Long Pocket laboratories. Much of the research carried out in the latter laboratories is devoted to the very important beef industry. In the Budget provision is made for the expening and the like. Of course expenditure on dediture of $2,774,112 to complete the Taringa fence matters is important to the security of Kingsholme Rehabilitation Centre.

But in a television repair shop for 6 months. It cannot be repaired because parts are completely unprocurable. The Government has a novel way of dealing with that problem: In this Budget, postage has been made so excessive and phone calls so expensive that I cannot even write to or ring my Federal member to complain about the situation. I cannot drive to see my Federal member because in Queensland no fuel is available to put in my car. coming from the honourable gentleman's supporters in the back. very stirred up about the whole situation. So honourable members can see that not everyone is wildly enthusiastic about the abolition of television licences. Television sets are inoperative and, anyway, are unrepairable at this time. I wish to quote from the 'Australian Taxpayer' of 28 September 1974. What it states cannot be refuted. Referring to the Budget, it says: When introducing the Government's financial plan for payers face when they are confronted by de1974-75, Mr Crean said that the Labor Party stands mands for information from the Taxation Office. readyI like that; he stood ready last year and he is there is a confrontation, where are the big guns? standing ready again this year. . during the year to take action on the expenditure side or revenue side of the Budget to give a quick stimulus to established basis of valuation which can be demand and employment. The comment is this, and I agree with it: Only a fool would read into that anything less than a resolve to further increase Government spending and to The Treasurer said that capital losses will be alfinance it from even more tax this financial year if the private lowed. Then we see how they wiU be allowed. sector is hit so hard that employment falls beyond the Capital gains, of course, are added straight on to present post-war record low.

I do not call tunately, in the minority in the Labor Caucus. I that deductibility. I call that a confidence trick. do say that the tax istil-conceivedand vicious and it will be abolished by the Liberal and Country Parties when they come back to office. I should like to say something about the capigains tax. It says that capital gains tax inhibits tal gains tax. This is somewhat difficult. What a risk taking. Of course it does. Under this tax, if a situation we are in.

The Treasurer ( Mr Crean) difficulties and his productivity is lessened and said that he wtil let drop from time to time employment also suffers. There are particular crumbs of information whenever somebody gets problems on death. I do not want to say too a bright idea. What a way to run a government. much about them. The Budget statements tell us What sort of Budget is that to bring into the that assets subject to the tax wUl be deemed to Houses of the Parliament? What sort of plan is have been sold immediately before death and a that to put before the people of Australia? What a way to introduce such a new impost about which so many conflicting interpretations have been circulated. At this stage if we want to find out how the capital gains tax operates in relation to trust and partnerships and other aspects we just have to wait. I have tried to find out and I know my statement is true. The system has not yet been estabUshed or worked out. So, what can we say about the capital gains tax. There are one or two things we can say. One thing is abundantly clear. Because death is deemed as a disposal, within 2 generations I beUeve that it wUl mean the end of the famUy farm. There is tremendous confusion as to how the value is to be established on Budget or valuation day. It is all very well for the Government and the taxation authorities to say that they rely on the honesty of the taxpayer and accept his declared value. That is veryfinein theory, but we all know the worry and concern that many taxr They are not exactly pubUc relations exercises. If They are on the side of the Taxation Office.

186,Mr Adermann,"Well, they are naturallyfew minutes after death the death duty man puts his shovel into what is left. night from the honourable member for Brisbane about what this Government has done in regard to education. He did not tell us what the Government had done to the concession that is allowed to the taxpayer for educauon expenses. That cut alone takes away any tax cut the taxpayer gets. Cutting the maximum claim from $400 to $ 150 a year is unreasonable and stupid. It is unreasonable and stupid for a number of reasons. Is there anyone here who honestly beheves that $ 150 will anywhere near cover the costs of uniforms of children going to government schools, let alone cover all the other things that must be provided under the free educauon scheme? reduction is unwise because it will penalise country children. Country children very often are condemned because they go to the despised private schools. Do honourable members know why? They do so because it is the only place they can go. They do not have the facilities in the country for secondary education. They have to go to these private schools and be boarded at them. What sort of deduction do they receive$ 150. mon decency to mention the isolated children's allowance? member for Fisher will resume his seat for a moment There are far too many interjections from both sides of the House and I ask them to cease. isolated children's allowance. I am not arguing with the Minister for Education ( Mr Beazley) on that aspect at all. I am trying to show the inequity of a deduction which takes away the tax remission for a start. It imposes penalties which I foresee could mean that some children who are now in non-government schools will be forced to go to government schools. If that happens this Government will find that the public sector will have to provide a lot more capital for buildings, teachers' wages and teacher training. I am very alarmed that the Government also hits the self-education expenses. This is something which the Liberal-Country Party fought for for years and eventually introduced. I do not think the deduction of $400 was enough. The deduction is now to be cut back to $ 150. What does it mean? It gives 2 choices-Hobson' s and Buckley's. Either students abandon their course half way through or they meet yet another unforeseen expense-the extra tax that Canberra wants. I wish to say also what this Budget did not do. This Budget did not keep faith with a campaign promise of the Labor Party in 2 elections. The campaign promise was made to the older people, the pan pensioners. The Government promised-ever y promise was specifically under a certain timetable-that it would further remove the means test. Now it is deferred until next autumn. It was made as an election promise twice. If there was an election tomorrow the Government would promise to do so again. Let us look at the Government's priorities. It talks about its expenditure. The pensioners and the people who were relying on this promise now know where the Government puts them in its order of priority. They know that for all the fine words of the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) he has allocated them a priority that can be pushed off"" until next autumn, provided it does not have to be pushed off again. We now know the worth ofhis promises. If anyone has to wait apparently it has to be these people-the people to whom he made promises and the people he betrayed. Never let that man come into this House again with his pretty words and pious sentiments because he has established his priorities and his credibilities in this Budget.

In fact, I wonder if they dare go on the hustings and promulgate the virtue of it anywhere else. Certainly with the chopping and changing that we have seen to date one would wonder-""where its virtues are when it has had to be changed so radically in such a short time and before the discussion on the Budget has yet concluded in the national Parliament. I have much pleasure in supporting the this sort of attitude expressed continually in this amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr debate. Honourable members opposite have Snedden). He has accepted a responsibility in spoken as if we were the Government, as though respect of this nation and has brought to pubhc we had the responsibiUty for making these deattention the matters that we all know and hear cisions and as though we were the people who about as we go from place to place and as expreshad to put these decisions into effect. That is not sed in the very firm terms that we see in his the case. If the present Government runs its full amendment. That amendment expresses the term in office it should introduce a number of concern of the Australian people for our future other Budgets after this one. One is entitled to and our welfare. The amendment bears repeatlook at the Budget, not at what the Opposition is ing because it covers the very important matters doing. The Opposition is not the Goverament at that face this nation. The amendment states: this House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic crisis, in that: (1) unemployment is permitted to grow and the prospect for school leavers is prejudiced, (2) inflation is accelerated, (3) existing poverty is ignored and new poverty is created, (4) personal income tax is increased by 45 percent, (5) living standards will be lowered, (6) private enterprise is stifled, (7) Government power is further centralised, (8) individual incentive and thrift is penalised, and (9) a double tax is levied on estates; I support the amendment because of the state of The AustraUan community is in no different posthe economy in AustraUa at present and because ition to this.

I refer honourafford we would cut out. That is not a responsible able members to the first few Unes of the Budget approach. It is a most irresponsible approach speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Crean). He said: We share with all our major trading partners problems of economic management unparalleled in modern times. It is a very serious statement. Even though the has been quoted more than it has been quoted Treasurer acknowledges the strains which our for a longtime.I do not know why. I would like nation suffers, he gives us only a simple Budget to quote from an editorial that deals with setting. The Treasurer does not mention in any Government spending.

There is no setting in which a business, a worker or any other person can advance himself or see the way in which he wUl advance himself in the future The attitude of the Minister who preceded me in this debate, the Minister for the Capital Territory was to ask the Opposition what it would do if it were in government and to ask where the Opposition would cut expenditure. I have heard thistimeand does not have the responsibility to advance an alternative. It is not that the Opposition is not capable of advancing an alternative. When one examines expenditure of this nature and the matters that are dealt with, be they education, social reform-particularl y the Australian assistance plan which is something I personally commend-o r urban development and sewerage, one is reminded of the position of an individual. When I go home to my wife she seems always to want more money because she wants to do something-perhap s she would like to buy a new dress or buy something for our little daughter. from a government.

I would endorse those comments as I think every in the eyes of the Australian people. It would honourable member on this side of the House highlight in their minds the way in which this would endorse them.

208,Mr Ruddock,"That has nothing to do with tives are now endangered. Instead of progressing steadilythought. It prompted me to think about the nature of this Budget. It was not so long ago, 1972, when a Budget was produced by members who now sit on the Opposition side of the House. I do not propose to quote from the speech that the present Leader of the Opposition made on that occasion, although one honourable member on the other side of the House did. It is pertinent. I read the speech of the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), the Prime Minister as he now is. I felt that it was worth looking at bis speech to see what he was saying then about the nature of a budget. I direct honourable members opposite to read that speech, because so much of what is being said now, although not quoted directly from that speech, is what the Prime Minister was saying ought to be done by a government. These comments seem so pertinent, do they not? I quote from page 510 of Hansard of August 1972. The present Prime Minister then said: Last year's Budget was presented as the ultimate in all Minister's remarks. On page 512 of the House of economic wisdom. So, of course, was this year's. Last year there was even a proud declaration headed: 'The Budget Representatives Hansard of August 1972 the Strategy'. It proclaimed in ringing tones: We see it as a critically important objective of our policy to combat the inflationary forces now running in our econredistribution of the tax burden. omy. This Budget sets out no strategy. The comparable heading this year is reduced to a modest 'Philosophy and Objecman who leads the Government that has tives'That is far more fitting than the heading 'The Budget Setting' that we see in the Budget before usthough philosophy or objectives are hard indeed to discover. speech the Prime Minister said: Instead of a declaration of war against inflation, or unemployment, we are merely told confidentially: 'In looking at the year ahead the government has in mind a number of considerations'. This relatively modest tone, this retreat from rhetoric, is I suppose the most we can hope for; the nearest we can hope to get to a confession of failure from the Treaurer. On his own admission, he has failed in what he called 'the critically important objective to combat inflationary forces'. How apt these comments are. He says now: 'A modest abatement of inflationary trends lem. Yet there are commanding economic reasons why such has been achieved'. How modest is shown by comparing this an attack should have been made this year. year's Speech with last year's. In last year's Speech he said: 'By the June quarter of 1971 the underlying rate of increase An attack should have been made this year, but in prices was above 6 per cent'. Last Tuesday he said: 'In the it was not. We saw in this Budget an attempt to year to the June quarter of 1972 the increase was still far too stifle thrift with a most iniquitous super-tax or high at 6.1 per cent'. Some reduction! Some achievement! surcharge on so-called unearned income. Other Where are the interjections now from the honourable members opposite, as we near a rate of inflation of some 14 per cent which is likely to be some 20 per cent, about the sorts of problems that we face now? The Prime Minister's comments seemed so apt on that occasion perhaps. How much more apt do they seem to honourable members opposite now? I am ashamed that I can come into this House as a new member and have to debate a document that clearly has no intention of dealing with the problems that we will face in the future. We are debating a budget that talks about tax concessions in the most remarkable terms. I refer honourable members to the Treasurer's statements on page 30 of the Budget Speech. He spoke so glibly about these matters when he said: Taken together, our tax measures constitute major reforms. They will make the tax system fairer and more equitable. The great majority of wage and salary earners, and especially low-income single-income families, will pay less tax as a result. I suppose that the voices of honourable members opposite will herald that as well as a major reform. I would like to refer them back to the speech of the Prime Minister from which I quoted. Perhaps the reason why they are so silent now is that they recall his words then about taxation. In the time remaining to me I would like to quote the Prime Prime Minister is recorded as saying: A mere reduction in the rate of tax increase is not real What a magnificent comment that is from the introduced such a Budget as we are now debating and has made so Uttle reform. He is the man who criticised, quite aptly perhaps, what I beUeve were major attempts to bring about a major change in our tax structure at thattime.In his Nothing has been done to attack the real problem of middle income earners paying taxes at rates set for high income earners. The equivalent of $5,000 18 years ago was a high income; it is an exceptionally modest income today. But the $5,000 a year man today is taxed as if he were the wealthy man of 18 years ago-becaus e the system remains unchanged. It remains unchanged today. He continued: The new scales just do not attack that fundamental probproposed taxes wtil stifle initiative. The Prime Minister himself by his own tax planning in sending his wife out to work has demonstrated quite clearly that the only lurk left is to have 2 income earners in the famUy and to have an income division.

We have high productivity, vast natural resources and a great capacity to expand. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) and his myrmidons loudly proclaim that they have all the nostrums and cures for inflation, but they have not offered even one specific and assessable technique of any sort to control it. I was reminded of them when I read the following extract in an article in the magazine 'Newsweek' of 30 September at page 32: But even with occasional bright spots, the truth is that the United States of America regarding the Central economies of the US in particular and most of the countries of the Western world in general are seriously ill-and Intelligence Agency.

I do not know whether the people would you cut your expenditure if you were in who have written to me will fall into the tax government?' The honourable member for Parbracket that wUl enable them to escape from this ramatta ( Mr Ruddock) eloquently answered this net but I believe many will be on the borderline, vexatious quesuon. It is hardly our responsibUity even if this tax is altered, and wUl be hit hard. but during the election campaign in May we The letter reads: proposed a $600m tax cut. However because of Dear Mr Drummond, price and wage escalations since then that amount may have been much greater had we been in a position to bring down this Budget.

I beUeve that with the Government spending at the rate it is currently spending we are endeavouring to live beyond our means. I appreciate that we all want to see facUities and benefits maximised to the greatest extent but we are Uving beyond our means.

But, then, perhaps it would not be would go bankrupt before Christmas. That was the State having to take over the land because it would be impossible for free enterprise or individuals to carry on with the farming. One must remember also that we are going through a time. I wish to turn very briefly to the rural scene. There have been many speeches made, and made very well, by members of the Liberal PartyI hasten to congratulate the Government for ing farmers. They sat around the table. After their round table informal meeting, they came to",84,General Adjusted Rates Of Tax Individuals
220,Mr Giles,Sinc e the great depression.,86,General Adjusted Rates Of Tax Individuals
221,Mr Drummond,"Since the great depresthe conclusion drawn in good faith by these people. That is the concern uppermost in their minds in their neck of the rural area. If anywhere near this type of calamity occurs, who is going to buy the farms? Who will take them over? What will happen to production in Australia? Its very life blood still comes from rural areas. What will happen to the very prosperity of our country? The sooner the Federal Government recognises that there is a dangerous situation on our hands, the better. I believe that it should recognise that it is a temporary situation and that the wheel of fortune will turn, although I would not know how long it would take to do so in the beef industry. Be it 12 months, 18 months or 2 years, I have no doubt that the rest of the world will once again be eagerly seeking beef and protein from Australia and the other countries which can produce it. Those countries seeking beef will be able to pay for it. As the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) pointed out to the United Nations in the course of his cunent trip, we have a responsibility to produce. At the moment, these farmers basically need finance to get them through this difficulttime.I know of some instances of farmers being forced to sell their stock to meet their commitments. Others are finding it impossible to borrow money to pay to have their sheep shorn. I cannot remember a time when the farmer could not get finance to harvest his wool clip when he is so close to getting his return and paying back the money that thefinancierhas lent him. That is how bad the liquidity situation is. It is no consolation to the rural community to realise that the rest of the private sector is so deeply in trouble. I make the plea to the Government to recognise that the private sector is facing a Uquidity situation which is now forcing people in different spheres of that sector-no t only the smaU farmer-to sell up their businesses at whatever price they can get and to try to make a new Ufe wherever they can. AustraUa needs free enterprise. Free enterprise demand for goods, which results in high costs has given us our prosperity, provided 75 per cent and inflation.

Therefore he does not deserve the criticism that I would level against any member of the Opposition who had been rather sadistic in his criticism of my Government. I hope that the honourable member for Forrest continues with the modest criticism of the Government, because that is the role of the Opposition. When he reaches the stage of going overboard I think the members on this side of the House can curb his unjustified, bitter and sadistic criticism. I wtil be in the forefront in doing so on behalf of my Party. I wholeheartedly support the Budget. I congratulate my Government on its introduction. I beUeve it is perfectly tatiored to suit the times in our nation and throughout the western world. It might be a bit difficult tofityou with anything. I am grateful for the Government's endeavour and concern in trying to curb the economic monster that has enveloped the western world at this time.

I hope that thosetimeshave gone in AustraUa and I know they have in the opinion of all my party members. It can be truly said that a shorttimeago there was over-employment.

234,Mr James,"Let him ask himself. Social serProvision has been made to improve sewerage in the capital cities. Provision has been made to build Austrahan Government hospitals in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne to overcome the lag in the provision of hospital beds. This should be commended even by the tory Opposition. The hospital care subsidy for approved hospitals for the aged is to be raised from $12 to $15 for those who are bedridden or semi-bedridden. Meals on Wheels subsidies are to be increased from 20c to 25c. I applaud my Government in particular for its humane outlook toward those who have the unfortunate circumstance of having a physically handicapped child. Only last week a lady in my electorate, 50 years of age, a small frail woman, told me that she has to sponge, care for and help her 32 year old son out of bed, onto the toilet, and to walk about the house. The allocation of $10 a week to people like that indicates the humanitarianism that the Government displays in its policies. The national family planning program-somethin g that was lacking under tory administration-is to get $425,000. Mr Les Johnson-It is a pity it was not made retrospective. so many foolish interjections if it had been. To my mind this is a great thing because it will eliminate the sordidness of illegal abortions about which honourable members know I have spoken in this House on a number of occasions. It will eliminate the backyard abortionist or butcher. I turn now to the provision for the Structural Adjustment Board. Imagine a tory government providing $11.8m to assist employees displaced by government decisions. Such a scheme could never have been introduced by a tory government because it would have immediately met with repercussions from big business and the Chambers of Manufactures, which form the backbone of the Opposition's support. Repatriation benefits are to be upgraded. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are to get an initial $ 14m to overcome their housing problems. In urban development, as I said, $390m is to be provided for sewerage. How can any fair minded person say that this is not the ideal Budget to meet the needs of the Australian people at this time? I thought the Mimster for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) slaughtered the Opposition this morning in the debate on uranium. The Opposition wants uramum to be under the control of private enterprise. I honestly and sincerely believe that that is not the view of the Opposition but is the result of the Opposition yielding to the pressures of the multinationals and gigantic mining companies who have subsidised its election expenses. I can well understand that when people put themselves in the hands of those people they can be politically blackmailed. I feel sorry for the Opposition in allowing itself to get into such a position. In the discussion this morning my mind went back to the action of Sir Robert Menzies the result of which he has to bear during the whole ofhis pohtical career. The wharf labourers defied the tories and thenforeign policy in refusing to load pig-iron on the eve of the Japanese-German war against the Allies. The wharf labourers' actions proved to be correct. They said: 'We will not load it because we will get it back in guns and in the bodies of our soldiers'. How right they were. This is what free enterprise would do if it had the whole and sole control of Australia's uranium. Particularly at thistimein the world's history the export of uranium should not be taken from the control of the Australian Government. I believe that the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said in the United Nations that Australia would not export uranium to any country that had not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. We all know that the bombs that can be produced by the great powers of the world today can destroy the fabric of the earth. We know from the lectures of Linus Pauling, the great American nuclear physicist, that a 20 megaton bomb exploded 5 miles above the earth has such a killing effect, that every Uving thing is destroyed within a radius of 50 mties and very few people survive within a radius of 100 miles. One can visualise that a 20 megaton bomb dropped over Katoomba would destroy Wollongong, Sydney, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Bathurst and Orange. Some honourable members laugh when these serious things are raised and when one mentions that uranium should be controlled. The Opposition was reminded in the discussion this morning that it was the tory Government, the present Opposition, that introduced the Atomic Energy Act. The previous Government made provision in that Act, as was so effectively pointed out by the Minister for Minerals and Energy this morning, that uranium shall remain the property of the Commonwealth. But as I said, the Opposition is under the pressure of big business and the mining companies who want to reef uranium out of the ground and get an exorbitant profit irrespective of what is done with it or what it could be worth after 1980. We know that the price of uranium wUl treble or quadruple. I believe that it is the proper attitude of the Minister for Minerals and Energy to intend",88,General Adjusted Rates Of Tax Individuals
235,Mr James,"Yes. There might not have beento recommend to Cabinet that we set up a uranium enrichment plant in the Northern Territory. It would be a great thing for the Northern Territory. The Minister pointed out that in their search for uranium the mining companies spent a mere $12m and that the success of their search undoubtedly would have depended on the preliminary research done by the Bureau of Mineral Resources of Australia which is controlled by this Parliament and paid for by the Australian taxpayer.JBut on the other hand the estimated value of the uramum on present world prices is $7,000m. So what is a mere $12m? We know that the nuning companies use this argument in the ears of those who are not knowledgeable in politics and they get a very patient hearing when they say that they had spent $12m searching for uranium and that the Government will not let them develop it. That sounds very good but when it is pointed out to them, as some of us do point out when we go to other parts of AustraUa, it is a mere bagatelle when the value of uranium is$7,000m. I would Uke to have said something tonight on the power of multinationals, as my rnind was prompted by the very sincere speech of my friend, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). We have been criticised for our attitude to multinationals but I hope that some day the AustraUan people wtil approve an assets tax being introduced in this ParUament. The present British Labour Government intends to do this in the foreseeable future because of the gluttonous wealth stiU in private hands. member's time has expired. interesting to foUow the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). I sat here listening to his incoherent waffle, listening to him lurching from point to point Uke a rubber duck and trying to fill out thetimeto the end of his speech by talking about uranium. When the honourable member's time had almost expired he wanted to talk about multinationals and a few other things which had equaUy Uttle reference to the Budget. It now becomes apparent why the proceedings of this House are not broadcast on the 3 sitting days because it would be rather unfair to project such stuff to the AustraUan pubUc. It is equally obvious that the management of this House is such that non-broadcast days are left for members like the honourable member for Hunter to have their rip. cause the debate is to be interrupted at 10.30 tonight. After hearing what was contained in this Budget one wonders how supporters of the Government can with all honesty go to the pubs in their electorates and stand up to their fellow men. The Budget is an absolute disgrace. The apologists for the Budget have been digging around in the back pages of the Budget papers for some sort of inspiration, for some good points that they can dig up to bring into this House, some good points that they can try to get across to their supporters, to the people to whom they have had to hand out so many sops. We hear them talk about the Budget being a social justice and welfare Budget. This Budget is an economic and social disaster. We need to look at it in some sort of perspective. We have to be able to look at it in the Ught of what the problems facing this country are and were at the time when it was drawn up. The things that were crippling AustraUa then, as they are today in a greater degree, were inflation, unemployment, crippUng interest rates and so many other perpetrations by this Government since it has been in power. What has the Government done? Having fought 2 elections in December 1972 and May 1974 at which the Government promised what it would and would not do, it now comes in and introduces a Budget which is based on Liberal and Country Party policy which was rejected by the electorate in May of 1974. The Government has based its Budget policy and strategy on tax cuts and tax cuts were the central theme of the Liberal and Country Parties when they went to the polls. We did not hear a word about tax cuts from the Government during the elections. The Government went to the polls talking about full employment. It said that it would not use unemployment. But what has the Government done? It is presiding over the greatest degree of unemployment that we have ever seen in this country. It makes the policies of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) on unemployment look like kindergarten material. The policy of the Budget is so confused. The Budget strategy has been completely confused and it has been completely rejected by the Government already. Within a week of the Budget being brought down we have seen such significant alterations to the strategy as $ 150m having to be found for wool funds because the Government believed that it was politically in its own interests to reverse its decision to try to get that money provided by the trading banks or alternatively by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

We have had a devaluation of the AustraUan currency by 12 per cent, and this from a Government which swore black and blue that the value of Austraha's currency was the cornerstone of its economic pohcy. We have had an overnight turn around. There is no discussion with anybody; it is just done. Let us sincerely hope for the future of AustraUa in world markets that this arbitrary figure of 12 per cent that the Government has picked is a correctfigurebecause if it is not the decision wUl do AustraUa irreparable harm. We have the Regional Employment and Development program which the Mmister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) proudly refers to as the RED program. Red indeed! This is a $20m proposal to pump money in to cure the massive levels of unemployment that have been created in a mere 20 months under this Government. As I said earUer-and I say again-whe n sectors of the economy are brought to their knees the rescue operations cost so much more than the cost of keeping the economy in some reasonable state of stimulation so that the problem does not arise at aU. What about the Caucus committee which is dictating to the Government? The honourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) walked mto the House after dinner one night and member has not been here for very long and I announced that a certain tax announced by the inform him that the remark that he has just used Government in its Budget had been roUed. right, as my friend from Chisolm points out.

How can the Government expect to be able to improve the lot of citizens? AU that it is doing is creating some massive book entries which wUl be brought to account before very long. We are asked where cuts should be made in taxes and government expenditure. Everyone on the Government side says: 'Where would you make these cuts?' I wUl teU them where I would start and they should Usten to this because it wUl be good stuff. I would stan with the natural gas pipeline. I would cut that out and put it back into the hands of private enterprise where it belongs. What about the arts?

We are talking about $4m that has been spent this week on statues and ceUings that wtil probably break up when they are moved. We have purchased the paintings 'WomanV and 'Blue Poles'. Where are we going to stop? This Government is blowing money down the drain and is trying to present some sort of avant-garde image to the world. What about unemployment payments? The Government having created unemployment is creating a system whereby anyone who vaguely looks as if he is unemployed is able to receive unemployment benefits.

The Grants think that this appointment can pass without my Commission is well known to the House. I bemaking a reference to it. Ueve it was touched upon in a passing manner in a debate which occurred yesterday. The Commission has operated in AustraUa for more than require? 40 years. It has been a body which has pursued a most creditable path and has a valuable record. In fact, pre-eminently it has been a body quite unique to AustraUa. From the early days its task in finance. He needs some understanding of has been to pursue principles of equaUty between interstate finance and economics. Certainly, he the States. It is often termed 'fiscal equaUty'.

Some very famous Commission. AU this is a respectable background people have preceded Mr Justice Else-Mitchell for a body which is worthy of the respect that has been given to it. I am concerned that a new appointment has been made to the Grants Commission. The new appointment-probabl y to the most complex economic body in AustraUa-is of a New South Wales judge. His name I understand is ElseMitchella nicely hyphenated name. Judge ElseMitchell has been appointed as Chairman of the Commission-as Chairman of a body for which he has had no training. He has exhibited no knowledge as to the principles of operation of this body. His appointment is in stark contrast to other appointments which have been made to the Commission during the last 8 or 9 years. I believe that his appointment has been a simple mistake. To appoint a man whose expertise is almost wholly in the law to the chairmanship of a most complex body of this type is rather Uke appointing an accountant to a supreme court. In another way, it is rather like appointing an economist to the High Court of Australia.

250,Mr Cohen (Robertson) (10.40),"On 25The report has only just become available in printed form and it is appropriate that I should, at this time, bring it to the attention of all people ing and town planning. This area is one which is interested in road safety. It was myfirstexperience in chairing a House committee and I was dehghted with the work of both the staff and the members of that Committee. While I was Chairman of the Committee we sat on 33 occasions and held pubhc hearings in all the capital cities. During these public hearings evidence was received from 115 witnesses and 3,600 pages of evidence was taken. One of the sharp distinctions between committee work and debates of the House of Representatives is the degree of unanimity one can achieve in a committee although the Committee consisted of members of all political philosophies represented in the Parhament We were able to resolve these difficulties and come up with a unanimous report that I beheve has far reaching consequences for this country and for its citizens. The great problem that we face in our society today is that the motor vehicle has been imposed upon a system which was never designed for a motor vehicle, certainly not the five and a half million motor vehicles that are present in Australia today. Seventy years ago, no one would have foreseen the growth in motor vehicle usage. Thirty years ago, our planners failed to foresee what was likely to happen and the result is a tangled mess that results in enormous wastage of resources and time, a massive loss of life, and large numbers of injured. The decisions that we make today will determine whether, by the turn of the century, we will have shown more foresight than did our forebears. We expect to build as many new communities during the next 25 years as we have in the past 200 years. We have a marvellous opportunity to learn from our failures of the past and to see that death and injury from the motor vehicle are reduced to a bare rninimum. The previous report and this report stress the need for an overaU systematic approach to the problems of road safety. The major aspect which has been dealt with in this report is the environmental side of the problem and covers such things as road design; construction and maintenance; the roadside environment; traffic engineering, including signs, signals and markings; town planning and the transport system, including alternatives to the private vehicle. Other aspects such as the vehicle, driver, law enforcement, care in the post-crash stage etc. wtil be covered in future reports of the Committee. This systematic approach is nowhere more appUcable than in thefieldof roads, road engineermost fruitful for effecting major reductions in road accidents. An improvement to the road will continue to save Uves for the whole life of the road, provided there is proper maintenance. Effective separation of vehicles from other vehicles and from pedestrians has the greatest possibUity of a major reduction in accidents. This can sometimes be done at a very low cost, such as by merely closing oft"" a road to traffic, creating a pedestrian mall or simply Umiting access to arterials. In other cases, town planning and land usage aimed at minimising the exposure to accidents can be achieved at no cost or even lower cost than their alternatives. The main ingredient is proper plarming. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads recommended that the Australian Government should contribute $2,607m for the provision of roads and highways for the next 5-year period. The Australian Government agreed to the Bureau of Roads recommendation, and a total of $6,608m wUl be spent by the States and the Australian Government during this period. With this in mind the Committee decided to bring forward this aspect of road safety so that the 2 reports could be considered together. Unfortunately, past history shows Commonwealth aid road grants have never been related in any way to safety features and we believe that it is the responsibUity of the Australian Government to use the power of direction it has through the Commonwealth aid road grants to ensure that the highest standards of safety are implemented. We were also conscious that the new Government has taken a more direct involvement in the development of new cities and growth centres and is working on blueprints for these areas at the moment. The Committee felt that the new Department of Urban and Regional Development and its offshoot, the Cities Commission, should be extremely aware of the need to plan the cities and to redevelop the old cities in such a way that there was a maximum separation of the vehicle from other vehicles and of the vehicle from the pedestrian. Throughout our hearings we were also made conscious of the fact that a large proportion of the developed areas are the responsibiUty of local councUs and private developers. Repeatedly, evidence was given to the Committee that local councUs lacked the technical expertise to design communities with the highest degree of road safety. Private developers who put forward to councUs imaginative although sometimes revolutionary new proposals which were designed with a high degree of road safety the principles in the Bureau of Roads report that found themselves obstructed rather than the AustraUan Government should proceed postencouraged by the rigid rules of local governhaste with the buUding of a highway system. ment authorities.

(Para. 83) porate in Hansard the recommendations of the Committee. no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)The Committee recommends that: Town Planning 1. The Australian Government should encourage State Planning Authorities and local government by technical assistance and, if necessary, by nnancial assistance to adopt safer and more efficient land use principles. Incentives should be introduced to encourage developers and local councils to adopt safer community designs. (Para. 59(a)) 2. A specialist secuon should be created in the Road Safety and Standards Authority (RSSA) to advise State Planning Authorities and local government on the safety aspects of development proposals. (Para. 59 (b)) 3. TheRSSAshouldFormulate safety standards for land use, town planning and road design; and seek ways of creating greater public acceptance of the desirability of and necessity for planning and building communities in which the vehicle and pedestrian are separated; for example, by the greater use of Radburn design principles, cluster housing estates. (Para. 59(c)) Roadside 4. The Australian Government shouldhelpfinancea program for widening shoulders of rural highways, the removal of obstacles and the planting of native shrubs or erection or growing of suitable barriers; implement a program to replace the current unsatisfactory guide post with a lightweight frangible post according to standards set by the RSSA; implement a program to extend the use of reflective paints and road marker discs of uniform colour and standard; help finance a program for undergrounding power supplies etc. especially in new developments and of moving poles in other areas. (Para. 78 (a)) 5. The RSSA should, in conjunction with other relevant authoritiesexamine the feasibility of a program for shifting poles back from the kerbside; research the benefits of using frangible poles at dangerous location; determine and set standards for quality, colour etc. for road marking paint, raised plastic discs and other traffic aids. (Para. 78 (b)) 6. The Postmaster-General's Department, wherever possible, should underground its services and should introduce such a program in older areas especially along major arterials carrying high speed traffic. (Para. 78 (c)) Traffic Management 7. The RSSA should devote increasing attention to promoting improved and more uniform traffic codes and traffic management. In particular, all signs should have a uniform meaning, their shape and detail uniform with consideration being given to making their symbolism more graphic and 8. The RSSA determine what types of traffic lights are the most effective in accident reduction, establish standards in terms of luminescence, colour, sequence of action etc. (Para. 9. The RSSA, in conjunction with other relevant authorities, seek ways of having types of traffic lights standardised throughout Australia and having them co-ordinated wherever possible. (Para. 88 (b)) 10. The Australian Government, through the RSSA, should arrange for pilot projects in each of the capital cities to test the effectiveness of concrete safety barriers at suitable locations. (Para. 91) 11. The greater use of clearways. (Para. 94) 12. The Australian Government should encourage the creation of pedestrian malls and precincts throughout Austraha by providing financial incentives. (Para. 101 (a)) 13. The RSSA should conduct a programme aimed at creating a greater community consciousness of the benefits of pedestrian malls and, through its advisory role with local councils, should encourage them to introduce pedestrian malls wherever possible. (Para. 101 (b)) Transport System 14. Wherever arterial roads close to the inner city are being considered, limited access ring roads should be encouraged by upgrading existing arterial or sub-arterial routes. (Para. 110(a)) 15. The concept of freeways radiating from inner city areas should be critically assessed by the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads (CBR) and the RSSA which should compare the benefit-cost advantages of urban freeways with low cost improvements to existing anerials, with a view to having a larger proportion of Australian Government funds allocated to upgrading existing main roads in urbanised areas. (Para. 110(b)) 16. The Australian Government should investigate sources of additional resources and resource re-allocation to enable the system of interstate highways and other urgent works to be completed as soon as possible. (Para. 115(a)) 17. The Australian Government should allocate more finance to enable bitumenisation of rural anerials which are at present surfaced with gravel or soil and to assist councils in maintaining such roads. (Para. 115(b)) 18. The Australian Government should consider increasing fuel tax to replace annual charges and to encourage more careful usage of the private vehicle and greater usage of public transpon. This would require that suitable financial and administrative arrangements be made with the States. (Para. 115(c)) Spot Improvements 19. The RSSA consider ways of extending the scope of black spot improvements by expanding the supply of special equipment, expertise, especially engineers, and other resources necessary to meet the full warranted programme of $154m recommended by the CBR together with any additional programmes disclosed by funher surveys. (Para. 128(a)) 20. The CBR examine ways of transferring resources from high cost, longer term, lower safety yielding projects, such as urban freeways, towards spot improvements. (Para. 128 (b)) 21. Further surveys be carried out by the relevant authorities with whatever assistance is required and possible of being provided by the RSSA and the CBR (Para. 128 (c))",93,Adjournment
251,Mr Speaker,"I s leave granted? There being 88(a))22. Additional grants should then be considered by the Australian Government for black spot surveys and for financing the required work. (Para. 128(d)) Street Lighting 23. The RSSA should investigate ways of extending improved lighting in urban areas, and the benefit and costs of extending improved lighting into rural areas. (Para. 139) New Approaches to Road Design 24. The Australian Government, through the RSSA, should arrange for thefinancingof pilot schemes in each capital city, to implement the designs and principles advanced by Mr Jay and Non-stop Urban Traffic Systems, involving interchanges and vertical grade separation. (Para. 151) Road Safety Education at Tertiary Level 25. The Australian Universities Comnussion and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education investigate the shortage of trained safety engineers in Australia with a view to encouraging new safety or safety-oriented units or courses at tertiary level. (Para. 155) Alternatives to the Motor Vehicle 26. The Australian Government shouldcontinue and extend its efforts to have public transport improved; stimulate research and development towards improving public transport technology being applied in Australia (Para. 164(a)) 27. The Depanment of Transpon should investigate other ways of encouraging motorists to transfer to public transport. (Para. 164(b)) 28. The RSSA, together with other relevant authorities, shouldinvestigate the safety aspects of permitting cyclists to use footpaths and other legislative changes which may be necessary to remove the cyclist from exposure; and examine ways of making more facilities available for pedal cyclists to encourage less car usage and create a safer environment for cyclists, especially children. (Para. 168) member's time has expired. (10.50)-There is very much that the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) has just said which I certainly would support and which I believe everybody in the House would support. I do not want to detract from anything that he has said or in any way minimise my support by just drawing attention to the fact that one mistake that is rather crucial was incorporated in his argument. The honourable member talked about new towns and the people who are going to live in them. On our present population statistics there are not going to be many new towns. The population statistics are such that the Government's program as a whole is nonsense. I say that particularly for the benefit of the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Les Johnson), who is at the table, because his housing program incorporates a great deal of nonsense for the simple reason that he has not looked specifically at the proper projections of the Australian population. That is a very important subject. It is one which I hope to be able to develop at greater length at another time. Mr Les Johnson-D o you know what we are doing? Do you know that we have started looking at it for thefirsttime? what the Government is doing and I know perfectly well what Professor Borrie is doing. I am saying that at the present moment the Government's plans incorporate a great deal of nonsense because they are based on a population projection which is simply wrong. I make that statement categorically and I am prepared to defend it in detail in this House or elsewhere. I know that Professor Borrie is shortly to reduce his previously published projections. I am familiar with what is going on. I make the definite statement that there is a great deal of nonsense talked by the Government, particularly by the Cities Commission, in this regard. If the Minister will do me the honour of looking at a small article which I wrote in the Sydney 'Bulletin' of this week he will see a little bit of this subject discussed but he will not see it discussed in depth because there was not enough room to do so. But, as I have said, I will take the opportunity in the future of discussing this matter in depth in the House. WhatI wanted to talk about tonight very briefly is the peculiar omission from the terms of reference of the Royal Commission which is inquiring into payments made to the maritime unions under duress. What happened was that when this matter was brought to the attention of the public the Government professed a great deal of indignation about it, said that it was improper and set up a Royal Commission to inquire into it. But one of the things that was missing from the terms of reference of that Royal Commission was any reference to misdoings by the Government itself because the Government itself knew about this misdemeanours and did nothing. One of the terms of reference of the Royal Commission should be why the Government did nothing, what Ministers had guilty foreknowledge of this matter and to what extent were they culpable in trying to hush up these events before they came to the notice of the public. I believe that this omission from the terms of reference of the Royal Commission is very significant because in my view there are guilty men in the Government.",96,Recommendations

253,Mr Wentworth ( M A C K E L L A R),,97,Recommendations
254,Mr Wentworthi Know Perfectly Well,"Why was the Royal Commission not told to investigate the prima facie fact that on 26 July, for example, the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) knew that money was being extorted by threat, and knew that the threats were a criminal act, yet they did not refer this matter to the Royal Commission. They allowed money to continue to be extorted from 26 July until a month later. They knew about it. They had prior knowledge that money was being extorted in regard to the 'Sevillon Reefer' under threat. It seems prima facie that there was a criminal act, that the Government knew about it and that the Government did nothing. I would not go so far as to assert that the Ministers are themselves crirninally liable. They may be; I do not know. But I was very interested to look at the legal authorities on what is known as misprision, which is the concealment of a felony. I looked in particular at the case of R. V. Crimmins which was heard in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1959 and in which the judgment of a single judge was upheld by the Full Court The introduction to the report on this case states: The oSence of misprision of felony is not obsolete. The citizen's duty is to disclose to the appropriate authorities any treason or felony of which he has knowledge remains the same and is still as binding upon him as it was in the early days of the common law. It is not an element in the offence of misprision of felony that the offender should have made his concealment of the crime a source of profit to himself. That is very clearly set out in the report. I want to read again from the judgment as contained in the report. It states: Misprision of felony has certainly come to us from the earliest times in the development of the common law . . . In our opinion, however, the citizen's duty to disclose to the appropriate authorities and treason or felony, of which he has knowledge, remains the same and is still as binding upon him as it was in the early days of the common law. And no doubt cases will arise, from time to time, when the public interest will be best served by the citizen, who fails in his duty, being prosecuted for misprision of felony. There is certainly no justification for the view that such a prosecution is no longer available to the Crown. The question then is: What are the constituent elements of the crime? We think they are really determined by what we have already said. The offence lies in the failure to perform the duty to disclose . . . it matters not what induced the citizen concerned not to do his duty. Those are weighty words. They are not my words; they are the words of the judge. As I have said, they were endorsed by the Full Court. It may be that the Attorney-General should be filing a bill against two of his Ministers. I do not go so far as to say that he should do that, but I say that there is prima facie evidence-it is in the public records-of maybe not a criminal offence but certainly a moral offence and certainly a kind of offence which should have been referred to the Royal Commission. It was not referred to the Royal Commission. I ask the Government now to extend the terms of reference of the Royal Commission to enable it to consider or report upon the failure of any Minister or Ministers to disclose the offence when it came to his or their notice or to take action to prevent its repetition. I want the Royal Commission to tell us whether any Minister has in a guilty way concealed things which should have been brought to the pubhc attention because there is atimelag as evidence in the documents. I am not talking from hearsay; I am talking from documents. There is a prima facie case of wrongdoing-perhap s not criminal wrongdoing but wrongdoing-agains t a Minister and it should have been referred to the Royal Commission in all honesty. I wonder whether the whole commission inquiry is meant as a cover-up of guilty Ministers. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In the case of the Science Facilities Program, some $123m will have been provided by 30 June 1975. With the Libraries Program some $57m will have been provided by 31 December 1974. Under the original arrangements for both the Science and Libraries Programs, the available funds were divided between the State and non-government school sectors and between the two non-government school sectors subsequently on a basis related to State population and secondary school enrolments. In 1967 the allocation to non-government schools was doubled. For the present quadrennial period of the Science Program, the proportionate distribution between government and non-government schools was maintained.

For the present triennial period of the Libraries Program, the State populadon factor was not taken into consideration. The total known amount available for the period was initially divided between the government and non-government school sectors on a secondary enrolment basis. The available funds for the non-government schools were then allocated on the proportionate basis of their established requirements to bring all eligible non-government school library facilities to an acceptable standard. To illustrate; if what was required to raise a particular sector of the non-government schools in a State to acceptable standards was 10 per cent of what was required to raise all non-government schools to acceptable standards, that sector received 10 per cent of the amount available to non-government schools.
