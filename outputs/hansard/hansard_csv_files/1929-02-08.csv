For many months I have been endeavouring to obtain some information, both in this House and privately, regarding the inquiry into soldier land settlement entrusted to Mr Justice Pike.

When more than one question is handed in ' at one time by one member, the practice is to alternate his questions with subsequent questions. That is following the practice in respect of the giving of notices of. motion. of considerable importance to honourable members who desire to give notice of motions.

No. The figures quoted by the honourable member have apparently been taken from a statement of the persons employed by and the cost of the commission to the end of August, 1927, which was tabled in Parliament on the 3rd November, 1927. The correct figures for the last financial year, whicli was the first complete financial year of the commission's activities, show that the total expenditure for that year was £124,092. Of this sum £78,135 represented recurring expenditure arising out of the joint Commonwealth and State Migration Scheme of 1920-21, £30,332 of which was the cost of the London organization. 2. No. The annual report of the Development and Migration Commission for the period ending 30th June, 1927, contains particulars as to the number of assisted migrants introduced into Australia. During the seven months ending 31st January, 1929, 11,825 assisted migrants have been absorbed into Australia, and it is estimated that by the end of the financial year 22,500 w ill have been absorbed, as compared with 26,915 during the previous year. The schemes which the Development and Migration Commission have so far approved as agreed undertakings under the £34,000,000 agreement involve the States concerned in a responsibility to absorb 86,908 assisted migrants before the 7th A p r i l, 1935. upon notice1.

If the outbreak is as serious as reports indicate, will he send a doctor at once to the scene of the outbreak? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Action has been taken by the Government Resident which it is considered will temporarily overcome tlie shortage of water. 2. Advice was received yesterday from the Government Resident that an outbreak of dysentery had occurred at the mission, an'' that medicines had been supplied. 3. The advice received does not indicate that tlie outbreak is serious. Further information is being obtained from the Government Resident.

In determining priority, are all applications for assistance grouped together for each State or are they divided into sections covering different kinds of assistance desired, for example, erection of new dwelling, additions to dwelling, purchase of dwelling already erected ? honourable member's questions are follow:1. Applications are dealt with generally according to the date of their lodging. Where a previous application was submitted or for other good reasons, priority may be extended beyond the date of the current applications. 2. Each State is dealt with separately, and applications are handled under the main head for which loans .are granted, i.e (a) erection of homes; (6) acquisition of existing properties; and (c) additional loans to provide extra accommodation, &c.

The estimated cost of a storage of 1,100,000 acre feet capacity in 1919 was £.1,639,000. The estimated cost of a storage of 2,000,000 acre feet capacity prepared in 1923 was £3,445,000. It was then realized, however, that, pending the opening up of excavations for foundations for the dam, these estimates were of a tentative nature. 6. This matter is now being exhaustively investigated on behalf of the four contracting Governments by the Murray River Advisory Committee. 7. Following upon receipt of the revised estiTAX ASSESSMENT ACT. mate of £5,872,637, which estimate has not yet been authorized by the River Murray Commission, it was decided by a conference of Ministers representing the four contracting Governments that an independent committee of experts he appointed to investigate the cost of the Hume Reservoir works. The question of the personnel of the proposed committee is at present the.subject of discussion between the four contracting Governments. The estimates above referred to have been made by the State constructing authorities. That the House w ill , at the next sitting, resolve itself into a committee to consider the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. Although this is a formal motion, it creates an appropriate opportunity to suggest to the Prime Minister that better provision should be made for honourable members to consider the Estimates. In last two years, an altogether insufficient time has been made available to enable us properly to discharge this important responsibility. In 1927, in consequence the House was. arranged, only a few hours were available for considering departmental estimates at the termination of a protracted sitting, and immediately following the conclusion of the",14,Moloney Asked The Minister For

We did not reach the Estimates until a very late hour in the sitting, and the committee continued to sit all night. resolution consequent upon them, together with the Appropriation Bill, were passed ultimately in the early hours' of the morning after quite inadequate consideration. of the Government. Honourable members did not use the time at their disposal. the procedure which has grown up with the concurrence of the Government. I think I may go so far as to say it is the fault* of the Leader of the House for not making better arrangements for honourable members to consider this business. I suggest that definite days should be fixed for considering ""the Estimates. Last year consideration of the Estimates was, in fact, given on days allocated for the budget debate. Almost the whole of the 30th August was devoted to this business, and so was the whole of the 31st August, but we did not touch it again until the 20th of September, when part of the day was devoted to it. The Estimates were finally dealt with on the 22nd of September, whioh was a continuous sitting from the previous day. I believe that we voted on the final Estimates at 5.48 a.m. It will be seen, therefore, that only three and involves a basic right that belongs to a quarter days were devoted to the whole of the departmental Estimates. Whole departments were put through without a question about 5 o'clock in the morning. I suggest that the expenditure of some £22,000,000 of public money is worthy of a little more consideration. The Appropriation Bill, which followed, was passed its stages without a word of discussion. I raise this question now, not to censure the Prime Minister, but to draw attention to the need for giving the House a better opportunity to deal with the expenditure under the departmental estimates. the honourable member allow for the Estimates in the Queensland Parliament? ing Orders of the Queensland Parliament, fifteen days are allotted in every session for the discussion of the departmental estimates, and, in addition,"" a day [fi] is set apart for the consideration of the resolutions, and no limitation of time applies to the debate on the AppropriaThe Estimates and the tion Bill. Should the honourable member for Warringah feel disposed to make further inquiries, he will find that a similar practice obtains in all the State Parliaments and in the Mother of Parliaments. In the British House of Commons the procedure is to allot certain daysI think fifteen-for the consideration of departmental estimates. The days are specified, so that, members may know on what day the estimates of any particular department will be under consideration, and may attend prepared to raise questions and direct criticism against that department. I feel sure that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have no desire to avoid criticism of Commonwealth departments, or to adopt any course that will prevent honourable members from raising questions concerning the administration or expenditure of any particular department. ThoughI do not suggest that Ministers wish to dodge criticism, nevertheless in this Parliament we have got away from the very healthy practice of parliamentary control of the public purse. Without this control, the power and the authority of the elected chamber disappears, or at all events is seriously curtailed. The question I now raise the House as a whole. Let me quote, for the information of honourable members, the view of Durell, a recognized authority on this subject. In his Parliamentary Grants, he saysI t is, indeed, ultimately to the power of the purse, to its power to bring the whole of the through all executive machinery of the country to a standstill, that the House of Commons owes its control over the executive. That is the fountain and origin of its historical victories over the other organs of the State; and since that power was recognized and confirmed towards the end of the seventeenth century, the House of Commons has remained whether reformed or unreformed, whether corrupt or incorrupt, the chief arbiter of the national destinies. That, of course, is what this House ought to be. The House-no t the Prime Minister or his Ministers-shoul d be the arbiter of the national destinies of Australia.

I am not sure that heads of departments are not strongly censurable for the enormous increase in the cost of almost all public undertakings. somewhat anomalous that the control of I join with the honourable member for Dalley in the hope that there will be created a more definite public conscience not only in this House, but outside, in connection with Federal expenditure generally. -The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) is not quite justified in suggesting that heads of departments are censurable for the unlooked-for increase in expenditure on public works, compared with original estimates of cost. No engineer in this or any other country, during the war and in the post-war period, could estimate accurately the cost of public undertakings. I have often complained, and I again emphasize my .complaint, that it is impossible for honourable members to review the operations of the various departments unless they are in possession of the latest figures and reports from the Auditor-General and the Public Service Board. I know there is. some difficulty about obtaining the Auditor-General's report in time, because it is his duty to review the operations of departments for the financial year ending on the 30th of June in each year; but it would help honourable members if ' the Auditor-General could submit a report of departmental activities tip to within two or three months of the close of each financial year. House is able to silence the voice of a It should be possible to make some such arrangement. speaking for every other honourable member when I urge that the latest information from the Auditor-General's Department and from the Public Service Board should be in the hands of honourable members before the departmental estimates are being dealt with. glad that this question has been raised again. During the last Parliament I directed attention to the desirableness of the Government allowing more time for the discussion of the departmental estimates. All honourable members should hitherto the privileges and rights of the House. In theory the power of the purse resides in the House of Commons as a safeguard against the encroachments of the Crown. In Australia, where we exercise the purest form of democracy, it is finance by a majority in the House is liable to develop into something in the nature of a tyranny quite as objectionable as that which formerly was represented by the authority of the Crown. party matter. it is of a non-party character. It should be the object of all honourable members to preserve the privileges of the House. At present a majority in this House is in a position to force the passage of departmental estimates of expenditure with what many people regard as almost indecent haste. Sometimes this is done in the small hours of the morning, thus destroying the essential function of Parliament, which is to supervise the large expenditure of public money. It is having the effect of whittling away what should be our most precious possession, the rights and privileges of the member. Although one party may be in a minority and represent only a small section of the opinion of this House, honourable members individually represent nearly an equal proportion of the electors, and the voice of one honourable member, though it may be shouted down, has as much right to be heard as that of any other member. If a majority of the private member then the most precious I feel sure that I am privilege of democracy is being killed.

The growing practice, which is being accepted by the parliaments of this country, of placing in the Estimates only a small amount for some particular work or undertaking which will ultimately cost a much larger amount, is utterly wrong in principle. Por instance, take a project costing £10,000, which has,to be approved by Parliament. It is becoming the practice simply to put an amount, say of £500 on the Estimates for such a work, the full and ultimate cost of the work not often disclosed. Parliament passes this apparently insignificant item, and find-? later that by voting £500 it is committed to an ultimate expenditure of £10,000. That is not right. It may be a convenience, if a work is proceeding and the whole of the expenditure is not to be confinancial position. Every opportunity fined to one financial year, to place £500 on the first Estimates, but it should be clearly shown that the vote will lead to au closely. ultimate expenditure of £10,000. We had one instance of this at the close of the last session in connection with the construction of a certain road. The discussion on that item developed into a warm debate in this House. It was shown in that case that if the sum of £10,000 appearing on the Estimates were granted, the vote would lead to an ultimate expenditure of £130,000. That, disclosure roused a considerable controversy. If that course were adopted by the Government in all similar cases, I think that it would lead to a closer scrutiny and a more careful supervision of the Estimates. I entirely support the views expressed by the honourable member for Dalley. new member it has been most interesting orable members that the Estimates and to me to listen to this discussion, and every form of government expenditure particularly to the remarks of the honormust receive the proper and fair conable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), sideration of this Parliament. The diswhom I congratulate on the manner in cussion on the Estimates should not he which he brought this subject before the made a party question, and it is essential House. I have had some little parliamento the good government of the country tary experience, and it has, at all times, that departmental expenditure should be been my wish, and will continue to be open to criticism. There is a tendency, so, that the privileges of members in we have to admit it, all over Australia, the Federal and the State parliamentary in all democracies, in the mother of Pararenas should be preserved as strictly as liament herself, for Cabinets to take possible. But the practice seems to be greater powers upon themselves to the growing in some of the State Parliaments, and apparently in this Parliament, too, of passing the Estimates with a rush, and without proper consideration. The suggestion that we should devote not only a certain number of days, but also certain fixed days to the study of financial matters should commend itself to all honourable members; certainly it has my hearty support. Undoubtedly the time has arrived when -the finances and especially the expenditure of this country should be criticized. If it were possible, we should obtain the report of the Auditor-General before considering our Estimates. The report recently presented relates to the financial transactions of last year; but it would be of material advantage to honourable members and to the community in general if future reports were furnished to Parliament before its consideration of the should be' given to honourable members to study the finances of this country most -The introduction of this subject at this stage must undoubtedly have a beneficial effect in this House, particularly in the closing hours of the session. My experience has been that in all parliaments, both Federal and State, no matter what party may be in office, the so-called discussion of the Estimates has become a farce, or rather, a financial debauch. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) has said, practically the whole of the expenditure of this great Commonwealth is rushed through in a few hours when members are exhausted and only a few of them awake.

When Estimates are forced through in the closing hours of a session there is little opportunity for disceding parliament, but he is not entitled cussion ; in fact, in such a case it would be to apply to a statute of Parliament, far better not to discuss them at all. During the eighteen years that I was a member of this House, I continually protested against this practice, and it was a great pleasure to me indeed when the present Treasurer instituted a reform by bringing forward his budget at an early stage of the session. able member should have an opportunity of discussing freely and fairly the management and control of departments and the expenditure upon them; and especially is that so at present when those interested in the financial position of Australia are shocked to find that despite the heavy taxation levied last year by the Commonwealth and the States, not one government budgeted for a surplus. Last year every Government showed a deficit at the close of the financial year. exceptional circumstances under which Tasmania enjoys her satisfactory position. With that one exception, the whole of the governments showed a deficit at the end of the financial year. That is certainly not a satisfactory position for the Commonwealth, and makes it essential that every opportunity should be given for an adequate discussion of every financial proposal that comes before this Parliament. I hope that this discussion will prove beneficial, and at the same time sound a note of warning to the Treasurer, although I have every appreciation of his action in giving the House an early opportunity of discussing the Estimates. -My interest in this discussion goes a little beyond the subject of finances. I wish to refer more particularly to the consideration of class legislation. I contend that sufficient time should be given to honourable members, particularly to those on this side of the House, to discuss with the people they represent, the various aspects of such legislation. In saying this, I have in mind the notorious measure relating to the registration of transport workers. Groom) -Order!

The subject is one which this Parliament must face. We must try to get a better system of conducting not only our financial discussions, but our parliamentary business generally. This Parliament has, in its Standing Orders, machinery which, when put into operation, will ensure the provision of a reasonable period for the discussion, at every stage, of every measure that comes before it. But as'our numbers are small -ther e are only 76 members of this House-it has not been considered necessary to put that machinery into operation as a general and accepted practice. But. the House of Commons has nearly 700 members and there this machinery has to be employed in order that business may be despatched with sufficient expedition and a reasonable opportunity afforded for the discussion of every measure brought down. Notwithstanding our comparatively small membership, I think it will be necessary to follow a similar practice in this Parliament. At present, when a measure of great interest to members is brought forward, its discussion on the second reading stage may extend over not only days, but sometimes weeks before finality is reached, at that stage.",19,Committee Of Supply

I think every honourable member would like provision to be made for the setting aside of a definite time for the coneffectively as possible, and that f u l l consideration of the budget and the general Estimates. But that cannot be done unless we enforce definite rules of procedure. On the assembling of Parliament, certain business has to be transacted during the session, but when a measure which might reasonably be disposed of in three days occupies three weeks, the time so occupied cuts into the time allotted for other measures, such as the discussion of the finances. During the budget discussion, we frequently hear speeches which do not contain any allusion whatever to Commonwealth finance. for, almost any topic is open for discussion. If the Leader of the Opposition will refer to the report of any budget debate in recent years, he will, I think, find that in most of them certain issues have predominated which have not directly concerned the finances of the country, although they may have done so indirectly. budget debates in the past have been relevant to financial questions. versial subject. We wish to ascertain the cause, and, if possible, find a remedy for a state of affairs which we are generally agreed should be altered. Speaking generally, I think it will be found that in the past a reasonable period has been allowed for the discussion of the financial measures, and that in most instances the debates on the budget and Estimates have extended over three weeks, but generally the whole of that period has been occupied by the general debate, little time being left for the consideration of the departmental estimates. I think we are all in agreement that it would be preferable that a period of three weeks-o r whatever time might be agreed upon-for the discussion of the finances should be distributed between the budget debate and the consideration of the Estimates. The Government has no objection to. such a procedure, and is quite prepared to consider the best way to meet the position, and to make arrangements accordingly. It is the desire of Ministers that the Parliament should function as sideration should be given to the measures that come before it ; and this allocation of time should not be confined to financial questions. If we could adopt the practice of the British, Parliament, and regularly fix the time for the discussion of every measure, it would be an advantage. , transaction of the business, and it would be in the interest of individual members. Unfortunately, now, whenever our machinery for facilitating business is put into operation, the members of the Opposition regard the action of the Government which sfets it in motion as an act of tyranny. I cannot say what action the Government is. prepared to take in the future; hut I ask honorahle members opposite to consider seriously whether the business of the House, particularly when important measures are before it, could not be more satisfactorily conducted if we allotted a fair and reasonable time for its discussion. The allocation of time is suggested directly in regard to the broad issue of finance; and I readily admit the desirability of fixing a period for such discussion. The Government will endeavour to ascertain what is the most satisfactory way of doing what is desired. With regard to the cost of the Murray River worksa matter which is really irrelevant to this discussionI must say in fairness to our Commonwealth officials that the estimates referred to were prepared, by the engineers of the three contracting States-Victoria, .South Australia and New South Wales.

Each committee appoints a rapporteur who drafts its recommendations for the consideration of the Assembly. The recommendations are brought up in plenary session, but are not usually discussed in detail; my experience in 1921 was that the responsibility of dealing with the various matters referred to them was left entirely to the committees, the Assembly in full session merely adopting the recommenda-' tions made to it. This procedure is remarkably business like and effective. The finances uf the League received a good deal of attention at the Assembly -which met in 1921. At that time there was an impression amongst the representatives of several countries, particuleague to bring about progressive dislarly of the British Empire, that the expenditure of the League was extravagant. The Fourth Committee, after a complete survey of the accounts, recommended that a supervisory committee should meet in Geneva in May each year to review the budget prepared by the Secretariat; that the budget, as agreed to by the committee, should he posted to each member of the League, to allow of its full consideration by the various governments before it came up for adoption at the meeting of the Assembly in the following September. That procedure is now in operation. Unfortunately, owing to our remoteness from Europe, we do not receive the budget until the eve of the departure of our delegates, but the government of nearly every other country. has ample opportunity to consider carefully the expenditure proposed for the coming year. The Secretariat is composed of men who believe firmly in the League, and their enthusiasm inclines them to expand its expenditure in order to increase the League's activities. The unwisdom of this is recognized by most of the nations, and the Supervisory Committee, supplementing the work of the Fourth Committee appointed at the September meetings, acts as a wholesome check upon too ambitious proposals for expenditure. The Fourth Committee has properly discharged its responsibility to scrutinize the budget carefully, and some countries which are particularly enthusiastic in support of the League have the impression that this scrutiny is hampering ""and curtailing its Mr Bruce. work. The view of the Australian delegates, however, is that the committee has done nothing to unduly restrict the proper activities of the League, but has merely restrained any tendency towards wasteful expenditure. do a great deal more good if it were to examine the budgets of nations that are making war-like preparations. most important subject dealt with by the league is that of disarmament and the reduction of armaments. This is the most gigantic task yet undertaken by any organization in the world's history, and it is not surprising that the efforts of the armament have not yet met with great success. Nevertheless distinct progress has been made.

The codification of international law also offers hope.

But unfortunately there is no body' of international law for this court to administer, and a considerable time will be required to bring it into existence. The league, however, is grappling with the problem of the codification of international law, and this is a line of possible development todomestic, interference with which wouldwards insuring national safety.

That agenda included matters which unquestionably every nation would regard as being purely be an infringement of their sovereign rights. At the meeting of the assembly in 1926, which the present Attorney General attended, he made Australia's position towards those economic questions very clear, and I think it is fairly generally understood now just where we stand in this matter. While we enthusiastically subscribe to the ideals two South of the League of Nations, we are not prepared to surrender any of our rights as a sovereign nation on such matters of domestic jurisdiction as the fiscal policy we think fit to pursue, or the migration to our shores of the nationals of other countries. The attitude which Australia has adopted is finding increasing favour with other nations, whose representatives are making it clear that, while they welcome, the league undertaking an economic investigation in certain directions, they strongly deprecate interference in such domestic problems as finance and migration.

The League has done very fine work regarding health matters, and it is to be hoped that this will continue. In Australia we are particularly interested in this work, because two years ago the Australian Government invited representatives of the Pacific nations to hold a conference in Australia to discuss the problem of health in the Pacific, and the conditions of the native races inhabiting tbe islands which are scattered. As a result of that conference it was decided to invite the League of Nations to take certain action regarding health"" in the Pacific. The League responded, and there is now a representative of that body working in the Pacific. An intelligence centre, which is proving of the greatest value, has been established at Singapore. There are some persons who never weary of belittling what has been done by the League. They point out that one of the objects of the League of Nations was to bring about world's disarmament, and because it has not been able to do this they draw the conclusion that its work has been futile; that it is the dream of idealists only, and has no place in a practical world amongst practical men. I strongly dissent from those views. While the League has not accomplished the impossible, it has done a great deal in the direction of bringing the people of the world to recognize a new standard of international morality, and of conduct among nations. Up to the present the League has, to a great extent, been sustained by the enthusiasm of a few individuals in various countries. One point which was very strongly stressed at the Assembly of the League last year, was that direct work must be done to educate the masses to the significance ' and importance of the work being done. people realize more and more just what the League is doing they will be prepared to afford it a greater measure of support. The power of the League of Nations will, I am quite certain, never rest on a basis of physical force. If it is attempted to make the League something that can enforce its decisions by Mr Bruce. sanctions and physical force, the whole movement is doomed to failure; but if we can get into the minds of the peoples of the world a respect for the authority of the League, and that authority is based on a general international conscience demanding recognition of the principles which the League has been authorized to enunciate, we shall have placed the League upon a firmer basis, and its power and influence amongst the nations will be enhanced. It will take a long time to do this, and the League, at the present time, is in great danger from the over-enthusiasm of some of its supporters, who are trying to make it go too far and too fast. They endeavour to induce the League to embark upon matters concerning which sovereign nations will never 'tolerate interference. If , however, the League is guarded from this danger, I am confident that it will become a force for great good in the world, and a means for promoting a better understanding among the nations. If it has done nothing else it has provided in the council a constant meeting place for the representatives of the great nations of the world, and of some of the other nations as well. Many of the things accomplished during the last seven or eight years could never have been brought about had it not been for the improved personal relations that have thus been established. That alone is sufficient to justify what the League of Nations has cost the participating countries. we are under a disadvantage in speaking on this subject without having the report before us, those who have been interested in the work of the League of Nations have followed its activities closely enough to understand fairly well the main points of the report. The Prime Minister referred to the As the financial cost of the League, and the necessity of restricting its activities because it was stretching out too far and becoming too costly. Everybody is aware of the stand taken hy the British delegation to the League at the last meeting of the Assembly, and there is certainly much to be said for the attitude adopted by it on that occasion.",24,League Of Nations Ninth Assembly
116,Mr Mann (Perth) [2.28],"AlthoughOn the other hand, the attitude of the British delegation, supported hy the Australian section of it, came in for a certain amount of criticism in this regard. I quite agree that the scope of the League might be so widened as to cause it to obtrude upon a number of subjects which do not seem properly to belong to the sphere of international politics; but there might be a valuable indirect effect, in the creation among certain countries of a friendly feeling towards the League and towards the larger nations which previously have been thought to dominate European politics without much regard for the welfare of their weaker neighbours. In consequence of the broad activities of the League these small nations are coming to have . a more sympathetic interest in its operations. Eveni n such countries as China and India the mind of the people is being cleared, and a true realization of the ful l political significance of what the League is doing to bring about a closer and other relations. co-operation and understanding and greater trust and goodwill between the nations is gradually coming. these reasons I believe that the expenditure of money on these activities of the League is justified. Great Britain has taken a prominent part in this matter, and one of the outstanding features of the work of the League is that what Britain says carries greater weight than what any other nation says. That is a striking tribute to the influence of Great Britain. It is also a recognition of the unselfish attitude most of us realize. This is continually which she has always adopted towards the other nations of the world. In consequence of this the British delegation, and we as part of it, should be very caref u l to do or say nothing which may imperil the confidence which the other nations of the world have in the British Empire. We should take all possible pains to consider every question that is submitted to the League in an openminded way, so that our influence may not be weakened. What the Prime Minister said respecting the failure of the League to make as much progress as people desired towards practical disarmament is true. We should all like to see greater progress in this regard; but we should not discount the advances that have already been made. In my opinion, the League has done a great deal to clarify our conceptions of disarmament and the obstacles which stand in the way of achieving it. We should give the most careful consideration to the factors which are preventing the realization of this great ideal. Apart from the more direct conception of military disarmament, ' certain other views of the subject have emerged from the discussions which have occurred. One of these is that, before we can expect material disarmament, we must work continuously, energetically and enthusiastically towards mental and moral disarmament. I do not hesitate to say that the greatest obstacle in the way of a greater fulfilment of the ideal of material disarmament is the suspicion and distrust which continues to exist between the nations of the world in their commercial The Prime Minister referred to matters of domestic jurisdiction, and said For that some of the dangers of the League arose from the over-enthusiasm of its supporters and their desire to push into the forefront certain economic questions which he has classified as entirely domestic and therefore not appropriate for the League to discuss. Probably more progress has been made during the last 18 months in the economic sphere of the League's operations than in any other. More earnest and solid investigation has been made into economic subjects than pointed out in the literature issued by the League. Not only was the great economic conference held in 1927, hut effective work has since been done by subsidiary conferences and by the Economic Committee of the League. This has tended to clarify the causes of economic friction between various countries and that, of course, opens the way to their removal. I was a little surprised to find that the Prime Minister did not seem to understand the allusion that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) made this morning to commercial disarmament. The term was a proper one to use. There is at present a great deal of commercial hostility among the nations which must be disarmed before substantial progress can be made in material disarmament. In my view the report presented by the Economic Conference was one of the most weighty international documents of its kind ever issued. It surveyed the economic conditions of the world as they had never previously been surveyed, and showed that the various countries are mutually dependent. It i i remarkable that this reence made it clear that one of the quesport was almost parallel in the international sphere to that submitted to this Government a few days ago by the British Economic Mission which has been inquiring into Australian affairs. The Prime Minister has stated that the greatest work of the League has been to create a new standard of conduct among the nations and to create an international conscience. I believe that it has done a great deal in this regard, and we should do nothing which is likely to interfere with the good results which must follow work of that description. I regret therefore that the Australian delegation to the last Assembly expressed views which were, in my opinion, out of harmony with these objects. We may take it that the delegates expressed the views of this Government when they spoke; but if so their views were not in accordance with those uttered by the Prime Minister this morning about the necessity of a new standard of conduct among the nations and the development of an international conscience. The whole matter turns, of course, upon what are subjects of domestic jurisdiction. I had said on a previous occasion in this House that I consider that our interpretation of what constitute domestic matters is too narrow. For instance, it has heen said that migration is a matter of domestic jurisdiction, although we know perfectly well that this subject has been and is being considered to-day in relation to the natural sensitiveness of other nations. If we desire to improve the standard of international conduct and strengthen the international conscience we must take the views of other nations into account in formulating our own. I am sorry therefore that during one of the debates at the last Assembly of the League the leader of the Australian delegation Mr Mann. acquired a rather unenviable notoriety by expressing opinions on this subject which were different from those of any other delegation. He saidThere are many reasons why it is a dangerous, even a hazardous undertaking, for the League to concern itself actively with the question of customs tariff. In effect, he said that the League must keep its hands off the tariffs of the nations, although the Economic Confertions which must be faced before material disarmament can be achieved is the tariff relations of the different countries. It is regrettable that only the Australian delegates expressed views of the nature I have quoted. Their attitude was definitely and uncompromisingly against that of the other members of the Assembly. The observations of our delegate were replied to by the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State who saidI do not agree with the speaker, who on Thursday last suggested it was improper and perhaps dangerous for the League to deal in any way with the complex problem of Customs tariffs. It is obviously not enough that tlie League should strive to bring about the reduction of armaments and to prevent war when disputes have arisen whicli involve the danger of war; the League must endeavour to dissuade nations from the adoption of policies which are likely to produce exasperation or a sense of injury among their neighbours. The general comments by members of the Assembly seemed to indicate that the Australian delegate had, by the expression of his views on this subject, made himself somewhat unpopular. It appears to me that the attitude of the Commonwealth Government was, perhaps, prompted by a desire to develop the idea which apparently is influencing the present British Government to establish free trade within the Empire and to set up tariff barriers against other countries. That fantasy, which is being condemned even now by conservative organs in England, is impracticable, and useless. If we entertain it too long we shall jeopardize our relationships with other countries, because imperial preference implies a hostile attitude towards other countries in the economic sphere. Moreover, it is entirely contrary to the spirit of the League, which we profess a desire to maintain and uphold. It is unwise for us, for the sake of this wild chimera, which can have nothing but a bad effect upon the Empire itself, to dissociate ourselves from the obvious movement in European countries towards a better commercial relationship. It would be a pity if we persisted iu our present attitude. We shall be judged, not by our professions in regard to League matters, but by our attitude towards specific questions. . It is unfortunate that we should have taken this stand at a time when Australia is feeling the strain of a great economic burden. We should open our ears to the arguments of the representatives of other countries, and certainly we should display a less recalcitrant attitude towards other nations. Considerable progress has been made in removing some of.the outstanding difficulties to the improvement of commercial relations between the various countries' of the world. It is much to be regretted, therefore, that the Australian delegate was alone in his refusal to sign an agreement entered into by other countries. I am afraid that we are placing ourselves more and more in an unenviable position of isolation on this issue. Fromour own point of view this is unwise. The same remarks may be applied to our attitude towards the "" optional clause"", to which the Prime Minister, I understand, did not refer to-day. This matter has been receiving a great deal of attention in other countries. The British Government was one of the few of the great nations represented on the League that has' withheld its signature, the reason given being that the British Government had first to consult and obtain the approval of the dominions. It appears to me that there are no insuperable difficulties. I listened to the remarks of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) on this subject, and I think we might very well inform the British Government that as far as we are concerned we have no objection to Britain's signature being attached to the "" optional clause"". Apparently, an undue sensitiveness and distrust of the League have prevented us from according our support to it. I am greatly obliged to the right honourable the Prime Minister for his courtesy in allowing me to speak at this stage. On former occasions the discussions of the report of the Australian delegation to the Assembly of the League of Nations has been curtailed in the most unsatisfactory manner. Sufficient time has not been allowed for that careful consideration which its importance demands. Hitherto discussion has been postponed till so late in the session that the interest in the report had entirely faded and the practical issues arising out of it could not be dealt with adequately. I hope that on all future occasions the Government will endeavour to co-operate in the economic side of the work of the League more actively and in a spirit of greater goodwill. At all events, I trust that the Government will not display an uncompromising attitude, because if we are to bring about co-operation and a better understanding among the nations, we must be prepared to give as well as take; we must be willing to make concessions even in regard to those matters which perhaps we have come to regard as our inalienable right to deal with under our domestic jurisdiction. adjourned. That he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Tariff Board Act, 1921-24. . Bill presented and read a first time. Trade and Customs) [2.53] -(B y leave.) I move That the bill be now read a second time. When the original Tariff Board Bill was submitted to this House in 1921, the Ministeri n charge admitted that it was largely of an experimental nature. The board which was. created under the act has done good work although as was to be expected in the course of seven years' operations certain defects in the machinery of the act have been disclosed. The purpose of the bill is to make good those defects. It is generally agreed that it would be unthinkable to abolish the board and revert to the old method of tariff-making by ministerial or departmental initiative with unlimited log rolling. Experience has shown that the capacity of the board to hear and",25,League Of Nations Ninth Assembly

118,Motion (By Mr Gullett) Agreed To,,28,Second Reading
119,Mr Gullett (Henty,"Minister fordeal with applications was over estimated. I should like, at the outset, to pay a tribute of respect to the pioneer members' of the board and particularly chairmen upon whom has fallen the greater part of the work. The thanks of the Government are also due to the lay members of the board who have served this country so well in the discharge of their important duties. I do not suggest that the board's recommendations have been always acceptable to either the government of the day or the interested parties; but the reports presented have disclosed sound knowledge of the particular subjects dealt with, and have given evidence of the most careful consideration for all the interests involved, direct and indirect. The main criticism of the board-and I think it is admitted that the complaint is not unfounded-ha s been because of the delay in hearing applications, many of which have been of first importance. Honourable members will recognize that undue delay in matters of this nature not infrequently means heavy loss to the interested parties. The amendments in the bill fall into two classes. The first group aims at altering the machinery of the board to make it more adaptable, and to increase the board's capacity to consider applications. The second group of amendments is designed to relieve the board of a good deal of work in connection with minor matters, so that members may give more of their time and energy 10 the hearing of the more important tariff, issues. When the board was first constituted it consisted of three members-a departaveraged about 300 sitting days a year. mental oflicer, who was chairman, and two laymen. Subsequently, the number of the laymen was increased to three, members of Parliament. giving a membership of four. Up to the present the board has always sat as a work. Up to date the amount paid to each single body. The first change proposed layman has been about £1,500 a year. It in the bill is that at the discretion of the is now proposed to increase the fees from chairman the board may be divided into five guineas to six guineas a day, and to two boards or sub-boards of two members limit the days of sitting from six to five each. The question whether there shall a week, and thus cut out meetings on be a division will be left with the chairSaturday mornings. These, I understand, 4 man; although the Minister may at his do not permit of much work. It is also discretion at any time instruct the board proposed to grant the members of the to sit as a whole on a particular case. board on fees an annual recreation leave Mr Gullett. Each sub-board of two members will have all the powers of the full board in regard to the taking of evidence and the conduct of hearings generally, but the reports of to the departmental the sub-boards must be signed hy the members of the f u l l board. There will be a deputy chairman presiding over the sub-boards, but, unlike the chairman of the full board, he will have no casting vote. In the event of unanimity between the two members of the sub-boards, their report will be forwarded as a single report to the full board. The evidence will be briefly surveyed by the full board, and the report eventually signed if an agreement is reached. In the event of a disagreement between the two members of the sub-board, two reports containing their dissenting views will be presented to the full board, which body will come to an ultimate decision. In this way the usefulness of the board will be considerably increased. The working speed of the board will not be actually doubled, because at times its members will be sitting as a single board on cases of special importance, and they will be together for the consideration of reports from the sub-boards. It is proposed to make some slight increase in the remuneration of members of the board. Up to the present the chairman has been receiving an annual salary of £1,400, which, I am sure, all honourable members will agree, is not a very large remuneration for that position. It is now proposed to pay the chairman £1,600 a year. The lay members have been in receipt of a fee of five guineas a sitting. They have been sitting practically six days a week all the year round, and have",28,Second Reading

121,Mr Gullett,"And a little moreof three weeks, or fifteen days, on full pay. Whereas the average earning of the lay members in the past has been a little more than £1,500, under this arrangement they will sit some 248 days a year, and receive an annual remuneration of £1,560. It is considered desirable to increase the fees so as to make the positions more attractive, without imposing a further burden upon the taxpayers. We have had great difficulty in the past in obtaining suitable men for these positions, the reason advanced being that we have not paid enough for this class of work. Consideration has again been given to the question of paying fees or salaries to the members of the board, and the Government has come definitely to the conclusion that whatever chance we may have of getting first-class men under the arrangement of paying fees, we have none whatever of. getting well-known business men to give up all their time to the work of the board at a salary of £1,500 a year. ence ? as we have ascertained from business men. I come now to the question of reducing the work of the board. As honourable members are aware the board, as originally constituted, was given, by the Minister of the day, all manner of things to consider. It was given not only all requests for tariff revision, including requests for new, decreased and increased tariffs, but, in addition, a lot of what may be termed small work, and that work has occupied a great deal of the board's time. included what are known as by-law cases valuations under section 160 of the Customs Act, interpretations, and cases arising out of the Industries Preservation Act. them now? remain with the board. It is now proposed to withhold from the board all applications for admission under the by-laws and cases arising out of section 160. In case some honourable members are not familiar with the by-law cases, let me explain that there appear in the Australian tariff, as in all tariffs, a number of articles classed as dutiable which may not be actually manufactured in this country, but which it was hoped by Parliament would be manufactured here at some future date. At the discretion of the Minister, however, these articles may under certain circumstances be admitted free or at a nominal rate of duty, provided that the Minister is satisfied that they cannot be commercially manufactured in this country. Under the act as it stands, however, all such applications for admission under the by-laws must be sent to the Tariff Board, except where the department has a complete precedent for their admission or rejection. When an application has been forwarded to the department, it is, before it is given to the Tariff Board, passed to the various investigation officers, in the States concerned and reported upon by them. It is then returned to the department and before being submitted to the board the department in all cases makes a recommendation. It has been found from experience that in almost every case the recommendation of the department has been acted upon by the board. Obviously, however, the hoard does not merely sign and endorse these recommendations. It is obliged to review the evidence and to spend a considerable time on this more or less futile endorsement work. It is, therefore, proposed, under the amending bill, to withhold those cases from the board, except at the discretion This minor work of the Minister, and also cases arising out of section 160 of the Customs Act dealing with valuations. Under that section valuations must, under certain conditions, be made arbitrarily by the Minister; as, for example, when there is no clear guidance as to the cost of production or the value of the article in the country oi origin. These cases, however, are not numerous. In future it is not proposed to send them to the board unless the Minister so decides. with departmentally.",29,Second Reading

I am aware that there is a considerable demand at the present time for the removal of dumping cases from the board, so as to expedite their consideration, but even if a change were considered desirable, it could not be effected under this bill. Those cases are sent to the Tariff Board under the Industries Preservation Act, and do not come within the scope of the bill now before the House. The alterations that I have outlined will, I think, be acceptable to all business interests concerned. They will be welcomed hy both manufacturers and importers. I might say that all of these alterations have been approved by the Tariff Board itseK. tains little more than I have stated, except that there is an interesting provision under which the board will, if so directed by the Minister, be called upon to make reference to the Bureau of Economic Research which, as honourable members are aware, is to be created at an early date. The director of the bureau will not be concerned with the taking of evidence before the board, or the framing of its reports. He will when requested give advice upon the possible or probable, direct or indirect, economic results of any requests which may be before the board. Another minor amendment strongly advocated by the board is that it shall be given 60 days instead of 30 days, after the close of the financial year, in which to submit its annual report. power to refer to the Economic Bureau the question of the efficiency of an industry? provision in the bill. It empowers the Minister for Trade and Customs to obtain the advice of the director of the bureau on the economic aspect of any particular request submitted to the board. The powers of the hoard are not substantially increased under the bill, and the Minister will still decide which cases submitted to him shall be sent to the board for investigation. There has been some criticism in the past because Ministers have not referred all cases to the board; hut I can assure honourable members that, if they had, the work of the board would have been even more congested than it has been. The Minister should have discretionary power in this matter. The bill does not increase the powers of the board in regard to actions arising out of its reports. It will still report to the Minister, and it will be for the Government to decide what action shall be taken.. every report of the board shall be tabled? tion of the present procedure in that respect. We are not increasing the powers of the board beyond the definite proposals which I have outlined. I am uot permitted to enter into a general discussion on tariff matters; but, before commending the measure to the House, I should like to sound a note of caution. I believe that the measure, when in operation, will greatly expedite the hearing of cases, and, therefore, be of increased service to our secondary industries and the commercial community generally. I regard the board as only one of a number of agents operating in the interests of a workable tariff. There is a general opinion-in Australia to-day that the solution of our present-transi tory, I hope-depression , and the perfecting of a great national policy of protection, lies merely in more and still more customs duties.

The board should be able to do good work; but if our economic and industrial position is to improve there must be wholehearted co-operation not only between those engaged in tariff work, but by all parties who support a national policy of protection. adjourned. That lie have leave to bring in a bill for an act to validate an agreement made on the 12th day of December, 1927, between the Commonwealth of (Australia of the first part, and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania of the second, third, fourth, f if t h , sixth and seventh parts, respecable members to oppose the motion, and tively. I move That this House expresses its gratification at the courage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in visiting the poverty stricken areas of the coal districts of Northern England, appreciates his broad humanitarianism, and regrets to hear that 300,000 men, women and children of Great Britain are confronted with want, misery, desolation and death, that six families are living ih one hovel, that men are only earning 38s. for sixteen shifts of work, and this House shares the horror of His Royal Highness at such conditions, and expresses its determination that such conditions shall never prevail in Australia. I have no intention of occupying the time of the House in debating this motion. It speaks for itself. News has come to us to-day that the announcement that His Royal Highness intended inspecting the conditions existing at the collieries in South Wales, which are even more deplorable than those at the mines he has [7] already visited, has caused the mine owners to become indignant, and to bring influence to bear to prevent him from making further inspections or publishing any more reports. It is therefore our duty to commiserate with these people, to express our appreciation of the humanitarianism which His Royal Highness has displayed and our indignation because the force of wealth in Great Britain is sufficiently strong to prevent His Royal Highness from seeing the conditions' under which these unfortunate persons are living.

138,"Price, J. L. Mr Latham (Kooyong","Attorneywhole act failed, and in other cases the .court adopted this criterion: it asked whether the omission of the invalid portions of a statute produced a substantially different measure. For example, in the Union Label case-the State of New South ""Wales against the Brewery Employees Union-it was held that the provision dealing with workers' labels in the Trade Marks Act of the Commonwealth was invalid. The question then arose whether the invalid provisions infected the whole statute so as to render it invalid. In that case the court asked this question-Does there remain a complete intelligible and valid statute capable of be the general intention, in the case of all ing executed"", and conforming to the general purpose and intent of the legislature as shown in the act? There is also the well-known Whybrow's case in which the court held that the provisions of the Arbitration Court in respect to the common rule were invalid. there also, namely, whether the failure of the common rule provision made the whole act invalid. be determined whether it would he a substantially different law after the invalid portions had been cut out. That, fundamentally, is a question of the intention of the legislature. The real question which the court had before it in those cases was whether it could reasonably be assumed that Parliament would nave passed the law with the invalid portions omitted. This has been stated by Mr Justice Isaacs to be the position in other cases. When the Navigation Act was passed it was realized that there was room for dispute and difference of opinion over the extent of the navigation powers of the Commonwealth as part of its trade and commerce powers, and Parliament sought to save the position by the inclusion in the Navigation Act of a declaration in the terms of the second clause of this bill. This section announced the intention of Parliament that, notwithstanding the invalidity of part of the statute, Parliament intended that the rest should operate. ticipate that part of the Navigation Act would be declared invalid? ticipated that that portion of the Navigation Act which dealt with intra-state trade might be held to be invalid, and that anticipation was justified. Hadi t not been for the presence in the statute of the section which is now reproduced in this bill, the whole Navigation Act would probably have failed. By means of this section the interstate sections of the act and those dealing with foreign trade, were saved. The object of the present section is to apply in the case of all statutes the rule which was applied to the Navigation Act; that is, to declare legislation of this Parliament, that although parts of the statute may be held to be .invalid, the rest is to be treated as valid. That would leave a statute, a portion of which was declared by the court to be invalid, in this position: Parliament would know that certain sections were invalid; that part of the act The same question arose would, therefore, he cut out, and would not be effective or operative; and it would then be for Parliament to deI t had to termine whether the remaining and valid portions of the act should continue in force, or whether the act should be repealed or amended in some way. I commend this amendment to the support of honourable members as being likely to carry out the intention which honourable members have when they support any bill in this House. That is the first and principal provision of this hill. The next is contained in clause 3, and is very simple. It proposes to define the phrase "" Territory of the Commonwealth "" or "" Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth "" so that those phrases shall include the mandated territory of New Guinea. .That is an obviously desirable amendment, as it dispenses with the necessity of making special mention of the mandated territory as it is now necessary to do in a number of our statutes. The third provision is a general one dealing with the administration of acts. The Constitution, in section an64, provides that departments of State shall be administered by Ministers of State appointed by the",33,Distress On British Coal Fields Investigation Sbytheprince Of Wales

140,Mr Latham,"Yes, Parliament anGovernor-General, and tlie Governor General is able to assign the administration of departments to particular Ministers. Prom time to time orders in council are made declaring that certain acts are under the administration of certain Ministers. Honourable members will find them published in Hansard, so that they may ascertain which Minister has the administration of any particular act. There are some statutes, however, concerning which it is specifically provided that they shall be administered by a particular Minister. The Navigation Act, for instance, lays it down that it shall be administered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The distribution of duties between members of a Ministry is a matter of administrative convenience, and, except in one or two very special cases, can be arranged by the Governor General. The object of this provision is to enable the Governor General to assign the administration of particular statutes and departments to any Minister as may be thought fit. .The fourth substantive provision of the. act is to be found in clause 5. clause, and will save a great deal of trouble in drafting. It provides that where a term is found in a statute, that term shall have the same meaning in any regulations made under the statute. sarily follow? provide for it, and a term would, as the law now stands, have to be re-defined in the regulation.

This afternoon the Prime Minister intimated that it was not desirable to pass a resolution submitted by the honourable member for Bourke because it dealt with matters which were not within the domestic concern of this country. I wish now to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter which, if not exactly parallel to that raised by the honourable member, for Bourke, is at least very similar to it ; I refer to the deplorable condition of poverty under which many families in industrial areas are now living in South Australia. In Port Adelaide, independent authorities have conducted investigations, and have published statements to the effect that the conditions are absolutely harrowing. Not only are adults suffering, but in many cases children are literally starving. Many public spirited persons have contributed towards the relief of these sufferers, and appeals have been made by authorities to the general public, but something more needs to be done. I ask the Prime Minister to realize that it is a matter of national importance that some relief should be afforded to those in need. The State Government has been so moved in the matter that the single men who have been sleeping on the banks of the Torrens River have been given shelter in the Exhibition building. There are many This will be a very useful married men, however, who have been compelled to sell practically every piece of furniture out of their homes, and are now living under conditions of the greatest hardship, and without the ordinary necessaries of life. Not only are parents and their children being affected, but the distress which prevails will have a most harmful effect upon the children not yet born. The Prime Minister may say 'that this is a case for State action; but I submit that it is of national concern that many of our people are starving. There is a precedent for the Commonwealth Government granting relief in such circumstances. ""When Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer he granted £1,000 to relieve distress in the division of Grey at Port Pirie, and said that, if upon investigation it were shown that the amount was insufficient, he would be prepared to grant more. Many of the people in Port Adelaide have reached the point of desperation, and something should he done immediately to relieve them from the pangs of hunger. This applies particularly to the unfortunate children.",34,Distress On British Coal Fields Investigation Sbytheprince Of Wales

145,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [3.57],"The State Government provides destitute rations, but these are on the meanest scale, and do not provide for the essential needs of children and infants. There is another way in which the Commonwealth Government could relieve the situation. Many of the men to whom I huve referred are returned soldiers in Occupation of war service homes, and their payments are considerably in arrears. Hitherto the department has dealt with them in a sympathetic manner; and I trust that the Government will take some step to ensure that they will not be embarrassed because they cannot meet their payments on the due date. I do not desire to go into details in the matter; I know that every feeling of sympathy and humanity which honourable members possess will go out to these people. I trust that the Government will act immediately to meet their dire and urgent need. and Minister for External Affairs) [4.3],-Every honourable member must deeply deplore that conditions such as those referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) should exist. I do not say that the Commonwealth Government is not concerned with such happenings; but that the primary responsibility for providing relief cannot be assumed by it. If we were to assume such responsibility in this case we should have to do so in every other similar case. I shall cause an examination to he made into the circumstances, and, if it is thought proper that the Commonwealth should take some action to assist in relieving the distress, that will be done, but not because this is an obligation which the Government should assume. I was glad to hear the honourable member say that returned soldiers were being treated with consideration and sympathy by the department. On this aspect of the subject. I shall confer witb the Minister for Repatriation, to see that the fullest possible consideration is extended to them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.4 p.m. [8]",35,Adjournment Distress Caused By Unemployment
