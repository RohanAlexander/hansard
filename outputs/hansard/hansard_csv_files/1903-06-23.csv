These rumours, when sifted and reduced to distinct charges, and to the evidence that supported thein, showed that, considering tlie circumstances, nothing very exceptional hud taken place.

Bungonia to Goulburn? Windellima to Goulburn or Bungendore (whichever is the more economical) ? Wombat to Mumimbiirrah or Young (whichever is the more economical) ? Sir PHILIPFYSH honourable and learned member's question is as follows :In cases where cash guarantees have been dispensed with, the estimated revenue has been considered sufficient to afford a reasonable return for the expenditure. W it h respect to the lines mentioned this is not bhe case, , the particulars being as follow :Binda to Bigga.

The article which prompbed bhose questions, appeared in the Age of the l o t h inst., and the questions were prepared wibh a view to . gettin g an authoribative reply bo bhe veryimportant statements which it contained. Since then, in its issue of the 19th June, the Age has published the following statement :In the House of Representatives on Wednesday ,. ,. , afternoon Mr Hume Cook was put up to ask the Prime Minister a series of questions based upon an article published in the Age of Monday last in regard .to Federal extravagance.

It is not correct to say "" t h a t dozens of officers whose positions were sinecures under the States were transferred to the Federal service a t largely increased salaries."" T h is statement, besides bein g u n j u s t to gentlemen w ho occupied onerous and. responsible offices in t h e service of the States, is inaccurate in so f a r as it refers to the Commonwealth service. It is t r u e t h a t some officers who were transferred from the States are receiving under the Commonwealth higher salaries t h a n they received under t h e . States; b u t t h is is in every cose because fchey occupy higher and more responsible positions in the Commonwealth service. It is also t r u e t h a t t h e salaries attached to the higher offices referred to are in nearly every case less than the salaries attached to corresponding offices in the State services. In justificatio n of the statement referred to in the honourable member's question, the papeD referred to published the f o l l o w i ng list, to w h i c h I have added, to ill u s t r a te the unfairness of the statements in question, the columns showing the salaries paid to the holders of similar offices in N e w South Wales and V i c to r i a :There is ample proof to support the justness of these observations in a few selections from the Federal salnvy list:Federal Salary. £ President of the Senate 1,500 . .

If the honourable member intends his question to cover any wider ground than this I shall be happy to obtain the information. 4. Five officers are now receiving salaries double the amount they received in the States. They were specially selected, and are now performing much more onerous and responsible duties. Their aggregate salaries in the States were £1,560. Corresponding positions in the public services of New South Wales and Victoria are more highly paid. 5. Ministers have no private secretaries.

The approximate expenditure for 1900-1 upon the military and naval forces was £860,000. This allows for the services now charged for in the votes of the Department, and also a sum of £25,000 for the expenses of salaries, pay, and contingencies of men away in South Africa, which are borne on present estimates. 1903-4, say, £700,000 ; reduction, £160,000. Just before Federation the States very largely increased their defence expenditure, probably by £75,000, but it did not come into operation, except to a very small extent in 1900-1, and if it had, the amount for that year would, of course, be increased. Neither of the amounts given includes repairs, & c , which, however, would probably approximate pretty closely. In 1900-1 large sums were expended out of loan moneys for defence purposes, namely, £132,000, and although these would be far in excess of the amounts proposed for next year, they have not been taken into consideration.

The Postmaster-General does not consider this necessary. 2. The additional telegraph lines to Eucla and Yardea mentioned constitute part of the State systems of Western Australia and South Australia respectively, and their construction is considered necessary for commercial reasons ; therefore the question of guarantees was not considered in connection with them. 3. The line to Tarcoola terminates for the present at that place; but it may eventually be -extended to Western Australia in connection with the suggested railway between South Australia and Western Australia. 4.

32,Mr Glynn (South A US T R A L I A ),"I wouldarea within which exclusive jurisdiction is to be vested in the High Court. In the discussion which took place on Thursdaylast, several suggestions were made as to the particular provisions of the clause which ought to be retained, and those which ought to be eliminated. I think it was the honourable and learned member for .Bendigo who suggested that paragraphs (a), (b), and (e) ought to be excised. The Attorney-General, however, proposes to retain paragraphs (a) and (6). that actions in matters arising under Courts. Moreover, it is clearly a matter treaties will be very rare indeed. But if which for the dignity of the Commonwealth such cases do arise, 'why should we confine and of its Courts ought to be dealt with by jurisdiction in them to the High Court? them. The cases provided for under the Under this Bill defendants are empowered clause are limited to those which arise in to of Eederal jurisdiction from the States treaty obligation.

But even if those clauses perish, a right of honourable and learned member for In d i appeal to the High Court will still remain. referred to paragraphs (e) and ( / ) . Thus, any interests which the CommonSeeing that the Federal Government wealth may have in any matter are thois charged with responsibility in all roughly guarded. Something may possibly matters arising, under any' treaty,, it be said in favour of conferring exclusive would be only proper, if such a case did jurisdiction on the High Court in cases occur, that it should be dealt with by the arising under any treaty. That is not a High Court. I put that point as a matter very important matter, but as the honourable of no very great importance from the standand learned member for Bendigo spoke point of litigants, but as of some importance strongly upon it , and as he is absent from the point of view of the dignity of to-day, I venture to call attention to it . the Commonwealth and its Courts. In Further, I do not see why States Courts the same way the honourable and learned should not have concurrent jurisdiction in member for Bendigo directed attention matters affecting consuls. I remember a to the possibility of actions of any case which occurred in Adelaide a few kind being taken against the consuls of months ago, in which action was taken for other countries, and quoted from the the recovery of £15, which had been paid to United States practice in this connection. a consul under the Merchant Shipping Buti t was pointed out to him that under Act, and which sum was held in trust this provision the area covered had been by him for certain sailors. In that case expressly limited to actions against any the consul was sued by a creditor of one Consul in his representative capacity. Thereof the sailors. It was a comparatively upon the honourable and learned member for trivial matter. Surelyi t is not advisable Bendigo admitted that such cases would be that jurisdiction in a case of that sort shall of very rare occurrence, and I understoodbe exclusively vested in the High Court] though he did not discuss .the question If it is, either the suitor will have to await .further-that he was generally satisfied that the visit of a Judge upon circuit, or the suit these two paragraphs might be retained will have to be heard at the seat of Governwithout injury to any one. ment, wherever that may happen to be. I burden of the argument which took place ask the Attorney-General to agree to the was directed against paragraphs (e) and suggestion of the honourable and learned (/), and it is in one of them that I propose member for Bendigo, and to excise paragraphs (ct) and (b) in addition to some of the succeeding paragraphs 1 previously under discussion, I had an opportunity of' replying to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo upon both the points which have been raised. In answer to, an interjection, I think he admitted that he had never known of a case under a treaty arising in Australia, and he had great difficulty in conceiving how one could arise. Under the circumstances, I put it to him that no I will show why. possible injury could follow the retention of remove suits involving a matter .consequence of some alleged breach in a The whole",18,Judiciary

It was admitted that a number of these cases might arise, and it can well be argued, that if litigants have to await the sittings of the High Courti n remote States, they might be involved in additional expense. I ask the Committee to accept the amendment which I have moved. to move a prior amendment if the Attorney General will permit me to do so. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. which may arise under treaties, I offer no objection to the provision in its present form ; but I think I have already shown that there is some reason for making the jurisdiction conferred by paragraph (b) concurrent. Time after time claims will arise by sailors against consuls, -or by parties having claims against the wages of sailors. Surelyi n such cases it is inadvisable that exclusive jurisdiction should he vested in the High Court. We ought not to increase the expense incurred by l it i gants in such pettifogging cases. I would further point out that this paragraph proposes to confer upon the High Court a jurisdiction which does not exist under the American Constitution. In America the jurisdiction of the Court in such cases is purely concurrent. I therefore move That paragraph [b) be omitted. the Attorney-General will consent to the amendment proposed. I would point out that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the honourable and learned member for Corinella both urged the same objections to this paragraph that are now being put forward by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr visit the remote States more than once in Glynn. I am sure that the Committee desire to prevent the possibility of the expense to litigants being increased. Let me invite the attention of honourable members to what would occur if an action under this clause arose in Western Australia, and required to be determined at once. In such a contingency, theHigh Court would have to go -to Western Australia or the litigants would have to come here. In either case there would be unnecessary expense. Personally, I think that when we come to discuss the appellate clauses of the Bill we can well allow any Court to determine matters such as those which are mentioned in paragraph (b). Then, if the Commonwealth is dissatisfied with any decision in which it is interested, it has the right of appeal from the State Supreme Court to the High Court. Thus the whole difficulty would be solved. I trust that what was the evident desire of those honourable and learned members, who had looked into this question, will be followed. clined to agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. If his idea be adopted I . think that the expenses inW it h regard to cases curred by consuls who desire to secure justice will be increased. I take it that the settlement of these matters by the High Court is necessary to secure absolute uniformity in decisions. If each State Court is allowed to give its own judgment, it may happen that these judgments will be in conflict. of appeal to the High Court. Western Australia who was subjected to a decision by the Supreme Court of that State which conflicted with a judgment by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, would naturally feel that he had been denied justice, and would appeal to the High Court; whereas, if that tribunal had dealt with his case in Perth in the first place, he would have obtained satisfaction at much less expense. Consequently, under the clause as it stands, litigants would secure finality quicker than they would under the amendment proposed. the honourable member for Coolgardie, I would point out that the States Courts practically sit all the year round. If the High Court is composed of either three or five Justices, it will be impossible for them to six months. the litigants might come to the High Court. the expense involved may be so great as to prevent them from obtaining justice.' If appellate jurisdiction is to be vested in the High Court, it is clearly within the power of that tribunal to correct all conflicting judgments. In the event of a decision being given by one of these States Courts, with which the Commonwealth Government was dissatisfied, an appeal would always lie to the High Court. Thus uniformity would",19,Judiciary

That the words ""against the Commonwealth,"" line 19, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""by a State or any person suing on behalf of a State against the Commonwealth, or any person being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth."" The amendment simply renders the subclause parallel with the preceding subclause. We have provided that jurisdiction in suits by the Commonwealth against a State shall be exclusive, and I now propose a similar provision in regard to suits by a State against the Commonwealth. It was generally agreed, when the Bill was last before us, that these were two classes of cases in regard to which tlie jurisdiction might very properly be vested exclusively in the High Court. If any jurisdiction is made exclusive, the jurisdiction contemplated in this sub-clause should also be exclusive. From my own point of view I should trust the States Supreme Courts with any power; but, if the Committee determined to make any jurisdiction exclusive, I see no objection to this sub-clause as amended. It will still be competent for a public servant to bring a suit in a Supreme Court to recover from the Commonwealth salary or damages for wrongf u l dismissal; the States Supreme Courts will still be available for small actions which continually arise between a Government and its employees.

54,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"I s theNorthern Melbourne, and supported by several other honourable members, that concurrent jurisdiction shall in all matters not specified in clause 40 be given to the States Courts. If the States Courts are to have this concurrent jurisdiction why not strike out the whole of sub-clause (2) ? We have just settled what is to be the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court; and the Attorney-General, by 'not excising the words to which I have called attention, leaves any other matters which are not mentioned to be mattprs of exclusive jurisdiction. the jurisdiction back. nary way of drafting 1 In the beginning of the clause we declare certain things which it appears there is to be a subsequent provision to negative. We start by declaring that, in all matters not mentioned in clause 40, the High Court is to have exclusive jurisdiction, and the Attorney-General asks us to do that, because he proposes to immediately afterwards undo it . Surely that is patching rather than clearly drafting a Bill. If the words to which I have called attention be excised, the clause will simply declare that the Courts of tlie States shall, within the limits of their several jurisdictions, have the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth; in other words, that the States Courts shall have all parts of the judicial power, which are not appellate, and which are not, by clause 40, exclusively vested in the High Court. It is the method of drafting to which I object. I do not wish .to move an amendment, but merely to make a suggestion. learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, admits that all that is involved is a question of method-of the manner in which a thing sought to be done is to be done. We are agreed as to what is to be done, and I propose to take steps in the remainder of the clause to accomplish all that the honourable and learned member desires. But I ask the honourable and learned member not to offer any objection to the sub-clause being retained, because it is deliberately adopted with a view to render it perfectly clear that the investing of the Federal jurisdiction is an investing under this Bill of the whole of the Federal jurisdiction in the High Court -wit h a view to putting beyond all question the fact that nothing has been omitted. tion exclusive. the first instance, and then we invest the States Courts, subject to their own limitations, with the whole of this jurisdiction. goes further than that. I .wish to make it perfectly plain that the object is to place it beyond doubt that all Federal jurisdiction is first of a l l exclusively vested in the High Court, and then is shared concurrently with the Courts of the several States. That procedure will, in my opinion, place beyond I s not that an extraordiall question what the f u l l meaning and extent of this investing is, and the method to which exception has been taken, is adopted for this particular purpose. If there be any other point in connection w it h this clause which honourable members desire to discuss, I shall be happy to discuss it ; but I wish it to be perfectly clear on the face of the measure, and perfectly clear in words which, in the opinion of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, are, at the utmost, unnecessary; that the investure of States Oourts is an in vesture of Federal jurisdiction which has been first made exclusive in the High Court, and which then comes from the High Court -as an express endowment of States Courts over again, if honourable members like to so> regard it-of what is distinctly Federal jurisdiction. This is done to mark off the more emphatically the jurisdiction given through the High Court from any jurisdiction at present belonging to the States Courts. ' of a private individual who wishes to recover damages against the Commonwealth 1 vidual may bring his suit in any court. So far as the mere matter of expression is involved, I do not feel justified in interfering with the drafting of the measure. I never do so interfere, because it is utterly impossible for a large body like this Committee to draft a B ill ; and the responsibility in this connection must rest on the Attorney-General. But I think this particular clause raises some very grave questions of substance.

I should not strenuously object to that, as I feel that we may attain the same object in other ways, if the Committee accede to my views. If honourable members will look at what the honourable and learned gentleman proposes to insert in clause <tl in lieu of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), it will be seen that he wishes to substitute the High Court for the Full Courts of the States. I hope I am not dealing with technicalities more than is absolutely necessary, because it is a very important matter, and will go to the very root of the position of the High Court. The amendment saysEvery appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of a State or any other Court of a State .from which, at the establishment of the Commonwealth, an appeal lay to the Queen in Council, shall be broug-ht to the High Court. I think I am right in saying that the object of the Attorney-General is to prevent an appeal from a Judge of first instance in a Supreme Court to the Full Court. new paragraph.

I understand the gentleman shall be carried into effect, and honourable and learned gentleman to wish I think we are justified in calling attention that the several Courts of the States shall to the drafting, because I certainly read be invested with Federal jurisdiction in all -the provision in the form in which he says matters in which the High Court has original it ought not to be read. I take it that it never was the intention of the Constitution to substitute the High Court for the Full Court of the State. It was the intention of the Constitution to give the High Court of the High the same jurisdiction as the Privy Council. Supposing that a man has been made insolvent by the order of a Judge. If he is made insolvent his hands are tied, he cannot deal with his assets. .These are vested in the assignee or trustee, and there he is helpless. Supposing that a mistake has been made, at the prqsent time he is able to appeal to the Full Court, and very often he can be heard the next month. It is important that we should provide that that right of appeal shall not be taken away, because, if we restrict the right of appeal to the High Court, which must consist of three or four Judges at least for the purpose of an appeal, it will mean that the litigant will have to wait the time of five Judges who will have duties all over Australia, as distinguished from five, six, or seven Judgesi n a particular State, and his chances of getting his appeal heard will be much less.

Next we proceed to sayExcept as provided in the last preceding secdowment of the States Courts was absolute,, tion. That, of course, is necessary, because in clause 40 we have left a few matters, which are still to be exclusively in the High Court. But, by this form of words, we make it as plain as it can be made that, with the exception of those few matters, we vest the whole of the jurisdiction of the High Court. Now we come to the first affirmative proposition. We strike out paragraphs (a) (6) and (c) from the sub-clause, and substitute the new paragraph, which was printed and circulated last week, as follows :Every appeal from a decision of a Supreme Court of a State, or any other Court of a State from which at the establishment of tlie Commonwealth an appeal lay to the Queen in Council shall be brought to the High Court. The other Courts which are. there alluded to are the Equity Courti n New South Wales, the Equity Court in Victoria, where the decision of a single Judge may be appealed against to the King in Council, and also that curious Court which is peculiar to . South Australia. the only Courts from which an appeal lay to the Queeni n Council at the time of the passing of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Bill. So that practically the substance of that paragraph relates to the appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of a State. learned member for Northern Melbourne has asked whether that includes a decision -of the Eull Court of the State. I take it that it does, that it in no respect alters, at ail events it is not intended to alter, the present system by which appeals can be taken from a single Judge of a State Court to the Full Court of that State. The paragraph refers only to appeals which, having reached that stage, may atherwise be sent to the King .in Council without going before the High Court, even although they were matters of Federal jurisdiction. This paragraph says that if there be an appeal in such a case, the parties not being satisfied with the decision of the Full Court of the State, that appeal shall be brought to the High Court. The operation of the provision is practically external, if I may use the word, to the practice of the Supreme Court, to which I Mr Deakin. understand that my honourable and learned! friend, the member for Northern Melbourne,, was alluding when asked whether the enand whether or not it was intended to in terfere with their appeals within their own States, I replied distinctly that that was notintended, except so far as paragraph (d), confers that option. We have not arrived, at paragraph (d) yet, but I have called, attention to it .

We have struck out paragraphs (e) and (/) of clause 40. Now, in clause 41, we are giving back again to the High Court the powers we took from it under clause 40. There is a danger in allowing this drafting to remain, because, in passing other Acts, we may forget to state where the jurisdiction shall he. In bankruptcy cases, where, of course, there ought to be a Judge sitting in each State-becaus e it is of the greatest importance to the commercial world that such cases should be settled speedily, whatever decision is arrived at-w e may find people in Brisbane having to wait until a High CourtJ udge visits them, or cases in Perth may be delayed until a Judge of the High Court goes to Western Australia. I cannot understand the Attorney-General's reason for striking out provisions from clause 40, and then in the first three linesof clause 41 practically reintroducing the same jurisdiction. Let me make this matter perfectly Of course, the honourable plain to honourable members. We have first of all struck out of clause 40 certain paragraphs, and have consequently taken away the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court as to those matters. Then, in the first few lines of clause 41, we give back again the whole of that exclusive jurisdiction. It is true that the Attorney-General points out that, in subsequent parts of the clause, there is a limitation as to that exclusive jurisdiction. But, by leaving in these words, the effect may be that in passing patent laws, bankT h e question involves ruptcy laws, and divorce laws, we shall each time have to make provision as to where cases are to be settled, and by what courts they are to be tried. An omission to make such a statement in any f u ture Act would vest the jurisdiction in the High Court exclusively. I cannot conceive of a more dangerous provision being inserted having regard to the contingency that we might allow a Bankruptcy Bill to go through Parliament without making provision for the question of jurisdiction. That would be an entirely MrL . E. GROOM -Can the honourable and learned member conceive of a Bankruptcy Bill that did not provide for the courts by which cases were to be tried ? this clause reinvests jurisdiction exclusively in the High Court. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, agrees with me on tliis point; and I ask the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne whether he is not of the same opinion ? I ask the Attorney General himself whether it is not true that the effect of the first three lines of clause 41 is to give back to the High Court the jurisdiction taken from it by clause 40? MrL . E. GROOM -Has not tlie honourable and learned member failed to read the amendment circulated ? swered by the Attorney-General's silence. learned member is not; this is simply a means to an end. contained in paragraph (d).

It seems to me to be clear that it does so. In clause 75 of the Constitution it is provided that the High Court shall have original jurisdiction in five matters. It was sought, in this Bill, to make that original jurisdiction exclusive. Of those five matters, we have agreed to strike out three. We have left matters arising under any treaty, suits between States, and suits between the Commonwealth and any person. Those are matters in which, under the Constitution, the High Court has original jurisdiction, and upon which, by this Bill, exclusive jurisdiction was sought to be given to it . It is sought now to give the Supreme Courts jurisdiction in matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction, or in which original jurisdiction may be conferred upon it, ""except as provided in the last preceding section."" I am not quite clear which clause that is. I suppose it is clause 41. the whole matter will be very ambiguous. One point is very clear, however, and that is, that what we effected by amending clause 40 is undone by clause 41 as it now stands. that the matter will be made quite clear if a certain amendment, of which he has given notice, is agreed to. I do not think it will. The proposal is that sub-clause (2) shall be amended so that it will read as follows :The several Courts of the States shall, within to carry on pending the establishment of the the limits of their several jurisdictions, whether High Court, and we must remember that on such limits are as to locality, subject-matter, or otherwise, be invested with Federal jurisdiction in all matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction, or in which original juriswill cease. I desire, only as a matter of indiction may be conferred upon it. . . . That is to say, they are to have jurisdiction in respect of all matters under section 75 of the Constitution. That jurisdiction is to be as exclusive as jurisdiction the States Courts are to be invested with. It is. investing the States Courts with all the jurisdiction. very clear to the Attorney-General, or he would not stand by his proposal; but if any honourable member can prove to me that the effect of clause 41 is not to take away directly the effect of the amendments made in clause 40, I shall be happy to receive that explanation. think I should intimate at this stage that I intend to move an amendment of the amendment to insert new paragraph (a), notice of which has been given by the Attorney General. The proposed new paragraph provides thatEvery appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of a State, or any other Court of a State, from which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lay to the Queen in Council, shall be brough't to the High Court. In my opinion, that provision would be void as a matter of law. Mr L. E. GROOM (Darling Downs) -I understand from the Attorney-General that clause 41 vests the superior as well as the inferior courts of the States with jurisdiction 1 Mr L. E.

The Attorney General will also observe that in the Punishment of Offences Act 1901, we make provision the passing of this Bill, all the authority conferred on States Courts under that Act terpretation, to learn whether the Attorney General considers that this clause will be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon all inferior courts to hear cases under Commonwealth Acts, which impose certain penalties No .

113,Mr Deakin,"Before the honorablemoves the amendment of which he has given notice, I should like to reply to the honourable member for West Sydney. I presume that he was absent when I explained that the object of the first sub-clause is to carry out precisely what he desires shall be done. It proposes to take all the Federal jurisdiction outside the exclusive jurisdiction, and vest it in the High Court, in order that the whole of it shall then be transferred from the High Court to the States Courts. I believe that object will be effectively accomplished by the sub-clauses which follow. Having vested the whole body of Federal jurisdiction, outside clause 40, in the High Court, we next provide in subclause (2), in the widest words I have been able to find, that the whole of the Federal jurisdiction shall be vested in the States Courts, subject to certain limitations. We thus give them an area of authority which embraces, as the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out, the vesting of jiirisdiction in them, to deal with cases under all the Commonwealth statutes in which penalties have been imposed, but in which the inferior courts required to act have not been specified. I am unable to conceive of a more complete vesting of all the Federal jurisdiction in the States Courts. upon them. . ing of the possibilities of the future. I take it that the very essence of any amending Act; or any A ct dealing with any extension of jurisdiction that may be passed, will be a provision as to the courts by which that jurisdiction shall be exercised, and the extent to which it shall be employed. It is at this point that I part company with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. I cannot conceive that any House of Parliament would be so blind to the position as to proceed to greatly extend the jurisdiction of the High Court, or other Federal tribunals, without at the same time making provision for the exercise of that jurisdiction. Even a Parliament in which there, was not one member of the legal profession would not do that. I am not attempting, in this Bill, to provide for all the extensions of jurisdiction which this Parliament, or future Parliaments, may think fit to authorize. "" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" Surelyi t is enough to provide here, in the amplest way, for all the matters with which we have power to deal, and all the jurisdiction which we are actually vesting. If we give to the States Courts all the jurisdiction that we now have power to give, why should we enter upon the consideration of questions of what we might or might not give in the future ! 1 the Attorney-General himself has fully justified my objection. When' the Committee dealt with clause 40, it laid down die very definite principle that the High Court should be practically an appellate court. The object which the Committee had in view in making that provision was to save expense. Honourable members saw that if original jurisdiction other than that absolutely conferred by the Constitution were given to the High Court, fifteen or twenty Judges, instead of five, would be necessary, or a number of inferior courts would have to be created. from that principle. admits that he has gone outside it, and that he intends to extend the jurisdiction of the High Court, unless certain restrictive clauses are contained in every measure which we may subsequently pass. If we were to pass any Bill in which there was not a restrictive clause, the jurisdiction to deal with cases under it would vest in the High Court. tion? be the result. The Attorney-General admitted that it would be so when he asked the Committee whether there would not be a sufficient number of lawyers in the House to see that every Bil l brought forward contained a few clauses determining what court should exerpise jurisdiction under it. member is not applying my statement correctly. honourable and learned gentleman can get away from that position. I intend to move That sub-clause (1) be omitted.

123,Mr Conroy,"I do not see how theprinciple laid down by the Committee, that the High Court shall be only an appellate court, he can readily draft a few clauses clearly embodying that proposal. In every Bil l passed by this Parliament in future it will be necessary to provide where jurisdiction under it begins and ends. If we fail to do so we shall find the jurisdiction of the High Court practically exclusive under it . Even if this were not quite so, the practical effect of omitting such a provision would be to vest the High Court with jurisdiction, and in that way we should go beyond the principle that we have decided upon in striking out paragraphs (e) and ( f ) of clause 40, and also certain provisions in clause 31. should like to ask the Attorney-General whether, as the object which he has in view can be accomplished in the way proposed by the honourable and learned member for ""Werriwa-and as there is some doubt as to the expediency of allowing these words to remain-it would not be better to make the amendment suggested. As a matter of fact, I had given notice of an amendment to omit these words before clause 40 was dealt with. This clause is open to an objection similar to that raised to clause 40, .although not to the same extent. Under clause 40, it was originally proposed to confer upon the High Court exclusive jurisdiction, with one exception, in all cases, .arising under section 75 of the Constitution. The one case omitted from that clause, however, was impliedly re-inserted in clause 41, so that the clause was open to the objection which has been so strongly urged by the honourable and learned members -for West Sydney and Werriwa before the amendment was made. The objection holds now with double force'. As the desired change can be made in one general statement instead of two, would it not be better for the Attorney General to allow those words to be struck -out? I quite admit that the subsequent amendment proposed to be made, if we interpret it in the way in which the Attorney-General desires, though it is a l it t l e ambiguous, modifies the effect of the stances the Committee generally will accept retention of these words. But surely it is bad drafting to first put in words which .say a certain thing and afterwards to abrogate them by a subsequent part of the -clause 1 The general rule of construction is that words are put in for some purpose, and if the purpose cannot be clearly shown the Judges will not know what to do. The Attorney General thinks that by the proposal he makes he is really vesting the Courts of the States with full concurrent jurisdiction, and I understand the honourable and learned gentleman to mean that he is giving it wherever the High Court has original jurisdiction, and wherever we can give jurisdiction under section 76 of the Constitution. Mr ,GLYNN -There is an ambiguity in the way in which the honourable and learned gentleman proposes to do that, because the proposed amendment readsIn all matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction, or in which original jurisdiction may be conferred upon it, except as provided in the last preceding section. The jurisdiction may be conferred upon it by a specific A ct of Parliament. The clause may not be read as the Attorney-General, evidently intends that it should be read, "" in all matters in which original jurisdiction can be conferred upon it . "" That is the honourable and learned gentleman's intention evidently. construction. member thinks that "" can"" is better than ""may."" "" can "" will make the clause absolutely clear while the use of the other word will render its meaning doubtful. I think that if the word ""can "" is used it will meet the objection raised by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa. W it h that honourable and learned member I still think that it would be better to redraft the clause, but personally I do not care to interfere with drafting. If the Attorney-General will use the word "" can "" instead of the word "" may"" I shall be prepared to allow this clause to go as proposed. to use the word "" can "" instead of the word "" may."" I hope that under these circummy assurance that this matter has been given most careful consideration.

The time is now ripe to call the attention of the Committee to what I think is a departure from the Constitution. The proposal as re-drafted is that every appeal in a matter which involves Federal jurisdiction from a Supreme Court shall be brought to the High Court. 1 wish it to be quite clear that I understand this is only proposed where there is a question of Federal law or of the Federal Constitution involved. Assuming that in the course of a long case, there is some question raised as to the meaning of the Federal law on divorce, on insolvency, on bills of exchange, or any of the numerous matters with which this Parliament may deal, the idea is to deprive the Privy Council of the right it has at present of hearing appeals upon those matters. that there is no power to deprive the Privy clause it would, perhaps, have been better Council of this right. as of right. present the Privy Council, under an Orderi n Council, made under the A ct 7 and 8 V i c , has f u l l power to hear all appeals from the Supreme Courts of the colonies, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere, so long as the amount involved is over ±'500. It is by virtue of an ImperialA ct that the Privy Council has this right, and it is only by an ImperialA c t that the right can be taken away. Imperial Act, but the Constitution does not All that the Constitution says is that a High Court may be created, and may hear appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States. It does not say that the High Court must hear appeals, and therefore the attempt which is being made is to concentrate, and to drive into the High Court, willy nilly, appeals which at present would go, as of course, to the Privy Council. I his proposal to cases where there is some question of the Constitution, or of Federal law involved. I hope honourable members will understand that I make the admission that the honourable and learned gentleman proposes to limit it absolutely in that way. General limit it absolutely ? I rather think that these words will have the effect of limiting it to cases of Federal jurisdiction, because the amendment to which we have just agreed proposes that the several courts of the States shall within the limits of their several jurisdictions be invested with Federal jurisdiction In all matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction, or in which orginal jurisdiction can be conferred upon it, except as provided intbe last preceding section. Then there is the new proposal involving this condition and restriction :Every appeal from the decision of a Supreme Court of a State, or any other court of a State from which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lay to the Queen in Council, shall be brought to the High Court.

I desire now to raise the substantial question whether there is any right on the part of this Parliament to say to a litigant who has been defeated in a Supreme Court of a State"" You must appeal to the High Court, because there is some question of Federal law involved."" I dispute the constitutionality of the proposed amendment. If one looks at the Order in Council made on 7th June, 1860, in pursuance of the Acts7 and S Victoria, it will be seen that the litigant has a right of appeal in any case in which a Supreme Court of a State decides against him where over £ 5 0 0 is involved. The words areAny person or persons may appeal to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, in her or their diction to any Courti n Australia, but Privy Council, from any finding, judgment, decree, order, or sentence of such Supreme Court of the colony of Victoria in such manner and within such time as hereinafter mentioned. The provision could not be more universal than that. be new laws made after the Order in Council, which for this purpose may be treated as an Imperial Act, wonld not prevent the Order in Council applying. effect of the Imperial Act, taken with the Order in Council, is that, no matter what new laws may be made by the Parliaments of Australia, may be made in the Supreme Courts of New South Wales, Victoria, or any other of the States, the right of appeal lies to the Privy Council. the right, and do frequently decide as to the meaning of Imperial laws. I had a case of the sort only a few weeks ago. In the course of the working out of a case it may become necessary to decide as to the meaning of an Imperial law and a Jortiori, the courts will have to decide as to the meaning of Federal laws. We cannot put Federal laws upon a higher basis than Imperial laws. I claim that the Constitution of the Commonwealth, though an Imperial law, has not altered the Imperial law which gives the right of appeal to the Privy Council. Parliament can change its mind and make any alteration it likes, but I say that so far it has not done so. In 1844 the Imperial Parliament order in Council under the Act, that any person aggrieved by a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, may appeal to the King in Council. Mr Higgins: there is another Imperial Act, passed in the year 1900, which says that the Parliament of Australia may create a High Court to which appeals from the Supreme Court of Victoria, New South Wales, or any of the other States may lie. The Imperial law enables litigants to appeal to the High Court of Australia, but it does not compel them to do so. MrL . E. GROOM -Cannot we give Federal jurisdiction, and limit the conditions under which it shall be exercised ? only of the effect of the clause upon the right to appeal to the Privy Council. It is not now a question of giving Federal jurisdiction. We can give Federal juriswhen any of the Supreme Courts gives a decision under any law one may choose to name, there is annexed to it the right of the litigant who thinks he is aggrieved thereby to appeal to the Privy Council. The mere fact that there may It does not matter what body made the law under which the decision is given. It is not a question of the source of the law ; it is a question of what court gave the So that the decision. ' If a Supreme Court, either through a Judge sitting as a court of first instance, or as a Full Court, gave a decision affecting a matter involving £500, an apand no matter what orders peal would lie as of course to the Privy Council. I know that the Attorney-General is enamoured of the idea of this clause, but he will acknowledge that I suggested to Our Supreme Court Judges have him some weeks ago that I doubted very much whether such a provision could be carried into effect. a clause put into the B ill which is either obviously wrong or will lead to litigation and trouble hereafter. In these matters there must be differences of opinion, however, and therefore I would waive my objection if this particular difficulty 'were referred to any impartial lawyer in practice, and he said that the clause is a right I do not dispute that the Imperial one. leave the matter in doubt ? Cannoti t be put beyond the possibility of doubt ? which is vital to the High Court.

E. GUOOM -The interpretation of the Constitution may arise independently of any of the statutes of this Parliament. however, a vague theory afloat to the effect thab one set of Judges may close its eyes to one set of laws, and another set of Judges to another set of laws; that the State Judges can close their eyes to the Federal laws, and the Federal Judges to the State laws. That is a mistake. The .whole body of law must be consistent, and every State Judge, down to Justices of the Peace, just as much as the highest dignitaries of the High Court, must obey the Federal law. A rule of law must be followed in every court: I venture to respectfully submit to the Attorney-General, however, that the effect of 7 and SV i c , taken with the Order in Council made under it , is to give a litigant the right, if he feels himself aggrieved by aninterpretation of the Federal law, to appeal to the Privy Council. He may, therefore, snap his fingers at this provision compelling him to appeal to the High Court. I will give a concrete instance. Under the Constitution we may make a law-dealing with bills of exchange. Now there is no class of,actions more common than actions upon bills of exchange. Suppose. then that Ave had made a law affecting bills of exchange, and a question arose in one of the States Courts as to the rights of parties under a certain bill for £5,000a question relating to endorsement, to presentation, or to.any other matter. That would be an ordinary commercial case. As things stand now the dissatisfied litigant can appeal directly from the Supreme Court of the State to the Privy Council. But the proposal of the Attorney-General is to deprive litigants of that right, and compel them to go to the High Court. There is to be no appeal to the Privy Council from the ""High Court unless special leave be given, and in most cases there must be a special recommendation from the High Court. That is an extraordinary interference with existing rights, and, not only do I not think it expedient, but I think it impossible. I put my argument on two 4II grounds. First, that it is inexpedient under present circumstances to deprive litiI n cases in which even gants of their right to appeal on commercial causes to the supreme tribunal of the Empire; and secondly, that we have not the power to do so, because we cannot interfere with the operation of 7 and SV i c , which gives litigants the right to appeal to the Privy Council. I have indicated before that I think the option a most unwholesome one, and I know how it will work out in practice. Litigants who are aggrieved by the decision of a. Supreme Court will study the idiosyncra sies of the members of the High Court Bench and of those of the Privy Council before deciding which court to appeal to,, and thus the man who wants to appeal will be able to hold the whip over the man in whose favour the decision is given. trying to prevent that. a provision to that effect would be ultra vires. We cannot abolish the option ; but we can prevent our statutes from becoming foolish. The option is given by the Constitution, and we must abide by it . If we. provide in the Bill that appeals must go in a certain direction, we snail' be exceeding our powers"",' and only, misleading litigants.

153,. . Mr Conboy' (Werriwa),"I thoroughlyby the mode of procedure now being adopted. All that we shall do, if we pass the clause as proposed, will be to create doubt in the minds of the non-legal world as to the meaning of the provision. Laymen, when they read the words ""shall ,be brought in the High Court,"" will think that an appeal will not lie to the Privy Council, and may, therefore, go to the High Court against the wishes of their legal advisers. But where thoy adopt legal advice they will no doubt go to the Privy Council. One of the first rules for the drawing up of a statute is to make it as precise and certain in form and expression as the knowledge of the men who are drawing it up enables them to make it, and we are departing from that practice when we agree to -a provision which, at .best, can result only in tion taken up by those honourable members litigation. I think that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne should be accepted. The words in the Constitution A ct are very clear, and I am at a loss to understand how the Attorney-General can think that they can be got over. Does he suggest that because Federal jurisdiction is conferred upon the Supreme Courts they must, before they allow any appeal as of right to the Privy Council, inquire as to the law under which the decision was given ? If they did, they would practically be saying to litigants"" Although the Constitution entitles you to appeal to the Privy Council from bhe Supreme Court on any matter, as this is a Federal matter you cannot appeal."" Under such an interprebation of the Constitution, an appeal from a decision under tlie Imperial Navigation laws would not lie. Are not our courts called upon every day to interpret Acts passed in other countries? Does the Attorney-General hold that no appeal would lie to the Privy Councili n a case such as that of McLeod v. McLeod in Sydney, which involved tlie interpretation of an American Act? not deal with an American law, but with be very undesirable, even if we had the an A ct passed in New South Wales, and power, to get rid of them. an Imperial Act which had been repealed, and of which one section was still in force optional appeal is fixed upon us by the in New South Wales. General wish us to believe that, if a decision were given in New South Wales upon a able and learned member will admit that question affecting New Zealand law, the the extreme difficulties imposed upon us by Privy Council would refuse to hear an optional appeals justifies us in making appeal ? I contend that, irrespective of the law involved, the moment a decision is given by a State Supreme Court upon any matter an appeal will lie to the Privy Council, and that we cannot take away this right. Perhaps we have the right to limit the power of appeal in matters involving the interpretation of the Constitution, but, even in regard to this point, it is held by some honourable and learned members that, the moment we invest States Courts with jurisdiction, the ordinary course of proceeding will not be followed, and that appeals will lie to the Privy Council. If that view is correct, the objections raised by many honourable members against the Bill on the ground that it is unnecessary are strengthened. The posiwho supported the proposal that original jurisdiction should be given to the High Court would also have been .improved if the committee had not decided against their views. I shall support the amendment, because the first object of a statute should be to lessen litigation, and because, in view of the doubts raised regarding a possible conflict with the provisions of the Constitution, it is necessary to make matters perfectly clear. differ from the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne upon this question, which he was good enough to bring under my notice privately a few weeks ago. The strength of his case on the question of law must be apparent to all honourable members who listened to his extremely clear exposition of his views. They may, however, have been somewhat puzzled when, after exposing with great force the very undesirable position in which we shall be placed if optional appeals are permitted, my honourable and learned friend went on to say that, although disapproving entirely of optional appeals, he yet thought, Constitution, and that we must abide by",32,Judiciary

158,Mr Deakin,"I think that tlie honorevery effort to get rid of them; and that is the object with which the proposal is made in this Bill. I have addressed myself with great care to the Constitution, in order to discover if it is not possible to avoid the optional appeal. I need not at present enter into a discussion as to their inexpediency, because, first of all, if it be not possible I submit, therefore, that under section 77, for us to obtain the desired jurisdiction, we must submit to the double jurisdiction. I fear, however, that it may weigh with honourable members who, whatever their opinion of the legal question may be, are disposed to agree with the law of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Let me now, apart from that aspect of the matter, explain why I sub-clause into the measure, even after my honourable and learned friend was good enough to put to me his own clear and strong views on the question. In the first place, I rely upon the fact to which the honourable and learned member has referred, that the Constitution is an Imperial Act, and carries with it all the authority which Acts creating the appeal as of right to the Privy Council can cany, and that, we are' to read it as passed in the light of existing Imperial statutes, when emanating from the body which having passed these statutes has authority to amend them either directly or by implication. I submit that the endowment which section 73 of the Constitution gives to the High Court may in effect repeal them by implication. Section 73 provides that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences, not only of Justices of the High Court, but of any other Federal Court, or court exercising Federal jurisdiction. It is in the power of the High Courti n fact the Constitution imposes jurisdiction upon it-to hear appeals from any Federal Court or court exercising Federal jurisdiction. The courts which would be affected by this sub-section, are courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. They are Courts of tlie States, and are being endowed with all the Federal jurisdiction we can give them under this clause. important in this connection. Then, if we turn to section 77 we find that with respect to any of the matters mentioned in the previous two sections, that is with respect to any matter of Federal jurisdiction, the Parliament may make laws not only defining 4 H 2 the jurisdiction of any Federal Court other than the High Court, but definingThe extent to which the jurisdiction of an3 r Federal Court shall be exclusive of that which belongs to or is vested iu the Courts of the States. and vesting it or any part of it in State Courts. sub-section 2, it is possible for us to give exclusive jurisdiction to the High Courti n all those matters of Federal jurisdiction which go on appeal to the Supreme Courts of the States, and to require that all appeals in matters of Federal jurisdiction which come before them shall be brought before the High Court. If , then, we have the power to make this appellate jurisdiction have endeavoured to introduce this exclusive, and to shut out the Supreme Courts of the States or to define the extent to which they shall exercise jurisdiction, that implies that we have the right to invest them with power to hear appeals subject to certain conditions. That is what is sought to be done in this clause. First of all, we absorb in the High Court the whole of the Federal jurisdiction, and then invest the States Courts with it, subject to certain conditions. The position I take is that we are empowered under the Constitution to render back the appellate jurisdiction upon Federal matters to the Supreme Courts, with the condition that any appeals from them shall 'be brought before the High Court. They will have no such jurisdiction except under that condition. I admit the force of the contention of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but, notwithstanding the deference which I pay to his opinion, and to the opinions of other honourable and learned members, venture to submit that the Constitution justifies tlie assumption that we have the power to condition these appeals. The inconvenience, loss, and difficulty created by the optional appeal to two different courts justifies us in endeavouring to claim this power. The appeals to the King in Council preserved either by section 73 or l i of the Constitution, are those as of grace as distinguished from those as of Section 71 is right, and as the only appeals with which' we propose to deal in the new paragraph are appeals as of r i g h t I admit our inability to reach appeals as of grace, which would still be retained in these mattersi t seems to me a fair construction to place upon the whole of these clauses when read together, to say that just as section 74 distlie States are accepted by suitors as satisposes of appeals as of right from the High factory. The functions of the High Court Court, and leaves untouched appeals as of would cover a larger ambit, and probably a grace, in like manner sections 71, 73, and 77 great many of the cases coming before it -when read together, empower this Parliawould not be taken on to tlie King in ment to deprive litigants of appeals as of Council. I do riot dispute that there is right from the States Courts always leaving much force in the contention of the them the prerogative appeals as of grace.

163,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"Pernegatived did not hold good in ,all cases. It was held that by implication the prerogative could be cut down. That being so, it is quite open to argument that under the Acts Interpretation Act, and under section 2 of the Constitution which expressly binds the Crown, we may, by implication, limit the power of appeal to the Privy Council as of grace-that is with the permission of the Privy Council. .But subjectv.to that qualification, I agree with the Attorney-General that the appeal as of grace will be open, and that what we are now attacking is the power of appeal as of right. The honourable gentleman declares that where we vest Federal jurisdiction in a court, we can vest it subject to any condition which we choose to impose. To some extent I have answered that contention by showing that we may not be required to vest it by Act of Parliament, because such jurisdiction may have been conferred upon the-States Courts by the Constitution. It is a doubtfulpoint, but iti has been held by some-'and I think by Professor Harrison Moore-that the jurisdiction may exist under section 5 of the Constitution. I believe he even goes further and says that as a matter of general British law this jurisdiction may exist without it being specially conferred by Act of .Parliament. , If .that be so, the appeal i as of right to the'Privy Council exists under the Constitution. The original jurisdiction' exists without' any action being taken by us, and incident to that jurisdiction is the-power to appeal to tlie Privy Council. If , as the Attorney General says, we bestow jurisdiction, it might be we can limit it , but if it exists without us we cannot cut it down. able and learned member say that Federal jurisdiction has been vested in the States Courts? Constitution, which makes that Act as an ImperialA c t binding upon the Crown.. Sir"".'JOHN QUICK -That merely means that the law must be executed. that it has a very much wider' signification. It is argued by Professor Harrison Moore with a good deal of conclusiveness that, altogether apart from the Constitution, as a matter of general British law, this Federal jurisdiction does exist. If that be so, inasmuch as the jurisdiction arises out of this Bill, the appeal to the Privy Council which exists before it is passed will still be open. In the Canadian case of Gushing v. Divpuyi t was laid . down that where Parliament confers a right of appeal it can also take away that right. In that case an appeal was given as of right from the Insolvency Court of Quebec to' the Supreme Court of Canada or the Privy Council. In a subsequent Act, however, the Dominion Parliament, took away that right of appeal by declaring that the judgment of the Provincial Courts in matters of insolvency should be final. In that case it was decided that the appeal of right had been abolished because it had its origin under a Canadian statute, and that what a Canadian statute could confer, it could also take away. Buti t expressly stated that it did not take away the appeal of grace to the Privy Council, because that existed before the Canadian appeal as of right was conferred by a Canadian Act. I mention this to show that there is another side to that which has been taken by the Attorney-General. Some of the lay members of the Committee inay imagine that the power of construing the constitutionality of statutes is absolutely vested in the High Court, subject to anypermissive appeal given to the Privy Council by the High Court, but as a matter of fact,, it is possible that if a point involving the constitutionality of statutes-a n inter se point-aros e in the Supreme Court of a State, under the Federal jurisdiction to be conferred, an appeal would lie direct to the Privy Council. vision. clause does that.

On the last division in the Con-, vention, I was defeated by three votes in making the attempt to abolish all direct appeals to the Privy Council. MrL . E. GROOM -No w we are trying to get back to where the honourable and learned member left off. methods. There is no doubt that this is an attempt to cancel the bungling of the Convention in its final division. On this point the delegates were unfortunately -and , I believe, unintentionally-misle d by their leader and Sir Josiah Symon. I endeavoured to point out that direct appeals were retained, and I was point-blank contradicted by those gentlemen, who said that no appeals weie allowed in Canada. ""What bhey had in their minds was that there were few appeals fiom the Supreme Court of Canada, but the direct appeals exist of right and grace. The tremendous leakage which will take place in Australia will be from the States, and do what we will, we shall find that there will be very little final jurisdiction exercised by the High Court. The passage of the High Court Bill and the abolition of the appeal to the Privy Council from the States ought to be contemporaneous. As regards the policy, what the clause does is to protract litigation, because really, where a suitor wishes to appeal direct, he is compelled to appeal to a court not of final jurisdiction -that is, to the High Court of Australia. So that we may have two appeals where, if the clause were left out, we possibly would have only one, or ab all events one of the litigants could say that there was to be only one appeal. The probability is that an appeal as of grace from the High Court, if we leave the appeal of the High Court, will be granted in almost all cases. The Privy Council refuses to allow appeals as of grace from the Supreme Court of Canada except in very rare cases of public importance, or where something more than mere money, is concerned. Buti t acts on this ground, that the suitor having had the option of two appellate courts-the Supreme Court of Canada and the Privy Council-ha s It does not relieve us of chosen one and is bound by his option. There is no option given by this clause, so that the reason which frequently influences the Privy Council to refuse these appeals And the optional appeal does not hold in this cuse, because the suitor is compelled to go to the High Court. I therefore contend that in almost every case the Privy Council will grant an appeal from a Judge of the High Court. If that is so, the best thing we can do is to diminish the opportunities for appeal by leaving out the clause. For that reason, if a division is called for, I shall vote against it. Yes ; but by sinister Mr MoCAY (Corinella) ! listened with very great attention to the view put by the Attorney-General as to the constitubionaliby of the clause. But I confess that I was unable to go with him in his reasoning to the conclusion at which he arrived. He has had to say in effect that, taking section 73 of the Constitution with section 77, he could spell out from the two an implied power to place a condition upon the bestowal of jurisdiction on the Courts of the States. Section 73 deals solely with one of the courts created by the Constitution, or that may be created under the Constitution, but does' not deal .in any way with the jurisdiction to be bestowed on existing courts on which we have the light to bestow further powers. Then, if we look at section 77, upon which the honourable and learned gentleman relied, we find in sub-section (2) that the Parliament may make lawsDenning tlie extent to which the jurisdiction of any Federal Court shall be exclusive of that which belongs to or is invested in the Courts of the States. If I understand the honourable and learned gentleman aright, he says that that power implies an aublioriby to limit the jurisdiction. bhe granting of the appeal, because we can define the extent to which the jurisdiction shall be exclusive. and learned gentleman says that the word "" e x t e n t "" implies the power to impose a condition.

Consequently sub-section (2) of section 77 does not refer in any way to States Courts invested with Federal jurisdiction.

Buti t does not convey the power to impose a condition upon the investment of tlie States Courts with Federal jurisdiction. It does not convey the power to define the extent to which Federal jurisdiction shall be bestowed upon States Courts, because, when we come to sub-section (3), we have the investing power given without any corresponding power of defining the extent. Sub-section (1) refers solely to courts created by the Parliament. In sub-section (2) the words ""any Federal Court,"" refer solely to courts created by the Parliament, and it is only in the case of courts created by the Parliament that we can define the extent of their jurisdiction in the sense in which we can impose a condition with respect to jurisdiction. In sub-section (3) -beyon d section 71, of course-w e get the only express authority for investing States Courts wibh Federal jurisdiction. There is no power to be spelled out of that sub-section, or any other portion of the chapter which allows us to impose a condition at the same time that we invest the Courts of the Sbates wibh Federal jurisdiction. WhatI mean is that, having decided that the State Court is to have a given Federal jurisdiction, we must bestow that jurisdiction along with all the incidents and righbs of litigants which belong to the State Courb in the exercise of its ordinary Sbabe jurisdiction; that the only ground on which we can say that a State Court can have the jurisdiction bestowed on it limited with respect to the right of appeal is that we have the authority to define the extent of its jurisdiction, which we cannot do. The wording of sub-section (1) and sub-section (2)-to define ""in one case the jurisdiction and in the other case the extent to which the jurisdiction shall be exclusive-varie s so markedly from the third sub-section, which authorizes us to inI know. It says the vest the States Courts with Federal jurisdiction that it seems to me there is a very cogent argument to be drawn from these words to the effect that the Constitution has almost, in so many words, distinguished between what we can do with regard . to Commonwealth-created courts, and what we can do wibh regard to previously existing courts. Sub-section 2, when it is read carefully, seems to me to give only a power to assert that the jurisdiction shall be exclusive-nothin g else surely the power to assert that the jurisdiction of Court"" A,"" shall be exclusive, cannot be read to mean that Court"" B "" may haveaconditionimposedupon the jurisdiction vested in it , which is not made exclusive in Court"" A .

When we find irresistible inferences arising from express words, it will require a very strong impli cation to be gathered from the general sense of the chapter on the Judicature to justify us in overriding those inferences. I feel compelled, on the ground of law, to say that this sub-clause is not within the authority of this Parliament; because having invested the States Courbs with Federal jurisdiction, having said that they shall have power to hear cases arising under laws made by the Commonwealth, we propose to say that there shall be no appeal in the ordinary way.

We do not want to pass .laws here of .such a character that -there shall be a chance of any custom growing up of reserving 'measures, .unless in cases in which the Constitution positively orders such a step. gard to the matter of appeals, it seems to me-and I expressed very much the same view during the debate on the second reading-that so long as we, as a matter of fact, have no finality, or anything like finality, in the High Court, it is not desirable to introduce another stage in litigation. as we can get. in Australia as we can get, but I do not think that finality will, be attained, under existing conditions, by merely introducing a fresh stage, or possibly fresh stages, of litigation, and thereby giving rise to appeal after appeal,, until the Privy Council is reached.' There is a great deal in what was said by the honourable and learned member foi-South Australia, Mr Glynn, as to the' probability of leave of appeal to the PrivyCouncil being given iu a large number of cases. If under this clause every appeal went to the High Court, many litigants, whether satisfied or dissatisfied with the result, would probably be thoroughly satis:fied with the bill, or bills, of costs which would come in due course, and consequently a great number of appeals would stop, because of reasons other than the satisfactionif such'a term may be used-of a litigant with the decision against him. I base my objec-' tion to the clause chiefly on the ground that I do not see any authority in the Constitution for imposing a condition on a State Court which we have invested with Federal jurisdiction. I can see reasons for arguing that, given a Federal Court, we can impose conditions on that court. I may have grave doubtsroh :that -point, but I cannot-probably' , -through /my.owri fault in i not properly following' the (arguments of the Attorney-General-se e at;.the present time any ground for .imposing any condition, and, therefore, I feel it .my duty to oppose the honourable gentleman's proposal.

There is another argument by which the view of the Attorney-General can be sustained. The High Court, under the Constitution, has the right to hear appeals from the States Courts';' and it is, therefore, quite clear that where there is a Court of Appeal presiding over courts of inferior jurisdiction; tlie-Court of Appeal has the power of'removal, and that that power of i removal exists'both'during the hearing of a suit,' and after the decision is given.

Constitution ; if it be given, it is only given by implication, as a power necessary and proper to carry into effect some express power. The power of removal is certainly not, in strictness of language, a grant of original jurisdiction : it pvesup]X>ses an exercise of'original jurisdiction to have attached elseI enterwhere. ' The existence of this power of removal is familiar 'in courts acting according to the course of the commonlaw, in criminal as well as civil cases,'and it is'exercised before as well as after judgment. But this is always deemed, in both cases, an exercise of appellate, and not of original jurisdiction. According to that principle the High Court of Australia would, in any case dealt with by the States Courts in the exercise of Federal jurisdiction, have power, as the Court of Appeal, to remove a cause from the States Courts, whether or not this provision proposed by the Attorney-General be passed. If that can be done by the inherent authority vested in the High Court as a Court of Appeal, I see no objection whatever to an express provision in the B ill vesting in the High. .Court, in the first instance, the -exclusive right of appeal from the States Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. Also, on the ground of' expediency, I think, it would be better to accept the proposal so as to avoid -any option in a case where one party desired to go to the Privy Council, while the other party desired to go to the High Court. Of. course, the proposal does not in any -way interfere with the inherent power, which is still vested in the Privy Couiicil, to grant leave to appeal from the decision of a.State Court; and it is not proposed to take away that power. All that is taken away by :the Attorney-General's proposal is the legal right to appeal under Orders in -Council. Nor does the provision' interfere with the ultimate right of the Privy. Council to grant leave of appeal from decisions of the High Court provided.no'constitutional question is No ; it is an involved Under .these: circumstances, I feel' quite .justified, <afceordirig to constitutional principles, as well as on the grounds of expediency, .in;supporting the proposal of the Attorney-General.x»J . . .",39,Judiciary

Every power capable of use is capable of abuse. That is true not only of legal powers, but of every power which exists. The. more strength a machine has to perform its work the greater the danger if it is misapplied. must consider that the important part of section 74, which requires that questions as to the limits inter se, of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, or of a State or States, shall not be taken from the High Court, without the consent of that body, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, may become a dead letter unless it is safeguarded by provisions of which this is one and an effective one. which is not covered by the clause just passed? peal-as the last stage of a series of appeals. and learned gentleman's contention was that a litigant might get to the Privy Council on an inter se question behind the back of the High Court. How could he, in view of the clause we have just passed ? the mind of the honourable and learned member, I did not intend to do so. WhatI pointed oub was that we have one provision under which suits, after they have passed through all the stages in which the States Courts can deal with them, are brought before the High Court on appeal. I used the word ""provisions"" deliberately, because this is another provision which will enable us to interrupt that long course of procedure in certain cases, and in those cases, directly it the Committee to consider. becomes clear that a question of the character to which I have referred is being raised, there will be a means of removal. them a prospect of having to go through a State Supreme Court to the High Court, would they not exercise their option in the lower court of going direct to the High Court from a single State Judge? do that under the Bill. just now, and the Attorney-General replied under the provisions of this Act the High Court The facb thab the Federal that they could go direct from a State Police Court to the High Court. but what I am coming to now is the power proposed to be vested in the Attorney General of intervening in any suit. That is the second proposal in bhis clause. I take it that it would be bhe duty of the Attorney General to intervene at any The Committee stage of a case at which it became plain that a serious constitutional question was arising. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs interjected that it would probably .appear on the pleadings, but it will be admitted that whenever it arises it would be desirable that the suit should be transferred at once to the High Court because such a question can only be finally dealt with by the High' Court, and, in fact, ib rests with the High Court under the Constitution to say whether it shall ever be dealb wibh by any obher court. Those who desire to shorten legal proceedings, and to see finality obtained as soon as possible, will T h a t provides an apsurely not complain of a provision which enables cases of bhat particular character to be brought to the speediest possible trial I understood the honourable in the shortest possible way ? move a cause to a hearing before a single Judge of the High Court, or to the Appellate High Court direct ? clause, to a single Judge of the High Court.

For instance, if it was a removal whilst still in the court of first instance it would go before a single J udge ; but if it had passed' the court of first instance, and leached the appeal stage, it would go to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction. is taken from the Court of first instance, what saving would there be 1 would get at once to a FederalJ udge whose particular business it is to deal with Federal issues, who will be dealing with them every day, and who may, therefore, be expected to deal with the cause more rapidly and more definitely than it is likely to be dealt with by some tribunals before which a litigant may find himself. Asi t stands, this power of removal safeguards every power of appeal with which we have been dealing. The power of removal will be useful to litigants, and it may be extremely valuable to the Commonwealth as a whole when exercised by the Attorney General, as it would be exercised, only in cases meriting that special and extraordinary interference. No Attorney-General could be found who would lightly or willingly intervene in litigation in order merely to change the tribunal before which a cause was being heard. It would require to appear upon the face of it that an important Federal issue was involved. Mi-. THOMSON An Attorney-General who was trying to build up the High Court might intervene suggested, similar to the illustrations already given, in which it is desirable that the business should be dealt with by the High Court, which will be able, not only to deal with it more speedily, but upon more consistent and uniform principles than we can expect every particular tribunal before whom it may come in the States to apply. only to the Appellate High Court, and not to a Judge of the High Court of .first instance. Those Judges will differ among themselves as much as do the Judges of the States. with these questions. If the Committee consider that the power of removal can be safeguarded effectively by making it a removal always to the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court, we can consider that proposal. on appeal then.

Sometimes that can be obtained without this mode of removal. ' ""WhatI wish to impress upon the Committee is the importance of the power, and at the same time my entire willingness to consider any proposal that will safeguard removals, and which authorize it only upon reasonable and proper grounds, so as to prevent it being made what one of my honourable friends calls an instrument of oppression. I am perfectly prepared to consider any limitations either of the matter to be removed or the manner of removal. I have no desire to multiply proceedings or to increase costs. the words "" on appeal"" after the word "" pending "" to begin with. retain this power as a safeguard, in order that the class of cases for which the Federal Court is specially created, and to decide which it will exist, may be brought M a n y matters might be before it when necessary, in the most summary and inexpensive manner. That is the design underlying all the removal clauses, and I hope I shall have the assistance of honourable members in shaping them in any better form than is at present proposed to achieve that end. I do not desire that they should be unduly elaborate, coercive, or cumbrous. I hope that honourable members are agreed as to the necessity of possessing a power of removal, and am willing to accept their assistance to so safeguard its exercise, and the manner of its exercise, as to meet all the objections we can.",45,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

In either case there will be an appeal to the High Court, so that there will be no saving in time or expense by the removal. On the contrary, probably some time will be lost, because, I venture to say that, whether three or five Judges constitute the High Court, the original jurisdiction of that tribunal will not be exercised as speedily as the primary jurisdiction of the State Court. If a case should be partly heard, and one of fhe parties desired to remove it to the High Court, the whole of the proceedings before the State Court would have to be repeated before the High Court. Then there would be the expenses attendant upon the application for removal. Presumably the application would be made upon notice, and there would be a fight before the High Court as to whether or not the cause should be removed. The exercise of the right of removal of a cause from the primary Judge or Judge of first instance will not result in any saving, and if the power of removal is limited to pending appeals it can be exercised only in regard to appeals from a single J udge of a State Court to the Full Court of the State, in view of a subsequent appeal to the High Court. A single stage in the proceedings might be saved by the party who had won before the single J udge removing the cause from the appellate jurisdiction of the State Court to the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court; possibly because he might think that he would lose before the Full Court of the State and win before the High Court. would not occur with frequency, or be of sufficient importance to justify the retention of the clause. Then the question arises whether the ultimate decision of the High Court could be evaded. I think that the Attorney-General will admit that the clause does not offer any safeguard unless regard is had to the fact that under it a litigant could bring before the High Court a case involving less than the appealable amount elsewhere provided for. It would rarely be worthwhile to transfer such a case to the High Court.

Therefore, as regards the individual the proposal cannot make for economy or speed, whilst as regards important matters affecting the Commonwealth, the causes must ultimately go to the High Court if the litigants have the necessary money, or, if they have not, it is open to the Attorney-General to provide Such cases the funds for the appeal without exercising the power of removal.

262,Mr Mccay,"We have not reached thatthat is not achieved by provisions already passed relating to appeals to the High Court. The Attorney-General has stated that he is prepared to agree to modifications, and I would suggest to him that it is not desirable to remove causes from courts of first instance to a single Judge of the High Court. We may regard the courts of first instance as capable of dealing with these matters, and getting the causes into form for decision, and if the clause is retained it should apply only to cases pending appeal from the court of first instance to the appellate court. The Attorney General might also consent to the elimination of the power of intervention by the Attorney-General, because for all practical purposes the High Court will have ultimate jurisdiction under the clause already passed ; that is, assuming that that clause is intra vires of the Constitution. Perhaps the arguments upon this head used against the clause to which I refer might also be urged, though with perhaps less force,. against this clause. I ask the Attorney-General to agree to that limitation of the clause, and then let us decide whether the clause as amended shall or shall not be retained. that the clause should be struck out altogether, though, of course, I agree with the honourable member for Corinella that it should be amended in the direction which he suggests. But I fail to see that it is required. provide for removal before appeal. opportunity for the saving? passed we added a stage, so that I suppose the Attorney-General now wants to save a stage by way of counterbalance. But the clause is unnecessary. The power of removal was regarded in the case of Martin v. Hunter as inherent in the American Supreme Court under the implied powers of the Constitution, because otherwise the decision of the State Court might have been final. In that case it was laid down, not only that there is a power of removal to prevent States Courts from giving decisions upon questions of jurisdiction which could not be checked, but that the Federal Parliament was obliged to create Federal Courts in which to vest Federal jurisdiction. If a removal from an American State Court were not allowed, there would be no possibility under the American system of checking its decisions, because there is no Privy Council to appeal to. But here there is the right to appeal from the States Courts to the High Court in all matters, and there is the check of the Privy Council as well. Therefore, our need for a provision like this is nothing like so great as the need for the power under the American Constitution. But this clause is far more comprehensive than the American provision. In America there is no power of removalexcept in one or two cases in which justice might otherwise be denied in small matters arising in the district courts, or where a public officer is concerned unless the amount in dispute exceeds 2,000 dollars. Under the clause, however, a constitutional question might arise during the hearing of an action upon a bill of exchange, because the clause does not apply only to constitutional questions arising under section 74, and affecting the mutual rights of the Parliaments of the States and of the Commonwealth to pass laws, but to all Federal matters. That is the meaning of "" Federal jurisdiction."" MrL . E. GROOM -It will' depend upon the meaning placed upon the words "" for sufficient cause shown."" discretion of the court; but a litigant would have the power to put his opponent to the expense of an appliA stage will be saved if we cation, even though the case was only one upon a bill of exchange in which £ 5 was A stage may be saved. in dispute. About 90 per cent, of the cases which would come under the clause are such as occur at the present time-Stat e cases. The chief end which the Attorney General has in view is to provide for the removal of cases where decisions are given on constitutional matters, but to do that he asks us to give the power of removal in all cases, sweeping into one net all the cases which may arise under section 51 of the Constitution. That is bad legislation. We should confine the operation of the clause to the necessities of the case. The honourable and learned gentleman, however, seems to act upon che principle that if we want to do a little we must do all. W it h regard to the power of intervention given to the Attorney-General, I think it is provided for in the. wrong place.

268,Mr Glynn,"That is a matter for theof a State Court or of the High Courti n original jurisdiction, and the litigant does not wish to take his case on to the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth should be allowed to do so. I go further, and say that in certain cases the Attorney-General of the State should be allowed to intervene, and bring a matter on appeal to the High Court, or to the Privy Council, whichever Parliament likes to fix upon. Suppose that in a small matter in a District Court the question of the rights of the Commonwealth Parliament and a State Parliament inter se arose, and a decision was given affecting the constitutional powers of one of those bodies, and the litigants' had not sufficient funds to conduct an appeal. In such a case the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, if , the Commonwealth was concerned, and the Attorney-General of the State if the validity of a State law was affected, should be allowed to intervene, and have the question authoritatively settled once and for all. That might be done at the expense of the, Commonwealth or of the State, whichever was affected. I think there is some power of that sort in the Canadian Constitution.' A t all events there is a power of, reference. If a constitutional point is raised in any of the lower courts in Canada, it can be carried on to the Supreme Court or to the Privy Council, by the Attorney-General raising a point by way of opinion, and that is a much more independent way of dealing with the matter than the method provided for here, because the actual issue between the litigants is not decided, but only the constitutional point involved. here, the rights of the parties may be affected, both as to the amount of the judgment given and the costs. In Canada, however, the judgment is not affected. All that is done is to carry the constitutional point on to the Supreme Court or to the Privy Council. No such power exists under our Constitution, though some of us did our best to have provision made for it . We can, however, provide that where an important constitutional point arises in connection with appellate casesand I think that the provision might be limited to matters of constitutionality arising under section 74-and is left undecided by the litigants, the Attorney-General of theCoinmonwealth, or the Attorney-General of the State, may step in and have it dealt 4 I 2 with by way of appeal. But that power should not be given in this clause, because it has relation only to appellate jurisdiction. But, under this clause, power is given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, though not to an Attorney-General of the State, instead of waiting until a decision is given, to intervene at any stage, either in the beginning, or after judgment has been given. But if it is right that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should have that power, it is right that it should be given also to the Attorneys-General of the States, because not only may the powers of the Commonwealth be challenged, but the powers of the States may also be challenged, and provision should be made for such an occurrence. Honourable members will therefore see that the clause is imperfect even from the point of view of the Government, because it gives to one party only a remedy to which both are entitled, and which ought to belong to the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. Under these circumstances I think the Attorney-General should not continue his opposition to the wish of honourable members to have the clause omitted. If he amends the appellate clauses with a view to allowing the intervention of a State or the Commonwealth after judgment has been given, there are many reasons why such a provision should be supported, and then the omission of this clause will not destroy the whole object that he has in view. retained we can miss a stage. much objection to that, but all the honourable Under the method provided and learned member wants to accomplish is accomplished at the present time. I think that he should adopt the suggestion of the' honourable and learned member for Corinella, and even go further, and make the clause apply only under section 74 of the Constitution Act, where the constitutionality of a statute is affected. I would, therefore, suggest the insertion, after the word "" jurisdiction,"" in line 2, of the words "" under section 74 of the Constitution."" That may cover cases in which it is desirable that the High Court should have the first and only say. They are partly provided for already, but if the Attorney-General wishes to have a subsidiary provision, and amends the clause in that direction, I shall not vote against it, though without such an amendment I must do so.",49,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

270,Mr Glynn,"Possibly. I do not seeSir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I believe that the power of removal is part of the appellate power, and, consequently, I cannot object to that portion of the clause which provides that in special cases the High Court may remove a cause pending in a State Court upon the application of one pf the parties. So far, I am with the honourable and learned member in charge of the Bill, on the grounds which I have previously stated, but I take strong objection to the power reserved to the Attorney General to remove. I do not see why he should intervene to remove a private suit during its hearing in a State Court which is exercising Eederal jurisdiction. Why should he remove a case during its progress through a State Court? Let the parties fight it out, and let it be determined by the State Court first. of the clause. the honourable and learned gentleman say that. If that part of the clause is omitted, my objection to the clause will be removed. It may be, however, that provision should be made in some other part of the Bill for special cases where the decision of a Supreme Court has been given upon a Federal question. taken further? Sir JOHN QUICK not taken further. .The interests of the Commonwealth may in some indirect way be related to, or determined by, a decision in a State Court, or a State right or a Federal right might be left in doubt. It might be desirable in such a case to allow the Attorney-General to cause an appeal to be made, so that the matter might be dealt with by the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction. remove while a case is pending before the State Court, the removal will be practically an appeal. Sir JOHN QUICK It would be an appeal after determination. If that portion of the clause to which I object is removed I shall support the clause. that the Attorney-General should have power as of course to remove a cause. But I think the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should have power to protect its interests in some shape and form when the exceptional circumstances of the case require it . happen. cases he should be under the same obligation as either of the parties to show sufficient cause for removal to the High Court. I should not object to allow the Attorney General of the Commonwealth or the A t torney-General of a State to intervene in a case if sufficient cause were shown to the High Court, which would mean that the court would be called upon to say that there were good reasons for its removal. I think the case might be met by reserving to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and to the Attorney-General of a State, leave to apply to intervene in a cause in its primary stage. In a case before the I shall not press that part Supreme Court, or any other Court of a State, it might be very important that the Attorney-General of either the Commonwealth or the State concerned should be present before the facts were finally decided. We know that when the facts of a case are finally decided, the question of law may run almost as a matter of course. It may be of the . highest importance, in some particular .case, that the Commonwealth and the State shall be And the matter is not protected in regard to the determination of the facts, because, after a case goes to apA n d the matter is peal, the facts are not as a rule raised again,, and the court decides the law on the facts as put before it ; and, for a long time after, the facts as found in a particular case may limit the law in the particular State concerned. It is therefore important that the facts shall be rightly found, so that all courts and persons may act upon them properly from the beginning. Subject to that, I see no reason why power should not be given to suitors to apply to the High Court for an order to remove any cause involving a matter of Federal jurisdiction, which is pending in any State Court.. I think that the fallacy lurking in the minds of honourable members is that upon any such application being made, the High Court will, as a matter of course, order such removal, whereas the clause under discussion merely empowers the High Court"" for sufficient I do not agree cause,"" to order it . In other words, if that tribunal thinks that any particular case is of so exceptional a nature that it ought to be removed from a State Court, it has the power to order it s",50,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

In each case, power is given to order the removal of any cause provided that it is of an exceptional nature. the Attorney-General power to extend the original j urisdiction ? that the Attorney-General should have a right to remove causes from the States Courts to the High Court as a matter of course.

I think it would be very dangerous to concede the power to remove causes at any stage. . I know well enough how such a power would be abused Let us take for example a case connected with bills of exchange, which come within the Commonwealth competency. Every civilized country has provided means for deciding the liability of a man upon bills of exchange by summary process. Under the present law of Yictoria and New South Wales, after the issue of a writ, a defendant is no longer able to prevent'the plaintiff from obtaining his rights by postponing theevil day as long as he can, by protracting the proceedings. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment, and the defendant must show that he has a good defence, or judgment is given against him without allowing him an opportunity, to be heard. This practice is a great convenience to banks and other financial institutions. But, under this clause, what will happen ? I say unhesitatingly that, under its operation, frequent endeavours will be made to remove causes from the States JOHN QUICK -Why not say-""for Courts to the High Court with the view to delaying the course of justice. It should also be recollected that delay very often affords an opportunity to litigants to get rid of property, and it is, therefore, highly inadvisable to confer upon them the power to remove actions at any stage. I was very glad that the Attorney-General intimated his intention to prevent the removal of causes until they had been fully heard by the States Courts. MrL . E.

What honourable members do not sufficiently realize is that under the Commonwealth Constitution the operations ' of this Parliament cover a far wider area than do those of the States Legislatures. If we compare the matters in which our Parliament has jurisdiction under section 51 of the Constitution with those in which the United States Congress has jurisdiction, we shall find that there is an enormous difference between them. When we commence to enact laws relating to banking, currency, bills of exchange, and divorce, it will be found that nearly every matter of commercial import, and a great many of social and domestic concern, will come within the scope of our legislation. Why should not cases of divorce, or cases relating to infants, or to companies, be tried by the Supreme Courts of the States? All such cases are at present dealt with by those tribunals. Of course, the honourable and learned member for In d i will say that it will rest with the High Court to determine whether sufficient cause has been shown for the removal of any cause from the States Courts to itself. But I would point out that each case involves the making of an application, and that most ingenious attempts will be made to raise issues which never would be raised but for this power of removal. I think there is a strong feeling both in this Chamber and elsewhere that the more the functions of the High Court are restricted to matters of appeal the better. number of cases under the ordinary Federal laws with which the tribunals will have to deal. Very often I see obvious evidence of rich litigants by means of numerous applications compelling poor suitors to submit to an unjust com-' promise. I am quite sure that the Committee have no desire to countenance that sort of thing. I hold that the power of removal is a very exceptional one to confer, and 1 would point out that in the United Statesi t is very limited. May I remind the Attorney-General that in the United States a suitor cannot remove any cause from the States Courts in which the sum involved is less than' 2,000 dollars. It must be a very exceptional case. But, apart from that limitation, there is no power to remove causes unless the State Court has decided against a Federal Act, or in favour of a It must be remembered State Act. do not think there is any limit as to amount. The Removal of Causes, page 146, I find the following:The amount in dispute in an ordinary case must exceed the sum or value of 2,000 dollars to make it a removable one. The Attorney General desires to apply the power of removal to a far wider area of causes than is covered in the United States. No doubt he is actuated by the laudable anxiety that the Judges of the High Court shall have plenty of work to perform, but I do not desire them to obtain that work at unnecessary expense to litigants. I feel that he will serve his purpose better-havin g regard to the temper of the country and of Parliament-if he will allow the functions of the High( ourt to be confined as much as possible to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Of course, I do not attempt to predict the decision of the Committee in regard to the number of Judges to be appointed. But I think that the general tendency of the voting will be in the direction of limiting the number of Judges, and limiting the jurisdiction, making it as far as possible a court of appeal in Federal matters. I would ask the Attorney-General to consent to strike out the words "" at any stage of the proceedings before final judgment,"" and although I would not ask him to consent to do it right off, he might consider whether he There will be an enormous would not take away the power of removal before final judgment, and simply leave the ordinary right of appeal.

I can see that if we keep the power of removal, there is a distinction between a cause in which the Constitution is involved, and a cause in which a Federal law is involved. There is no real need for removing a cause because a mere Federal law is involved ; but there may be a ground for removing a cause where the Constitution is involved. A Federal law may be amended if it seems to be uncertain. It should be remembered, also, that Federal laws include divorce laws, bills of exchange laws, company laws, and mercantile laws generally. MrL . E. GKOOM -They may involve matters affecting the Constitution. effect of Federal laws. That is very different from a question of whether a Federal law or a State law goes against the Constitution. In a case where there is only a question as to the meaning of the Federal law, I do not see why there should be the power of removal, but in a case where there is a question as to the scope and ambit of the Constitution I can see that there is much more reason for that power, and although I think that it might be omitted, I suggest that as an alternative. collected the meaning of the Committee from the interesting discussion which has been maintained in connection with the clauses. AlthoughI felt that tlie changes made in the measure would require alterations here, I thought it best to endeavour to obtain the mind of the Committee before essaying that difficult task.

As I take it , the trend of the mind of the Committee is to limit this power of removal as far as possible to the appellate stage, to make it ancillary to appeals, and, if possible, to indicate the cases in which alone it shall be applied, to make it in all cases dependent upon the High Court, being satisfied that there is substantial ground for that removal, and possiblyI have noted it I would go even farther -to limit its area to cases arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. I must confess that it was the illustrations drawn from that class of cases which principally occupied my mind when 1 was previously speaking. Having now an indication of the mind of the Committee in regard to the clauses preceding, I hope I shall be able to submit amendments which shall represent the sense of the great majority. relating to the Attorney-General? to leave the Attorney-General power only on the same terms as any other person if I I am speaking of the do not make a separate provision allowing the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of the States to refer certain cases as was suggested by my honourable and learned friend, Mr Glynn, or in the manner suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi. That proposal seems to me to be one which, if separated from this clause, might be very useful. It certainly could not prejudice the interests of any litigant, while it might assist the. solution of difficult problems if such happen to arise in minor cases which would otherwise not be brought to appeal. The decision in such I hope that I have a case might, within a State at all events, and perhaps over a wider area if it were a court exercising Federal jurisdiction, operate unfavorably to the construction of the Constitution which, in the interests of the Commonwealth, ought to be maintained. If honourable members will pass the clause as it is it will be reprinted, and they will then be able to grasp with less difficulty the significance of the amendments I shall propose.

A Judge has a better chance of providing for his old age than the average working man. I do not propose to vote for pensions to Eederal Judges. They should be left as other people are to provide for their old age. I think that the salaries ought to be reduced, but I am noc prepared at this moment to say what salaries should be paid. I only rose because I thought that the clause was going to be passed without debate. and learned member say to a salary of £3,000 for the Chief Justice, and a salary of £2,500 for the other Judges? MrM c CAY amendment at the present time. Like the Attorney-General, I shall wait to see what the sense of the Committee is. its individual opinion may be the Committee is in a certain way committed by the action of certain of the States Parliaments in voting salaries of £3,500 to their Chief Justices. They only do that because they find it necessary to have a perfectly free choice in order to the States Benches, it stands to reason that get the best men.. I would point out to those honourable members who happen to think that a smaller salary should be paid to the Chief Justice that we are in a certain sense precluded from fixing any amount which we may think reasonable while the States Parliaments retain their present rates of salaries. It stands to reason that we could not get a man to take a smaller salary in one position than he can get in the other position. If I am referred to the example of the United StatesI shall reply that in New York there are 34 Judges whose average salary amounts to £3,500. Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States at £2,100? the State has to pay for its Judges. In making the appointments to the Bench of the Supreme Court the United States is absolutely limited to a number of wealthy men, that is if it wishes to obtain the services of men of known and tried abilities. Of course, if it went outside that class it could get plenty of men to take the positions at a salary of £100. MrA . McLEAN A r e they such inferior I do not see why a Judge men in the United States and Canada? there is a sufficient number of wealthy men at the Bar here-me n of the best experience who are prepared to make the large sacrifice which is involved in the acceptance of a Judgeship chosen for the Bench, as a rule those who have been making the largest incomes at the Bar. it is so, but it does not always follow that a man is willing to give up his practice. I could mention four or five leading men at the bar in New South Wales who have refused to accept the salary which is offered there, and I have no doubt that in one or two cases VicI shall not move an toria has had a similar experience. There are two considerations which should actuate us at tlie present moment. We desire to secure the most suitable men for the positions, and to offer, them what is a quid pro quo for what they must practically give up, and we desire that the best men shall be attracted to the service of the Federal Government as against the service of the States. If the best men are attracted to the opinions of the States Judges will be of more value than the opinions of the High Court Judges. In these days of economy we are all desirous of limiting the expenditure as far as is possible having regard to the importance of obtaining men of the highest ability; and I do not see how we can fix a lower sum for the salary of the Federal Chief Justice than is at present paid to the Chief Justices in at least three of the States. Much as I disapprove of the Government in niany respects, I think they have adopted the only attitude opr-n to them on the present occasion. I was, and I still am, strongly opposed to the constitution of the Federal High Court as quite unnecessary ; but now that we have determined on having a High Court, we ought to be able to select a Judiciary composed of",54,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

309,Mr Conroy,"My own opinion is thatmen who show that their abilities in their outside walks of life are rated at something like the salaries now proposed. It cannot be inferred for a moment that, because in three of the States the Chief Justices each receive £3,500 per annum, three corrupt Parliaments have been ready to give larger salaries than are necessary. the three States. * other two States? I remember when the present Chief Justice of Queensland was elevated to the Bench, the late Sir Henry Parkes, whose public appointments throughout New South Wales reflected great credit on his judgment, and have been of eminent service to that State, said that Queensland could not afford to lose from its political life a man of the abilit}' of Sir Samuel Griffith-that in Parliament he could save Queensland the amount of his salary twenty or thirty times over every year. money for himself. with Sir Henry Parkes on Sir Samuel Griffith's appointment at the time, and am thus able to state his opinion of the loss to fixing the salary of future Chief Justices at Queensland in that gentleman's retirement from public life, and I do not think there is any breach of confidence in making public the circumstance. Whether we like it or not, we are bound by the decision of the various States Parliaments in this respect. has not applied that rule in other matters. kind the States afford a good precedent; at any rate, we do not find that in any of the States there is agitation for a reduction of the salaries at present paid to the Judges. MrA . McLEAN -No future Chief Justice in Victoria will receive £3,500 per annum. member for Gippsland say that the Federal Government could not afford £3,500 per annum for the Federal Chief Justice when three Judges of the States Courts are at present receiving that amount ? I do not believe that we can make the High Court as effective as it would otherwise be unless important as those to be performed in Auswe offer salaries sufficient to attract men who will be a credit to the Judiciary; and under the circumstances I feel bound mu. 1225 to support the Government. No doubt tlie Government would gain more popularity throughout Australia just at the present time if they made salaries low ; but I venture to say that if later on the question was raised as to unsuitable Judges having been selected, they would find themselves accused of false economy. In dealing with the affairs of a continent like Australia we must remember the Roman maxim, the very age of which proves its value-""Sometimes the greatest tax of all is parsimony."" That, I am inclined to think, will be the conclusion arrived at if the Committee do not adopt the proposals of the Government. Mr A. M c LEAN (Gippsland) -It would be a great mistake to pass this clause as it stands. We must remember that the times were very different when the high salaries were fixed for the States Judges: The best talent was then very scarce, as it was possible to earn large sums at the Bar. Those were the golden days when we in Victoria fixed tlie salary of the Governor at £15,000 per annum; and we know that now his salary has been reduced to £5,000, though the salaries of the Judges remain at the original figures. A law has, however, been passed £3,000 per annum, and the salaries of the puisne Judges at £2,500. States Judges receive pensions. MrA . M c LEA N Pensions are also provided in this Bill, and will be dealt with later o n ; at any rate, the question of pensions is not mixed up with the question we are now discussing. orable member is comparing the proposed salaries with thesalariesof the States Judges, it must be remembered that the latter receive pensions, and that the clause providing pensions under this B ill may hereafter be struck out. MrA . M c LEAN But for one consideration I should regard the salaries I have just mentioned as much too high. They are much higher than are paid in other parts of the world. In the United States, with a population of S7,000,000, the Chief Justice receives £2,100 per annum, and the puisne Judges £2,000, and surely the duties they perform must be as tralia, with a population of less than 4,000,000"" I do not think it would be wise to fix the salary of the Federal Chief",55,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

In these days, when the professions are largely overstocked, and a great many legal practitioners are unable to obtain briefs, there will be very little difficulty in pleading at the bar earn much larger getting the best talent available for the Federal Judiciary. When commencing our career as a nation it would be a fatal mistake to fix the standard unreasonably high. In fixing the salaries we must have regard to the maximum, and go down on a graduated scale through the other salaries; and if we fix the remuneration of the Judges-wh o occupy the highest-paid offices-a t an unreasonably high figure, we shall not be able to fix other salaries at an amount proportionate to the services rendered. a large difference between the salary of the ChiefJ ustice and the salaries of the puisne Judges? MrA . M c LEAN the salaries as they are proposed; otherwise I might be disposed to think the difference rather too great. However, I shall not in any case vote for a higher salary than £3,000 for the Chief Justice, because to go beyond that would be to take a mistaken step which we might not be able to retrace. These appointments are practically for l if e ; and after we have induced men to give up the practice of their profession, we cannot break faith with them by reducing their salaries. MrA . M c LEAN And therefore we shall be making a fatal mistake if we fix the salaries unreasonably high. I shall support a reduction of the salaries to at least the limits I have mentioned. do not agree that our hands are tied in any way, but hold that Parliament is perfectly free to do what is deemed best in this important matter. I intend to move that the And the position of salary of the Chief Justice be reduced by £1,000, because in my opinion £2,500 per A man may run the annum is sufficiently high as a commencingsalary. It is much easier to go up than down in the matter of salaries. I do not subscribe to the theory promulgated tonight, that a Judge goes on the Bench merely for the sake of what he can make out of the position.' I read an article today, in the Age or the Argus, by Professor Harrison Moore, who expresses the opinion that Judges sell their law precisely as a grocer sells sugar, or any other commodity. I consider that£3,000 I do not agree with that view. My own opinion is that most of our leading lawyers sacrifice something in the way of remuneration when they are elevated to the Bench. We are told repeatedly that barristers when amounts than they do when they become Judges; and personally I believe that the present Chief Justices in nearly all the States made great pecuniary sacrifice when they went on the Bench. If that be so, it is clear that the Bench has attractions other than those of a monetary character. The prestige and status of a Judgeship are in themselves a high attraction to ambitious men, apart altogether from the remuneration offered. As has been suggested, the attraction of the judicial office is something akin to that of the Premiership of a State. It is well known that the present Premier of Victoria is making a huge sacrifice of income in holding the position he does.

If we must not offer a lesser salary to the Federal Judges than is being paid in ""the States, the same argument would apply to all the civil servants in the pay of the Commonwealth. We have paid smaller salaries in nearly every other case. pays the heads of the Commonwealth Departments about 25 per cent, less than the States pay the heads of their Departments. the case of the Secretary for External Affairs. He gets £ 8 0 0 a year, but the head of a corresponding Department in New South Wales receives £1,100 a year. The Secretary for Home Affairs receives £700, whereas £1,000 is paid in New South Wales. The Secretary to the Attorney General's Department receives £ 7 5 0 a year; a similar State officer receives £950. And so, all through the gamut of these salaries, we have deliberately fixed them at a much lower rate than is paid in the States. vagance there. the other hand, it is only fair to say that I do not believe that the Federal officers have the same amount of work 'to do as have similar officers of the States, for the simple reason that all our functions are not yet developed. Similarly, my own opinion is. that the Judges will not have so much work to do ; that is to say, it will not be so conWhat have we to do with the States? tinuous, and their noses will not be kept so close to the grindstone in the earlier stages of federation, as is the case with the Judges of the States Courts. My object is to give to the court as few functions as possible. It is a much easier matter to clothe the court with greater powers, and to increase the salaries of the Judges at a subsequent period, than to curtail its powers and pay the Judges less, once the court becomes a settled institution in the country. We see how difficult it is to interfere in any way with the present States Courts. Reductions ought to be made in connection with all of them. That is the doctrine that is being preached industriously throughout the Commonwealth. Buti t is found to be a matter of prodigious labour and of almost insuperable difficulty to curtail the privileges Werriwa has said that in the State of New and the functions of State institutions in any way whatever.

I move this amendment with the object of fixing the salary at £2,500 a year. of us will vote with the honourable member. £2,500 would be an adequate salary.' MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I do not desire to enter into this question very seriously after the debate of a legal character which we have had to-night; but I wish to say that I cannot see that the Chief Justice will have much more work to do than the other Judges. Therefore, if we reduce the salary of the Chief Justice to £3,000, we should fix the salaries of the other Judges at £3,000 also. We have not yet fixed the number of Judges, but I am taking it for granted that there will be three. We ought not to be too penurious about this matter, because justice is cheap at any cost. Justice is something wherein the height of extravagance may be the essence of economy. Therefore, I shall be perfectly willing to pay £3,000 per annum to each of three Judges. It is nonsense to argue that we must pay £3,500 to our Chief Justice because a State has done so. That is a ridiculous way of looking at the matter. The States can vote what they like. The State of Victoria gave for years £10,000 a year to her Governor, and borrowed the money with which to pay it. That is economy from the Victorian point of view. For years all the States borrowed the money with which to pay high salaries. But the Commonwealth must live within its own means. The Commonwealth has 'already given back to the States a surplus greater than it is required to do under the Constitution, to enable them to pay their way. I shall vote, not because the States pay their Judges £3,500, or £10,000 or whatever it may be, but because I consider a certain sum to be a proper amount to pay the Judges of the High Court of Australia.

In the United States of America the salaries of the Judges of the High Court were fixed at £2,100 a year, when that sum was more than equivalent to the £3,500 a year paid in Australia at present. Attempts have been made in America for a number of years to alter that rate of salary, and increases would have been carried last session but for the fact that the two political parties came into hopeless collision over other legislation, and the session had to be closed with most of its business unfinished. According to an article published in Harper's Weekly, the salaries of the United States High CourtJ udges would undoubtedly, have been raised in the last session of Congress, but for the fact I have mentioned. As I have already said, they were fixed at a time when America had the same number of people as Australia has to-day, and when the value of £2,100 a year, represented more than £3,500 a year does to-day in Australia. The facts are very much the same in Canada. In Canada the salaries were fixed at a time when Canadian rates were even lower than they are now; and Canadian rates, as honourable members are aware, are always lower than Australian rates. I commend to honourable members the letter by Professor Harrison Moore, published in to-day's Argus, wherein he shows that the principal legal journal of Canada states that the low salaries paid there are a direct bar to attracting the best men to the Bench. the salaries do not attract the men who are earning the largest incomes at the Bar. aware that there are many men at the Bar who are reputed to be making considerably larger sums than the Chief Justices of the States are paid.

I have little doubt but that if we fixed the salaries which have been mentioned, we should be able to obtain men qualified for the office. But we should not be able to obtain men in the prime of life who, with the f u l l capacity of earning before them,' are carrying on their practice at the Bar and are probably earning something considerably above the salaries proposed. The men obtained for the positions would have the advantage, perhaps, of riper wisdom, but they would be men who felt their powers to be not what they were, and who realized that it might not be possible to continue to earn a larger income. Chief Justice Way is against the Attorney General. pendent fortune with whom the Chief Justiceship counts. If there be a sufficient number of independent men in Australia to fill these positions, no doubt some of them would be prepared to accept salaries lower than those proposed in the Bill. But I submit it to the Committee as an incontestable fact that we shall not be able to have a free choice, both from the Bench and the Bar, if we fix the salary of the Chief Justice at the amount named in the amendment. I would myself have fixed a lower salary than that provided in the Bill, if I had thought In these StatesI am it possible to obtain that free choice by doing so. But I took the lowest sum possible.

362,Mr Sawers,"I am not specially admany honourable members. I shall be glad if the question of pensions is decided first; but in any event I shall give my vote on this clause with the clear determination of voting for pensions. We must remember that gentlemen who are raised to the Bench are generally well advanced in years, and that even if they received a f a i r l y high salary they would not be adequately recompensed, as they would remain on the Bench only for a few years. It seems to me that the offer of a pension will be one of the attractions of the position. vernment. I hope that, in any event, the It goes without saying, that the object of the Government ought to be to-secure the very best men to occupy the position of J udges of the High Court. I cannot overlook the fact that in Hew South Wales when the late Sir James Martin died not many years ago, the utmost difficulty was experienced in filling the vacant position of Chief Justice of that State. I am almost safe in saying, that for a time the office practically went begging. It was offered to various barristers but refused, and it was not accepted by the present Chief Justice until Parliament passed a Bill raising the salary from £3,000 to £3,500 a year. Honourable members for Queensland may remember that a somewhat similar case occurred in that State. to discuss the merits of the Queensland case, but in New South Wales the 'facts were as I have stated. If we look around the commercial world we shall find men at the head of firms or great banking institutions, for example, who receive salaries far in excess of those proposed to be given to our Judges. and Sydney to-day. are men at the head of commercial institutions in Melbourne and Sydney who receive from £4,000 to £5,000 a year. Then we have our, Railways Commissioners. The Chief Commissioner of Railways in New South Wales receives £3,000 a year, while the Chief Commissioner of Railways in Victoria draws a salary of £3,500 per annum.

In New South Wales the commissioners were appointed for seven years, and the term was recently renewed. tial that our J udges should receive pensions, but the offer of a pension would be one of the great attractions of the position.

He urged that we should be outbidden by the States, and that the current rateswpaid in Australia were higher than the amount fixed in the amendment. We have to remember, however, that these are not the current rates of to-day, but were really fixed in the boom time, when the mercantile, professional, and other classes were receiving very high emoluments. I would reverse the comparative statement made by the honourable and learned gentlemen, for £3,500 a year received to-day, is equal to £5,000 per annum paid seven or eight years ago. Federal Tariff. T has been the position of affairs for the last seven or eight years. The purchasing power of money has become larger and larger, and those in receipt of a salary of £3,000 seven years ago were in no better position than those who now receive £2,000 per annum. While some urge that no reduction should be made in the salary proposed by the Government, it might be admitted that the purchasing power of salaries 'is greater than it was. I find that special provision for the payment of the salaries of our Judges is made in the Constitution. Section 72 provides that theyShall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix, but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

373,Mr Wilks,"I am sorry to saj thatincrease ib. That is another reason why we should support the reduction proposed. If we find by experience that we cannot get the best men to be had in Australia, that the most active members of the Bar will not accept positions upon bhe High Court Bench, bhab bhe salaries we vobe are nob sufficient, and if we find that the work to be done by the High CourtJ udges will be so heavy as to involve a great demand upon their time, Parliament can increase the salaries. There is, therefore, no danger in agreeing to a reduction upon the amounts suggested by the Government. They ask that the salary of the Chief Justice shall be £3,500 a year. I intend to support an amendment making the salary £2,500, but whether that amount or £3,000 is the salary fixed, it must nob be forgotten that we can diminish the salary pioposed only once, and that is to-night. Afterwards, during the life time of the person appointed, it will stand at the surn,£xed by Parliament unless it is found necessary subsequently to increase it. I think that £2,500 a year is a fair salary. It must be remembered that upon clause after clause of this Bill, the Attorney-General has been urging the Committee to confer greater powers upon the High Courti n order to give employment to the Judges. We have every evidence that there will"" be very little for them to do, and that in itself will be an incentive to men to go from the Bar to the High Court Bench. The Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States have six times as much work as these Federal Judges will have to do. member know that 1 already the amount of work they will have to do. The honourable member is backing up the Attorney-General, who referred to the gambling that takes place in courts in Canada; but we know that so long as there is a higher court, they will gamble. I do not think the fact that the Judges will not be very highly paid will encourage gambling in law. I remind honourable members that the Prime Minister of bhis country receives a salary of £2,500 a year. He has no permanency, and no pension, and, in fact, occupies a very precarious position. He has to superintend the whole of the affairs of Australia, and although he will have the appointment of these High Court Judges, he only gets £2,500. Once we introduce comparisons of this kind, honourable members will see how absurd the Government's proposal is. If the argument be sound that to get the best men of the legal profession to accept positions as Judges of the High Court, we should pay a salary of £3,500 a year, we should pay the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth £5,000 a year. The present Prime Minister is a well-known lawyer, and is regarded in the . profession as a lawyer of high standing, but we find him working for £2,500, with no chance of a pension and no permanency. permanent position. election. I agree with those who ask for a reduction of the salaries proposed. The Attorney-General has not shown how the confidence of the profession, or of the general public, will be shakenby a reduction, but we know how the public will be shaken by an increase of the salaries. I should like to hear some argument against the proposal to fix the salary at £2,500 a year. We are told that younger men at the Bar, getting £8,000 or £10,000 a year, will not be attracted by the offer of a position on the High Court, but this is the age of economy, and we must not fix as current rates the. rates which existed in the boom period. is the wish generally of honourable members to consider clause 53 before clause 52, I shall now move bhe posbponemenb of clause 52 until after we have considered clause 53.

It is very unfortunate that a man whom one has had to address in terms of respect and deference should afterwards be coming round desiring to borrow a five-pound note. Any one who has moved in legal circles in Melbourne for fifteen or twenty years well know that some Judges have been reduced to that unfortunate position.

A similar principle arises here, because men in these positions should retain the dignity previously attaching to them. I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the case of a Judge who recently retired from the Victorian Bench, after a good many years service, because he found that his faculties were not as keen as they previously had been. There is another case of a Judgei u another State who is said to be getting too old and too deaf. I shall not say in which State that case arises, but I have no doubt that such a Judge, if he had not his pension to fall back upon, would cling to his position far longer than he should. ing to it notwithstanding the pension. the pitiable position that he has to remain on the bench through fear of poverty. If we wish to get the best men to occupy these positions, and if we wish only to retain them so long as they are able to efficiently perforin their duties, we shall provide for a pension. I support the clause, and I trust the Committee will not accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. honourable and learned member who has just spoken would read the clause a little more carefully, he would see that it is disknow that there tinctly, in favour of the Commonwealth. It provides for a case in which a Judge is disabled by permanent infirmity from the performance of the duties of his office. The honourable and learned member for Corio will not contend for a moment that it is not in theinterests of the Commonwealth that, when a Judge has developed some permanent infirmity which renders him incompetent to perform his functions as a Judge, some inducement should be offered to him to resign. We cannot provide in a Bill of this kind that a Judge shall occupy his position only so long as he is competent, in the estimation of the permanent latv officers of the Crown, to discharge his duties, and thereI think that a Judge fore our only recourse is to provide that, when a Judge is afflicted with some permanent infirmity, a moderate pension shall be offered to him to retire and allow a more competent man to take his place. It is therefore proposed thatA justice of the High Court, if disabled by permanent infirmity from the performance of the duties of his office, shall be entitled to retire upon a pension, to be continued during his life. Then the rates are set forth. If the Judge has served for less than five years he is to be entitled to a pension equal to twotenths of his salary. If he had been appointed at a salary of £3,000 a year, he would thus be entitled to a pension of £600 a year. if he were outside 1 question.

It will be to the interest of the Commonwealth to offer an inducement to Judges who may be thus disabled by permanent infirmity to give up their positions, and we may fairly give them a moderate recompense for the sacrifice they will in such a case be called upon to make. There is no parallel between the provisons of the clause and the case put by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in which a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria retired at the age of 60 upon a pension of £1,500. TheB ill proposes that a Judge who has served fifteen years on the High Court Bench shall be entitled to retire upon a pension-bu t only when he has reached the age of 65. Although human life is said to be lengthening, 70 years is still about the average span for the most healthy among us, and, therefore, it is only reasonable to provide: that when a Judge has reached the age of 65 years he shall be entitled, if he has served fifteen years, to receive a pension equal to 7-10ths of his salary. AVe are not thus legislating so much in the interests of the Judges as in the interests of the Commonwealth, because if 70 years be taken to be the maximum age at which most men fail to retain their f u l l faculties, it is not extravagant to provide that when a J udge is five years short of the end of his natural life he shall be allowed to retire on a pension. We do not want upon the Bench palsied men-me n who are really not in the possession of their full faculties, and who are incompetent to do the very difficult work which will fall to their lot. Therefore, instead of looking at this clause from the point of view of the Judge, it should be regarded as a safety-valve which will enable the Commonwealth to clear the Bench of Judges who have become broken down by age or permanent infirmity. I would point out also to the honourable member-for Melbourne Ports that, if no pensions were provided for, it would be open for any Judge to remain on the Bench long after he had become incompetent, through illness, to do his work faithfully and well. for removal in such cases. a Judge were grossly incompetent no Government would take the extreme step of removing him. 4 K2 rt apply, even if pensions were provided for, if a Judge still desired to remain on the Bench? Parliament would be much more ready to take steps to remove a J udge when they knew that a pension was provided for in case of his lacking ability, through illness, to proper!}' perform his duties. I submit, therefore, that it is fair that Judges who have arrived at an age within five years of the recognised allotted span of life should be offered an inducement to retire from the Bench, and make way for younger men. seems an opportune time to discuss the whole question of pensions, which is ever recurring in connection with the discussion of Estimates. We should deal with this matter in the broadest possible spirit, and fix the salaries upon such a liberal scale that we shall encourage our best and youngest men to take up the positions of Judges. We should also endeavour to secure as Judges men of such an age that it will be possible to provide for them by way of insurance, instead of adding to the burdens of the taxpayers by granting pensions. We should not make the High Court Bench a place of refuge for barristers who desire to retire from the active practice of their profession. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports proposes that no provision shall be made for pensions, but I take a very liberal view of pensions in the case of Judges, because I feel that we must get the best men. I should, however, be in favour of offering the highest possible salary, fixing the amount of the pension in inverse ratio to the amount of the salary. Our Judges should be not only the best men, but the healthiest, and such as would most likely be able to render us good service for many years. attentively to the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Parkesi n regard to the proposed pension arrangements, but I should like to know why, if a J udge is suffering from some permanent disablement-the palsy, or an enlarged liver, perhaps-the amount of pension paid to him should be in inverse ratio to the length of his service ?

As a matter of fact, however, a Judge who becomes permanently disabled at 55, and thus wholly dependent upon his pension for support, has a longer life before him and will be worse off than a Judge who becomes permanently disabled at 65. It seems to me absurd that there should be any connection between the salary and the pension. to the country the better their rewards. that their salaries alone are not to be regarded as paying for their services 1 If their salaries pay them for their services, we have no right in fixing their pensions to consider their length of service. hope that the Committee is not prepared to abolish pensions altogether, but I would rather vote for their abolition than for a differential scheme like this. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I should like clause 52 to be settled before we go further. If the scale of pensions allowed for is agreed to I shall certainly vote for much smaller salaries. I think that pensions of a certain amount should be provided, so that Judges who become incompetent by reason of physical or intellectual misfortunes may have something to support them. I should not like any of the Judges of the High Court to be placed in the position in which we saw an old warrior here in Victoria lately. They had a great battle to get anything for him, though he ( was one of the greatest democrats that Victoria ever produced. His case made every man who had any human .sympathy in his soul blush with shame at the meanness and parsimony of this State. We must make such provision that we shall not have Judges who have made financial mistakes reduced in penury in their old age. It is easy to say that men in such a position should provide for their future, but, as a rule, Judges are not financiers. They are law-givers, not money-grabbers. They are not sharp enough for the money-grabbing business. Consequently they may lose all they have through some financial mistake on their own account, or to help their sons. But no one would like to see an old J udge of the High Court of this great Commonwealth going round bare-footed. I heard Holman, of Indiana, the watch-dog of the United States Treasury for 40 years, say when he was bidding good-bye to his people, after a young lawyer had come to his district while he was away and put liini out, that-paraphrasin g Cardinal Wolsle'y-if he had served his family half as faithfully as he had served his electors, he would not have been indigent in his old nge. I do not want our Judges to be indigent when they are old. I would not give large pensions, but I .would give them as much as .£500 a year. It is well known to every thinker that the great men, the intellectual giants of the world, are not those who make money. . They have no time for that sort of thing, and do not know how to do it . They have not studied the methods of gathering in. But, before settling the pension question, I should like to deal with the question I of salaries. If I knew that the three 'Judges were to get £3,000 a year each, without distinction, I would vote for a pension of £ 5 0 0 when a Judge had to retire by reason of intellectual or physical disability.

But the provisions in clause 53, would make it necessary for a man who was taken over while in full possession of his faculties, and before the completion of fifteen years of service, to abandon some of his existing rights, as, unless he has served, fifteen years in the State, he has no right to a pension at all.",66,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

If we are to grant pensions to the Justices of the High Court we ought to make provision whereby Judges of the States Courts, if appointed to the Eederal Bench, shall not be placed under any disadvantage. Sub-clause (3) of this clause readsWhen any Justice of the High Court is entitled, difficulty upon this matter, because the by virtue of any right preserved by the Constitudirection in which I shall vote upon the tion, to any pension upon retirement, that pension shall be deemed to be in reduction pro tanto of the pension to which he is entitled under this Act. That' means that we can practically only appoint to the High Court BenchJ ustices who have actually served fifteen years in the States Courts, and who have thus acquired a right to a pension. If we decide to grant pensions to the Justices of the High Court we ought to provide that State Judges shall not be placed under any disability by reason of their having undertaken to serve the Commonwealth in a higher capacity. learned member for Darling Downs will carefully read the sub-clause in question he will find that the contingency which he has suggested has been anticipated. MrL . E.

I u Western Australia, after fifteen years' service, or upon attaining the age of 60 years, or being permanently incapacitated, the Judges receive a pension equal to one-half their salary.' the whole, I do not think it would be wise to object to the pensions provisions of this clause, though perhaps some modifications might with advantage be made in them. I notice that in America the age at which the Justices retire on pension is fixed at 70 years. Something has been said about allowing the retiring of the High Court Judges on pension, out of consideration to them, at 65 years of age j but it seems to ine that what we must chiefly regard is their capacity to satisfactorily discharge the duties of their office. In America, I repeat, that the age limit imposed is 70 years, and I ask the Attorney-General whether he could not base the right of .the High Court Judges to a pension equivalent to seven-tenths of their salary upon a similar limitation. . In England of recent years, complaints have frequently been made in the public press regarding in cases the senility of the Bench. It has been repeatedly urged that it is very advisable to afford its Justices an opportunity to retire. It is said that they sometimes get livery, impatient, and somewhat petulant in their declining years, and that owing to the fact that pro ratd pensions had not been granted, Justices who ought to have retired have not done so. learned member wishes to buy them off. of getting rid of them except by both Houses of Parliament adopting an. address declaring that they are incapable. It is very seldom, indeed, that Justices are got rid of in America by impeachment, or in England by the adoption of an address by both Houses of Parliament. B ut here, in a case of established infirmity, some inducement is offered to a Judge whose waning faculties suggest that he ought to enjoy the remaining years of his life where he would not be obnoxious to suitors, to retire from the Bench. Under these cirI have not the retiring cumstances, I think it is advisable to vote generally for the pension provisions of the Bill, whatever the Committee may decide in regard to clause 52. vote for the proposal to grant pensions to the Justices of the High Court, because it seems to me that the reason which has been put forward by the Attorney-General and other honourable members who have spoken in support of it, are unanswerable, thab it would not be wise for the Commonwealth to offer lower salaries or pensions than obtain in regard to the Judiciaries of the States. We desire to place the High Court of Australia upon such a footing that it will attract the best legal talent from the States. A t the. same time, I cannot quite agree with the details of this pensions proposal. In the first place, I do not think it is the proper thing to give a pension to a Judge who has served only two years. And with regard to the proposal to give a Judge, after fifteen years' service, a pension equal to seven-tenths of his salary, I think it is, if anything, offering an inducement to a Judge who may feel a little lazy to retire. age 70 years, as in America. the amendment should take, but there is a necessity to provide for some pensions.

435,Mr Watson,"I think it ought to beMv. HUME COOK (Bourke) I cannot understand the remark of the honourable member for Bland, that we should not offer lower salaries than are being offered in any of the States. The whole argument in the Prime Minister's replies to certain questions I put this afternoon was that we were able to get the best men at 25 per cent, less than is being paid in the several States. I have no doubt that in connection with the High Court we shall be able to get men of very wide experience both in law and politics who will serve us admirably for the salaries which we are prepared to offer, and without the extra inducement of a pension. I am opposed to the payment of pensions. We did the right thing in the provision we embodied in the Public ServiceA ct for life assurance. In this case, where we are likely to offer a handsome salary, and where the men will enter the service of the Commonwealth later in Jife,after they have probably had for years a lucrative practice, out of which they ought to have made some savings, it is hardly right as a reward for services rendered, as a to ask the Commonwealth to grant them pensions. business men. It is not done for the managers of bank's, of trustee companies, or of other great financial or trading institutions. get pensions when they retire from active work. in connection with some banking institutions, but in the generality of cases men have to make provision for themselves out of their salaries. For the most part the men who will be appointed to the High Court Bench will have had excellent practices at the bar, or if they are taken from the .'Benches of the States they will carry with them their rights to pensions, and consequently we shall not be under an obligation to create a pension list on their account. We are under no obligation to follow the example of the States and to offer salaries beyond what it is fair to give. put upon themselves, and for the social what it is fair to give, but of what we must give in order to get the class of men we require. shall get the best of men for the salaries which tire likely to be voted here without the additional inducement of a pension. civil servants is no criterion, because there was quite a large number of civil servants to select from. circumstances are entirely different. Buti t is my opinion that we shall get excellent men of proved legal capacity as well as perhaps ripe political experience to offer their services to the Commonwealth. The peculiarity of the present proposal is that a Judge will be induced to remain at his post as long as possible in order to get the higher pension. If a Judge meets with a paralytic stroke after he has served for three or four years he will endeavour to remain on the Bench for seven or eight years, because at the end of that time he will get a larger pension than if he had retired at the end of five years, and so on right through the piece. I think it is a mistake to differentiate in this way. In any case, if there is to be a pension granted I think it ought to be paid, not so much compensation for some infirmity which has That is not clone for ordinary suddenly rendered a Judge incapable of performing his duty. What ought to be done, I submit, is to create a fund out of which the compensation, gratuity, or retiring allowance should be paid in a case of proved incapacity, occasioned by a sudden paralytic stroke or some misfortune. up to one half of the salary would be a fair thing; but that is a matter for further discussion. Judges unlike most other persons are not called upon to take a very large part in social functions, and therefore are not under any great obligation to spend money in the way in which other persons are. On the other hand, they aresubject to certain limitations in the way of business. They cannot take up directorships, or any positions of that k in d ; but the salaries which are likely to be voted will be more than proper compensation for the restrictions which they have to pleasures which they have to forego. I think that the proposal in the Bil l in respect to pensions ought not to be carried, and that some other proposal might be put forward to provide for a case of sudden misfortune occurring to a Judge whereby he could make provision for his own needs.

443,Mr Hume Cook,"I should say thati t would' be sufficient to give £3,000 to the Chief Justice, and £2,500 each to the other Judges. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON (South Australia) The Attorney-General correctly quoted me as saying that the pensions of the puisne Judges in South Australia had been fixed at £1,300 per annum, and I believe that that of the Chief Justice is £1,500 per annum. should like to add that I believe an Act was passed about nine years ago abolishing pensions for future Judgesi n South Australia. matter we are now discussing is of such importance that we cannot give it too carethe number on the Bench than by any ful attention. On the one hand, there is a natural clesire, in which I fully sympathize, of the Judges. If this is to be a court to prevent the system of pensions getting a footing in the Commonwealth service. On the other hand, there is a clesire to keep British justice and Australian justice up to the high standard which it has hitherto maintained, and from which it would not be to the interests of the community to allow ib to fall. In dealing with a question of this sort, we are more limited as to the manner of fixing remuneration than we should be in connection with many positions in the public service of the Commonwealth. There are three ways in which remuneration is usually fixed. One way is to have regard to the importance of the work ; and I am quite sure we cannot get more important work in the community than that of the administration of justice. When the lives and liberties of the people are at stake we have every reason to avoid the risks attachriot occupy certain positions of profit ing to maladministration, even if in doing so we have to expend a little money. I do not say that the mere height of the salary would be sufficient to enable us to escape the evil of maladministration ; but if we wish to get men in whom we have confiddence-who m we believe will administer jusbice capably and honesbly-w e musb be prepared to give what has been fixed in these States as the remuneration for such services. Another method of fixing a salary is to estimate it according to the rate which applicants will accept. If we adopt that method we can get the work done for nothing, because there are men, one or two of whom might even be' accept. able, who would bake bhe position for the simple honour abtaching to ib. unsafe principle to act on in connection with our Judiciary. wholly ; and no member of the Committee would for a moment consider the adoption of such a principle. Another way of estimating a salary is not to necessarily take I the men who want bhe positions, bub to offer a. rate at which we can get the men we want. We have heard a great deal about the High Courb. I was, and I am still, very desirous'of limiting the expense of that court; but I would rather limit the expense by curtailing the jurisdiction and reducing cheese-paring in connection with the salaries which will command the respect that the Attorney-General expects it to command, we shall have to pay the salaries which the men we want will require. We cannot expect only wealthy men or philanbhropisbs bo be called to tliis court; we must expect men who are following their profession, and we ma)' perhaps have to ask some .of these to make a sacrifice when they take the position. If we say to the members of the Bar-""You are asked to do justice under all circumstances and all temptations r and we expecb you to be so capable that the other Judges, from whose decisions there may be appeals to you, will never, whatever they may say of your judgments, venture to question your capacity,"" and if we further tell the members of the Bar that on their appointment to the Bench they must outside their office, which are open to many other men, so that the Bench may be kept clear of any imputation of injustice, bias or prejudice, we must be prepared to payliberal salaries. And in fixing what is liberal we must have regard to the salaries which are paid to the States Judges in Australia at the present time. Indeed, I do not see any obher standard to guide us; and if the rate of remuneration were £2,000 in the States, I should be perfectly willing bo adopb that sum for the Commonwealth, regarding it as an evidence of sufliciencj' to attract the best men. in some of the States. which contains a tenth of the population of Australia, the salary is £2,000 ; but I do",70,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

The honourable member for Bourke expressed the opinion that instead of providing in this way for pensions, we ought to have a fund devoted to paying, as allowances, any sums which Parliament might fix, though not more than half the salary. I do not agree with that idea for a moment. in any case. in the most objectionable way. Some retiring Judges would get the allowance, perhaps through parliamentary influence, while other men, equally deserving, would be denied it through lack of influence. The granting of the pension might be a matter of the whim or prejudice of the moment. If we have pensions the amounts should be fixed. I agree with the honourable member for Bland that there might be some amendment of the clause in regard to the rates of pensions. I would suggest that after a service of five the present rates be years the rate should be low, certainly not more than two-tenths of the salary, though I should be satisfied with one-tenth. Then the pension after ten years' service might be increased to three-tenths, and after fifteen years' service to five-tenths. I do not think that we need go beyond half the salary, and the suggestions I have made would reasonably support a Judge to whom circumstances had pioved unfavorable, at a period of life at which he was unable to earn an income. It would be a most disastrous thing if after the liberties and lives of the subjects of the Commonwealth had been safe in the hands of a Judge for many years, through misfortune or possibly through not being allowed to do things in connection with business which other persons could do, disaster came upon him and he was reduced to penury. Therefore, while as a rule I oppose pensions in the Commonwealth service as strongh' as other members do, in the present case, entirely in the interests of justice, I cannot see mj' way to abolish the system. able member will oppose this clause from a misunderstanding of the position. The clause contains a proposal which appears to the Government to be a proper one j but. of course, those who vote in favour of retaining it are not bound to accept the particular rates set forth. I thought that some of the suggestions of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat had a good deal to be said for them, and I am quite prepared to give consideration to such suggestions. If there are some honourable members who oppose the giving of any pensions whatever, of any kind, or of any amount no matter how small, we must, of course, have a division on the clause. the first line 1 understood that practically the whole of the Committee were agreed upon some provision to meet possible contingencies that might arise. If that view be accepted, and it becomes a question of the amount and the time of the pension, I should be very glad to consider suggestions. Nothing definite has been, proposed as yet.

Buti f a Judge suffers from some physical infirmity after two years service, should he not be entitled to equal consideration on the part of the public as is the man who after five years service becomes incapable of remaining on the Bench? I see no wisdom in saying that the pension shall start after five years service. If it is right that pensions should be granted, let them start from the time that they are actually required. I can understand the Government proposal. They provide that if a man becomes paralyzed, or suffers some other infirmity during the first year of office, he shall at once be entitled to a pension. But under the amendment which has been temporarily withdrawn, a Judge would be entitled to no such pension if he became incapacitated within five years of his appointment to the Bench. For these reasons, I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will adhere to his amendment. I have not spoken during the debate on this Bill, but there are one or two phases relating to the payment of pensions to which I desire to make brief reference. When we were dealing with the Public Service Bill, we discussed at length the position of the civil service, but throughout that debate no suggestion was made that we should give a pension to any class of our public servants. < Notwithstanding what has been said during the discussion on this clause, I fail to see why any distinction should be made in the case of Judges of the High Court. As a matter of fact, when the Public .Service Bill was before us, some honourable members went so far as to oppose a proposal that adults-marrie d men-wh o had been in the service of the transferred departments for some years, should receive a bare living wage. They were opposed to the payment of a minimum wage, apart altogether from any question of making a retiring allowance to a civil servant suffering In the Bank of New South from physical infirmity. It would be a great mistake for Parliament to draw this distinction between one class of civil servants and another. I have every respect for the Judges of the States, and I am just as anxious that we should obtain the very best men available for the position of Judges of the High Court as is any honorI t is proposed that a cerable member; but I do not consider it necessary for us to hold out an incentive of this kind. If we offer adequate salaries our Judges, like other persons occupying prominent positions outside the service, will be i u a position to purchase life annuities. We compel our public servants to insure their lives, and if in the case of our Judges some provision must be made for old age or physical infirmity, let us make it compulsory for them to purchase life annuities. Such a provision, however, need not necessarily be inserted in the Bill. I intend to protest as strongly as I can against the proposal that special treatment shall be meted out to one particular class of public servants. mind the honourable member for South Australia, who has just spoken, that there is a great difference between a J udge and the other officers of the public service to whom he has referred, inasmuch as an ordinary member of the service can be dismissed straight way while a Judge cannot. against my argument. become slightly. deaf or suffer from some other infirmity which it is extremely difficult to prove, although it is injurious to his capacity on the Judicial Bench. In such a case it might be possible to induce him to retire by the offer of a fairly large",73,Pairs Taken That The Magistrates Acting Were Not

495,Mr Conroy,"Sometimes a Judge maypension. If a man incapacitated in this way continues on the Bench, the cost to the community is infinitely more than would be the payment of a pension. That is one reason why we should grant pensions to OurJ udges. It is far better that a Judge suffervery much require to follow, by wiping out ing from deafness, or some other infirmity, should be able to retire voluntarily than that a Bill should be introduced setting one of the very worse precedents for the removal of a member of the Bench. In how many cases has this ever been required ? When one listens to the objections raised against the proposal, one would think that we were dealing with vast sums of money, yet I find that under paragraph (a), the amount involved would be £600, under pavagraph (£>) £900, under paragraph (d) £1,500, and paragraph (e) £2,100, assuming that the proposals of the Government are carried into effect. If a Judge should develope some infirmity, it would surely be better to hold out some inducement to him to retire. I trust that the Government will be able to carry out their proposals in their entirety, or that they will at least be able to carry them with the modification which has been suggested. rather astonished to find that there is any apologist for the perpetuation of a system which in the past has been condemned throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I am also surprised to find some honourable members who are opposed to pensions for certain branches of the public service advocating that they should be granted to the very highest paid officials of the State. I fail to see any consistency in that. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that we are making precedents, and the Committee should establish a precedent in this case which the States could well follow. We can also set a precedent in the matter of salaries, because these, in my opinion, are fixed too high in the Bill, and I shall have something to say upon that when we reach the clause dealing with them. It is our bounden duty to remove altogether from the Eederal public service any hope that its members, and especially those receiving high salaries, will have pensions paid to them when they leave the service, though in some of the States the pensions paid nearly equal in amount the salaries which the officers have been receiving when in f u l l service. It is the duty of those who are in receipt of regular and sufficient payment from the State to make provision for the time when they will not be receiving salary. We can -set an example, which some of the States altogether from our annual charges the pension list which, in the past and at present, is in the States proving a terrible, burden upon the taxpayers of Australia. like the Committee to consider whether the position in which we find ourselves now is a fair one. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is endeavouring to have a division taken upon this clause, without first trying whether it cannot be made acceptable to a majority of the Committee in the way suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. The speeches made so far suggest that there is a very large number of honourable members who are disposed to accept this clause with some modifications, hut the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has candidly said that he desires to take a division upon the clause as a whole, because he fears that, if the Committee has an opportunity of modifying it , it may be made acceptable, and he will lose his opportunity of strangling the proposal. The honourable member's suggestion is the same as if, upon the second reading of a measure, it were assumed that it would be unalterable, and that we should, therefore, take a division upon it in the condition in which it is first submitted to the House, and without the understanding that, in passing the second reading, we have an opportunity of making the measure acceptable in Committee. Why should we not modify this clause if there is some chance that it may be made acceptable to the Committee ? It will be open to honourable members subsequently to express an opinion upon the whole clause after it has been modified. MrA . McLEAN -We do not go into Committee upon the B ill before we pass the second reading. We take the principle first, and then deal with the modifications. member for Melbourne Ports is trying now to put the cart before the horse.

If the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne Forts is agreed to, the whole clause will be negatived, although I have formed the opinion from the speeches which I have heard that many members of the Committee at the present time are willing to accept the principle if the conditions arc modified in the way suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. willing to have the clause in a modified form we shall find that out very shortly, but if there is, by adopting the course proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Forts, we shall be presenting a majority in the Committee accepting the principle in a modified form, merely because the honourable member has chosen to take the clause by the scruff of the neck, in order to kill it at the first stage, of discussion. I subBatchelor, E. L. mit that unless honourable members desire to do that in the face of tbe majority, an opportunity should he given to fashion the clause so as to make it acceptable. was one of the first to ring the pension note, I think I have a right to say a word on this question. As a matter of fact, I should like very much to see all Government pensions abolished with the exception of pensions to soldiers who have been crippled in battle. But I quite recognise that there is absolutely no hope of inducing the Committee to accept -that policy in a case like this. Prom the remarks made by the honourable members for Bland and North Sydney, and the sympathy generally expressed by the Committee, I can see clearly that, there would be no use in attempting to do away with these pensions. Wccould not expect capablegentlemen of the learning, attainments, and experience necessary to occupy such a position as that of Judge of the High Court without some such provision as this. I am strongly in sympathy with the views expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney, and I have thought it well to explain my position in this respect. that if the principle of paying pensions If the second be established, honourable members will be afforded an opportunity of voting on the amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney, or some proposal in a similar direction.
