THE PARLIAMENT desire to raise a matter of privilege. I refer to an article which appeared in the Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' of Friday, 27th August 1971. This newspaper is published by Australian Consolidated Press Ltd. An extract from the article reads: A group of ALP Parliamentarians walked out of the Chamber when the quorum was called, well knowing that their action could cause the collapse of the House of Representatives. This is a deliberate untruth and it is a reflection on the Chair which, at the time in question, was occupied by Mr Lucock, as Deputy Speaker. I travelled to Sydney on the morning of Friday, 27th August, and Mr Lucock was on the same plane. During the wait for our luggage I showed him the article in the 'Daily Telegraph' and he stated that the extract that I have read could not be true because he always keeps a close eye on the members of the House to see that no member leaves the chamber when a quorum is called. As you know, Mr Speaker, this procedure is covered by standing order 47 and is strictly carried out at all times by yourself, the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman. I realise that freedom of the Press is a fundamental principle of democracy and in addition, I know that journalists have to earn a living and that sometimes their reports are exaggerated or misleading in their endeavours to get a story across, but I believe that this House could never condone a deliberate untruth in a matter of this nature. Therefore I move: That the matter of the article in the 'Daily Telegraph' of Friday 27 August 1971, be referred any further petitions I would suggest to to the Committee of Privileges. for National Development)Mr Speaker, as the Clerk read a petition. Those honourthis is a matter of some importance to able members who are interested in the individual members, the Government has proceedings of the House should be able to no objection to it being referred to the hear petitions being read. I ask for the coCommittee of Privileges. Question resolved in the affirmative. 18938/71-*-[27 ] Means Test petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That due to higher living costs, including increasing charges for health services, most aged persons living on fixed incomes are suffering acute distress. That Australia is the only English-speaking country in the world to retain a means test for aged pensioners and that a number of European countries also have no means test. That today's aged persons have paid at least 7i% of their taxable income towards social services since the absorption of Special Social Services Taxation in Income Tax and continue to make such payments. (71% of all taxable incomes for 1966-67 amounted to $783,082,130 and this year will produce more than $800,000,000, more than sufficient to abolish the means test immediately.) That the middle income group, the most heavily taxed sector of the community, subsidises the tax commitment of the upper income bracket through the amount of social services con:ributions collected by the government and not spent on the purposes for which they were imposed. That the abolition of tire means test will give a boost to the economy by(1) additional tax revenue from pensions, (2) swelling of the work force, and (3) increased spending by pensioners. That it is considered just and right to allow people who have been frugal, have lived their lives with dignity and have been anything but an encumbrance on the nation, to maintain that dignity to the end of their lives free from. fear of penury. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate steps to abolish the means test for all people who have reached retiring age or who otherwise qualify for social service benefits or pensioners. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Petition received and read. the House that there is far too much audible undertone within the chamber. It is operation of honourable members in this regard.",7,Setup

5,Mr Speaker,"Order! BeforeI call forEducation petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled -Tlie humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully shewethWhereas(a) the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies in the Australian Education system. (b) a major inadequacy at present, in Australian education is the lack of equal education opportunity for all. (c) 200,000 students from Universities, Colleges of Advanced Education and other Ternary Institutions, and their parents suffer severe penalty from inadequacies in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1968. (d) Australia cannot afford to hinder the education of these 200,000 Australians. Your petitioners request that your honourable House make legal provision for1. The allowance of personal education expenses as a deduction from income for tax purposes. 2. Removal of the present age Umit in respect of the deduction for education expenses and the maintenance allowance for students. 3. Increase in the amount of deduction allowable for tertiary education expenses. 4. Increase in the maintenance allowance for students. 5. Exemption of non-bonded scholarships, for part-time students from income tax. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. Chemical Agents of Warfare petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of 11 electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth1. that the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2603 XXIV A (December 1969) declares that the Geneva Protocol of 192S, which Australia has ratified, prohibits the use in international armed conflict of any chemical agents of warfare-chemica l substances whether gaseous, liquid or solidemployed for their direct toxic effects on man, animals or plants; 2. that the World Health Organisation Report (January 1970) confirms the above definition of chemical agents of warfare; 3. that the Australian Government does not accept this definition, but holds that the Geneva Protocol does not prevent the use in war of certain toxic chemical substances in the form of herbicides, defoliants and 'riot control' agents. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray1. that thc Parliament take note of the consensus of international political, scientific and humanitarian opinion; and 2. that honourable members urge upon the Government the desirability of revising its interpretation of the Geneva Protocol, and declaring that it regards all chemical substances employed fbr their toxic effect on man, animals or plants as being included in the prohibitions laid down by that Protocol. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. Contraceptives Dr KLUGMANI present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showethThat tbe Sales Tax on all forms of Contraceptive Devices is 27i per cent (Sales Tax Exemptions and Classifications Act 1935-1967). Also that there is Customs Duty of up to 47i per cenl on some Contraceptive Devices. And that this is an unfair imposition on the human rights of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And furthermore that this imposition discriminates particularly against people on low incomes. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Sales Tax on all forms of Contraceptive Devices be removed, so as to bring these' items into line with other necessities such as food, upon which there is no Sales Tax. Also that Customs Duties be removed, and that all Contraceptive Devices be placed on the National Health Scheme Pharmaceutical Benefits List. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received and read. Broadcasting and Television ing petition: To the Honourable thc Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth: 1. Tbat the Australian people both in Metropolitan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. 2. The increased quota for Australian dramatic productions should not be imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board at the expense of AustraUan professional variety or Australian documentary or educational programmes, but directed more towards cutting down expenditure on the purchase of imported productions, thus effecting a considerable saving in Australia's overseas balance of payments.",13,Petitions

The Australian Parliament has a responsibility to encourage the development of our National identity, character and heritage and the promulgation, for the sake of our children, of an adequate picture of Australia, her standards, mores and way of life, particularly through the media of Radio and Television, which is in the immediate control of 1 the Australian Government. , 4. Until constructive and positive action is taken by the Australian Government to promote Australian culture and protect the employment and professional standards of Australian writers, artists and producers in Australia itself there is little likelihood of stopping the flow of Australian talent from Australia to other countries. 5. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board must insist that its new quota standards of Australian dramatic content on television are rigidly imposed and enforced on all commercial television stations. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representalives, in Parliament assembled, shouldCause the Australian Government to recognize the right of Australian professional 'people engaged in the. creative and performing arts to further develop their skills and talents in Australia, and to be protected from overseas programmes in a way that will encourage an Australian Television and Radio industry that can reflect and contribute to our identity and growth as a Nation. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received and read. Social Services ition: To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. Thc serious decline in social services has intensified the hardships faced by pensioners and families on lower incomes. Therefore as a matter of urgency the Commonwealth Government should immediately allocate extra finance to social services. The petition of the undersigned urges your Government to increase immediately Pensions-by $5.00 per week. Child Endowment-to $3.60 per week per child. Maternity Allowance-to at least $117 for each child born. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received and read. Australian Capital Territory Pharmacy Ordinance petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of constructive purpose and not to do harm. the House of Representatives in Parliament assemFor example, I went there on one occasion bled. The humble petition of citizens of the Division of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth That the Australian Capital Territory Pharmacy Ordinances 1931-1959 Section 46, Sub-section (1) states that 'A person shall not publish any statement, whether by way of advertisement or otherwise, to promote the sale of any article as a medicine, instrument or appliance . . . for preventing conception'. And that this infringes upon each individual's right as a human being to all available information about contraceptive devices in order to help prevent unwanted pregnancies. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the words 'or for preventing conception' be deleted from Sub-section (1) of Section 46 of the Australian Capital Territory Pharmacy Ordinances. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received. ter a question. The right honourable gentleman will remember telling the House on 25 th August that he had not paid a visit to Papua New Guinea for some time. I ask him: Was his only visit to the Territory made on 15th January 1952 when, as Minister for the Navy, he stayed at Tarangau base, Manus Island, for a period of less than 24 hours? I also ask him when I may expect an answer from him to 2 questions about Papua New Guinea, one which he inherited from my putting it on the notice paper on 16th Febuary and the other which I put on the notice paper on 17th of last month. They concern the dates and terms on which the Administrator was authorised to use the military forces of the Commonwealth and the dates on which the Prime Minister discussed the matter with his predecessor, who had become Minister for Defence, and on which the order was revoked. gentleman had been cautious enough to obtain information from the Department of Air as well as from the Department of the Navy he would have found that I visited Papua New Guinea on several occasions and not one.

The second part of the honourable gentleman's question relates to the 2 questions that have been on the notice paper for some time. Within the course of the last 24 hours I have asked my Department to clear up any questions on the notice paper related to me or my Department. OneI specifically referred to was the question that the honourable gentleman has mentioned I think he must know that he has so many questions on the notice paper that most departments will now require additional employees to cater to his specific needs, I think he has well over 450 questions on the notice paper.

Yesterday I had a long discussion with the Attorney-General after he had discussed the problem with the Crown Law officer's. Today the Cabinet met on a submission presented by him and discussed not only the immediate problem but the long term problem as well. As to the immediate problem, that is the one of the viability of the law, as it then existed, relating to restrictive trade practices, we will shortly be presenting to the House a Bill relating to trade practices to ensure that the provisions as they existed remain viable. I am informed by the Crown Law authorities that over 99 per cent of the cases referred to the Commissioner of Trade Practices relate to corporations, and consequently the new Bill will be able to cover those cases completely. But we have a much more basic and, I think, important objective. That is to strengthen quickly the provisions of the restrictive trade practices legislation in order to strengthen competitive influences within Australia. I was informed today that the essential documentation is very nearly completed and, as soon as it is, it will be submitted to the relevant official for discussion. In time it will be embodied in a Cabinet submission and finally presented to the House. I want to warn the House of this: \be handled.

This is because other countries have moved away from it and therefore that country the Minister for Shipping and Transport. cannot be static. We were aware of the situation that ing taking its ships off the Darwin run looked as though it would be some conlater this year?

25,Mr Calderi Direct A Question To,,18,Western Australian State Shipping Service
26,Mr Nixon,"Dealing first with thatAustralian Council of Trade Unions, myself and the maritime unions involved met the Professional Radio Employees Institute on this question, and the ACTU and the maritime unions accepted that there was no safety issue involved in the sailing of the 'Echuca', which was the basis of the dispute. The ACTU carried a resolution instructing the other maritime unions that they were free to sail all ANL ships as well as the 'Echuca'. Unfortunately the Professional Radio Employees Institute has not accepted the resolution passed by the ACTU and has called its operators out on strike. I feel somewhat disappointed at Mr Hawke's inability to bring his affiliated union under control in the circumstances. When the House comes to order. I will continue. It has to be remembered, of course, that on that occasion he did, as 1 put it to the Leader of the Opposition, come charging in on his galloper like the great white knight to settle the dispute and he failed so to do. I did try to get in touch with Mr Hawke last night when I learned that the ban was going to be reimposed by the PREI. But I found that unfortunately he was not available. He was somewhere in New Guinea and there was no point of contact that I could make with him. In the meantime, however, my Department along with the Department of Labour and National Service had discussions with the Australian National Line this morning. The Australian National Line is going back to Mr Justice Franki, where this matter all began, to seek a compulsory conference of the parties to the dispute. Insofar as costs are concerned, I believe that Darwin will suffer if the 'Darwin Trader' is tied up; so also will many industries around the coast of Australia as well as our trade to Japan. Whilst the PREI has exempted the 'Alunga' and, T think, the ship on the container run to the United Kingdom, it has not exempted the ship running to Japan. So not only will the coastal industries and bulk trade be affected but also our exports to Japan. 1 think that the action of the PREI is to be deplored. I am disappointed that Mr Australian Government, which so rightly Hawke was unable to settle the dispute. He is the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. One would think that the small affiliated unions of this nature could be brought under control. to the Minister for Labour and National Service and it refers to compulsion, a subject that has been raised consistently in this House. Is it not a fact that in all of the Government's rural legislation that provides for levies to support research, promotion and marketing, such levies become compulsory for all producers in the applicable industry regardless of the conscience and that severe penalties are provided for those who do not pay? If it is true that such is the case, can the Minister explain to the House where in substance this policy differs from the trade union policy of compulsory unionism or preference to unionists? ter to which the honourable gentleman directs attention would be more properly directed to my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry. In relation to that part of the question I will consult with my colleague and provide the honourable gentleman with an answer in writing. In terms of the parallel which the honourable gentleman draws, it is news to me that it is the official policy of the Australian Labor Party to support compulsory unionism, if that is what the honourable gentleman is referring to. I am sure that the House would be very interested indeed to hear what the policy of the Opposition is on the subject of compulsory unionism, an issue which is of increasing concern to the Australian people. cation and Science seen reports of a statement by Mr Hudson, the South Australian Minister of Education, relating to an increase in educational allowances as against taxable income?

The South Australian Minister tried to make out the case that the allowances affected only one section of the community and were biased in favour of wealthier secwere not made in the period of my admintions of the community. There is one point that should be noted and which should not be ignored: Those on the higher incomes are paying taxation at a much higher rate than those on lower incomes. This fact is relevant to any rational discussion of thc matter. The other point, and a much more important one perhaps, of which the South Australian Minister took no note that I can recall, is that those allowances are of specific advantage to people in remote country areas whose only prospect of giving their children the kind of education they would like to give them is to send them to boarding schools. If people in country areas, especially those in the wool prepared by the Victorian Anti-Cancer growing areas at the moment, are regarded by the Opposition as being amongst the most affluent people in the Australian community, that certainly would not be the view on the Government side of the House. The honourable member for Angas referred to the support given by the South Australian Government to independent schools. I am glad to see that since last week the South Australian Government has provided an additional amount$150,000 only, but at least it was an addidrug education which the Minister for tion-to support for independent education in the primary area. South Australia comes about average amongst the States in support of education in the primary area. But when we look at the secondary area of education, which of course is a very expensive one, the South Australian Government provides much less than any other State or Territory. Dr EVERINGHAMI ask the Minister for Imigration: Did the Government refuse visas to East German contestants for political reasons and so deprive Australia of the right to see the 1966 world pentathlon championships? Did a similar decision deprive Australia of the world table tennis cil of Victoria showed that 3,167 Auschampionships in 1967 for political reasons? Will a similar policy be applied to refuse entry to international cricket teatm which are selected racially because of political decrees and not according to merit? to whicb the honourable gentleman referred istration. I will examine the facts and advise him as to precisely what happened. But it is the general policy of the Government and my Department to provide visas for sporting teams to come to this country. It any exception is to be made to this policy the case is looked at by the Government on its merits and a decision is made.

Will the Minister consider arranging additional screenings of these educational films on Australian Broadcasting Commission television stations as part of the programme on the dangers of drugs of addiction? question contains material which relates really to the portfolios of 2 of my colleagues -the Minister for Health and the Postmaster-General. That part of the question which affects me affects that aspect of Health and myself administer jointly on behalf of the Government and for which the Government has hypothecated $500,000 this year for a national education campaign. I have seen the reports to which the honourable gentleman refers and formed my own very strong personal opinions about them. I think that anyone would now express little doubt that cigarette smoking is a dangerous health hazard. If we are discussing dangerous drugs of addiction I think one must concede that one of the present drugs of addiction which are causing damage in Western society certainly would be tobacco as used in cigarette smoking.

Expenditure of the $500,000 which has been given for education relates mainly to those drugs which are denned by the Single Convention of the United Nations as narcotics and other dangerous drugs and is, as I said before, administered by my colleague the Minister for Health and myself. I will confer with him to see whether attention or consideration could be given to including cigarette smoking in this campaign. MightI say, in conclusion, that while we are hopeful that the expenditure of $500,000 will result in young people being dissuaded from taking dangerous drugs and parents being awakened to the dangers of drug abuse, the real answer does not lie. in a national education programme; it lies in the consciousness of parents of the need to educate their children on the dangers of smoking and of taking other dangerous drugs. Social Services a question. Did the honourable gentleman raise the matter of national superannuation at the Federal Council of the Liberal Party on 31st May, and did the Prime Minister describe his remarks to the Council, in his presence, as a 'most blatant' breach of Cabinet secrecy? (Opposition members interjecting). knows how to answer that one. the Leader of the Opposition does not want any assistance at this stage, and I suggest that the question should be asked. Did he subsequently, on 2nd July, tell the Queensland Council on the Ageing that a national superannuation scheme was ready for adoption, and on 24th August advocate in this House presentation of a national superannuation green paper? Will he continue to defy the Prime Minister, and has that right honourable gentleman ventured to rebuke him afresh? the honourable gentleman's curiosity in these matters. It is inordinate in this as in other matters. However, I can assure him that what happened at the Federal Council of the Liberal Party is none of his concern. I can assure him that he has quoted not accurately, but not terribly inaccurately, what I said in Queensland, which is a matter of public record. If he wants to know what I said in this House he might well refresh his memory by having a look at Hansard which in this as in other matters is almost invariably accurate. MEAT EXPORTS Mr O'KEEFEI ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry: Have Australian meat interests considerable quantities of beef on the water to the United States of America? Is there a threatened longshoremen's strike in that country? Will this seriously affect our sales to the United States, and will the meat at present on board ship be unloaded at its destination? tity of Australian meat is on the water, although 1 believe that actual exports during the past week have tended to taper off mainly because of the uncertainty of a strike in the United States ports on the Gulf of Mexico and in the United States ports bordering the Atlantic Ocean. For the past two or three months the Australian Meat Board has been encouraging exporters to export as much meat as possible so that we can fill our quota. The threat of a strike on both the West Coast and the East Coast of the United States could prevent us from doing that. A strike of longshoremen on the West Coast has been in progress since about the beginning of July, and it was only recently that negotiations commenced to try to settle it. We are hopeful that the strike might end shortly. But at the present time our meat is going to the ports on the East Coast of the United States. The present contract expires on 30th September, and unless a settlement is reached the strike could spread which then would prevent any further meat shipments to the United States. If there is meat on the water it could be diverted into Canadian ports, such as Halifax or St Johns, in the same way as we have diverted to Vancouver some shipments to the West Coast of the United States.

WOOL directed to the Minister for Primary Industry and it concerns the $60m which is required to build up the price of wool to 36c per lb, and the very serious economic circumstances of country towns and the large number of unemployed in those areas. Will the Minister inform the House whether the Government intends to take steps to ensure that when the subsidy is paid to the wool brokers, it is not held by them to reduce the wool growers' debts to the brokers as this would leave little or no money for the growers to pay shire rates and country business houses, thereby relieving unemployment in country areas? 36c per lb price support scheme for the wool industry is to ensure that wool growers' incomes over the next 12 months will be lifted to a point which will enable them reasonably to work out their future in relation to wool trends and opportunities which might be available for diversification or perhaps to move out of the industry should that be their desire. As to the allospeaking there are twin problems of recruitcation of the funds the intention is that the ment and retention. I will not go into them money should be paid to the wool grower's account. It is true that the funds will be administered both through the wool brokers and through private wool buyers. The Government does not intrude on the private operations of business between wool brokers, the buyers and their clients but it is intended that the funds should be paid to the actual wool grower's account. In some instances the funds may well be used by wool brokers to satisfy outstanding indebtedness with the wool brokers but in those circumstances it will be no different from the proceeds of the sale of wool. In the past the pattern offinancingoperations in the wool industry has been to a large degree a borrowing of funds for stock purchases from wool brokers on the understanding, and subject to a wool lien, that the loans would be repaid when the wool proceeds were received by the wool brokers. I would expect that in some instances this has meant that growers have had to borrow again from wool brokers. Where there is any retention of the funds by wool brokers or by others one would expect that the brokers will maintain at least the same level of credit for wool growers in the future as they have in the past. Army a question. Will the Minister consider making a statement in the near future on the present strength, recruitment and organisation of the Citizen Military Forces so that the House may debate this subject? a statement ought to be made in this House does not rest unilaterally with me. This is a mater-particularl y in regard to the Citizen Military Forces-for discussion by the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the House and me. I know that the honourable member is both interested in and concerned with the decline which has been apparent in the overall strength of the CMF over the last 3 years. The honourable member's interest and concern are shared by me. I have visited various commands to try to confirm the reasons given by those at Army headquarters who are associated with the CMF. Generally in detail because the honourable member's question is primarily related to whether a statement could be made in this House. I conclude by saying that when one talks about the CMF and one bears in mind what this Government has done for the CMF it must be remembered that it is the Citizen Military Forces and as sucb it requires assistance from those within the community, particularly employers. I have nothing further to say on this matter at this stage. directed to the Minister for Education and Science.

77,Mr Anthony,"Thes e reports are inhas done the concept of interim arrangements to ensure an orderly and successful transition to the new basis. It has been noted that the problem of an established textile industry being unable to compete against low cost countries is not unique to Australia. A high proportion of western countries has found it necessary to impose quota restrictions or to negotiate voluntary restraints with Asian countries to manage a sharing of their internal markets between imports and domestic production. It is not within the terms pf reference or the responsibility of the Tariff Board to take up the possibility of such arrangements between countries and the report does not therefore bring them under reference. But having regard to the particular circumstances of this case and to the approaches which have been followed in other countries, the Government has felt that this alternative also should be explored as one of the possible means of moving to the longer term position which the Board has recommended. In taking up and tabling the Board's report, the Government therefore decided on the following courses of action: (a) For knitted shirts and outergarments quantitative restrictions should be applied for a period of up to 18 months at the licensing levels origifor Customs and Excise, will formally nally recommended by the Special Advisory Authority. These are 60 per cent of the import level for the year ended March 1969 for knitted shirts and 100 per cent of the import level for the year ended . 30th June 1967 for knitted outer garments. The current rates of duty will continue to apply during this period to all knitwear covered by the report of the Tariff Board. (b) For those woven shirts on which the Special Advisory Authority had previously recommended additional duties these duties will be re-applied for a period of up to 18 months. The current rates of duty on other woven shirts covered by the Tariff Board's report will also continue to operate for this period. Meanwhile the Government proposes to ( Mr Anthony) earlier this afternoon gave initiate negotiations with thbse low-cost honourable members details of the Govcountries which are the major suppliers of ernment's decision in relation to the Tariff the products covered by these reports. Board's reports on knitted outer garments These negotiations will be aimed at arriving at mutually acceptable arrangements which will allow these countries both reasonable access and growth prospects for their exports but also enable the more efficient sectors of the Australian woven shirts and knitted outer garments industries to continue to operate on a viable basis. These negotiations are to be conducted in the general oversight of Ministers and will of course be considered by the Government before any final decision is taken. In summary, the Government has decided that in order to achieve an orderly transition to the basis which the Tariff Board recommends, the levels of protection which have applied in recent years should be maintained for a further period of up to 18 months, during which period it will initiate negotiations for voluntary restraint arrangements with the principal low-cost supplying countries. This is on the basis that the industries concerned will be expected within this period to take steps to adjust to the increased import competition which will follow the transitional period and the Government's intention to reach a situation where the longer term levels of protection recommended by the Tariff Board can be phased in without disruption to the more efficient sectors of the industries concerned. My colleague, the Minister introduce the Customs Tariff Proposal to formulate the necessary legislation. I represent the following paper: Reports by the Tarifl Board on knitted shirts and outergarments and woven shirts, etc-Minis terial Statement, 7th September 1971.

In addition, import restrictions on knitted coats, jumpers, cardigans, sweaters and the like and men's and boys' knitted shirts will be reintroduced from tomorrow 8th September on the same bases as those applying previously. These measures constitute holding action for a period up to 18 months.

To assist honourable member in underthe terms upon which such exports will be standing the terminology in this statement, made. may I briefly-in general terms-defin e the parties involved. 'Producers' are those companies which own and extract the raw exports in general would be restricted to material from the oil fields. 'Refiners' are 20 per cent of the allocation of crude oil those companies which refine Australian required to be taken up by either refiners and imported crude oil into petroleum or marketers. Provision was also made products and market these products. 'Marthat, in exceptional circumstances, the keters' are those companies who do not engage in refining crude oil themselves, but which purchase petroleum products from refiners in Australia and/or overseas and market the refined products in Australia. There is no restriction on the importation of refined petroleum products by either refiners or marketers. However, consistent with its policy, the Government determined that marketers of imported petrol should accept the same obligation as refiners and take a proportion of indigenous crude. To that end Australian crude oil is allocated amongst both refiners and marketers according to a formula based on the relative sales of certain refined products. As the import parity price was a weighted average, it necessarily followed that it was a higher price, to some companies, than the price of the crude' they had been importing. At the present time, of course, because of significant increases in crude oil prices overseas, the determined Since October 1968, the production of the company's refinery activities in Australia; and (c) they are willing to disclose The industry has been informed that,",26,Tariff Proposals
79,Mr Chipp (Hotham,"Minister for Cusprice for indigenous crude is less than ifGovernment would be prepared to consider an approach by any company to have this limit varied. Consistent with this policy 5 companies have been permitted to export a proportion of their allocation. The exports to date amount to approximately 2 per cent of total indigenous production. In each of these cases, the Government had accepted that the companies concerned were having difficulties because of the different type of oil normally used pending a realignment of their refining facilities. Refiners are investing significant amounts of money to readjust their refineries to cope with Australian oil. Recently .2 marketers of petrol, who do not have refinery facilities in Australia, sought permission of the Government to export the whole of their allocation of indigenous crude oil. They were again informed of the Government's policy, as outlined above, and were asked to negotiate with local refiners to have their allocation of indigenous crude oil refined in Australia. However, they, were also informed that, if either existing or proposed refining arrangements were not mutually acceptable, the Government would again reconsider the applications. To this end, the Government indicated that it was prepared to call upon an independent arbiter to determine whether the arrangements proposed by the refining companies were equitable. In the event, agreement has not been reached and, at the request of the Government, Sir Leslie Melville, K.B.E., has undertaken to advise the Government as an arbiter. Sir Leslie will be assisted by Mr T. A. Webb, a consulting engineer, who has had long and varied experience in the oil refining industry. On the receipt of the Arbiter's advice, the Government will reconsider these applications. I turn now to the subject of dumping. Recently, several oil companies approached the Government alleging that petroleum products from some countries were being dumped in Australia in contravention of the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. It is a fact that in some countries refiners produce petroleum products in excess of those countries' requirements. Consequently to dispose of this surplus there is compulsion to seek export markets and if necessary to supply them at low prices. I point out that the Government's policy is that no Australian industry should suffer because of unfair trading practices by overseas exporters. In accordance with normal procedures, these allegations -have been examined and, on the best information available to the Department of Customs and Excise, it would appear that dumping has taken place to an extent which may be causing not insubstantial injuryand I use here the precise term of the Act -to the refiners of petroleum products in Australia. Consequently, the industry has now been informed that, if petrol is exported bn or after 31st August 1971, from certain countries, at a price lower than the normal values that have been assessed, dumping cash securities will be collected. However, companies have been invited to submit any evidence they may have if they consider the normal values assessed are not accurate with a view to a re-examination of this aspect. In accordance with the normal procedure, if petroleum products are imported at lower than the normal value, the question will be . examined by the Tariff Board in accordance with the terms of the Dumping and Subsidies Act. The Government is conscious of the complex nature of this industry with its many component parts and conflicting interests. The indigenous oil policy has been of great advantage to Australia. It has resulted in massive quantities of crude oil and natural gas being found in Australia. It has encouraged further research and exploration into finding new fields. It has insured that Australia will not simply be a 'quarry' from which the raw material is mined and taken out of Australia for processing. On the contrary it has stimulated significant investment and created much employment for Australians. It has insulated motorists against dramatic increases in oil prices which have taken place overseas. At the same time it has allowed free competition to function, in that persons other than established oil companies can import petroleum products and sell them on the Australian market. The Government is conscious that its policy in this area not only affects the ofl companies per se, but thousands of smaller business men and employees engaged in marketing and distribution. It would be unthinkable if the Government did not act in accordance with the law and its declared policies when alleged unfair practices are brought to its notice. The Government has done this in invoking the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. However, as I have said every opportunity will be given to importers if they wish the matter to be further reviewed. In the last resort the final decision can only be made after a report by the Tariff Board. I present the following paper: Indigenous Oil Policy-Ministeria l Statement, 7 industry recently made application for antiSeptember 1971. Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That ihe House take note of the paper. ment which has just been made by thc normal values. Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Today we are told again by the Minister Chipp) is completely unacceptable to the Opposition and should be completely unacceptable to this Parliament. It marks a material change in the Government's policy in the oil industry. The policy of the ex-Prime Minister, given on 10th October 1968 without consultation with his Cabinet and without consultation with his confreres in the Government was, in the words cf the Minister, a policy which sought that indigenous crude oil would be refined and used in Australia. The decisions that have just been announced by the Minister leave grave doubts in my mind and in the minds of members of the Opposition as to the manner and reasons for the decisions having been taken. We are not satisfied at ail that the Minister has given us all the information at his disposal. I know for certain that oil companies have been pressing this Government from as long ago as 18 months for a similar decision to the one that has just been announced. Those companies were having difficulties then in using the Australian indigenous crude oil and they told the Government so. No action was taken by the Government. As short a time ago as 28th June this year the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon), who was then the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry, made a statement which read: He announced that he had decided not to refer is referring them to an arbiter. I will come the question of emergency tariff protection on petroleum products to the Special Advisory to this later. The marketers are having Authority. It continued: 'In addition to the detailed data presented by Ampol Ltd' said Mr Nixon, 'confidential information was also obtained from importers and members of the petroleum industry. It was concluded that in the present circumstances a reference to the Special Advisory Authority would not be justified.' Yet, on 2nd September, a matter of 4 days ago, the Minister who has just spoken released a Press statement headed 'Dumping Information'. The statement reads: A section of the Australian petroleum refining dumping action against imports of petrol. Following inquiries, prima facie evidence of dumping bas been established and dumping cash securities will be taken in respect of petrol exported to Australia on and after 31 August 1971 in his statement that as well as anti-dumping action the Government has granted permission for up to 20 per cent of ths allocation of indigenous crude oil to the various companies to be exported and a greater percentage will be allowed under exceptional circumstances. Five companies have indigenous crude oil. However, those companies have not been named and they remain anonymous. Two marketers have also sought permission to export the whole of their allocation of indigenous crude but. they have been refused. The marketers have been having great difficulty in getting their quota refined. The Minister for Customs and Excise, who is at the table, shook his head when I made the statement that marketers have been refused to export crude. arbiter. to the arbiter. The Minister said in his statement: Recently two marketers of petrol, who do not have refinery facilities in Australia, sought permission of the Government to export the whole of their allocation of indigenous crude oil. They were again informed of the Government's policy, as outlined above, and were asked to negotiate with local refineries to have their allocation of indigenous crude oil refined in Australia. That is a refusal, Mr Minister. The Minister is giving them no protection at all. He great difficulty in getting their quota",27,Indigenous Oil Policy

82,Mr Stewart,"No it has not. It is goingrefined. This is the reason why the Minister has referred this matter to an independent arbiter. We have seen another Gorton policy in tatters. I want you, Mr Speaker, to note carefully the timing of the decisions. In March this year the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) was deposed as Leader of the Liberal Parry and consequently deposed as Prime Minister of Australia. In June a request by Ampol for emergency tariff protection on petroleum imports was rejected by the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry. On 2nd September the Minister at the table announced that anti-dumping action would be taken. On 7th September we have an announcement in the House which almostcompletely changes the previous policy. The Opposition wants to know what pressures have been applied to the Government by the oil industry to cause this change so shortly after the deposing of the right honwords of the Minister this afternoon: ourable member for Higgins, the founder of the crude oil policy in Australia. What promises have been made to the Government of electoral support by the oil companies to obtain this change? There is a smell about the whole matter. This Parliament has not been given the facts. A number of questions remain to be answered and some of those questions are: Which are the 5 companies allowed to export crude oil? Who are the marketers who cannot obtain refining facilities? What information was placed before the Government between June and September to obtain anti-dumping action? And a very important question: What is the cost of production of petrol by refineries in Australia? What is the cost of the petrol imported by marketers? Will the evidence placed before the independent arbitrator, Sir Leslie Melville, be made public? How long has the Government given him to tender his advice on this matter? What protection is to be given to the marketers while the inquiry is taking place? How is it that refiners can now claim to be experiencingI use the words of the Minister and he said they came directly from the Act-no t unsubstantial injury when those same oil companies and refiners can afford to indulge in a price war on petrol throughout Australia against a very few marketers? How is it that oil companies and refineries can spend millions of dollars a year in advertising? I have another very important question: How many oil companies are Australian owned or substantially Australian owned? The Minister made mention of an Australian industry. The Opposition and I am certain the public would like to know just how much equity Australia has in the major oil companies throughout Australia. The annua] profits of oil companies and refineries are fairly well hidden, but each year most of them announce a substantial profit. Why did not the Minister put some of those facts before the Parliament when he made the announcement of the changing of the Government's oil policy? All the questions I have posed, and many more, should be answered and I am suggesting that the only way-the only proper wayfor these questions to be answered is for the Government to set up a royal commission into the oil industry in Australia. T am reinforced in that suggestion hy these -The Government is conscious of the complex nature of this industry with its many component parts and conflicting interests. Earlier in his speech he announced the setting up of the independent arbitrator to decide a battle between the marketers, the people who are bringing in low priced petrol and giving it to motorists at 4c or Sc a gallon lower than the major oil companies have been giving it to them-a n independent arbitrator to see whether they can get a little bit of equity and justice from the major refining interests in Australia. These things should be answered and I am surprised that a Minister for whom I have a great deal of respect should come into the Parliament with a statement like thisa major statement-and give so little information to the Parliament on the reasons for this major alteration in Government policy. The Government has laid down a couple of stipulations on what the refiners will have to do before they are given permission to export some of their crude oil allocation. He did not publish, and I do not think they have published information on the firm plans to install extra refinery capacity to take up the Australian crude quota. If tbey are willing to disclose the terms-r-and this is one of the conditions the Government lays down-upo n which such exports of crude will be made, surely the Parliament is entitled to know how much petroleum in Australia costs at the moment. I am completely dissatisfied wi the statement and 1 am completely dissatisfied with the policy of the Government on Australian crude and the oil industry generally. I will admit that there are major problems in this industry but such important decisions as this one should not be made behind closed doors. The Parliament is entitled to know more about it than it has been given and even if the matter goes to the Tariff Boml and a final decision is made very little information will appear in the report of the Tariff Board and the Parliament again, and I would think the Cabinet again, will be making a decision in the dark. This industry, in the Minister's own words, by using Australian crude in the current year has saved approximately $230tn in foreign exchange payments. It is too important an industry for the ex-Prime Minister to be sitting down negotiating crude oil pricing policies or for this Minister or for any other Minister to sit down behind closed doors with representatives of the major oil companies before them pushing them hither and thither, using every pressure they can so they can get a decision which will put more profits into the oil companies at the expense of the 3 million or 4 million motorists in Australia. I come back to the point: I make a request that this Government should set up a royal commission into the oil industry in Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Giles) adjourned. Assent reported.

Thus we are told to give an impression of activity on various matters dealing with the securities markets, with that there are committees dealing with securities them, and when we try to find out the exchanges. It was on 19th March 1970 progress of the committees we are told that a motion by my colleague, Senator that their proceed'ngs are confidential.

Furthermore, in his report for 1970-71, signed on 15th July-the quickest report this Parliament ever gets-h e went through the whole of the procedure which he was advocating, not for the first time, to have effective laws, pointing out that the Trade Practices Act 1965 took far too long, that it would be years before there would be any effect on trade practices as the Act stood and that if we adopted the approach, the definitions and the procedures of the 1971 resale price maintenance legislation we could at last have an effective trade practices law in this country. I can very briefly touch on other subjects on which the Parliament can now pass laws in the light of the High Court decision. They include consumer protection and consumer credit. These are matters upon which the United States of America, Canada, West Germany and other commen that Sir Robert Menzies in March Attorney-General, the last reason, amongst others, that the ConstituAgain under the High Court decision the Parliament can now pass national laws and exchange-the stock committee of the Senate to inquire into",31,Power

87,The New Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon),"international reputation if Australia at last were to have a securities and exchange commission such as the United States has had for the last 4 decades. The present Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, expressed the view that it was high time that the various State governments considered the desirability of establishing such a commission in each State. He thought that there were constitutional difficulties about the setting up of a national commission. His doubts can now be allayed. In the same field we have had reports by Mr Justice Eggleston's committee-the Company Law Advisory Committee to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. In itsfirstreport on 17th October 1968it was not tabled by the Attorney-General of the day but it was tabled, as were the 4 subsequent reports, by the honourable member for Berowra when he became Attorney-General for the first time-ther e was a strong recommendation for a companies commission. In the last report this recommendation has been reiterated and additional reasons have been given for it. Finally, under the High Court decision the Parliament can now pass laws on overseas control of our companies. The proportion of our company income payable overseas has risen now to over 30 per cent. The Australian Capital Territory Life Insurance Holding Companies Ordinance of 1968, the Australian Capital Territory Com-visions of the Trade Practices Act to be panies (Uranium Mining Companies) Ordiance of 1970 and the proposals made by the former Prime Minister to the President of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges on Sth December 1968-al l matters designed to safeguard Australian companies from overseas takeovers-hav e not been followed up. (Extension of time granted.) These3 methods, under the auspices of the former Prime Minister, were designed to prevent the takeover of Australian companies. Two of them were effective because the companies concerned were within the Commonwealth's power, as then understood, over the Territories. The other one was voluntary and has not been followed voluntarily by any companies in the Australian Capital Territory. The fact now is that, if we approve of the method, we can ensure that the same methods applying to the uranium company and the MLC can be prosecution in the Industrial Court of 3 applied to any companies in Australia. The manufacturers of concrete pipes for failing, former Prime Minister has shed light on his conflict with the Treasury over the MLC. I would acknowledge the part played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen), who will follow me, in collaborating with the former Prime Minister in safeguarding the MLC. In. the matters which I have mentioned we can now in this Parliament, thanks to last Friday's historic decision by the High Court, at last achieve national codes in matters which concern the welfare of all Australians. These are matters in relation to which other federal systems-abov e all the great federal systems of Canada and the United States-hav e such codes. If we are to have a just and efficient economy, .ind society in Australia we should now legislate in these fields where for years we have had advice from statutory reports to the Parliament from specialist advisers, to. the Attorneys-General and from committees of both Houses of the Parliament. Mr N. H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.28)I agree that the decision of the High Court last Friday was a most important one. This was the decision given in the case of Strickland v. Rocla Concrete Pipes Limited and others, which is commonly referred to as the concrete pipes case. The High Court by majority held important proviinvalid. At the same time the decision threw new light on the power that section SI (xx) of the Constitution has conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to foreign corporations .and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. My colleague in another place, the Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood), is currently making a statement on the effect of that decision and what is proposed to be done by the Government in relation to the Trade Practices -Act. I feel I should take some of the time which is available to me in the debate on this matter of public importance to mention some of the matters that he is putting before the other place. The concrerte pipes case arose out of a contrary to section 43 of the Trade Practices Act, to register particulars of an agreeBerowra( Mr Hughes), was successful in ment containing restrictive provisions. The agreement related to the supply of concrete pipes in Queensland by the 3 companies, and it regulated prices and other terms on which concrete pipes were to be supplied. Honourable members will doubtless have read in the Press that the High Court held, by a majority of 5 to 2, that the Trade Practices Act did not validly require the registration of the agreement. There are 2 points about this. Firstly, the agreement in question had a purely intrastate-no t interstate-operation . Secondly, the corporations involved were manufacturers as well as sellers of their products. The Commonwealth's case relied for its support entirely on the corporation's power. For the Commonwealth to succeed it was necessary for the High Court to overrule an earlier decision of the Court in the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead which was decided in 1909. In that case the High Court had held that the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which was the forerunner of the present Trade Practices Act, did not validly apply to corporations in respect of then: intrastate trading activities. This decision has now been overruled by the High Court, which has made it clear that the corporations power in the Constitution can be used to support legislation dealing with restrictive trade practices of foreign and trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth, that is, whether they are trading interstate or intrastate. The Trade Practices Act, as drafted by constitutional operation. Tn the light of the my predecessor, who is now the Treasurer guidance that has been provided in the ( Mr Snedden), had provided in section 7 judgment as to the scope of the corporations that one of the heads of power relied on power, the Government has decided that was paragraph (xx), and that this was in the immediate and remedial legislation will cluded on the footing that it was doubtful be founded on the corporations power. As Moorehead was correctly decided. If it answer to a question today, this will cover was correctly decided there would have approximately 99 per cent of the cases been no point in including section 7 (2.). which are registered. That sub-section was included upon the basis that there would be reliance placed will not be pressing on with its review, upon the corporations power. It was ineviwhich is well advanced, of the Trade table that there would be a challenge. It Practices Act generally. For example, one came, and the Commonwealth, which was of the major areas which we are considerrepresented in the case, as the Leader of ing very carefully is the position of horithe Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has said, by zontal restrictive price agreements and the honourable and learned member for having the decision in Huddart Parker and Moorehead overruled. The immediate consequence of the decision is that substantial parts of the Trade Practices Act-thoug h probably not all parts of it-ar e invalid. The learned Chief Justice referred to the Act being wholly invalid, but he was directing his attention specifically to section 35. I do not think that he was particularly directing his attention, for example, to the provisions relating to resale price maintenance or to shipping. under the 1965-69 Act, not the 1965-71 Act. Mr N. H. BOWEN-Yes. He was not directing his attention to those provisions, and indeed they have a different severability provision. The consequence on which the majority of judges fastened to hold the Act invalid was the consequence of the operation of section 7, the severability provision, which was held not to operate to sever the good from the bad in the Act. The whole Act was held to fall, and the position now is that there is a substantial gap. In the public interest it is desirable that that gap should be filled quickly, and the Government proposes to introduce, as a matter of urgency, legislation to overcome the constitutional defects which have been found to exist in the Trade Practices Act. This new legislation, for reasons of urgency, will be similar in scope to the present Trade Practices Act, except for amendments needed to bring it into This is not to say that the Commonwealth",33,Power

89,Mr Whitlam,"No, but the decision waswhether we should not make these unenforcible immediately unless the person entering into them can discharge the onus of showing affirmatively that they are in the public interest, as we have done with vertical resale price maintenance. But this would involve a much longer drafting job. It is thought that the gap should not be allowed to continue while this is undertaken. But as the Prime Minister has said, he has given extreme urgency to this general review and the legislation which is to follow upon its being completed. This will be brought before the House later. A number of matters are raised in the matter of public importance which we are debating although the Trade Practices Act is the principal one. PerhapsI should mention one other matter because I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that we should now re-enact the Australian Industries Preservation Act which had been held to be invalid in the case of Huddart Parker and Moorehead. May I just remind the Leader of the Opposition that the basis of that Act was to make it a statutory offences to engage in restrictive practices. One of the weaknesses in the operation of the Act was that it involved the prosecution proving its case beyond reasonable doubt, and proving it in circumstances where all the information was in the possession of the States to attempt to take over this area is accused. This was the basic reason why the Australian Industries Preservation Aot really did not become effective, and I think it would be a very retrogressive step to return to that concept. Certainly the procedure which is now followed, where the parties to the agreement have to disclose the facts by registration and then allow a tribunal look at it, is one way of dealing with the matter. The procedure which we have used in dealing with resale price mainthe University of Adelaide and which has tenance requires again not the establishment of a criminal offence but just the outRoggerson report stated that we should lawing of the agreement, with the capacity for anyone affected by such an outlawed agreement to get an injunction restraining its operation. This is another matter which has to be considered in the general review. I do not at all accept the proposition put by the Leader of the Opposition that we should immediately return to the Australian Industries Preservation Act. This discussion of a matter of public Victorian law reform committee, which importance is not restricted to. trade pracdealt with this topic. Anyone who has tices; it is rather a vague and general discussion which refers to the general need to pass laws relating to trade practices, consumer protection, consumer credit, securities markets and overseas control under the Commonwealth's corporations power. It is really a whiff of centralist grapeshot fired into the air without any defined target. However, in the few minutes remaining to me perhaps I should look at some of the other topics which have been raised in the matter of public importance. The first is consumer protection. Of course, this is an enormous area which the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has been considering over a long period of time with resulting State legislation being introduced from time to time. The question covers unfair practices, door to door selling and tbe problem concerning inertia selling which the Committee is currently considering. The States have established consumer protection authorities, as a result of the consideration which the Attorneys General together have given to the matter. It is not only corporations which are involved in ths matter. This is an area in which many single proprietors of businesses and partnerships are involved. To say that the High Court's ruling on paragraph (xx) should lead the Commonwealth immediately and perhaps without consultation with the something which has really been said without being thought through. The second matter which is referred to in Uie matter of public importance is the question of consumer credit. Again, this is a matter on which the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has received much material, in particular, the massive Roggerson report which was compiled by been laid on the table of this House. The entirely review the whole basis of credit and that we should abolish the hire purchase agreement as it is known under the law and have only certain other types of agreement which were laid down in this report. A tremendous change in the concept of the law was involved in the Roggerson report. At the last law convention held in Melbourne recently a massive paper was presented, foreshadowing a report of a studied those papers will know that the whole question of consumer credit is an enormous one. It again involves not just simply the corporalions covered by paragraph (xx), but an immense range of individuals, partnerships and sole proprietors of consideration of one of the substantive acts businesses. If we were going to enter this field in this post-haste manner that is suggested in the matter of public importance, we would need to have the closest co-operation with the States. It is a very complex area and one which is currently the subject of legal amendment which is being considered. Simply to float the question in a matter of public importance and to say that the Commonwealth now needs to pass laws relating to consumer credit really does not add to knowledge on the subject at all. The securities market is another target. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Eggleston Committee recommended something like this. It did nothing of the sort. It recommended a companies commission. It specified that the companies commission should be totally different to the' American Securities and Exchange Commission. It recommended a companies commission with a dispensing power. It laid down in its report conditions so strict for companies that it thought there ought to be a Federal companies commission having a dispensing power to apply to companies which showed they could not comply with such conditions. The Leader of the Opposition is mistaken in suggesting that it was anything to do witb a securities and exchange commission. Of course this a matter which the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange is now considering and I would hope that we will get some valuable comments when that Committee presents its report. This is a matter that will then be considered. We should not think that this corporation power simply opens the door for a securities and exchange commission. It might be argued that capital raisings by foreign corporations or trading and financial corporations, whether by share capital or by debentures or other forms of lending, might be subject to control. But it does not which this Government has taken to use suggest that dealings between people and individuals on share markets or dealings by brokers come under this control. This matter of public importance has not been thought out in the slightest degree nor does it contribute to the accomplishment of this Parliament. Thc last matter referred to is overseas control. This debate is probably delaying which this Government is endeavouring to take on overseas control. Where it has been necessary and desirable in the public interest to take steps in relation to overseas control this Government has taken action. I refer to the Banks (Shareholdings) Bill 1971 which is on the notice paper. This type of active legislation is being held up by the Opposition introducing these vague debates and through a habit on the part of honourable members on the other side of the House of moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders and then the mover and seconder speaking while the whole business of the House is delayed. This is the sort of thing that is delaying the Government in getting on with the business of controlling this kind of thing where it needs to be controlled. Let us get on with the Banks (Shareholdings) Bill and overseas shareholding acquisitions in our banks and stop talking about vague generalities such as we have in this debate. ritory) (4.43)-We have heard the classic traditional exposition of the conservative point of view in politics from the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen). The Minister spoke for about two-thirds of his time in a manner which suggested he was going to give a law book type treatise on constitutional law. It was only towards the end of his address that he dealt with the subject of the discussion, which is the need to pass laws relating to trade practices, consumer protection, consumer credit, securities markets and overseas control. He said that we must not hurry but that we will press on relentlessly in some way and that what we will do in the meantime is fill the gap that has now been shown to exist in our trade practices legislation. If the Government presses on at its past rate we will have to wait approximately another 61 years because that is the time the various methods available to it to test or to have the Huddart Parker decision repealed.

It is against the traditions of the of a lot of judicial comment as I am sure High Court to tell us from a drafting point the honourable member for Berowra( Mr of view how we should go about trying Hughes) and other honourable members again and it is theoretically possible, as I realise. It is to his credit that this year the am sure lawyers will appreciate, that we Government has initiated litigation which could try again and we could again run has produced this very fine result but it into some unforeseen trouble. has taken 61 years to do it. Are we to wait for a similar step or for legislation before any action is taken? This is realiy what it conducted in this country on the basis that comes down to. The parts of this discussion which interexcuse offered by our conservative governest me and which I think are important are ments when defending themselves against these.

We cannot seek advisory opinions but it can be done in other ways particularly now that we are moving into an era of imaginative and wide ranging systems of legal aid. Sixty-two years is too long for a Parliament to wait to be told that all along it could have done something that it had been told it could not do. This Parliament will also have to make much more use of referendums and take a chance that they will not always succeed. I know it means mors expense but so be it. It will be a small price to pay to have a able for use. working Constitution that is more in keeping with modern requirements. The Australian economy today no longer consists of 6 separate State economies plus one superimposed area of Federal economic interest.

The Australian econchanged it. A thaw is in the air and it can omy is diverse and sophisticated. Sometimes it is so sophisticated that it tends to tant decision. What remains to be done, of resemble a Petty cartoon. The influences and the forces that operate within the economy are examples of private power. They have never been adequately investigated and they are not responsible to any democratically elected bodies. If they are allowed to continue as they have been allowed to continue in the past we will not command our future. We will just drift along as we have done in the past. The laissez-faire view was never appropriate even in the eighteenth century. It is bizarre able and learned friend, the Leader of the in its unreality today. Intervention and stimulus by public power-no t private power-ar e necessary in a democratic Australia. That public power can be exercised only through this Parliament. The subjects listed in this proposal to discuss a matter of public importance are important. They are the sort of things which have arisen in the economy, particularly since the end of the Second World War. In recent years, banking has been transformed. Credit facilities have been transformed by mercantile banks and hire purchase companies. There has been a concentration of manufacturing and commercial interests that leaves consumers bewildered and vulnerable as they instinctively feel that they are being exploited by forces over which they have no control. We have seen Australia invaded by foreign capital, the magnitude of which should have been foreseen. That foreign capital brings with it foreign ownership which is foreign private power. That power also must be made responsible and accountable to the Australian people. If it is to be done and done properly, the Commonwealth Parliament must have more power. The recent decision of the High Court has indicated that there is one major source of that power which is now ready and availIn the time remaining to me I might just shorten my remarks by saying that as recently as 2 years ago one of the most learned writers on Australian constitutional law described Australia as 'constitutionally the frozen continent'. I think there would be very little argument about that, but some of the recent decisions of the High Court have thrown doubt upon it and be felt, particularly with this most imporcourse, is for the Government to pick up the ball and do something about it, because if tbe opportunity is botched, either deliberately or otherwise, then an opportunity will have been lost. no need to emphasise the importance of the decision that was given by the High Court of Australia on Friday. That has been done very eloquently by my honourOpposition ( Mr Whitlam), by the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen) and by the honourable member; for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr Enderby).. It is a decision with momentous-consequences for our future as a country and as a nation. It is a decision which has been met to some extent with mixed reactions. I heard on the radio this morning that one newspaperI think it was in Western Australia-describe d it as a blow to federalism. Federalism is one .of those .Alice in Wonderland-Humpty Dumpty ,. kind of words. One remembers that Humpty Dumpty said to Alice that, words mean exactly what one wants them to -mean. To",37,Power
91,Mr Hughes (Berowra) (4.53),"I haveme, federalism involves as a basic fact living under a federal constitution and if one is to live under a federal constitution it is one of the primary duties of the federal government, the national government, to explore the limits of constitutional power given to it under that constitution and then, having explored them with a view to ascertaining them by judicial decision, act within them in what one conceives to be the national interest. I think that if that is House owe a duty to the country and also, one of the true aspects of federalism, as I believe it to be, this decision will unlock the doors to a great deal of very important ideological disputation in this country in the future. Standing bere this afternoon I can foresee that in the years to comeI hope I shall be in this Parliament in the years to come although that is perhaps a matter of doubt-w e shall be having debates here which, in terms of the competing ideologies relating to the way the economic life of this country should be run, will be of perhaps greater momentousness than hitherto because we will be debating in a situation where we know that the Commonwealth Parliament has greater powers than hitherto it was thought to have. I think that this will lead to a different direction in the debates and the formulation of policies in this place. I hope that as restraints in the public interest, those these new doors are opening we can keep our ideological debates on a high level. I think we shall need to do so if this country is to be set on the course on which we on both sides of the House want it to go, and that is the course towards greater advancement; although on each side of the House we have very different views as to how that advancement is to be best secured. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the other honourable gentlemen who have spoken in this debate for saying the nice things that they did about my part in the events that led to this decision. IfI may say so to the Leader of the Opposition, 1 shall perhaps quote his words, but possibly without attribution, in another place. I am sure he will not mind. Great questions of policy open up for the Government's consideration and I was delighted to hear, as we heard this aftersaying that this is to be treated as a matter of great urgency. I welcome the decision, which is the only possible decision to take in the circumstances, that legislation be introduced as a matter of extreme urgency to render the Act in its present structure viable on a temporary basis. I think it is implicit in what the Prime Minister said this afternoon that the Government already recognises that this will not be enough in itself. We on this side of the by the way, a duty with a view to our own electoral survival, not to misuse this great opportunity that has been placed before us. We must not, and I am sure we shall not, incur the criticism that was incurred by the Liberals who were led by Mr Asquith in the early part of this century in England criticised for advancing upon measures of social reform with noisy mouths and mouse-like feet. I am sure that we shall not do this and I am sure that the Government recognises-it is plainly implicit in what the Prime Minister said this afternoon-that here we have opening up before us a very great opportunity to introduce in this country on a national level effective trade practices legislation that will recognise, firstly, that private enterprise must be free enterprise and not merely private enterprise and that that enterprise must be subject to reasonable restraints being restraints that are designed to sure the virtues and advantages of true freedom of competition, not altogether cut throat freedom and not the 19th century laissez-faire Liberal type of freedom that went too far, but the true virtues of freedom of competition. I think this is where some of the great ideological debates will open up. I can imagine that honourable gentlemen opposite, if they gain the treasury benches, will wish to use the corporation power in very different ways from the ways in which I would want to use them. If they ever get thereI hope they will notI will be fighting them tooth and nail to put the other view.

These are all matters that require a government to arm itself internally with greater powers of economic integration than certainly is currently the case in Australia. That is what the Opposition has sought to point to in the matter of public importance that it has proposed for discussion this afternoon. It is not just lhat the judgment on one section of an act has set at nought the restrictive trade practices triwhen it was only, after all, last Friday that bunal, but that during the course of the observations made in that judgment reference is made to powers which it was previously thought could not be exercised but which apparently can be exercised. I am suggesting that probably we have to move even further in the quite forseeable future than was suggested in the observations of the learned judges. After all, they are lawyers but many of the matters that are contained in the judgment and which are being debated this afternoon deal with the question of the proper use of economic powers both internally and externally in order to secure the best integration of our internal economy. That, at least, is something that my Party supports and that is why we have taken the opportunity this afternoon to draw attention to some other heads of power to which this Government should give its attention. bett)-Order!

Indeed, I wondered at some stages whether the debate had started. This is a debate on the speeches made by the former Attorneya matter of public importance and I have General, Sir Garfield Barwick, that time been wondering myself why <t has been raised at this stage, f can sympathise with the view expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) that the Opposition felt obliged to raise this matter to draw attention to the extent of Commonwealth power in these matters and the general desirability of the Commonwealth embarking on activities in some of those fields that have been mentioned this afternoon and, indeed, some of the fields that are set out in the matter that we are debating this afternoon. But what I cannot understand is the attitude of the Opposition in coming into this place today-Tuesday-to castigate and to criticise the Government for its lack of activity the High Court handed down its judgment. It was a momentous judgment indeed but it was only last Friday that the judgment was delivered. I think that honourable members of the Opposition who spoke in this debate will agree that until that judgment was delivered this was an area of great complexity and great uncertainty in the law. Honourable members can go back through the law books, through the texts and through the cases and see differing opinions and conflicting judgments which have been given. The whole area has been one of uncertainty which fortunately has now been largely clarified. If honourable members look, for instance, at the collection of 'Cases on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia' edited by Professor Geoffrey decision the decision in the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead in which the Court's decision was recently overruled. In the note to that case, Professor The case establishes lhat pi.

99,Mr Brown,"and time again he referred to the various sources of power that can be drawn on by the Commonwealth to justify as a basis for restrictive trade practices legislation and emphasised again and again the uncertainty of many of these areas of power and their extent. So it is a complicated and involved area. It is one that has been the subject of many judicial decisions. It is one that must still be and will continue to be the subject of the closest and most detailed examination to see precisely what is the extent of Commonwealth power and the way in which that Commonwealth power should be used. It is not simply a matter of the High Court handing down last Friday a momentous decision, which indicates a wide extent of Commonwealth power and the Opposition then coming to the Parliament on the following Tuesday to castigate the Government for not immediately having on the statute books legislation which might in the long run be worthwhile but which is not there now. Enough has probably been said about the trade practices aspect of this subject. The other matters that are mentioned in the proposition that the House is debating at the moment scarcely were discussed. They were referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech, I think. These are consumer protection, consumer credit, security markets and overseas controls. These matters scarcely received a mention in the speeches delivered by the members of the Opposition who took part in this debate. Those matters are all important. They all deserve to be the subject of good and strong legislation. As one speaker from the Opposition side said, it is important for an ordered, civilised and fair socition or the administration of this system ety that these matters should be regulated. But the mistake that the Opposition has made in this field as in so many fields is to say automatically: 'The Commonwealth should act.' They assume automatically that the Commonwealth should legislate. They forget that in many instances as is the case with some of the items that are mentioned in this matter there is also State legislation and that that State legislation is not recommend is that the Commonwealth already implemented. It is not perfect legislation. When one reads the reports, for instance, of the Victorian Consumer Protection Council one will see specific criticisms that are made of the extent of the legislation existing in that State. But the legislation is there. It does work. It can be improved. WhatI say to the members of the Opposition who raise this argument is not that I believe that there should be no Commonwealth intervention in these important matters, but that if Commonwealth activity in these matters is wanted, a case must be made out for it. If Opposition members raise for discussion a matter of public importance such as this one, they must point to specific State legislation which is on the State statute books. They must show the way in which that has not worked; they must show the way in which that has failed. Also, they must show the way in which the Commonwealth can improve upon it. It is not simply a matter of saying that the Commonwealth can introduce legislation and all of these problems will be swept under the table. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen) said, the general area of consumer credit has been the subject of a detailed investigation and a detailed inquiry by the Roggerson committee in South Australia. That committee investigated many aspects of consumer credit and consumer protection and published a detailed and lengthy report. The committee covered aspects such as security over goods, misleading advertising, minimum deposits, disclosure of interest rates and all the other pernicious aspects of consumer credit that so deserve legislation. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will read that report-yo u will read it closely-bu t you will read in vain for any indication that the system of State legislaunder the States is such that a case has been made out for overall Commonwealth control. You will see that one of the principal recommendations is that officers should be appointed in the States to have a general supervision of consumer affairs. The report recommends that commissioners of consumer affairs should be appointed. But what the committee does itself should seek or derive power from some source or other to take over this matter of government activity. What the committee says is that it is important that commissioners of consumer affairs should be appointed, but it is important that they should be appointed in each State by the States themselves, and so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, in the Commonwealth Territories. As I bave said, this very detailed matter has been investigated by a South Australian committee. Also, it has been the subject of discussion by standing committees of State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General. It is being investigated at great length. These are important matters which should be covered by strong legislation to protect the public in these very important areas. I repeat that the only point that can fairly be made against the matter of public importance raised by the Opposition is that it is just too simple a solution to say: 'The Commonwealth should intervene immediately'. concluded.

The overall financial position has deteriorated dramatically since that time. Total expenditure has risen from $60m to $82m while gross licence receipts have risen from $46m to $51m. The excess of expenditure over receipts has more than doubled, rising from $14m in 1968 to an estimated almost $31m in 1971-72. The increased licence fees proposed will thus db no more than restore the relativity of expenditure and receipts to that existing in 1968-69. It can be seen that the growth in gross licence receipts is not matching the trend in expenditure. A serious downturn was evident in 1970-71.

The question now is, 'That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question'. Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 26 August (vide page 792). the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). He has set out the deficiencies, the inequalities and the sectional aspects of this Budget. As the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on housing, urban affairs and environment I was appalled that the McMahon Government continues to accord housing a low priority in Government policy. In regard to the cities it seems that the McMahon Government does not consider them to be its responsibility and continues to imagine that all will be well. It is my view that there is an even greater crisis in our cities than exists in the rural areas, even though their position is catastrophic. I want to deal in detail with matters relating to housing at a later stage. I will deal with economic and social welfare matters during the debate on the Estimates. During this debate I want to deal with matters relating to the environment. There was no mention in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) of these matters directly, and those matters which were indirectly related will only The newly appointed Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts( Mr Howson) would be better described as the Minister for spare parts. This exemplifies the Government's priorities on the environment. During the parliamentary recess I represented the Parliament and my Party on a parliamentary working committee on the environment at Bonn, Germany. It was a challenging experience. Because it is difficult to have a debate on such a topic in this Parliament I intend to devote my comments in this debate to the problems of the environment. We are now becoming aware, perhaps just in time, although there McMahon Government, that we are now face to face with the greatest problem man has ever faced, that of his own survival. I am not referring to his self-destruction by 'the bomb' for we have been concerned about that for some time, but 2 other Bs which have joined 'the bomb' to threaten the survival of man. We now have 3 Bsbombs, babies and bulldozers. In 8000 B.C. we had an estimated population of 5 million people on planet earth. In 1650 A.D. we had an estimated population of 500 million. In 1930 it was 2,000 million. By 1975 we will have 4,000 million. By the turn of the century we will have over 7,000 million. By the year 2035 it is estimated that the world population will be 14,000 million. It took one million years for man to reach the present population. He will double that population in 30 years. I ask all honourable members to pause and give thought to the magnitude of such a population explosion. I question whether we can afford to continue to plunder and exploit our planet in the manner in which we are doing. Can Australia allow the plundering of its natural resources that has been occurring, particularly in the last decade. Can we afford to allow less than 10 per cent of the world's population to use more than 50 per cent of the world's resources annually.

It does not matter if man's value systemand I even include the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) who is at the table-is Communist, Fascist, Conservative, Liberal or Socialist, he faces a global crisis based on the fact that his population increase, his squandering of natural resources, his control of food production, his accelerated urbanisation and his release of a wide variety of toxic substances into the environment are directing him on a collision course with disaster. Scientists predicted over a century and a half ago that man would face famine because of the different ways by which man's population increased and his food production increased. Marxists and capitalists alike ridiculed this theory because of the inability to predict technological innovation. The fact of life is that this is a challenge today to both Marxist and capitalist. The obvious ways by which man's population could be limited were wars, lack of food and infectious disease. To that list we can add the depletion of natural resources and pollution in all its forms. Medical research has reduced the dangers of infectious disease and this has added to the population crisis, but now pollution is beginning to take its toll. We know of many small disasters due to heavy metal poisoning, particularly mercury. A recent 6-year study of mortality rates in New York indicates that one death in 8 in that city over that period was brought on by air pollution and 51 per cent of all hypertensive heart disease deaths were caused by air pollution. A century ago one-third of the world population was malnourished or under-nourished. Even with our vast increase in food production the relative figure today is worse and because of the huge total population increase the total number of starving people is much greater. Recently an American academic, Dr Jay of education needs that the States will be Forrester, wrote a book titled 'World$ 1,443m short of required finance for the Dynamics'. Here he has set up what he years 1971 to 1975. calls a world system in which he has a computer model which predicts how the levels of population, pollution, natural of State, local and semi-government resources, capital investment and quality of finance. In the last 2 decades the cost of life, will change over the next 130 years. on the floor of the House on 17th August: We are, after all, searching for a quality of life which will be better than the one we have today. Let me tell him that his interest in the quality of life has come a little late considering what his Government, of which he shared leadership for the last 22 years, has done. Surely his comments are only mouthing jargon or hypocrisy. Where is the action taken in the Budget to support such a cliche? It is indeed a little late. Dr Forrester tells us that we have just passed through a golden age and from now on the quality of life will decline if the present patterns continue. He shows that an inevitable pollution crisis which will cause the death of 83 per cent of the world's population will follow and that it will predominantly affect developed countries rather than developing countries. He indicates that the doomsday principle, death by pollution, will get us before the argued principle of lack of food. Forrester says that to ensure man's survival as we know him we must immediately, on a global scale, undertake the following steps now: Firstly, a reduction of 30 per cent in the birthrate; secondly, a reduction of 50 per cent in pollution generation; thirdly, a reduction of 75 per cent in our rate of use of natural resources; fourthly, a reduction of 40 per cent in capital investment generation; and fifthly, a reduction of food production by 20 per cent. My own personal view is that Australia should drastically cut her immigration programme. We should question whether it is in the interest of Australia to continue our assisted immigration programme in view of the pressure of immigration on the States, on education, on health and our hospitals, on local government, on spiralling land and housing costs; in fact on all aspects of government. I come now to the burden of education. The Australian Education Council estimated in a nation-wide survey There is also the question of the burden",46,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

That means that land which once was used to produce hay now can be used for food production for humans. But in doing so we are now driving our farm machinery with energy from oil rather than with energy trapped by plants from the sun.

Now that a Federal Department of the Environment has been established, we should define immediately the optimum human environment by a series of goals towards which the Federal and State agencies should work. Thus grants of money for research and development and the choice of how resources, minerals, water, urban and rural land, to name a few, are used, will conform to the highest national priorities. Legislation should be passed by the Commonwealth in relation to the Australian Capital Territories and other Territories. These Acts should be comprehensive, cover the whole human, physical and psychological environment. They will serve as models for legislation which may be passed by the States. Federal grants should be made to encourage the passage of legislation within the States. The Commonwealth has power to levy taxes. It can strive for uniformity by levying special taxes on pollution, by tax incentives and, if necessary, a tax surcharge to encourage pollution control, and by giving grants to States, local and semi-government authorities to ensure a system of policing the environment effort. We should look at our population policy at home and decide on what kind of total population mcrease, natural and immigrant, our environment can handle over a long period. Once legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth and by all States, a joint Commonwealth and State authority should administer pollution and environmental control. Joint co-operation at all levels of government can conquer, control and rectify, and make our Australia beautiful. The Budget is a regressive one. It makes no progressive reform. It takes no action in regard to pollution or environmental control. It gives the Government no power to deal with the real crisis in housing. It does the course of the Estimates debate. A good not deal in any shape or form with the crisis in our cities. For that reason we on this side of the House have been critical of the Budget. Surely it is necessary for the Commonwealth to give leadership in these fields. That has been long overdue. It is not much good the Prime Minister mouthing words, saying that we should have a better quality of life, unless the Oovernment takes positive action. If it does take such action then possibly we will be able to solve some of the problems confronting us in the survival of mankind. The challenge is not parochial or sectional. We are a part of the human race. We are all part of space ship earth. Unless we learn to live together we will in the long run perish together or there may be, as so many people have feared in the past, a war between the haves and the have nots. There will be a struggle for survival between those with a high standard of living and those who live an impoverished life. It is for this reason that I have made these few comments. I hope that they have not fallen on deaf ears. I hope that some positive action will be taken by thc Government and that it has not appointed a Minister for the Environment just to detract from the criticism of the conditions existing in this country. For this reason I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and T hope the Parliament will support it too. the Budget and oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). At the same time. I would like to compliment the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) on making a thoughtful and constructive contribution. I do not agree with everything he said, particularly in relation to housing. As he indicated, he intends to say more about this subject during the Estimates debate. I believe that the new Minister for Housing( Mr Kevin Cairns) has put forward to the State Ministers for Housing a very helpful and constructive formula which apparently most of them have indicated their willingness to accept. Indeed, only two of the State Ministers have indicated any reluctance. It may be that those two, when they give further consideration to the matter, will also agree. At any rate, this matter will no doubt be debated in greater detail during deal of what the honourable member for Reid said about the environment and growing problems in relation to population growth and future trends would be matters with which we would all be in agreement. I heard a recording of a guest of honour speech given by a leading American scientist last night on this very subject. There is no doubt that the question of the preservation of our environment is a world problem. It has many angles to it and it is a",47,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72
105,Mr Drury (Ryan) (5.48),"I supportvast problem. It is fortunate that major scientific brains are now endeavouring to grapple with it. It is a problem in relation to which we must all do our best to help. On the whole I have been disappointed with the debate that has come from honourable members opposite, because in the current state of the economy one would have hoped that Her Majesty's Opposition-the alternative government of this country-woul d have put forward something much more positive, constructive and acceptable to the community than it has done in relation to assisting the economy and giving it the right direction. I will have a little more to say about that matter later. BeforeI speak about the economy I would like to make a brief reference to a comment made last Thursday by my colleague the right honourable member for Fisher( Sir Charles Adermann) in the course of his comments in' this debate. I agree with him when he urges that the Government give consideration to making a decision in relation to a new and permanent Parliament House. At this stage of the economy I would not support any major outlay. I do not think any of us are of that mind. I have it on good authority that it would be 3 or 4 years after a decision is taken before the question of a major outlay of expenditure would arise. I understand that a great deal of preliminary work would be necessary. The calling for designs either on an Australia-wide basis or a world-wide basis would have to be decided. I urge the Government to make a decision at an early date in relation to this ular exercise. big question. IfI have a chance during the Estimates debate on the Parliament I will have something further to say under this unnecessary overlapping which could be heading. The Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) had a internal procedures. I am not convinced in difficult task in framing this Budget. I do my own mind that there may not be some not suppose any of us really envied him opportunity for economising in relation to his task, knowing as we do the various overlapping, for example, with some of the conflicting pressures in the community and State government departments. I know that in the economy to which he was being there is a system of internal controls subjected. On the one hand there is the within the Commonwealth Public Service urgent need for action to control inflation in relation to government expenditure and and to tighten government expenditure. On departmental outlay. I know too that sugthe other hand there are many demands gestions have been made from other upon the Federal government. After all, sources that there might be added to these our resources are not unlimited. For examcontrols some expert advice. This is a matple, there are pressures for extra outlay on ter for the Government and for the Public defence. There is pressure from the rural sector of the economy. There is pressure for increased welfare benefits, social service benefits, repatriation benefits, assistance to the family man and assistance to the States. While all of these things are admirable and they are all of great importance, the Treasurer and the Cabinet in framing the Budget have to endeavour to set priorities and have to endeavour to make a decision that is the right one in the particular context of today's economy. As I see it, the keynote is still growth with stability. This has been the keynote of the Government's economic policy for a long period of time, and I believe that it has paid handsome dividends to Australia. The worrying and disturbing aspect, of course, is the rate of innation, which is much too high. In a moment I wish to say something about a positive method of combating this innation. First of all, may I make a reference to expenditure in the public sector and the community's desire to see an effective review of government departments aimed at increasing efficiency. I am sure that the Government is aware of this desire. Indeed indications have been made to that effect. There is also a desire to see a minimising of the rate of growth in the Commonwealth Public Service. We all have the greatest admiration for the heads of the Commonwealth Public Service. They are men of great ability and integrity. We are fortunate to have men of the calibre that we have as the heads of our various government departments. They are men with a great sense of responsibility. I believe that we can feel confident that they will play their part in this particI suggest that there is possibly some looked at by the heads of departments and others who are concerned with examining Service Board and for those charged with the responsibility of economising in this field. Retarding our economy, retarding our progress and greatly adding to the fires of Inflation is the matter of industrial disputes that have resulted in an increasing number of man days lost over the last 2 or 3 years. Only last Thursday the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) made some comments about this. Quite recently the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) made a statement on this matter. It is a matter of general concern within the ranks of the Parties on this side of the House and, I believe, in the community generally. In 1968 1 million man days were lost through industrial disputes. In 1969 2 million man days were lost. In 1970 2.4 million man days were lost. In the first quarter of this present year there was a 4 per cent increase on the correspondingfiguresfor 1970. This is not good enough. We need to have a greater sense of responsibility in this nation. We need more cohesion between the various elements that make up our community. Above all we need a greater sense of unity of purpose, a greater sense of direction in the whole industrial field if Australia is to achieve real strength and solidarity and go steadily forward to its true destiny. After allI think this scarcely needs any underliningwe are one people; we are one nation; we are not just groups of people at loggerheads with one another. I believe we need some changes in the attitudes of mind. We need to discard some of the outworn slogans and cliches of the past. We need to think and work and plan more together for the common good. In 1970-71 the gross national product of this country rose at a rate of approximately 5 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent in the financial year 1969-70. Unfortunately, as we all know, this has been accompanied by costpush pressure, and wage levels have been increasing at approximately 3 times the rate of increased productivity. I believe we are capable of a much better performance than this. Indeed we must do better. I now refer to the 1970 report brought down by the Chairman of the Commonwealth Board, Sir Roland Wilson, who is well ment In educating the work force to understand known to us all. Indeed, he is one of the most distinguished men in Australia and one of the outstanding financial and ecoomic brains that this country has produced. I would like to read one or two brief extracts from the 1970 report given by Sir Roland Wilson. He said in that report: There are, at the start of the 1970s, some warning signals for us, and our reactions to them will have an important bearing on the future prosperity of this country. Improved productivity, must be an important determinant of growth of output in the coming years, and an important element in improved productivity will be highly skilled management and work forces. If the challenge of the future is to be met, Australia will need better training methods, both to upgrade existing skills, particularly in those areas where shortages of skilled labour persist, and to retrain people whose particular skills have been made redundant by the march of technological change. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. pended for dinner I was quoting from the 1970 report of Sir Roland Wilson in his capacity as Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation on the subject of inflation and productivity. For the sake of clarity I shall repeat the last sentence which I read previously. Sir Roland said: If the challenge of the future Is to be met, Australia will need better training methods, both to upgrade existing skills, particularly in those areas where shortages of skilled labour persist, and to retrain people whose particular skills have been made redundant by the march of technological change. Already useful steps have been taken. Sir Roland continued: Improved productivity Is also closely related to efforts to control inflationary trends and pressures on the cost structure. It is vital, at the very least, that Australian costs should not rise at a faster rate than those in the other major trading nations. A climate of political and economic stability will always remain a fundamental basis for Australian economic growth. I believe that great credit is due to the Productivity Council of Australia for its efforts to publicise and emphasise the fundamental importance of increasing productivity if we are to maintain a high standard of living and a real wage value. I am supported in this view by Mr A. J. White, the President of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. He told the annual meeting of the Chamber in Sydney last month: Banking Corporation It is in the interest of unions to assist manage-",49,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

107,Mr Connor (Cunningham) (8.8),"State that I naturally support the amendment which was moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). Some people were unkind enough to call last year's Budget 'Bury's Blunder'. Equally unkind people have referred to the paper now under discussion as 'Snedden's Shocker'. It is, of course, the folly of the year. We have heard a lot recently about the father of the year, but no doubt this particular award will be conferred with suitable recriminations at the ballot boxes if and when this Government is finally dragged there to answer to the people of Australia. This Budget is the product of two rival rabbles -tw o distinct factions which are spending much more time cutting one another's throats than attending to the peace, order and good government of Australia. We can hear the screams from the bloody Cabinet tower and see the heads in due course duly exhibited on Traitor's Gate. Behind the ghost cabinet; a cabinet of more talents than are to be found at present sitting on the front bench. But I leave him to the retribution which will be his in due course. One could scarcely expect this Budget to have the slightest reference to the world economic climate. The best that can be said of it-thi s appears to be the rationale for it-is simply that the current Treasurer of his incumbency-ha s decided that the retail price index will be the basis of the budget. That is the infra-structure. There is no reference whatever to the dollar crisis which is shaking the world. We have entered a new era. The policy enunciated with regard to the dollar crisis by President Nixon is an economic watershed for the world and the United States has the economic muscle to decide what it wants to do. I am no apologist for it but I am looking stark facts in the face. This Government and the people of this country, our trade, our prosperity and our future welfare will be determined by the diktat issued from Washington; make no mistake about that. This Government is completely unprepared to deal with the situation. Its members of course are economic babes in the woods; simpletons in world trade. At a time when the world is divided info protective trade blocs, at a time present economic crisis. It is time that the when we should be standing on our own feet; at a time when we should be dealing in terms of trade contracts in good Australian dollars and repatriating our foreign reserves we are doing a piggy-back on the pound sterling. Of course in contradistinction to the Government's economic ineptitude in its overseas affairs its members are past masters in the crafty art of distortion, cant, humbug and hypocrisy. They have plundered the poor and they have socked the sick. They mouth words of praise and words of sympathy but in hard fact the pensioners, the poor, the little savers, the investors and the business people of Australia have had a lousy deal from this Government and there are no prospects of improvement. The Prime Minister has suffered from 2 catastrophes recently. Firstly, he had his plans for a snap election on a bogus issue completely disrupted by the Gorton episode but having in due course dispatched him he came back to face the House and in the process discovered such a drop in support for himself amongst the people of Australia that he was not game to face the people. We are ready to face him at any time and on any issue of his choosing. Of course neither he nor the Liberal Party of Australia would ever face the people of Australia on decent and fundamental issues. There must always be some gimmick, some myth, to mislead the mob and the one that was chosen was the issue, of law and order associated with the South African football tour recently. The one that will undoubtedly be expounded by the Prime Minister will be industrial law and order. They may change the name but the principle is just the same. The objective of course is to mislead the people of Australia and somehow to secure another term of office for this miserable Government. In fact this Budget is a blueprint for a depression. The best way that any Liberal government can ever see to temper and discipline the trade union movement is to create a pool of unemployed, and that is precisely the objective of what is fundamentally a completely deflationary budget. The unemployed will find it very cool indeed in McMahon's pool. As for the future, we can expect an intensification of the people of Australia were told the truth.",52,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

109,( Mr Snedden),"I do not know the periodThe truth is that we are facing a stark economic crisis. The United States will not relax and it will not relent. It is a country say about inflation. It reads: whose gross national product and internal trade is 31 times that of the aggregate of world trade and it depends on world trade for only about 4} per cent of its gross national product. Accordingly the US is in a position to lay down the terms on the future parity of world foreign exchanges. The US is determined at all costs and for President Nixon's own political survival to restore stability to its economy no matter what happens to the rest of the world. That being so it is time that we in Australia stood on our own feet. It is time that we thought in terms of an independent nation because that is in fact what we are. We need to be hard hearted and hard fisted because in trade, as in foreign relasetting of norms as a guide for public and for tions, you have interests and not friends. This Government has never been prepared to do anything other than to follow what has been the time honoured practice in the average Australian embassy overseas and that is to find out what the United States and Britain wanted to do and then do the same. But our interests from now on will be in the main different. In some cases they will be parallel but we are the twelfth trading nation of this world. We should be in the Group of Ten. We should be there amongst the leaders of the world and enunciating our interests and our viewpoint and getting the inside information in return. We are no longer to be a lucky province; a dependent country. Australia from now on must definitely stand on its own feet. The Prime Minister will also raise a suitable smokescreen about the impact of wage increases as a component of gross national product. I would like to quote some figures from the 'Australian Economic Review' for thefirstquarter of 1971. These figures have been brought up to date. In 1959-60 wages as a percentage of the gross national product were 63.2 per cent. At the present time they amount to 64.4 per cent. That is an increase of only 1.1 per cent. The whole structure of the Prime Minister's argument will be based on this and he will be sounding the warning bells as to the impact of wage costs and inflation. I want to quote from the 'Australian Economic Review' what a group of eminent and disinterested but patriotic economists had to It is not just an economic problem which economists alone might be expected to solve. It is a social, political and, in the end, especially a moral problem, involving the whole community and its basic attitudes to the kind of society and economy it wants. My main point is that it is no good laying the blame on wage-earners, who are merely reflecting and trying to keep up with the attitudes of the whole society they live in, and usually being beaten anyhow by those who are driving, rither than trying to hop on to the bandwagon Honourable members should mark these words: Accelerating inflation could destroy our society. A fair tax system, a good social security system, a reform of tbe tariff structure, control of restrictive practices, an appropriate exchange rate, the private employers, informal public adjustments of rent and interest charges are directed to making our existing social system work better. That is a complete blueprint for the control of inflation. This Government will do precisely nothing about it. Let us have a look at the position today with regard to trade practices in particular. Coals of fire were heaped on the head of the Prime Minister this afternoon by the honourable member for Berowra( Mr Hughes) in a very subtle way, and the Prime Minister deserved it all because he was one of the architects responsible for the watering down of the Barwick legislation. It is poetic justice indeed that the man who first raised the question of trade practices and rackets was there as the Chief Justice of Australia to make sure that economic justice would be done for the people. It has been said by Dr Maureen Brunt that in Australia today there is every restrictive device and practice known to the ingenuity of man nnd the most this Government will do in the proudly announced amendments that it will make to the restrictive Trade Practices Act will be to tinker with it in such a way that there will be the minimum of relief in the maximum of time. Government supporters have a vested interest in evasion. They are, of course, privy to the rackets; they are the puppets of the racketeers. Packer, of course, still loves them. With regard to the wool sales fiasco, 1 know as well as every Australian knows that we need every atom of export income that we can get. For that reason, at ail costs the wool grower must be kept in the ring fighting; but that means the little wool the banks. To that can be added the grower, it means the people who came into the wool industry during and after the Korean war wool boom, who paid inflated prices for their land and who arc now in the grip of the pastoral companies and of the major trading banks. Let this also be said, that in any event, if the squeeze is applied to them, on-one else will enter the industry so, at all costs, the small wool growers must be kept in there fighting and working. For that reason they should receive the full benefit of whatever subsidy is to be paid. It should not be paid to the 15 per cent of wool growers-the big people-wh o were in the game before 1950, who inherited their properties or who bought them at pre-war prices. It is the little man who is entitled to assistance. In many cases, that assistance will have to go further in the form of a modified moratorium for them but, of course, that will be another and quite distinct issue. The alarm will be raised by the Prime tical sleight of hand of this Government. Minister as to the impact of accumulated savings, but the canny savers, the canny I refer to the impact and the result of conpeople in Australia today, are sitting on cessional deductions for the wife and childtheir savings because they can see storms ren. The taxation allowance for a wife is and breakers ahead. They are well aware $312 a year. To a man with a net taxable that less than 14 per cent of the capital income of $2,000 a year this deduction is which is being used for the development worth $63 a year.

Some of them are highly reputable but they are not here for the good of their health or because they like the colour of our eyes. They are here to do business and to do it in a big way. As for housing loans, already the Government has had a rebuff from the major State Housing Ministers. Again, we find that housing loan interest has increased from the Chifley3 per cent to 7 per cent today. In other words, the average family man who would suffer about a $90 a year increase as a result of the impact of this Budget if he is unlucky enough to be going into a Housing Commission home today, with an average cost of the house and land of about $10,000, will be paying another $100 a year in interest or a total of $190 a year as a result of this Budget. Let us consider another matter which is typical of the poliI turn now to another matter, and that application to this Budget. It was very intriguing to see the snide way in which it was announced that there would be an increase of $1.25 a week and to whom it would be given. We have the doubtful distinction of having one of the worse and lowest scales of social benefits in the world, and if one looks at the figures for naturalisacommunity, we have to tackle these probtion it will be found that it is the main reason for the abysmally low percentage of migrants who have applied for naturalisation. They prefer to go back to their own countries at the end of their period of service of labour in Australia. Again, there is the little matter of the domestic surplus-the biggest racket and the biggest touch of all. $630m for what? It is just a euphemism for a means of directing surplus revenue into the Commonwealth loans. Already the Commonwealth is a highly successful investor in its own loans to the tune of $2,767m. Of that figure, $2,246m came from the Loan Consolidation Investment Reservea nice high sounding title which bemuses the mob, who do not follow it. It is nothing more or less than a means of meeting the shortfall of loans which will not be filled because even at the record rates of interest that are being offered the shrewd and canny investor can do better by investing in the hire purchase companies. For that reason, last year the Government siphoned $280m from its domestic surplus into Commonwealth loans. Today we find Order! The honourable member's time has expired. (8.26)-This is the twenty-second Budget since the Liberal-Country Party Government took office in 1949. Since then we in Australia have enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth combined with full employment which has not been rivalled in chamber to hear speeches. any previous period of our history. Let me illustrate by reference to the progress we have made in the last decade. I see you. Ten years ago our gross national product, at constant prices was around $ 17,000m. with overall demand inflation of the classical Last year it was $28,000m-a n increase of type, except in three areas, namely, private about 60 per cent or an annual rate of building and construction, private investincrease of over 5 per cent.

Here there was excessive is now over 5i milliona growth of about pressure on resources. In addition, more 30 per cent. Our international reserves have more than doubled and now stand at over $2.3 billion. These facts, I suggest, speak for themselves. We are, I agree, now facing problems because cost and price inflation has recently gathered pace. In the interests of the whole lems and tackle them now. But they need to be handled in a way which will assist, rather than impede, our long-term growth goals. And a co-operative effort is needed by every group of Australians. We have one very important economic problem that the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) highlighted in his Budget Speech. Our over-riding economic purpose in this year's Budget was to combat inflationary pressures. We are well aware that the inflationary process is most complex and that there are important elements which the Government's fiscal and monetary measures do not influence directly. Wage rates, for example, are largely a matter for the Arbitration Commission and for employer and employee relationships, although the Government can play a role by trying to ensure that the general economic climate is not conducive to the making of wage awards that exceed increases in productivity. The problem we faced in framing the Budget was therefore to try to reduce inflationary pressures in those areas where the Government can have a direct influence. As I said in the House on 18th February, we have to distinguish between cost inflation and demand inflation. I wish that this distinction could be made abundantly clear, because of all the speeches I have heard in this House and of many of the comments I have heard too, few have been able to draw this distinction effectively. radio. In any event, I disappear the moment I pointed out then that we were not faced",53,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

To guard against the development of undue demand pressures, we therefore judged that it was necessary to restrain the growth in Commonwealth expenditures by severely pruning departmental proposals and we decided also that we had to raise additional revenues. These are in the nature of fine tuning adjustments which must be seen in proper perspective. After allowing for the transfer of payroll is to prevent such a development in this tax to the States the Commonwealth's country. domestic outlays are estimated to increase by $900m in 1971-72-onl y $90m less than in 1970-71. Similarly, receipts are measures aimed at demand control. But estimated to increase by only about $100m it is wrong to suggest that the Government more than last year. In technical termsI have to emphasise the word 'technical' The Treasurer referred to a variety of because it has a technical meaning-thes e measures which are being taken outside the measures imply an increase in the overall immediate Budget context and which arc domestic surplus of $170m. Combined with aimed at reducing these pressures. It should a restrictive monetary policy I have little however be recognised that the full year doubt that they have helped considerably effects of wage and other cost increases in reducing the risk that excess demand which took place during 1970-71 will coninnation would develop. But these measures tinue to be reflected in the economy for will not in themselves prevent the consome time. The levels of average weekly tinuance of the strong overall economic earnings and the consumer price index, growth that we have been experiencing in for example, are already considerably recent years. It is nonsense to suggest that above their average levels in 1970-71. This they will result in mass unemployment. In undoubtedly will be reflected in statistics the normal course of events registrants for during the remainder of 1971-72, no matter employment will rise to a seasonal peak how effective the Budget and the Governin January of next year. With the addition ment's other measures may be in containing of school leavers, it would not be at all future cost increases. surprising if unemployment exceeded 100,000 at that time. That would only be slightly in excess of the numbers that were Leader of the Opposition and his registered in January this year. I want to colleagues might do to solve the assure the House that we remain firmly problem. The Leader of the Opposition committed to the maintenance of full says he notes many things which are not employment and that the Government will causes of inflation. He says that wage inbe keeping a very close watch on trends creases are not the cause of inflation. I will in the private sector to see whether they refer to these in a moment. He also says: develop along the lines forecast. Our concern must be to try to provide an economic climate in which economic growth can proceed without excessive cost and price increases. Left unchecked, the rate of price increases would soon erode the gains we propose for pensioner and other social welfare recipients. It could also jeopardise the strong economic growth we have enjoyed in recent years. It could threaten our export industries. It could limit our ability to improve the quality of life the prospects for controlling inflation will be affected, as I have already said, by community attitudes-no t by any single group in the community, but by the community as a whole. Recent experience overseas suggests that once a cost-price spiral is permitted to get a foothold in an economy, the measures then required to combat it successfully are very difficult to devise and decidedly less palatable than those contained in this Budget. Our aim Till now I have referred mainly to has ignored the problems of cost pressures. Now let us speculate about what the Great sectors of our secondary industry have not contributed to inflation. The rural sector is not contributing to inflation; and clearly he believes that Government spending is not the cause, since he wants the Government to spend mucn more on a whole range of projects. Moreover, as company incomes mcreased very little in the last nnanciai year, presumably he does not find the cause of inflation in that area. What then is the cause in his view? It is important that not only we but all members of the Australian public should know. Having excluded so much, he leaves us in the dark as to what his analysis is and what the real causes might be. The Leader of the Opposition does, it is true, give us a most significant hint as to his views when he accuses the Government of refusing to acknowledge-and here I quote his own words-'the inevitable connection between rising prices and demands for increased wages.' I repeat his words ""The inevitable conandfiscalpolicy if circumstances make that nection between rising prices and demands necessary. for increased wages'. Does this mean that after all, he accepts wage increases as a cause of inflation? The words may be emphasise another important aspect of our ambiguous. He is strangely silent. I accept policy. We have been able to take positive his silence as meaning that he does accept action to meet the various high priority wage increases as the cause. The fact is, needs of the community, despite the need of course, that wage and salary earners to restrain Government expenditure to comhave increased their share of gross national bat inflationary pressures. The Budget in product. In 1970-71, wages, salaries and fact provides for substantial increases in supplements accounted for nearly 55 per social welfare, defence, education and the cent of gross national product, much above arts, assistance to rural industries, and other the proportion in 1969-70, when it was areas of essential activity. The responsible 52.4 per cent, and in other recent years. Ministers will explain in detail those parts The Leader of the Opposition refers also portfolios. But let me just mention social to 'half an income-price policy' under which welfare as one example. Reference has been he suggests the Arbitration Commission has made to a fundamental reappraisal of social the job of keeping wages and prices down. services which I said the Government would He should know, as a once potential lawyer, undertake. The Government looked at that the Arbitration Commission has power various possible measures in the social welto set only minimum wage rates which in fare field. We decided, as I shall outline neither theory nor practice amounts to in a moment, to take action in the areas setting actual wage rates. This is reflected of greatest need. If the Opposition wants to in the fact that average weekly earnings say that this policy was wrong and that it have consistently increased much faster does not believe that those in the greatest than award rates; for example, in the year need should receive the greatest assistance, to the June quarter 1971 by over 13 per it is up to the Opposition to tell the Governcent as against 9 per cent in the correspondment and up to it to make it positive to ing period last year. The truth is that the the Australian people. It is all very well Leader of the Opposition is unable to profor the Leader of the Opposition to say vide any analysis of the causes of inflation. glibly that the cost of paying pensions to Not unexpectedly he is therefore completely all Australians would be no more than silent on the crucial question of what should $300m. The fact is that, on the basis of be done to control it. We do know that present eligibility for age pensions, the cost he criticises the Government for not spendwould be about $440m. Now where would ing enough. In almost the same breath he that money come from? Where did he get complains that the burden of taxation is his figures from? What taxes would the too high. He cannot have it both ways. So we are left to the conclusion that Mr Whitlam's cure for inflation is to increase Government spending and to reduce taxation. This is just the kind of cure we must avoid if we are to make any kind of attempt to cure inflation. As I have said, it is the Government's firm belief that the only responsible course of action was to bring down a Budget designed to prevent the development of excessive demand inflation, superimposing itself on the existing cost inflation. I make it clear that our policy continues to be aflexibleone, responsive to change and able to make adjustments needed to sustain full employment and economic growth. It is, of course, entirely possible to adopt a less restrictive monetary Mr Deputy Speaker, I want now to of the Budget which involve their own Leader of the Opposition increase? Until these questions are answered one must to condemn the Budget on the ground that regard any propositions put by the Leader it contains no proposals to balance the of the Opposition with extreme doubt.

Fourth, in transferring payroll tax the real standards of the pensioners themto the States, we agreed to meet the cost selves.

The Leader of the Opposition has moved nnances and functions of the Commonwealth, States and local government. States on a growth tax which is theirs to levy and which will give them an important welcomed by local government authorities throughout Australia. I now ask the questhem from Canberra and to abolish the States if it had the constitutional capacity to do so. We believe, however, in a cooperative federalism, in which full recognition is given to the role of the States in providing the educational, housing, health and other facilities that are so important in improving the quality of life. (Extension of time granted.) The plain fact is that nearly $3,000m, or over one-third of this year's Budget, has been set aside to assist the States in providing these facilities. Portion of this assisvery seriously and solutions have to be tance takes the form of grants for specific purposes, but some $2,300m is available to the States for expenditure as they see fit. To suggest that this Budget excludes all mention of cities completely overlooks the fact that the major portion of this assistance would be expended by State governments in their cities. The Commonwealth recognises that State governments are being faced with demands for improvements in every field of their activity. With our help, an increasing proportion of national resources is being devoted to the provision of Government services in the State and local sectors. It is important, too, to bear in mind, however, that the resources of the community drawn upon by all the government instrumentalities that service the community are necessarily limited. Just as we have had to limit spending infieldsof Commonwealth responsibility, so too are there limits to the assistance we can provide to the States to improve their services. But there is no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the increased financial capacity of the States will do much to help improve the quality of Australian life. So, too, will the action which the Commonwealth is taking directly in many fields. I have already mentioned our social welfare programme. We are also making substantial contributions to Aboriginal welfare, to education and the arts, and we have established a department whose functions include examination of environmental problems. All this is part of our effort to give national leadership and secure national unity. Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget is a honourable members opposite to stay in positive one.

When he took office he was There are some people who seem blind to our economic progress, and the real nature of our problems. They relish playing the role of prophets of gloom. Some talk of a stagnant economy. Some see unemployment rising in an uncontrolled way. The Leader of the Opposition professes to see the Budget as a divisive political exercise. People who talk in this way seem to be mesmerised by the immediate problems of the day. It is true that some of these problems-suc h as the current problem of inflation-hav e to be taken found for them. But such problems should be kept in proper perspective. It is nonsense to suggest that mass unemployment is just around the corner. Our record in maintaining full employment is second to no other country in the world. We have a strong economy; an economy with enormous and exciting potentialities for future growth; providing only we act responsibly. People who suppress or distort these facts do no service to Australia. The sooner we learn to ignore them the better it will be for the development and prosperity of this country and the better we will be able to do for every single class of Australian citizen. ministerial sparrows behind him will remain in this chamber for the next 10 or 15 minutes.

Yet, the Prime Minister has the hide to stand at this minrun an election on false and despicable isterial table, Mr Deputy Speaker, and say what he has done to ease the poverty and meet the needs of pensioners. This Government has been hypocritical false situation for his own ends. with one of the areas of need. I refer here to the sick aged. I defy any man on the Government side to say where in this Budget the Government has given one solitary cent to this great area of need. I can recall the honourable member for Angas Petersen for a week. However, an Army receiving a letter from a constituent of spokesman told a reporter from the 'Sydney mine recently pointing out to him the great Morning Herald' that the Prime Minister's need in this area. The honourable member Department had said that the decision to for Angas expressed an opinion to me that give he was shocked that these things did exist.

I will goes on television and says that he had gladly show this article to the honourable nothing member to knock the surprised look off his face. But the fact of life is that this GovHe ernment did not give lc to this area of need. The Government of South Australia political candidate endorsed by Chou En-lai earlier this year made an additional grant and that the Chinese were playing him like out of meagre Statefinancesbecause the feda fish on a line. This was the time when eral Government had not paid any attention the Labor Conference was on in Launto this area of need. This grant was made to ceston. The Prime Minister repeated his approved nursing homes in the hope that speech of hate against Whitlam but when this Government would do something Nixon's about the matter when it brought down the Budget. But it has done nothing about it whatsoever. The State Government the other day continued, and perhaps increased, this item of expenditure. What has been the position in regard to foreign affairs? We still do not have a policy on foreign affairs. We have heard a lot gesting he is telling lies? from the Prime Minister about a China dialogue. The Prime Minister said that there has been no response and that no mentary, as I would like to remind the response is a good response. Honourable honourable member, but it was certainly members may remember that he said this most ambiguous. This Budget was intended on television. The Prime Minister is interto appear as an election budget with the ested only in winning elections. He is a political opportunist. At the time the Budget was being drawn up, when Australia was facing-as she does todaya number of very vital problems what did the Prime Minister do? He took himself off to a conference and used the Springbok visit to make political capital and foster further unrest and brutality to create a situation favourable to him for an election. What a despicable act he performed on that occasion. He will ignore the real issues affecting Australia and endeavour to issues ignorning the mess in foreign affairs, education, health services, social welfare, etc. He will use the games team from the greatest of all racist nations to create a When the state of emergency was declared in Queensland the Prime Minister stated that he had not spoken with Bjelkepermission to use army barracks was to do with it.

130,Mr Foster,"That would be unparliasupport of the Press, except perhaps the Murdoch Press, but this has not really eventuated. There is still the possibility of an election because of the visit of the South African cricketers. Then the Prime Minister hopes to cause enough hate, bitterness and even rioting to run an election on the issue. Pressure has been put on the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing Board of Control. I suggest there is a close connection between some members of that Board ar.d the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister hopes to divide the nation and thereby win an election and to hell with all the issues. The Government expects to win on the basis of cricket grounds ringed with barbed wire over a 5-day period and hopes of disruption by minority groups to create more divisions and more bitterness. This will take the people's minds from the rural problems, education deficiencies, costly and inadequate health schemes, etc. The yawn, go to sleep, roll over and shuffling attitude will pass unnoticed under the smoke-so thc Prime Minister hopes-of the demonstrators' bombs. His attitude is: 'Give me that cricket team for my narrow political aims so that I , Prime Minister McMahon, can have 3 years in which to inflict a budget that will cure inflation by causing wage and salary earners to bear this burden.' This is the way the Prime Minister reads the situation on behalf of big business and the monopoly interests. Now we come down to some of the points that the Prime Minister endeavoured to make tonight. He said in his initial remarks how good bis Government has in fact been and what it has achieved. document 1 have in front of me. It runs parallel to what the honourable member for Angas mumbled 'Hear, hear' to a while ago: Australia still needs a contributory system of members opposite could prove I was national insurance against sickness, widowhood, unemployment and old age. It is only under such a system that we can make full benefits a matter of right and so get completely rid of the means test During the new parliament we will further investigate this complicated' problem with a view to presenting to you at the election of 1952 a scheme for your approval. And on it goes. When was it made? It was made in 1949 by that great impostor and previous Prime Minister of this House. IfJ have to withdraw that remark, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose I will have to, but the truth of the matter is in this document. These are the promises, page after page. This is virtually a log of claims that that once great leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, put before the people in 1949 and not a shred of it has come into being some 20 years later. Honourable members opposite can have it for what it is worth. It now lies on the Government benches where it lay some years ago. There has been nothing whatsoever done with it and there is not likely to be anything done with it so far as this Government is concerned. Again tonight we heard the Prime Minister say as did his predecessors: 'Where is the money coming from'. I should be asking, we should be asking, the people should be demanding to know where the money has gone. Where is the Government's plan for national development? It has bombed the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority into a shadow of its former self. Honourable members opposite say that what I say here is not right. Let the Government set up a committee composed of members of this House which will investigate some of the allegations that are made from time to time by members of this side of the House. Honourable members opposite spoke today of what the Government might do with regard to resale price maintenance. It goes much deeper than that. It is a sorer point than that with the community. There should be committees such as a standing committee on health and welfare set up in this place. How much of the funds of the health benefit organisations has gone into rural industry and how much can they not get back? Is this one of the reasons why health benefits contributions have been increasing over the last few years? Let us have an inquiry to see if what I suggest is correct. I would be happy if honourable wrong but I will not be happy if they are going to stand up here and say without any real support that what I have said is not correct. I will not accept that, nor should anybody else accept it. Let us set up a committee on health, a committee on social welfare and a committee on trade practices. Let us have a look again at the",62,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

132,Mr Foster,"Let me quote from aConstitution, something which the Government was going to look at way back in, I think, 1959. This is the sort of thing the Government should be doing. Let us set up a standing committee on education and stop the claptrap of Dorothy Dix questions which are directed to this wealthy aristocrat the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser). There are more millionaires in this Minister to whom the question is directed place than one can shake a stick at, and those not in here are over in the Senate. If 'This is a State responsibility.' Is the debacle they are not in the Senate they are represented in some way or another. This is the core of this country's problems and honourable members opposite will not face it. A previous Minister for the Army, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Sir John Cramer), has been speculating in millions for years because of the upsurge in land prices. We on this side of the House have a policy on land prices and we have been putting it forward for goodness knows how many years. The Prime Minister stands here again tonight and says: 'We want to give away States.' I will sell him the policy for 50c, the meagre amount he gave to the pensioners. Any time he wants it he can have it for 50c. That is what a copy of our policy soid for. He can read it from cover to cover and there is nobody standing here covering up for what he thinks it might be. Let us have some action in this place. A few weeks ago I jocularly said that the policy of the Labor Party ought to be changed in regard to its attitude towards the Senate, but unless this place starts to do something for people and legislate for people we ought to include in our platform a policy for the abolition of the House of Representatives. It is doing nothing, and honourable members opposite can look at it whatever way they like. The resources of this country are not being used for the benefit of the people in any way, shape or form. opposite can laugh about it. The Minister whatsoever. for the Army( Mr Peacock) can laugh his head off. What bave we to defend ourselves with for the millions his Department Order! I ask the honourable member to has had in the last few years through the address his remarks to the Chair. Department of Defence? Absolutely nothing. We have nothing to measure in Mr Deputy Speaker. I notice that the perterms of the money honourable members son wbo preceded me in this debate and opposite have wasted and squandered. There is not one person in this country who would be concerned about it if we had something to show for the amount we have expended but we have nothing to show. What great national schemes have we running for us in Australia today? It does not matter a darn what is brought up in this House because the appropriate or who is concerned with the debate says: in the wool industry today to be regarded as a State issue? Are honourable members opposite looking at this correctly? I am not convinced that the millions the Government will spend in the next 12 months will help the industry. Why not set up a committee? this House, to fetch the real speculators in the industry before this House-the wool brokers, the burglars, the Bagols, shakes and lizards, the Australian and New Zealand Banking Co. Ltd and all those people. They are the blokes who ought to come before the Bar of this House, not somebody who might write a wrong line in a Press article now and again. This is my attitude towards it. The people who are bleeding the country and who are getting the wealth of the country ought to be questioned. Yet Government supporters have the hide to stand here tonight and say that this Government is doing all it can to eradicate poverty. I can march honourable members opposite through areas in my electorate-whic h is not exactly a blue ribbon Labor seat, you know-and show them areas of poverty there. What have you done for the superannuitants in the 10-odd years until this Budget? You have not really spelt out yet what you have given them. What have you done for local government?

Well, I am addressing you, Sir. honourable member will withdraw that reflection upon the Chair. What plan has any member of the Liberal Party got, from the Chair to the back bench, for cities and suburbs? None whatsoever. What concern has the Liberal Party when the Press comes out and says that land prices are rising? Is it by coincidence that a present Minister of this House has been able to sell a rural property recently? Honourable members know that prestige rural properties just are not selling, and the rest are not selling either. But the bairn) gets almost half a million dollars for Whitlam) and to the speeches that have his property, and the purchaser of it happens to be a person who owns a property very close to where we are standing or sitting at the moment. The Minister gets the money because the Government has acquired his property. Is this not perhaps white collar crime? I do not know. Honourable members may buy it if they want to, but there are plenty of cockies in the country who cannot get a bid for their land and yet somebody else can sell his for half a million dollars in cash in 24 hours. It does not seem quite right to me, as a fair-minded sort of bloke. We ought to have a bit of a look at the question of housing-of Ministers for the Interior getting what they like in Canberra. But what about the people who live in Canberra? That is another question. This is the sort of attitude the Government takes because it is completely and utterly the prisoner of the big interests it represents. Is it not true that the Government did not increase the excise on beer because it got plenty from the breweries to run its next election campaign? Why does thc Government not table in this House the report on thc Jetair issue on which questions have been asked here?

I believe one has to judge the attitude to a budget of a government or an opposition on the series of statements and attitudes that they present bolh inside and outside Parliament over a period of time. Because of this I question both the sincerity and the practicability of Australian Labor Party opposition to this Budget. In the short time that I have been in this Parliament I have heard the Opposition put forward a whole series of antidotes to every problem that we face. They always include creating a new federal board, an extra federal commission or an extra department. Probably nobody has excelled from the members on the opposite side in this regard more than the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Foster). If one were to accept the Labor Party view on the Budget it would mean the takeover of both State and local government, and make a mockery of the federal system. The lavish promises of finance made by the Opposition in this debate in order to solve all problems would, I believe, if they became a reality, make the social credit policy of setting up a printing press and printing money to solve any problem rather conservative economics by comparison. In particular I question the sincerity of matters. Members of the Opposition have",64,Appropriation Bill No 1 1971 72

147,Mr Lloyd (Murray) (9.22),"I have liscriticised the wool deficiency payment system. They say that there should be a means test. If they are sincere why did they not say that this means test should be applied to the sugar industry, the dairy industry and the other rural industries? This criticism also shows a complete lack of contact between honourable members opposite and those who are actually engaged in wool growing. If they did have contact with the actual wool growers they would know the impossibility of bringing in such a means test. I exempt the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) from this criticism because if the report of a radio broadcast of his as printed in the Melbourne 'Sun' of 23rd August is correct he will oppose this means test provision and vote with the Government. At least he has spoken to actual wool growers and knows that the $30m scheme of last year, which is really the same type of scheme as the Labor Party is presenting this time, was a failure because of the loopholes that could be found in the means test provisions. The chief spokesman for the Labor Party on rural policy, the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), published a booklet earlier this year entitled 'Labor's Federal Rural Policies'. In this booklet he criticised the Government for its loose patchwork and ad hoc rural policy system and lack of overall planning. It is rather a strange irony that exactly the same criticism was levelled at the proposals put forward by the Australian Labor Party Rural Committee to the recent Australian Labor Party Federal Conference at Launceston. It has been stated that the honourable meniber for Oxley( Mr Hayden), a colleague of the honourable member for Dawson, used much the same terms to criticise these proposals. The honourable member for Dawson felt obliged to comment on 'This Day Tonight' on 22nd June in these terms: I find it very hard to believe except perhaps years for the States in this regard. I know that very few members of the Conference know anything about rural matters. If the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party is the supreme policy making body of the Labor Party, as it tells us it is, and if the ALP Federal Conference is stated to contain very few people who know anything about rural policy, how can we accept as being sincere anything put forward by honourable members opposite as a true proposition for rural policy. I believe that the Treasurer has had a difficult course to steer with this year's Budget. On the one hand there is the problem of those suffering from inflation-fixe d income earners, pensioners, rural exporters. I believe that generally this group of people has received the most assistance in this Budget. I think all of them could justifiably claim that they have not received sufficient assistance. But let us look at the wool industry. With the current dollar-yen currency crisis, if the Budget had not contained the provision for a 36c deficiency payment scheme which has brought stability into the industry, I believe there would be absolute chaos and panic in the wool industry in Australia at the present moment. I am pleased to see that the reconstruction allowance to the States has been increased this year from $25m to $40m. Also a retraining scheme for young people displaced in the rural crisis will be introduced this session. But as yet there is no suggestion of adequate rehabilitation measures in the rural reconstruction scheme. The $1,000 loan is too puny and, I believe, too absurd to be considered seriously. We should consider seriously those people displaced by the rural crisis who are too old to be retrained. I would hope that the other State governments are adopting a more genuine attitude to rural reconstruction than is the Victorian Government. One of the outlandish statements made by the Victorian Government spokesman was that it could not delay the repayment of principal, from people to whom it had loaned money because the Commonwealth required virtually immediate repayment of some of these funds. Yet it is stated very clearly in the States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Act that there is a repayment holiday provided of up to 4 that in Victoria the biggest number of people affected by rural reconstruction will be the wool growers, but I believe that on an individual basis the Victorian Government could be doing more to look at the problems of a number of pear growers in the Goulburn Valley who are suffering just as much as anybody else at the present time. Their priorities should not be lower than those of any other group in this sioners and for totally and permanently regard. I support all those honourable members many years, and I congratulate the Govwho have referred to the failure so far to ernment in this regard.

Why cannot the Commonwealth Government co-operate with any State Government that introduces a policy which provides that if an industiy moves to the country then that Slate government will exempt or partially exempt that industry from the payment of payroll tax? What is to stop the Commonwealth Government from coming in and saying: 'We will support you in this measure'? What has encouraged me on this question of decentralisation was the very constructive speech which I heard the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Anthony) make at a national development conference held in Canberra recently. It was a well thought out. constructive speech on how decentralisation can be helped. I was also pleased to hear, in an answer which the Deputy Prime Minister gave to a question, that the technical sub-committee of the Commonwealth-State Officials Committee on Decentralisation had met 3 times this year, that it had completed its work and that very soon it would be making a final report to the full Committee. I believe it is imperative that this Committee completes its work and makes its final report to the Government as soon as possible so that we can no longer be prevented from having a serious discussion on decentralisation because the Committee's report is not yet available. I have criticised certain aspects of the Budget and I have criticised the Opposition's attitude to the Budget. I believe that the Opposition's attitude has not been sincere or constructive. I support the Budget. Deputy Speaker, in this debate I want to unworthy even of this Government. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). It is an amendment which cogently and precisely highlights the paucity of thought and the pedestrian technique of a document which was delivered by the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) but which in fact was framed because of his insatiable desire to remove Prime Minister, the right honourable memPrime Minister had to eliminate all of the Gortonesque image. His actions of the past few months have almost completed his Indeed, the present Prime Minister might well be dubbed the political Plantagenet of the 20th century. Let us examine some facets of this document that we are current debating. Income tax has risen. This is in direct contradiction of the promise made by the former Prime Minister. Radio and television licence fees are to be increased. There are rises in postal and telephone charges. There are increases in the price of petrol. The cost of the so-called free prescriptions has been increased by 50c. Company tax is up by 5c in $1. These are the bald unpalatable facts that now face the great majority of wage and salary earners of this nation. Clearly the Government believes that the Treasurer is a better and more efficient custodian of the people's money than are the people themselves. Surely an extraordinary exercise in Liberal logic and philosophy! This Budget was conceived as an instrument to beat inflation but in all likelihood it will achieve the opposite effect and give birth to a Frankenstein that this Government will be unable to control. Already the effects of this Budget have been and are still being felt throughout the community. I pose the question: Does this Government, even in its saner moments, seriously suppose that the miserly increase of $1.25 to pensioners will not be eroded even before they receive it in October? Many hundreds of thousands of pensioners will not receive it at all. This was never announced or spelt out in the Budget Speech by the Treasurer.

151,By The Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon),"To return to the problem of costs, our prices certainly will not wait until October. The spiral has already commenced. What extraordinary naivety this Government displays when it comes to the control of costs! It is never so reluctant when it comes to the control of wages. The plain simple fact is that pensioners and people on fixed incomes, such as superannuated persons, have become the whipping posts of this Government's policy year after year. It merely highlights the increasing need for a national superannuation scheme. Here one must have some sympathy for the Minister for Social displayed some humanitarian instincts in this area but whose efforts have been thwarted by the Liberal juggernaut. He realises, however late, and concurs with the Opposition that pensioners and superannuated persons must at least be considered as first class citizens who are deserving of consideration and who should have their plight recognised with regard to the movements in the spiralling cost factor. Let me now turn to the very contentious Leader of the Opposition has on many area of education.

I am following the points I was making during question time a week or so ago. The scale of charges operates on a system of so much per radial mile. The rate between the hours of 6 p.m. and 12 midnight from Monday to Sunday for relaying a one hour programme from Melbourne to Hobart would cost the commercial station, in Hobart $1,600. This is a revenue-producing facility and it is absurd that it should be too expensive to use. The cost in the United States works out at 55c a mile per hour. The cost of tails, that is links, between the Post Office and the transmitting stations are extra. In the case of TVT in Hobart it costs $4,100 per annum for rental alone.

In the time remaining to me in this debate 1 want to deal with the provision announced in this Budget for the arts. In the Treasurer's Budget Speech it rated 4 lines on page 14. I commend the brevity of the statement for the consideration of honourable members. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not criticising the newly appointed Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts; quite the contrary. I wish him well. However, I repeat the criticism I made in this House when this multi-purpose Ministry was announced by the Prime Minister. It is an absurdity to include the important portfolio of the Arts-her e I speak in the broadest terms-wit h that of Aboriginal Affairs, the Environment, Tourism and the multiplicity of activities for which this Minister is responsible. It is more than absurd; it is totally ludicrous. The former Prime Minister at least broke new ground. He attached great significance to the arts. The very office of Prime Minister added a prestigious dimension to the arts. The present structure merely adds to the diminution of artistic activity which is essential to our way of life and the quality of that life. 1 refer very briefly to the absence in this Budget of any announcement appropos of the national film and teletinued non-enforcement of the existing provisions. evaporated into thin air. Of course, this was another concept of the former Prime Minister. The Australian Film Development Corporation legislation, introduced by the right honourable member for Higgins is a case in point. I should like to quote what the New South Wales State Government has up its political sleeve and I commend this to the Minister. The quote is from the 'Nation' of 21st August and is headed: 'Australian film-the three-pronged attack' and reads as follows: The Commonwealth's efforts to get an Australian film industry off the ground are on the point of being undermined by the New South Wales' State Government. In the past year, the Commonwealth has spent several hundred thousand dollars sponsoring experimental films, and its Australian Film Development Corporation, initially capitalised at one million dollars, started on local film making These are the proposals of the New South Wales Governmentthe proposal to amend the 'Australian quota' legislation in New South Wales, which constitutes about a third of the country's film market, has alarmed local makers the most. These amendments threaten to come on top of a continued nonenforcement of the existing provisions. Ironically, the announcement of the activities of the New South Wales Government was released not in this country but in London. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate in Hansard extracts from this article. The Commonwealth's efforts to get an Austrahan film industry off the ground are on the point of being undermined by the New South Wales State Government. In the past year, the Commonwealth has spent several hundred thousand dollars sponsoring experimental films, and its Australian Film Development Corporation, initially capitalised at one million dollars, started operations. In the coming weeks, the N.S.W. Government, which has provided for a tiny 2.5 per cent quota of Australian films to be shown in its licensed cinemas for the past twenty-six years, will amend this legislation. Of this three-pronged attack on local film making, the proposal to amend the 'AustraUan quota' legislation in New South Wales, which constitutes about one third of the country's film market, has alarmed local makers the most. These amendments threaten to come on top of a conThe news of the amending proposals was first released, curiously and some argued perhaps significantly, in London in an interview given to Mr Derek Todd of the 'Kinematograph Weekly', and printed in the issue of July4 1971. Mr Hayward told Mr Todd that he had recommended two amendments to the N.S.W. quota provisions. One, that three documentaries of at least tsventy minutes each should be counted as one makes the right honourable gentleman unfit feature film. Two, he had recommended that coproduction films should be taken into the quota. Local film makers and other members of the industry had already become alarmed, ln its July newsletter, the Australian Film Council, which is presided over by Mr John McCallum, stated that it had heard a rumour 'that there may be an attempt by the Theatres and Films Commission to recommend that the quota requirements be amended in such a way as to reduce the requirements of the quota, and furthermore, that three thirty-minute documentaries should count as one feature film . . . If there is any substance in these rumours, the Film Council will oppose them with all means at its disposal and will notify thc Minister that it has no confidence in the Theatres Commission as presently constituted. This move by the New South Wales Government is nothing short of disgraceful and must be resisted. This is a nation which in the creative and performing arts needs all the encouragement and assistance of which this Government is capable. It would seem that the arts are anathema to this reconstructed Government. This Budget may well be summed up in the following phrase: 'Nowadays we are all of us so hard up that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments.' We have in the Prime Minister the last of the dynasty, for it is a political fact that what begins in fear usually ends in folly and we have witnessed an excess of that folly in the past few months. The bewildering internal struggles-indee d the convulsions-withi n the Liberal Party and the sacking of Prime Ministers and Ministers indicates the power ambitions of the present Prime Minister to hold oifice at any cost. His misguided and emotional attacks on the Leader of the Opposition on his initiatives in so many fields give a clear indication of the mediocrity of the Prime Minister's intellect and his Order! There must be no personal reflection rency crisis. Such extravagant language is on any member of the House. reflection; it is a matter of opinion. must be no reflection on the intellect of a member of the House. wishes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I withdraw the remark. But it certainly is a clear indication of the absence of temperament that to lead this nation. His disastrous sortie into piscatorial prose to describe the Leader of the Opposition being played like a trout by Mr Chou En-lai was answered superbly by the Deputy Leader of the Oppos tion ( Mr Barnard) when he described the Prime Minister as a 'stunned mullet'. He has been like a fish out of water ever since. The Government that he so tenuously leads is in disorder and disarray. It is discredited on all fronts. He is a monumental disaster for his Party and, worse of all, for this nation. The Prime Minister is adept in the art of concealing that which is not worth finding. He has thrust himself into power in a most devious and ruthless fashion. He has neither the capability nor the capacity to lead this nation as it goes forward to an exciting, stimulating and rewarding future. Australia has no place at this time for a leader of his undoubted and proven mediocrity. His own Party cannot afford him. The Parliament cannot afford him. The electorate must reject him. The people of Australia have not deserved such incompetence. This nation simply cannot afford to be wedded to a calamity. I rise to support the motion moved by the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1971-72 and to oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) who on Tuesday, 24th August, moved his amendment and sought the support of the House of Representatives for his amendment in a long speech attacking the Budget in extravagant terms designed to undermine the confidence of the people of Australia in their future development and national prosperity.

157,Mr Graham (North Sydney) (9.56),"the actions of President Nixon. He knows that the strength and the health of the United States economy is of vital importance to the welfare of the free world and he knows that the future of Australia is to a very significant degree dependent upon the proper discharge of those responsibilities which have been accepted by the United States Government during the last 30 years. The Leader of the Opposition knows that the President is deeply concerned about the health of the United States economy, in particular with the inflation and the degree of unemployment that is evident today in the United States of America. However, seeking always to gratify those elements within the Australian Labor Party which are notorious for their anti-Americanism, which are known to the Australian people as the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, he is ready to brand the President as a sinister influence engaged by inference in some monstrous capitalistic plot to create 'a great international currency crisis'. I felt, in view of the significance of these remarks and in case they were treated by international Press representatives as being important and truly reflective of the judgment of an alternative government in this country, that I should make some reference to the speech that the President of the United States made. I have 3 quotations which I believe are reasonable in setting out the position that President Nixon appreciated for bis country. Briefly put he said this: We must create more and better jobs. We must stop the rise in tiie cost of living. We must protect into a proper context serves to demonstrate the dollar from the attacks of international money speculators. I feel that the Leader of the Opposition in this House ought to be at least sympathetic to the last of those references by the President. Furthermore the President of the United States on ISth August said this: To our friends abroad, including the many responsible members of international banking Community who are dedicated to stabUity in the flow of trade, I give this assurance: The United States has always been, and will continue to be, a forward-looking and trustworthy trading partner. In full co-operation with the Monetary Fund 6nd those who trade with us, we will press for the Necessary reforms to set up an urgently needed new International Monetary System. Stability and equal treatment Is in everybody's best Interest, f am determined that the American dollar must jftever again be a hostage In the hands of the international speculators. One other quote from that speech is important because I believe that it represents a fair and proper description of what the United States has done in the interests of the free countries of the world over the last 30 years. The President said this: At the end of World War II, the economies of the major industrial nations of Europe and Asia were shattered. To help them get on their feet and to protect their freedom, the United States has provided 143 billion dollars ln foreign aid. That was the right thing for us to do. Today, largely with our help, they have regained their vitality and have become strong competitors. Now that other nations are economically strong the time has come for them to bear their fair share of the burden of defending freedom around the world. The time has come for exchange rates to be set straight and for the major nations to compete as equals. There is no longer any need for the United States to compete with one hand tied behind her back. The proper duty of all members of this House is to encourage Australian people to know the facts and to understand that confidence is vital in commerce and industry if national development is to be sustained and this country is to cope with the economic problems emerging in Australia. It is a long time since the Opposition members were able to use the term 'unemployment' as a political truncheon to belabour the Government, but 2 weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition was attacking the confidence of Australians by threatening the community with 100,000 unemployed. This figure represents about 2 per cent of a labour force of 5 million people. His shameful failure to put such figures the measure of his failure to compare economic conditions in Australia with those in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the continent of Europe. A close examination of this extravagant and exaggerated speech fails to reveal policies to be analysed and assessed by the Australian people who may be seeking to know what the Leader of the Opposition really would be doing if he were the Prime Minister of Australia. I turn now to a significant matter that has been stressed in this debate on all sides. I make reference to the rural economy within this country. The Leader of the Opposition has said: Wefindin our economy a generally depressed rural community. But a policy to cope with such a position as whole clip of 36c per lb greasy, ln this he denned it was not forthcoming. Every word of his speech was designed to attack the confidence of the community and nothing constructive was said to encourage the Australian people in any responsible way. The Treasurer in his Budget Speech on 17th August told us that the Government was aware that farm income in 197071 was estimated at about S810m and that this figure was about S265m less than in 1969-70. The constructive policies designed to help the rural community are clear in the to the honourable member for Murray( Mr Budget. These are, firstly, finance for schemes of debt reconstruction and farm build up. An amount of $4m was paid to New South Wales last year for this purpose and a further S40m is to be provided this year for payments to the States. Secondly, provision is also made for payment to the States of $ 11.5m under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. Payments last year were S3.1m. Thirdly, advances for capital purposes include SlOm for the Commonwealth Development Bank to help finance an extension of the Bank's operations to include loans to farmers to build up the size and operational efficiency of their farms. Fourthly, for those farmers not in a position to achieve economic viability a it were ever formed by the Australian retraining scheme is to be introduced, and Labor Party. I point out that my experience the rural reconstruction scheme also proin this House has led me to a suspicion vides for rehabilitation assistance necessary that in Opposition the Australian Labor to alleviate personal hardship for those Party has a no hold barred political outfarmers obliged to leave rural industry. look. No misrepresentation can be too big Fifthly, the wool industry is supported by for it, no standard of political attack is the operation of the Australian Wool Comunacceptable if, in its view, votes can be mission. Last year the Commonwealth won. This is characterised, in my belief, made available to the Commission $!2m for by the fact, as I mentioned before, that no working capital to finance purchases of details of policy are forthcoming from the wool, and an arrangement was negotiated Australian Labor Party. Until such time as with the trading banks to provide up to the people of Australia, facing serious $34m to the Commission for the same pureconomic circumstances, are able to compose.

As the Treasurer has told us, the Opposition with the policies introduced advances for capital purposes include a by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer further SlOm to be advanced to the Comit will not be possible for people to make mission as working capital should this be any rational comparison. needed. This year the wool producers will be further supported by a scheme of matters in relation to this Budget Speech deficiency payments so as to ensure that on but, as time is very short, I will content average growers receive for shorn wool, myself with a reference to those defence other than specified inferior types accountmatters which I feel have been denned by ing for about 10 per cent of shorn wool, the Prime Minister in this Budget as 'susa return corresponding to a price for the taining our conviction that the security of Budget provision is made for expenditure of $60m under the deficiency payments scheme This year S38m is the expected expenditure on the phosphate fertilisers bounty, and the bounty is to be extended to 31st December 1974.

Thus payments to rural industries are expected to total $275m, an increase of S65m on last year. These policies arc a clear answer to the extravagant criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor), the honourable member for will remember his speech for a considerable period although he was not assisted by an unfortunate incident in the galleryand the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) were all involved in attacks on personalities within the Government rather than concentrating upon those policies which would characterise a government if 1 wished to refer to a number of other",71,Australian Film Th E Three Pronged Attack

I have come to the view that it is impossible to look ahead by means of a crystal ball and to be sure that the estimate over a period of 10 years is a reliable one finds that those governments do not one. I therefore hold the view that the Government and the Parliament ought to be prepared to make at the earliest opportunity arrangements for a marked increase in the defence capacity of Australia. It is my view that the international situation may deteriorate rapidlyI have said so before in this House-and I believe that we ought perhaps to be better prepared in financial terms to meet such a rapid deterideserve. oration. 1 conclude my remarks by suggesting to the House that there are reasons why the ping pong diplomacy which has characterised the policies of the Peking Government in recent months and the softening approach of the Peking Government towards the Western powers should have taken place at all. I draw to the attention of the House those complexes which are in China at a place called Lop Nor. They are nuclear complexes in which the Government of Peking is preparing a nuclear capacity. I would imagine that if I were in government in Peking and IfI came to the conclusion that there was likely to be any nuclear threat to my country one of the first moves I would make would be to seek a detente and some form of relaxation with those people who had been my enemies during recent years. This is a suggesbefore-and his Budget Speech contained a tion which I think ought to be of interest to people in our defence Services and in the Department of Defence. I would be interested to know whether there was any information which would encourage people to believe that this was the real reasoning behind ping pong diplomacy and behind what bas been happening in recent times. join with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) who has condemned the Government on its Budget in these words: 'The House condemns the Budget because (a) It breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of proposals to balance the finances and functions of tbe Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national security'. This Government has held office by the use at election time of a number of issues which have divided the people. When governments are elected on emotional issues always govern in the best interests of the people. Emotional issues on which governments achieve electoral success may mean something 1 week but in 6 months time may mean nothing at all. When this is the case, I can say only that the electors certainly are getting the Government that they do not deserve. It is often said that electors get the government that they If the Australian people are to be divided, this Budget has sought to divide them even more. Personal income tax has been increased by $164m. In 1969, Prime Minister Gorton promised taxation reform and in the 1970-71 Budget he did grant an across the board reduction in personal taxation. There was no review of taxation, but he might have been working on it too for all we on this side of the House know. Certainly, there has not been any review of personal income tax as it relates to the middle and lower income groups. I believe this is what was understood to be the electoral promise made in 1969 by the then Leader of the Liberal Party, Prime Minister Gorton. This review is long overdue. The Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) on the presentation of the 1971-72 Budget condemned wage increases-h e has done this veiled threat to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Commonwealth Treasury always receives its pound of flesh from any wage increases that are granted. It is expected that this year there will be an average increase of 13 per cent in incomes-so much for the anti-inflationary measures which are",73,Australian Film Th E Three Pronged Attack

The former Prime Minister was regarded by members on both sides of the House as a true Australian. The man who now wears the shoes of Prime Minister and who in March of this year was speaking of the rights of Parliament, before a month had passed was causing Bills to be rushed through this House and the Parliament to sit at all hours and into the morning so that he might close down the Parliament as soon as possible. He neglected the rights of Parliament further a fortnight ago when he was hell bent on disregarding the views of Parliament on the subject of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. However, the Prime Minister was forced because of dissension within the ranks of his Party to refer this matter to the Parliatims of the Budget. Also, I believe that I ment.

Depending on the case that they are able to present, consideration is given to granting an increase without them having to face open tender. However, the only redress the mail contractors have is to give 3 months notice of the cancellation of their contracts and then to engage in public tender. This process of cancellation is not always practicable because of the outlay on their vehicles and the arrangements they have made on the understanding that they would be carrying out a service for 3 years. The increased costs have been placed upon them by the very people for whom they have contracted to work.

A means test is applied to the tapered means. test which was introduced by the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer. Under the present scheme, which includes some of the largest pension increases for some time, we find that 148,000 age pensioners will not benefit from the pension rises; that 1 ,000 invalid pensioners will not benefit; 7 and that 16.000 widow pensioners will not benefit. A total of 181,000 or 17 per cent of the total number of pensioners will not receive any increase in pension. About 27,000 will receive only partial benefit. Truly, it has been a further division amongst the ranks of the pensioners who have been divided into single pensioner and married pensioner, through the merged means test and the tapered means test and now further again into those who would qualify' for the increases that are proposed and those who do not qualify or qualify only in part.

162,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jarman),,77,Australian Film Th E Three Pronged Attack
163,Mr Turner (Bradfield) (10.34),"I nSo far as the situation in regard to our foreign affairs and defence is concerned I would point out that this is a novel situation in 1971 that we have never faced before, where our great and powerful friends are in the process of departing from our area. The British have turned their backs upon empire and their faces towards Europe. The Americans are recalling their legions from fhe mainland of Asia. There is also an enormous change in the balance of world power. China has recovered from the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese have achieved national unity and industrial strength and their diplomatic initiatives have spread throughout Asia, Europe and Africa. So far as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is concerned, she has made her presence felt in the Mediterranean ahd in the Mediterranean littoral, in the Middle East and now in India, and she has moved into the Indian Ocean and into South East Asia. As to Japan, the future of her alliance with America is now to some extent in doubt. Her relations with China, the USSR and the countries of South East Asia are in the melting pot. We do not know what they may be. She may or may not become a military power to match her enormous economic strength that now rivals that of the other super powers. We have a particular special relationship with her in regard to her procurement of raw materials. It is perfectly plain, least of developing nuclear weapons if we therefore, that we face a novel situation in our part of the world. What should we do? First of all, I should like to distinguish between foreign policy and defence policy. Foreign policy is optimistic. It seeks to avoid hostilities and to arrive at accommodations with other countries. It is an optimistic policy but a defence policy is a pessimistic policy. morale to defend itself. Here we can learn It begins on the assumption that you have not been able, by diplomatic and other means, to avoid hostilities and you are now faced with the worse situation. So far as our foreign relations are concerned, we should obviously cling to our old friends, tbe United States and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom may indeed be strengthened by her association with Europe and this combination may be another force in the world in the course of time. But we must be well aware of the fact that neither the United States nor the United Kingdom and the nebulous addition of Europe can be regarded as the towers of strength that they may have been in the past. We must, of course, establish diplomatic relations with the nations of our area, including the People's Republic of China, if this is possible. We must diversify our, trade as far as possible so that we may not be subject to blackmail by trading partners as was evidenced so clearly in the visit of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) to Peking recently. If this lesson has not been learned then indeed we are blind. We must seek stability in South East Asia by means of appropriate aid to the countries of that area so far as we can and we must not rule out the possibility of military action in that part of tbe world in appropriate circumstances. So far as defence is concerned-the pessimistic policy-w e have to consider, first of all, the likely threats and then we must build or acquire equipment and train personnel to meet those threats. We must begin the longer term projects now so that we are in a position to defend ourselves later if the need should arise. For example, if it takes, say, 7 years to build the kind of ships that we need for the sorts of threats that we may anticipate then we must begin to do it now and not in 7 years time. We should not rule out having the capability at should need to do so. We must not be chicken hearted about these things. Nobody knows what the situation of this world will be in a few years time. If we are to defend ourselves we need to have the spirit to do it. Arms are not enough. Trained personnel are by themselves no use. Nothing is any use unless a country has the spirit of independence and the something from Sweden and Switzerland, from Israel and Singapore. I would hope that Australia bas the same spirit. NowI turn very quickly to those domestic problems which are most important. Inflation is the one which faces us most, immediately, .with all its impact upon our exporting industries, with the distortion of. the internal economy. We should always remember that galloping inflation-and this can happen almost overnight-brough t to power Hitler and the social upheaval that produced World War II . This is something that ought not to be forgotten; and cannot be forgotten by my generation at least. I hope that the younger generation does not have to learn the lesson the hard way. Then there is the impact of innation on individuals, for which compensation, must be made by those who profit from inflation to those who suffer from it; that is to say, to pensioners, repatriation cases and retired Commonwealth Public Servants for whom this Parliament has a special responsibility. HereI would like to con gratulate the Government on having done justice to them. But also there are those who are just above.the pension means test level who also suffer from continuing inflation. I believe that in the longer run this means that we shall have to have a national superannuation scheme so that they may not be penalised unduly. What can we do about inflation? I must congratulate the Government on taking certain steps. First of all, with regard to corporations the High Court has now made an historic decision. Indeed, when I read it I thought of the words of Charles James Fox when he said, referring to the French Revolution: How much the greatest event that has happened in the world! Here1 would say 'in the history of the High Court'. He went on to say: And how much the best! This High Court decision will confer powers on the Government in Canberra that must be used, that ought to be used and that can be used in the general interest. It will enable the Government also to deal with the activities in this country of foreign investors. I hope, to some extent at least, that it wil] be possible to deal with the securities industry also which has been a disgrace to this country for some time. 1 hope the Government will proceed through the Tariff Board with the review that it has promised and that this will not be in any way impeded by the activities of the Department of Trade and Industry. Finally, if we are going to have industrial peace in this country-afte r all, everybody agrees that the inflation is due largely to cost-push inflation--the n there has to be some kind of accommodation between government, employers and employees. If not. we will wallow in a situation pf anarchy which can do no good to the people of Australia from the point of view either of our defence or prosperity, materially, spiritually or otherwise. This has to be done unless, as I say. we are to go down and down into chaos. I do not have time to deal now with the other domestic problems. I mentioned overseas capital, questions relating to national development, education, the crisis in the primary industries, the need for a real policy of decentralisation of population, the need to deal with urban prob: lems, the need to deal with immigration and the need to achieve a national identity which involves the quality of life and films which we make ourselves. I do not have time to deal with these things now. I hope to deal with them at the Committee stage of the Bill. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that we have a great political difficulty in dealing with all our problems whether they are foreign or domestic. I referred to the need for policies today and not personalities. We have had a surfeit, of personalities, and what this country now needs is policies designed to meet the situation in which we are now placed and policies that can be promulgated to the people so that they can understand and accept leadership. SoI deal with the question of Parliament and the media. The forum of debate on public issues in recent times has moved from Parliament to the media. On television we have programmes like 'This Day Tonight', 'Four Corners'. 'Monday Conference' and 'Meet the Press'. In the Press we get the pundits like Alan Reid. Alan Barnes, Alan Ramsey, David Solomon, Stubbs, Fitchett and the rest giving us our politics. These have become the forum for debate on public questions; not Parliament but television and the Press. What has to be done i.s to explain Government policies and intensions. How is this being done? It is being done by background briefings to Pressmen, by Press conferences, by leaks, by way of kites, by way of ministerial and departmental infighting and by way qf currying favour by Ministers with particular Pressmen. At best we get policy in dribs and drabs coming out in this fashion. It is simply not good enough. It is not the way in which any adult nation should have its politics and public issues discussed and debated. Is this movement from Parliament to the media a good or a bad thing, that is, that media personalities or those who employ them should replace members of Parliament as the tribunes of the people? As far as members of Parliament are concerned, admittedly we are a dull bunch compared with the clever and well remunerated young men on the television screen, or the pundits of the Press. We are also a tongue tied mob of people thanks to Party discipline and solidarity, reading so-called speeches and plugging the Party line at all times. But at least we are elected and from time to time sacked individually and collectively by the people themselves, and this is the great distinction from the others of whom I have spoken. We are on the whole a pretty sober, responsible and dedicated lot of people who know problems at the grass roots and accept the public interest, as we see it, as our guide. As to the media personalities, they are younger on the whole, more personable, quicker witted and smarter than members of Parliament but lacking in general in the more substantial abilities of leading members of the Parliament whose experience is rooted in various professional, business and televising of Parliament to reduce, if not to trade union spheres of activity. The differences in their criteria are more important still. What they must have always is a story. Whether it is truth or not is quite coincidental, but a story they must have. If possible, it should be a senmay be entitled 'This Day in Parliament' sation. Scoops are wonderful things to have, and a row is always good cop. Slickness, like the introduction of Christ into the Melbourne Club a little wbile ago, would be a good example. Then there are the personalities, court gossip. Who is in favour and who is not, who is plotting against whom and how and why, who will be promoted and to what portfolio, who will be dismissed and why, who has the support of colleagues and who has not, which lobbyist is achieving what for his customers, what vested interests have the ear of the Government and why, and what scandal is afoot? So they sniff their way along the political gutters looking for some months trial on closed circuit television. putrescent morsel to produce on the television screen or place on the breakfast tables of the people. This is not a transitory feature of our be public life. It is in the very bones of this new system, that is, government by the media on the television screen and by the gossip writers, and not by Parliament. Sensations and personalities are in the bones of the system because it thrives not on the public interest but on shallow entertainment. It is time that parliamentary democracy, if it is to endure, had more substantial fare. My generation at least will remember that violence, showmanship and radio brought Hitler to power. The answer is twofold. First of all I turn to policy statements. These should be made in all cases in Parliament whether by way of green papers, white papers, by the tabling of reports of expert advisers, through ministerial statements or other speeches by Ministers, through information given by the Government to parliamentary committees through informative replies to questions or through informed debate witb due notice. There can be no informed debate unless this kind of information' is given, and there can be no good debate unless there is due notice of the business of tbe House. I believe that there should be limited eliminate, distortion, suppression and selection on undesirable principles by the media. I say 'limited' because this should be done by some programme such as an hour, say, at the end of the day which when the principal things that happened may be screened. The problems of empty benches, absent members, clowning, matinee idols, film studio apparatus and so forth could be overcome. Any members who are interested in Parliament and the survival of a democratic system; any members who think that the handing over of the function of Parliament to the media is not in the interests of the people of this countryI believe these matters to be not unimportant-wil l find the whole thing in a report of a select committee of the House of Commons in 1966 and the ensuing debate. The proposal was for a 3 Unfortunately this proposal was defeated by one in a free vote. The House of Commons has certain problems because it has so many absentees at all times. Let there no doubt that the televising of Parliament can be carried out. The matter has been investigated in full. Anybody who is interested in the survival of Parliament can have a look at the report in the Hansard. If honourable members are not interested, they should not worry; let the media take over! What is the alternative-that Parliament moves to the media? They will select the subjects on which you and I will speak. They will choose the participants. We will operate according to their timing as to when a debate shall take place. They will have complete control over the proceedings. They will ask all the questions, keep the debate on the rails of their choosing, etc. The handicaps that Ministers have are quite obvious. Foreign Affairs is a very sensitive area. In the case of other matters ourable members will give their attention ih relation to which policies have not yet been decided a Minister is obviously very greatly handicapped and he will look like a bumbling fool compared with these bright young men. Back bench members, by definition the lesser lights anyhow and who are usually uninformed, will get no notice when they are to appear. Of course, certain objections have been made and will continue to be made, but I put it to honourable members that we face a novel situation in this country. We cannot afford to fiddle while this country burns. In leading this country-in arriving at policies adapted to the needs of a novel situation-w e cannot depend upon the media instead of the Parliament for the promulgation of policies that are decided, I hope, in consultation with the experts. We can go along the road that we have followed in the past, but I really believe that that road leads to disaster if we continue to follow it. I hope that at least some honto the problem itself and to the means of solving it. Debate (on motion by Mr Kennedy) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.54 p.m. The following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Arbitration: Australian Capital Territoiy (Question No. 2645) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: When was the backlog of claims in the Australian Capital Territory awaiting determination by a Conciliation Commissioner overtaken. able member's question is as follows: As at 7th April 1971 the position with regard to unfinatised matters in the Australian Capital Territory was as follows: Category Not listed at the request of the applicant Stood over or adjourned at the request of the applicant or the parties In which parties were conferring 6 In which hearing completed and a determination being considered 3 (joined) Referred to a Local Industrial Board for investigation and recommendation. Report sent to Commission ln which date fixed for work value case to commence .. Total Arbitration: National Wage Case Decisions (Question No. 2651) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: What percentage of the total work force has its wages adjusted directly to national wage decisions. able member's question is as follows: In general employees whose wages would be affected directly by national wage case decisions would be those whose wages, salaries and conditions of work are normally varied in accordance with awards, determinations or registered collective agreements of Commonwealth Industrial Tribunals. In recent years it has also been usual for employees whose wages, etc., are normally varied in accordance witb variations in awards, etc., of all State tribunals other than Western Australian tribunals, to have their wages varied in accordance with national wage case decisions. The results of the Commonwealth Statistician's May 1968 Survey of the Incidence of Industrial Awards, Determinations and collective Agreements show that 40.1 per cent of employees normaUy had their wages, salaries and conditions of work varied in accordance with variations in Commonwealth awards, determinations and registered collective agreements, 42.3 per cent in accordance witb variations in awards, determinations and agreements of the tribunals in 5 of the States, 5 per cent in accordance with variations in Western Australian State awards, etc., and there were 12.7 per cent of employees whose wages, etc., were varied either by unregistered coUective agreements or were not normally varied in accordance with any variation hi an award, determination or collective agreement. Thus, at least 82.4 per cent of employees would directly and indirectly have their wages varied in accordance with national wage case decisions. It is possible that some of the estimated 12.7 per cent of employees whose wages, No. of matters etc., are varied in accordance with unregistered agreements or are not varied in accordance with .. .. S any award, etc., may also have their wages varied in accordance with national wage case decisions.' .. .. 5 The Statistician's survey from which the above figures were taken did not cover all employees. Employees in the Australian Capital Territory, in the Northern Territory, in rural industry, private employees in hotels, cafes, personal service, etc., and employees of employers not subject to payroll tax were excluded from the survey. 5 (joined) Land Clearing1 (Question No. 2915) Mr Uren asked the Ministerf o r the 25 Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, upon notice: (1) Is sufficient land already cleared to enable ' Australia to provide for her own people and all potential exports. (2) Are current taxation policies encouraging the clearing of virgin land at a time when rural industries are in a state of decline. (3) Ts it a fact that because of these policies virgin land, which would have a great future as national parks or hardwood forests, is being cleared to provide financial gain for a few individuals. (4) If so, will he immediately consider taking, steps to alter the tax provisions and, in their place, institute such policies as will encourage the planting by private individuals of both softwood and hardwood forests on some of our cleared land. (5) Will he also consider the immediate cessation of further clearing of Commonwealth-owned crown land for any purpose including the planting of softwood timber species until a comprehensive overview of all such land is taken and the various alternatives for its use have been examined. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Considering the market prospects for agricultural products on both the domestic and world",77,Australian Film Th E Three Pronged Attack

166,Mr Howson,"The answer to the honmarkets in the foreseeable future, very careful consideration would need to be given to any stimulation of regional development projects involving the large scale clearing of virgin land. In many cases, however, the economic viability of a property may increasingly depend upon the improvement of production efficiency which may involve the clearing of land. (2) Current taxation provisions in relation to land clearing are designed to enlarge the scale of individual farm operations and improve' efficiency and net farm income. The provisions, of course, apply to bolh virgin land and to developed .properties and even so-called developed property may be found to stand in need of further development to bring about greater productivity and a lowering of farm costs. Under existing marketing conditions for many commodities, primary producers' plans to clear land are likely to be based much more on estimated net returns from the outlay than on the existence of taxation concessions. Insofar as land is cleared for forestry operations the cost of clearing the land is in allowable deduction when arriving at assessable income for taxation purposes. (3) The preservation of virgin areas for national parks or for development of hardwood forests can be achieved more effectively by legislative action on land use rather than by removal of concessions which improve production efficiency on properties in the rural sector. (4) Decisions by landholders to use their land for timber production depends on the relative economics of whatever alternative forms of production are available. Existing taxation concessions apply to development, for timber as well as to other forms of primary production. (5) The Minister for the Interior has advised as follows: 'Land use planning in the Australian Capital Territory has advanced to the point where most proposed plantations can be accommodated with benefit on previously cleared land. Various alternatives for all . A.C.T. lands have been examined and no .forested lands suitable for parks or hardwood forests are included in the plantation land programme. ""In the Northern Territory Commonwealtb clearing of Crown land is carried out on experimental farms for research into pasture improvement and agronomic practices and on forest reserves for the establishment of more productive forest stands. As a review of the best use of land is generally made at the time of its allocation for a Commonwealth purpose, it is not considered necessary to cease further clearing of Commonwealth-owned Crown Land.' Riverwood G o lf Course (Question No. 3162) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (l)'Is the Department of Civil Aviation, considering the acquisition of the 93-acre Riverwood golf course. (2) If so, for what purpose is the area to be utilised. (3) What is the estimated cost of acquisition. (4) What is the present planning classification for the area, and can he say whether the intended use of the site by the Department violates the ' Planning Scheme of the Bankstown Council. or that of the State Planning Authority. (5) Can he also say whether the Bankstown Council hopes to acquire the area for public recreation. (6) Was the golf course offered to the Department by Riverwood Golf Course Pty Ltd; if not, on whose initiative was the acquisition first contemplated.

(8) If so, what approximate area will become available and when. ationhas provided the followin g answers to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes (2) The area is required for the future extension of the building area at Bankstown Airport. (3) Negotiations for the purchase of the land have been adjourned, at the request of the owner, and I am unable to advise the estimated cost of acquisition at this time. (4) The land is at present zoned 'open space'. The owner of the land has applied to the.State Planning authorities to have the land rezoned 'industrial'. The Commonwealth has requested that the land be rezoned 'special uses (for -aviation purposes)'. (5) The Department of Civil Aviation is not aware of any proposal by the Bankstown Council to acquire the golf course for public recreation. (6) Negotiations for the acquisition of the golf course land by the Commonwealth commenced in 1968 when the owner offered to sell the land to the Department of Civil Aviation. The owner subsequently adjourned his negotiations when he applied to have the land rezoned 'industrial'. (7) It is planned that the RAAF. will vacate this area when accommodation is provided by the RAAF. at another location. (8) The area is approximately IS acres. It is not known when the area will be vacated by the RAAF. Home Help Service (Question No. 3199) Mr Kennedy asked the Ministerf o r Defence, upon notice: (1) What was the (a) date, (b) nature and (c) outcome of all negotiations betweenhis Department, the Department of the Army and the Victorian Government concerning the refusal of that Government to permit the extension of the Home Help Service of the Shire of Seymour to the families of Army personnel living at Puckapunyal.

Office of Secondary Industry (Question No. 3234) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that he is planning to take up his precedessor's campaign to increase the size and prestige of the Office of Secondary Industry. (2) If so, will this involve the recruitment of extra staff. (3) If extra staff will be required, does this accord witb the Government's present economy drive. (4) Is it a fact that the Tariff Board, which is itself faced with an extensive review of the whole tariff structure, is trying tp recruit additional skilled staff. (5) Will he give an assurance that any expansion of the Office of Secondary Industry will not be at the expense of the activities of the Tariff board. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) A proposal for re-organisation of the Office of Secondary Industry is currently under consideration. The proposal envisages the recruitment of additional staff. (3) The proposed re-organisation 'will be subjected to the same scrutiny as. other proposals affecting departmental establishments, to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's policy of staffing restraint in the Public Service. (4) Yes. Additional positions were recently created on the Tariff Board's establishment, and the Board is recruiting staff for the positions. (5) The Tariff Board and the Office of Secondary Industry perform different functions, though some of the functions are complementary. The staff needs-of each organisation will be dealt with on their individual merits. Training of Medical Practitioners (Question No. 3345) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Edurepresentative councils and sporting associations. cation and Science, upon notice: (1) What is the estimated, cost to' each of the benefits comprise principally the payment of all medical schools in Australia of the full training compulsory tuition and other statutory fees and, and graduation of a medical practitioner. (2) What would have been the total cost of fees to such a graduate covering the period over which these estimates are made.

Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It it is not possible at this stage to provide figures for the estimated cost to each medical school in Australia of the full training and graduation of a medical practitioner. The calculations are complicated because of the need to take into account the costs of training performed in teaching hospitals, which involves distinguishing costs from those in respect of patient care, and because certain elements of the total cost are merged with university expenditure covering other than medical studens. I have arranged for a detailed examination to be made in order to determine whether it is possible to make realistic estimaes. (2) The total course fees for the 6-year medical course at the rates of fees applicable in 1971 are: $ University of Sydney .. 2,393 University of New South Wales .. 2,344 University of Melbourne .. 3,426 Monash University .. 2,880 University of Queensland .. 2,616 University of Adelaide .. 3,240 University of Western Australia .. 2,232 University of Tasmania .. 2,303 These figures include fees paid for residence at teaching hospitals and fees for matriculation, graduation, general services, library, etc., but exclude fees payable to student unions, student (3) Commonwealth university scholarship subject to a means test, the payment of a Uving",83,Answers To Questions Upon Notice

171,Mr Wentworth,"The answer to the honIn addition, the rate of sickness benefit for persons who have been in receipt of payment for 6 consecutive weeks has been increased to the standard rate of invalid pension m the case of adults and married minors and to $10.50 per week for persons aged 16 to 20 years. The Social Services Bill before the House includes provisions for increases of $1 per week in the allowance for the dependent spouse of an unemployment or sickness beneficiary, $2 per week for diefirstchild of such beneficiary and SI per week for each subsequent child. Rates of long-term sickness benefit will also be increased in line with the proposed increase in the standard rate of pension. (7) It is estimated that, based on the average weekly number of beneficiaries during 1970-71, to increase unemployment benefit and sickness benefit to the standard rate of age and invalid pensions as proposed in the Social Services Bill, would cost in the vicinity of S9m per annum. (8) No change. ' (9) Provision to increase child endowment for third and subsequent children in families and for children in institutions by 50c per week is contained in the Social Services Bill before the House. (10) No change. (11) This involves a matter of Government policy. I would point out that fhe Government has not permitted rising prices to erode the living standards of pensioners since it has ensured that pensions have risen considerably faster than have prices. In the period between the September quarter 1949 and the June quarter 1971 prices rose by some 154 per cent. During the same period the maximum married rate of age and invalid pensions rose by 235 per cent, and the maximum standard rate by 276 per cent, or 324 per .cent if supplementary assistance is included. In addition,, a number, of fringe benefits such as the Pensioner Medical. Service have been introduced in that period, thus further enhancing the real value of the pension. (12) Because the future level of average weekly earnings cannot be predicted, it is not possible to estimate the cost of this proposal. However, the cost of increasing age, invalid and widows' pensions by $1 per week would currently be about $55m a year.

(5) What objective criteria does the Department of Civil Aviation use when weighing the loss of open space, property values and human comfort from aircraft noise against the needs of airlines and air travellers. ation has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question: (1) I would not have thought that Adelaide, in comparison with other Australian cities, has a shortage of recreation space and, in fact, the impression is rather to the contrary. However, you will appreciate that this is only a personal impression. (2) The conclusion built into the question is not necessarily correct A major extension of the runexisting sporting arenas but it is also probable ment's airport planners work very closely with the State Planning Authorities. (3a) It would require a re-alignment of Tapley's changes to Military Road, is under consideration that section of the Patawalonga passing through",87,Recurrent Grants For Medical Teaching Hospitals

177,Mr Swartz,"The Minister for Civil Avithe golf course would need to be diverted. The runway would not extend this far but one element of the instrument landing system is installed 1,000 feet beyond the end of the extended runway and that land within the 1,000 feet must be level to ensure the integrity of the landing aid. (3c) It is believed that any modification would be limited to. the Patawalonga diversion from within the golf course as earlier mentioned. These modifications do not appear to have any direct bearing on the drainage scheme as a whole. (3d) It is understood' that the capacity of Military Road would need to be increased. However, it is suggested that the question should be addressed to the highway authority. (3e) Noise nuisance patterns will depend upon aircraft types which are selected. However, in general terms, the coming years should see a reduction in noise in proportion to aircraft size. The B747 jumbo jet, for example, though three times the capacity of the B707, is marginally quieter. (3f) and (4) It is understood that any airport need would not lead to home acquisitions for road purposes. However, a rather more general re-alignment of roads is believed to be under consideration and the question should be addressed to the highway authority. (5) It is very doubtful whether it is possible to devise objective criteria along the lines suggested. Rather, the Department, in working closely with the State Planning authorities, does everything possible to make alternative arrangements for recreational areas. The Department, wherever possible, is willing to lease land, whicb is within the airport boundaries, for long term use as recreational areas. Similarly, the Department works .very closely with State and Local Government planning interests to ensure the maximum compatibility between airport operations and nearby land use. It is not necessarily correct to say that an airport reduces nearby land values. There is considerable evidence to the contrary. In fact, finding answers to drainage problems and initiating or extending engineering services in creating Adelaide Airport, made it possible to develop some of its nearby areas. French Nuclear Tests (Question No. 3673) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) With which countries has Australia discussed protests against the French nuclear tests at Muraroa atoll this year. (2) Which countries are known to have made protests. (3) What were the terms of Australia's and their protests. MrN . H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) New Zealand Cook Islands Nauru Fiji Tonga Western Samoa Japan (2) Australia New Zealand Cook Islands Nauru Fiji Tonga Western Samoa Japan Chile Peru The Philippines (3) The terms of Australia's protest note were as follows: (a) The Government of Australia has in the past expressed its strong opposiuon to the conduct of atmospheric nuclear testing, particularly in Uie Pacific area. (b) Auslralia is a parly to the partial test ban .. . treaty of 1963 and would like to see it universally and comprehensively applied. (c) The resumption of nuclear testing in tbe atmosphere in the Pacific area without regard to thc deep concern that this arouses among the people of the area is a matter of considerable regret to the Government of Australia. (d) The Government of Australia hopes that the Government of France will weigh these matters carefully in considering whether to proceed with further nuclear testing in the Pacific region. . The. Communique of the forum of South Pacific leaders, attended by the representatives of Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands, Nauru, Fiji, Tonga, and Western Samoa, expressed concern at the potential hazards to health and to marine life which is a vital element in islands subsistence and economy, and appealed to France to make the current series of tests the last in the Pacific area. The other countries mentioned have made protests in similar terms. On 17th August 1971 Peru threatened to break off diplomatic relations with France if another nuclear weapons test is held by France at its testing site in the Pacific.

(2) If so, what steps has Australia taken to see that. English teaching is as readily available as French teaching in Indonesia. Mr N. H . Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have noted the report of the French donation of audio-visual appliances and technical instruments for language teaching purposes. (2) Steps taken by Australia to assist in the teaching of English in Indonesia include: (a) the provision since 19S9 of well over 1 sioners have (i) one and (ii) two or more depenmillion sets of booklets (8 to a set) entitled dent children. 'English for You' for use in conjunction with broadcasts from Radio Australia.

These are given to universities and associations of economists primarily devoted to local children of age and invalid pensioners will benefit research; (d) training in Australia. Over the past 3 years, The cost for a full year is estimated to be 106 Indonesian students have been enrolled $3.2m. in English courses in Australian institutions. This includes 56 trainees for courses at the English Training Centre, North Sydney, 7 post graduate students admitted to the University of Sydney for a course of Teaching of English as a Foreign Language Services, upon notice: and 43 students enrolled in other special ' English language courses. During the same period, about 250 sponsioners have non-pensioner wives. sored students have been given preliminary English tuition before embarking on other children. studies. More than 30 Indonesians have so far been nominated for English training under increased rates proposed in the 1971 Budget for the Colombo Plan this fmancial year and non-pensioner wives and dependent children. approximately 150 others are expected to seek refresher or pre-course English ourable member's question is as follows: training: (e) help under the Australian-Asian University (1) Detailed statistics for the total number of Aid and Co-operation Scheme.

After discussions with tbe Indonesian authorities, Dr. J. R. Angel of Sydney University commenced a 1-month's assignment oa ' 3rd August to investigate and advise on forms of assistance which might be given in this field; (I) my department has recently been examining the possibility of providing a language laboratory, chiefly for language instruction sponsored Indonesian students who will be undertaking training courses in Australia. It is hoped mat this would lead to a reduction in the number of students who come to Australia specifically for English language training, and also meet the language needs of students who would otherwise undergo lengthy language courses after arrival here as a preliminary to other studies.

182,Mr Wentworth,"The answer to the hon(b) At 30th June 1971 there were an estimated ' 11,800 age pensioners with non-pensioner wives. A wife's allowance was paid to. a total of 7,244 of these age pensioners' wives. (2) Detailed statistics for the total number oi non-pensioner wives of invalid and age pensioners with dependent children are not maintained. However, it is estimated .that at 30th June 1971 approximately 8,000 invalid pensioners* wives and 2,000 age pensioners' wives and 2,000 age. pensioners' wives ftho were receiving wives' allowances had dependent children. The number of non-pensioner wives of invaUd and age pensioners who have dependent children and are not paid a 'wife's allowance would be negligible.

MrN . E Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as The full text of paragraph 465 of the Visiting Mission's report which was presented to the UN. Trusteeship Council, was: 'The Mission shares the view expressed by the Select Committee that the vast majority of the people of Papua New Guinea desire a strong central government and a united country. It accordingly believes that in the interest of the country as a whole separatism must be discouraged. In the Mission's opinion, however, the surest answer to separatist tendencies probably lies in steady progress towards full self-government and independence for the whole country. In Bougainville, the present sense of separateness might be further diminished if at some later date the people of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate were to opt for unification with an independent Papua New Guinea.' 'No special consultations have taken place with the British authorities regarding the speculation by the Visiting Mission.
