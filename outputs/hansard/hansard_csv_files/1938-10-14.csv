I saw that criticism in the press, and regard it as very unfair. It would appear that this organization sends letters of that kind to the press simultaneously' with their despatch to me, complaining about films being banned before they have been inspected. Actually, it has imported six films in the last two years, every one of which has been released, one on appeal.

The fact remains that all of the films were released. through the ordinary process of inspection by the Film Censorship Board. Apparently, this organization feels that it attracts notice and arouses enmity against the Government by making these protests before the matter has been finalized.

These condition of the export markets and the problems can be attacked only by a board serious financial difficulties of growers of enabled because of its statutory authority fresh fruit. In examining the cause of these adverse circumstances, costs of production and costs of marketing, and conditions governing returns from sales came under review. The Commonwealth concern was confined to marketing, questions of production coming under the jurisdiction of the States. Oversea freights were first given attention, and although the Commonwealth has no statutory power to deal with shipowners, it managed, through the Australian Overseas Transport Association, and by negotiation between shipowners' representatives and exporters' organizations, to arrange agreements which covered primary products, which included apples of freight on apples and pears have committee (Consideration of amounted to 5d. a case, including a reduction of 3d. a case secured last year.

66,Mr Archie Cameron (Barkerremoving The Huge Quantity Of Fruit To,"to enforce its decisions upon its growers and exporters. Beyond doubt, in its dealings with shipowners, a statutory board will be able to render greater service to the industry than can a voluntary body. Though it was enabled to secure some relief in freight costs, the Government found itself called upon to augment export returns j and in lie years from 1933-34 to 1937-3S it paid out almost £500,000 to the apple and pear growers of Australia£489,448 to be exact. It is obvious that, while making such sums available, the Commonwealth Government must question whether every possible effort is being amendments of the decisions are possible made to improve conditions, in particular whetherlack of organization is not militating against the most effective disposal of our frui t in overseas markets. Statements are constantly being made to the Government that marketing conditions in the United Kingdom could and should be improved. It is freely stated that there are too many agents in England, that some of them are financially weak, and that their methods of trading affect the market adversely. It is further said tliat too much fruit is marketed in London; that greater quantities should go to outports. These contentions might be right, or wrong. AllI wish to say is that a lot of people who know something about the industry say that they are right. My belief is that a thorough examination is called for, and that a body representative of the industry should direct that examination, and apply remedies where it can do so. Regulation of imports into the United Kingdom is certain to come. In fact it is in the interests of the Australian industry that it should be brought about if for no other reason than because of the check that it will place upon American stored fruit. At present, American apples are on the market often as late as June. Regulation, it is hoped, .would stop this. If the Anglo-American agreement contains provision for reductions of duties on foreign fruit during certain months of the year, this protection against stored fruit will he absolutely necessary. If regulation be imposed at the United Kingdom end, it means regulation at this end, and the Commonwealth Government prefers that the regulation, be done by the representatives of the industry themselves rather Mr Arohie Cameron. than by a Government department. The only way to arrange this is to form a board and give it the necessary legal power. A voluntary body will not do, because it cannot enforce its decisions. It is by no means certain that the quotas as applied to the supplies to the United Kindom market under present arrangements are as satisfactory and as fully effective as they might be. They are decided upon months ahead, but there is no machinery for adjustment, and it might often be found that, as the export season closely approaches or progresses, which would permit the entry of greater quantities than at first arranged. I know that, because of the distance from Australia and shipping arrangements, adjustments are difficult. Every one realizes that perfection cannot be attained, but it is necessary to obtain the best possible result. This can be done only by close collaboration with others interested in the market in the United Kingdom, who could make the necessary arrangements which would be followed up in Australia. The United Kingdom market should be closely studied so that the greatest quantity of fruit possible should he sent, consistently, of course, with sound marketing; and, if it, happens that one country fails to send its quota, quotas of others should be increased. If the supply in the United Kingdom suddenly falls back, for example, it might be possible, by setting the cables to work and bringing about active negotiation and active organization at both ends, to act promptly enough to take advantage of that change of circumstances. My point is that, with, the arrival of quotas, the closest and most efficient organization in London and in Australia would well repay the growers of Australia whose interests are so much influenced by these quota arrangements. Greater quantities of fruit should ho sold on the Continent. With the huge quantities of fruit going on to the United Kingdom market, greater attention should he paid to the Continental marmarkets selling some citrus to New Zealand? selling citrus to New Zealand.

68,Mr Archie Cameron,"We arefruits are not one of our difficulties at present. however, due to the governmental regulations applied by so many countries. This, question should be tackled, and, as far as contact with the governmental authorities is involved, the Commonwealth Government is prepared to help. I believe the best approach is to use the practical knowledge and advice of a representative of the industry, who can study the markets of each country, combined with that of an official who can study the import regulations of each country, and the commercial treaties, and see how host the fruit can be admitted. A gradual development of permitted exports into continental Europe should be the aim. It cannot be done alone by public servants. With limitation of entry to the United Kingdom, this is a very practical problem. While there is a case of apples left in Australia fit for export, which is surplus to the United Kingdom quota and the domestic requirements of Australia, no effort should be spared to we that other markets are found. There are difficulties admittedly, but they should be tackled, and a statutory board is the body to do the tackling. Where foreign governments are to be approached, Australian government representatives should be available to assist. Every grower must realize that, if Australia is to compete with other suppliers to world markets, the quality of its apples must be high. It supplies approximately only 25 per cent, of Britain's imports and the only way it can hold its own in the competitive struggle is to send a product uniformly sound in quality. The Commonwealth Department of Commerce, with the co-operation of State officers, is charged with the task of regulating qua1<ity and type, and who are best fitted to advise the department in forming its standards than the representatives of growers themselves? The board will have no power to enforce any scheme of regulation within Australia. occasioned by section 92 of the Constitution. tion 92 prevents that. nothing to prevent it from collaborating There are many difficulties, with other bodies to improve marketing in Australia. Eor example, it could join in a policy of advertising and, where it could be shown that benefit to export would result from such policy, it could contribute, if it wished, from its funds to any advertising scheme. Again, it could approach State bodies or, through the Commonwealth Government, State governments with recommendations that, if acted upon, would improve conditions within a State. With these considerations before the Government, the question arose whether some improvement could not be brought about by greater organization. It was clear that organization in some form had been found necessary. Associations of growers had been brought'into existence in all States, and the federally organized Apple and Pear Export Council was given many functions to fulfil. The plain truth, however, is that these organizations are not sufficiently effective. In the first place, the great body of opinion within the industry cannot bind the minor factions, which seem to exist in all primary industries, and these minor factions often hamper and break down the whole work of organization. In the second place, the existing organizations frequently fail to do what they want to do simply because they lack the statutory power. The smn of the proposals I am now putting before honourable members, therefore, is not so much the introduction of the principle of organization in the marketing of apples and pears, as it is the introduction of more effective and generally more efficient organization on the basis of that which is already in existence. Having concluded that some action was called for, the next step was to consult representative growers' organizations, and the State governments were invited to arrange for representatives to attend a conference at Canberra. The outcome of that conference was that representative organizations of growers in all States, except Tasmania, affirmed the proposals, and, in fact, approved them in detail. On difficulty the Tasmanian State Fruit Board signifying its objections to the proposed board, I arranged to meet the full board in Hobart, and there learned that its objecBut there is tions were not against the principle of the",19,Apple And Pear Organization Bill 1938 Cameron And Read A First Time Second Reading

Of courre, the State board itself is a statutory body, and, furtheimore, it sends its representatives to the Apple and Pear Export Council, a voluntary body. I subsequently addressed meetings of growers throughout Tasmania and explained to them in detail the measures under consideration. The manner in which I was received, and the support given me, clearly showed that a great body of Tasmanian growers were in favour of such an organization as that proposed. The Tasmanian Government wholeheartedly approves the establishment of a board, and, notwithstanding the views of a majority of the members of its own statutory board, considers that the ComInonwealth Parliament should pass this legislation. The Commonwealth Government thus has clear and ample evidence that growers support the establishment of such a statutory ,body as that contemplated. 1 emphasize that the board is predominantly representative of producers.

I therefore suggest to honourable gentlemen opposite, and also certain honourable members on my own side of the House, that if they are prepared to curtail somewhat the second-reading debate, so that we may give as much attention as possible to particular clauses of the measure, the Government will be glad to co-operate in reaching a decision satisfactory to all. adjourned.

[11.18] -Each year for quite a long period now this Parliament has been requested to make special grants, aggregating millions of pounds, to certain States. It is claimed by the representatives of these States that they have suffered certain disabilities in consequence of federation. Yet the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which has made frequent investigations into these assertions, has not found it possible to indicate the nature of tire alleged disabilities. of the Constitution say on this subject? ever they said, the fact remains that the disabilities from which these claimant States suffer are largely due to seasonal and other economic factors and not to Commonwealth policy. Representatives of Western Australia, for example, invariably claim that the difficulties of that State are due to drought conditions. I The board is thus, iu point out that Queensland also suffers from drought conditions. But I should It was not think of declaring to the world, as do the representatives of some States, that a matter of fact, bills of the kind we are now considering could be described as in the nature of a financial ramp on the Commonwealth Treasury. Certain State governments are not prepared to impose adequate taxation upon the residents in their States, and they look to the Commonwealth Government to make up the deficiency. Queensland is the highest taxed State in Australia; yet its people fulfil their obligations year by year, and they are being asked to contribute to the obligations of other States not so heavily taxed. The Commonwealth Grants Commission has, as a matter of fact, found it advisable to suggest penalties on various States for laxity in imposing adequate taxes. This being so, I protest against the taxpayers",20,Apple And Pear Organization Bill 1938 Cameron And Read A First Time Second Reading

If it could bo shown that the money provided by the Commonwealth to assist necessitous States was being paid to the unfortunate primary producers who are suffering in consequence of drought and other unfavorable conditions, the situation would be different; but I strongly resent adherence to the procedure of paying Commonwealth grants to State Treasurers to help them balance their budgets. I do not think my figures. that the State Treasurers are entitled to such windfalls from tlie Commonwealth. In 1937, the dairying districts of Queensmember for Forrest( Mr Prowse) to say? laud passed through their third successive He remains quiet. severe drought, and these moneys should go to assist dairy farmers financially. The taxpayers of South Australia, in particular, have recently been relieved of certain taxes in consequence of the surplus in the public accounts in that State; the honourable member for Forrest pleases and I can see no reason why, in such circumstances, we should continue to pay substantial grants to the South Australian Government. Certain honourable gentlemen who have supported this bill, particularly the honGovernment wisely decided that coloured orable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), have complained about the development of secondary industries in the eastern States; but if the measure of secondary production is to be the measure of assistwhite men, and they have worked under ance to States, Queensland is entitled to more consideration than ""Western Australia, for I find that in 1935-36 the value of secondary production per head of the population was £16 15s.

Id. In these circumstances it is hard to understand why Western Australia should be begging financial assistance from the Commonwealth, particularly as the people of that State have received a great deal more proportionately from the Commonwealth in wheat bounties, gold bounties, road grants and farmers' debt reduction, and so on, than the people of Queensland. I strongly protest, therefore, aggregating against the payment of Commonwealth do.es to Western Australia in order to ease the burden of taxation on the people of that State. Western Australia cannot contradict these statements. have never tried to do so. I challenge the representatives of both Western Australia and South Australia to deny my general contentions or the accuracy of sugar ramp, it is the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) who should remain quiet. to call "" the sugar ramp"" is a policy which this Parliament has approved. The honourable gentleman no doubt would like to see Kanakas, Chinese and Indians producing sugar in Australia under blacklabour conditions, but the Commonwealth people should be removed from the canefields of Queensland. Since that was done, the white workers in the caiie-fields have received the rate of wages payable to Australian conditions. Moreover, the people of Western Australia and of the other States also are being supplied with sugar at a lower price, when duty and exchange are allowed for, than the people of Great Britain are paying for sugar, the bulk of which is produced in blacklabour countries. Java for about half the present price. doubt the honourable member has in mind surplus sugar grown in Java by black labour, which was sold at less than it cost to produce by black labour. It is well known that during the war the sugar industry of Queensland made sugar available to the people of Australia under conditions which saved them more than £11,000,000.

The total demands of the claimant States amounted to no less than £4,300,000. The proposed grant will have to come from the people of other States which have their own economic problems to deal with, and which are equally oppressed hy unseasonable climatic conditions. The claim has been made by their representatives that the smaller States suffer great disabilities as the reState. sult of federal policy, but no tribunal has ever yet proved the justice of that claim. The claimant States have made very unfair demands on the resonrces of the Commonwealth. We should not have to make these contributions to their finances year after year. should read the report of the royal commission on the effects of the tariff. read the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on the proposals of the claimant States. is better than having both closed. The tables placed before us by the Commonwealth reveal that disabilities are suffered not only by the claimant States but also by the more prosperous States. In that respect I should say that New South Wales suffers more than any other State. We have, for instance, only to consider the enormous sums of money that have to be .provided for the r.elief of unemployment in New .South Wales and its huge expenditure in connection with social services. The same thing may be equally well said of Queensland because I believe that no State is further ahead than Queensland in its contribution? to social services. South Australia has dodued its obligations in that regard. It is now the first to approach the CqmTasmania. monwealth for assistance for its wheat growers by the provision of a home-conalways been prepared to do everything sumption price for wheat; and whilst I possible to assist the little island State, hope that the wheat-growers in that State will receive their just due, it must not be forgotten that the South Australian Premier headed the attack against a similar proposal when it was put to a referendum of the people by the Commonwealth. The Premier of South Australia in opposing the referendum stood side by side with the middlemen who take advantage of the people of Australia to an unwarranted degree, and with the workers who, although enjoying such wonderful conditions in our great secondary industries, want to continue to secure cheap food at the expense of the primary producers. South Australia opposes the establishment of any new industries in the But Western Australia is the champion in that respect. Only a few years ago when Queensland banana growers endeavoured to establish their industry at Carnarvon in Western Australia they found that they were not wanted and they wrote and wired me to resist Western Australia's desire to import bananas .from Java. The people of Western Australia wanted the duty on bananas removed so that they could import their requirements from Java; but in spite of opposition so successfully has the industry been established at Carnarvon that the Western Australian growers produce almost sufficient to meet the requirements of the State. The same thing occurred in connection with endeavours to establish the cotton growing industry; the growers were practiGrants Commission cally hounded out of the country. Subsequently, however, a Queenslander became Minister for' Agriculture in Western Australia, and as the .result of his activities, we find a changed outlook on the part of the Western Australian Government in regard to the establishment of new primary industries.

We must all be imbued with the common desire to make Australia self-supporting, and to develop its natural resources in the tropics and in the southern portions of this vast continent iu the best possible way.",22,Casey

This .Parliament did a great deal for that State by imposing an embargo on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand, although that policy may have inflicted hardship on some of our citrus-growers. I have always supported a policy designed to prevent the flooding of Australia with products of the land from otlier countries to the detriment of our own primary producers. In my opinion, Tasmania had a right to expect the Commonwealth to impose the embargo on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand; that is an obligation which we owed to that State just as in other ways we owe obligations to other States. Yesterday, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Green) referred to the fact that 1S0,000 persons are settled in Queensland north of the Tropic of Capricorn. That is a matter of which we cart be justly proud. I hope that in the near future, through the development of tronical industries, it will be possible to settle a much larger population in the northern parts of Western Australia near Broome and other northern ports. Only by having the population spread over a greater area, can Australia be developed fully. I oppose the grants recommended for the States. I suggest that the amount proposed to be appropriated for this purpose would be much better utilized in providing assistance for individuals who have suffered severely from drought conditions all over Australia. I commend this suggestion to the serious consideration of all honourable members. disastrous drought of 1937 had very serious consequences on primary producers all over Australia, particularly the butter producers of Queensland, and many of them are now in dire straits; assistance should be. given to them with the money provided in this bill. was somewhat astonished at the attack levelled hy the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) against the claimant States. From year to year it has been customary to hear expresred in this .House very severe criticism by a number of honourable members representing the eastern States. lamhopeful,however,that on this occasion, the honourable member for Wide Bay will be the only critic of this bill. Representing as he does a State which receives greater assistance from the Commonwealth than any other State, his criticism is in bad taste. We have only to take into consideration the great been; extended to Queensland as the result of what has been referred to here to-day as the sugar ramp to see the injustice of his remarks. Millions of pounds annually are poured into Queensland as the result of the sugar policy adopted by the Federal Government. Queensland receives great benefits from the rest of Australia, not only in respect of the sugar industry, but also in connection with the bananagrowing, pineapple-growing and cotton industries. When the honourable member takes all of those things into consideration, he should bow his head in shame at the unwarranted attack he made on the claimant States. Prior to the inception of the Commonwealth Grants Commission,honourable members representing the less prosperous States had td come here year after year, cap in hand, asking for Commonwealth assistance for their respective States. Since its appointment, the commission has played a very important part in inquiring into the disabilities of the smaller States, and the grants recommended by it from year to year have been instrumental in at least partially satisfying their needs. They ask, not for a dole, .but for something which the commission has clearly pointed out is their just right. I remind the honourable member for Wide Bay that the framers of the Constitution foresaw the The difficulties that would confront the loss prosperous States after federation. Steps -were taken early in the history of federation to meet their disabilities. Prior to federation the secondary industries OT South Australia were protected hy a border tariff, but after, the union had been achieved it was found, that many of them which had previously been able to operate successfully were forced to transfer their operations to the eastern States. When the border tariff was removed, boot, clothing and tobacco manufacturers, finding they had to operate in competition with manufacturers in States with greater natural resources, closed their doors and migrated to the eastern States. Power for use in",23,Casey
90,Mr Stagey (Adelaide) [11.39],"1secondary industries was cheaply obtained in the eastern States. As I have said, that was foreseen by the framers of the Constitution. Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, with their larger populations and more intense development, offered better markets for the output of secondary industries. The development of South Australia . and Western Australia thus became very costly, and it became necessary for those States to approach the Commonwealth for assistance. Although Western Australia had to seek assistance from the Commonwealth for a number of years, fortunately South Australia was able to carry on until recently without a grant. The South Australian people who, in the earlier years, had been very modest in their demands, eventually saw that the time had arrived when they could no longer continue to develop their State without Commonwealth assistance. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr that an average should be struck of the John Lawson) was one of the most severe critics of Commonwealth grants for the States in the past, but I am pleased to note that, since he has been elevated to the important position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, he has seen the light. The honourable member is apparently that the States ing for what is their just due. That reminds mo of the story of the little boy who tried to sell a. kitten. He approached the residence of a priest who was in consultation with a minister of the district in respect of some charitable undertaking. knock at the door. The boy said to him "".We are very poor, will you buy this kitten? .It is a trood Catholic kitten"". The priest replied "" No, my little fellow, it is no good to me; I could not buy it"". There the matter ended for the time being. About a month later the priest and the minister were again in consultation on the same matter at the minister's house. Again there was a knock at the door. AVhen it was opened, the minister was confronted by the same little boy with the identical kitten, which, of course, was then somewhat bigger. upon being asked whether he would buy the kitten, replied ""I do not want it, my little fellow"". The boy said ""It is a Mr Stacey. good Protestant kitten "". The priest, who had come on the scene, said to him "" Is not that the kitten that you tried to In addition, New South sell to me a month ago "" ? The boy replied, Yes, sir "". The priest said, "" Did you not then say it was a good Catholic kitten "" ? and the boy replied "" Yes, sir "". The priest asked him "" Why, then, do you now say that it is a good Protestant kitten "" ? and the reply that he received was "" It has its eyes opened now "". Thai is what has happened to the honourable gentleman; he has had his eyes opened in regard to this matter. Several honourable members have mentioned drought as a State disability. I do not regard that as the disability of a particular State, because any State is liable to become drought-stricken. I support the grant recommended 'by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and am in favour of the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) amount granted during the last five years, and that that should be given for the next five years. A good deal of expense would thus be avoided, and the claims of the different States would be met in a fair and reasonable manner. We should be big enough in mind to realize that, now convinced being members of a federation, one State are merely askshould assist another; we should work as a Commonwealth, in a Commonwealth, for a Commonwealth. The honourable member for Wide Bay stated that South Australia had flourished and had balanced its budget. I agree with him. South Australia was the first State The priest answered the to balance its budget during the yeai'3 of the depression, and to enable it to do so, the people suffered silently under the overburden of taxation. That reflects great credit on them. The honourable member also alleged that the Premier of South Australia had stood in the way of help being given to secondary industries. No man in Australia has tried to do more to assist in the establishment of secondary industries in any State than has the Premier of South Australia. Many industries in South Australia were closed after the establishment of federation. The minister, The need for the decentralization of industry in Australia has been discussed in this House on more than one occasion, and I am in accord with it. not only for defence purposes but also for otker reasons. should help the smaller Statesi n every possible way to ha\e some secondary industries established, especially for defence £2,000,000 for the financial year 193S-39, purposes. South Australia is now better equipped than it was some years ago to engage in secondary industries, and until it is assisted by the Commonwealth to bring this about I fail to see how it can be other than a drag on the rest of the States. It is not a mendicant State; it asks, not for a dole, but for it3 rights. That is realized by 95 per cent, or more of honourable members of this House. I hope that the Government will strike an average of the amounts paid to the three claimant States over the last five years, and make that amount available each year for the next three or five years. I support the bill, and hope that honourable members will recognize the justice of the grant that is sought. is not the first occasion on which we have been asked to consider legislation, designed to assist what may be described as the three weaker States, and I am afraid that for many years to come the Commonwealth Parliament will be called upon to assist them. The matter is here dealt with in one measure, whereas formerly the case of each State could be debated separately, which is preferable. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was constituted in July, 1933, with a view to considering applications by States for financial assistance. commissioners were appointed, one being a South Australian-Si r Wallace Sandford, who has recently been returned to the Legislative Council of that State. I said on a previous occasion that in my opinion he had done valuable work on tlie commission. When be relinquished his position, I voiced the view that another South Australian should be appointed, and I regret that that was not done. The matter of adjustments among the different States has been very fully investigated, and I have read with a good deal of interest the reports that have been presented from time to time. I nropose to deal, not with Tasmania or Western Australia, but more particularly with the State that I have the honour to represent. On this occasion, the commission has recommended a grant of Jiven New South Wales £i,.04U,UOO in the case of South Australia. The dtovernment of that State claimed from the Commonwealth something like and supported its claim up to the hilt with facts and figures which clearly show that it was fail' and just. o It is, therefore, regrettable that the commission did not see fit to be more reasonable in its recommendation. Each year since 1928, 1 have participated in a debate of this character. The outstanding feature in connection with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is that the amount claimed has never been granted, although the claims have always been supported by audited figures. I agree that the object in setting up the commission was to make a thorough investigation throughout Australia. 1 have felt on numerous occasions that the commission had not done the fair thing by my State. I hope that, as time goes on, we may be able to evolve a new method of calculation to determine the payments that should be ' made to the different States. Under the provisions'of the Constitution, the States have a perfect right to expect the Commonwealth to pay to them a proportion of its surplus revenue. We know that Commonwealth revenue, is buoyant at the moment. The Commonwealth enjoys many rich sources of revenue, and it is only natural that when it has a bountiful year it should be approached by the necessitous Three States for assistance. It cannot be denied that the three claimant States have been passing through difficult times financially. The position is improving in South Australia, where the State finances are now on a sound basis, Jind every endeavour is being made by the Government to balance the budget. In this regard, South Australia has set an example to the other States. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), speaking last night, openly and blatantly advocated secession for Western Australia. I have interests in Western Australia, and know the views of many people there. I do not think that a great many people in Western Australia seriously desire that State to secede from the Commonwealth. That would be a retrograde step, and the real",24,Casey
91,Mr Price (Boothby) [11.53],"Thispurpose of the secession movement was, I am convinced, to obtain greater Commonwealth assistance than had been previously forthcoming.

It will be necessary, therefore, to make up the difference hy means of extra taxation, and that in a State which, at the present time, is taxed to the limit. Last week, Parliament was discussing the Commonwealth works programme for 193S-39, and I was surprised to learn that very little of the large amount of money which it is proposed to expend has been allocated to South Australia. We should endeavour to spread such activities as far as possible over thu whole of Australia. Many of the works in the programme with which we dealt last week could have been allocated to the smaller States. If that were done, the time would eventually arrive when the claimant States would cease to be a burden on the other States. The same prin. ciple of the distribution, of expenditure should be adhered to in regard to defence undertakings also. It would then not be necessary for the smaller States to come, cap in hand, to the Commonwealth for assistance. South Australia is not a grasping State; it applies' to the Commonwealth for assistance only when it is forced to do so. However, when we have a claim, we make no apologies for pressing it. It is laid down in the Constitution the Commonwealth to all the States. There that we have a right to Commonwealth assistance, and we ask Parliament to pass this bill as speedily as possible. I should have been very pleased if it made provision for a larger grant for South Australia, but wo are thankful for small mercies. There is on the notice-paper a hill to set up an Inter-State Commission, and I hope it, too, will be passed. representative of one of the States which has arrived when we should make a review will not participate in these grants, 1 accept the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Its report is a comprehensive survey of the financial and economic position in the various States. Whilst it is .not clear how the commission arrived at some of its conclusions, it would be very difficult South Australia is to suggest another formula which would ensure results as equitable. The honor, able member for Boothby( Mr Price) stated that one of the results of the failure South Ausof the commission to give South Australia the full amount of £2,000,000 for which it asked would be that taxation in that State would have to be increased. I draw attention to the fact that State taxation in South Australia is, according to th& report of the commission, only £6 2s. 9d. a head, while the average taxation a head for all the States is £6 12s. 6d. tion as it is to-day, because, we are making the grants to-day.

After listening to the arguments of honourable members, I realize that the claimant Statesare faced with certain difficulties as the result of federation. I remind honourable members, however, that the grants provided in this bill are only part of the contribution which the Comanonwealth makes to the States. Last year, in addition to the grants made to the claimant States as such, nearly £17,000,000 was granted by is a great danger in the making of grants by one public body to another.

94,Mr Jolly,"We must take the posiof the present system of national, State, and civic government. The commission itself suggests that, in addition to considering the position of the States and the Commonwealth, it is necessary, in order to arrive at a true realization of the economic position of Australia, to consider also the position of the various local governing bodies. The other day I pointed out that the various local and semi-governmental bodies in Australia are raising and spending as much loan money as are the State governments. The activi* ties of the national^ State, and civic governments are becoming more and more interwoven. There is frequent conflict of authority on money matters, overlapping of activities, and duplication of social services, a condition of affairs which is not conducive to the proper development of the Commonwealth. It is essential, for instance, that we should huve uniform, industrial and social conditions throughout Australia. The honourable member for Boothby has been advocating-and I agree with him-that there should be a more equitable distribution of secondary industries throughout Australia, but one of the first requirements is that we should have uniform industrial conditions. The making of Commonwealth grants, no matter how generous, to necessitousStates, will never solve the problem. It is clear from the report of the commission, and from the debate which has taken place, that we must prepare for the day when we shall have one government in Australia to speak and aot for all the people. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr South Australia has reduced company Prowse) suggested that Western Australia should break away from the Commonwealth, but I believe that it would be a sorry day for Western Australia if it did. for the other States, perhaps. would be in the best interests of Australia as a whole if there were but one government. ber only wants to get rid of the Queensland Labonr Government. at all. Let me inform the honourable member that manv of those associated with his own party in Queensland are in favour of unification. I believe that if that question were put to the people, there would be an overwhelming vote in favour of one government for one people. is regrettable that the system of States grants still continues, but in the absence of any alternative we must accept it. In view of the obvious disabilities which the smaller States suffer, no one in the eastern States will object to their receiving grants, but the main reason why I rise to speak on this question is to say that one of the most regrettable features of this debate is the fact; that some honourable members who represent States which are receiving assistance have attacked Australian secondary industries. It is the existence of those secondary industries which enables tliese grants to be made; it is really the secondary industries which provide a home market at enhanced prices, that goes a long way to enable the primary industries to be carried on at a profit. We must have co-operation between the two. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) made some criticism of the profits which were made by General Motors-Holdens Limited in South Australia. I am not aware of the net profits of this concern, nor do I champion excessive profits, but the Taxation Department will find those profits and the profits of all successful companies acceptable, hecause the taxes on them will help the budgetary position of Australia, and enable the rate of taxation to be kept down. I do not champion any particular company, but I know that the Government of taxation. -Noi one man in South Australia would raise his voice against the motor body-building industry. The Premier of South Australia and many other public men advocate the development of secondary industries in South Australia, in order to encourage their establishment; in fact, the State Parliament has decided upon a system of grants. I sympathize with the honourable member for Forrest in his effort to develop the wheat industry, but the position to-day is that, as the result of economic nationalism in Europe, the former purchasers of Australian wheat now grow their own crops, resulting in a reduction of imports from Australia.

Three menioers of the Ministry recently went to Lonaon to engage in trade negotiations. They returned convinced that, if we are to develop Australia and maintain and expand our population, we must give more support to industries. Country party ( Sir Earle Page) himself made a most impressive speech in which he stated that we must import less and manufacture more. I regret in these circumstances that certain honourable gentlemen have made attacks upon the -secondary industries which largely provide the means by which the States they represent enjoy these Commonwealth grants. -Provision for the smaller State governments is the necessary result of any composite form of government which devolves an important part of the functions of goby the central parliament. The scheme vernment upon local bodies. The various States, for instance, have a system of municipal grants in aid. Great Britain has it and the States of Australia have adopted it. The units of municipal government are varying. and administer areas of different size3, of Zealand. Australia is one nation and different populations, and of different resources; yet they have to perform pretty well the same functions in respect of those different areas. Their ability *to raise revenue also varies; consequently only scheme of State aid consistent the central government, which in relation to them is the State Government, makes grants to them out of the revenue of the State. That policy is a necessary result of the existence of local government. In the same way a necessary result of the existence of composite government, whether it be a unitary State such a3 they hfve in South Africa, or a Federal State like Australia and Canada, is that the central government, having the greatest powers of taxation, and the greatest control over revenue, should make grants to the subordinate governments. ji«t because they govern separate romrmi-niiips at all. not because the comthe mainland, Labrador, which was given posito Rta+e is to he regarded as a partnership of separate eoimrnr""i+ies. ^""t hecause it is th» one oommunitv which Stales Grants [REPRESEN TATIV ES. | Bill 1938. has been created. There are different tunouons of government, and those functions of government have sometimes been entrusted to a central body and sometimes to regional bodies such as States or provinces, call them what you will. The one nation of Australia is not governed by one Parliament and one administration; it is unthinkable that it could be. The altersecondary native to federation would be unification The Leader of the with a unitary State on"" South African lines where the regional governments are the delegates of the central government, and where .part of the powers of government are delegated to the regional governments which are subordinate to the central government. The only difference between the federal and unitary systems is that in the unitary state the distribution of powers can always be revised by the central parliament, whereas in the federal state it cannot be. In South Africa, subject to certain reservations, the distribution of powers to the provinces can always be revised, but in the Australian scheme the distribution cannot be revised which operates in New Zealand was composite up to 1876, and a revision was made in 1S76, when the several provincial assemblies were abolished They control by the General Assembly of New there ought, not to he distinctions between the States except as bodies which are entrusted with local-governing functions. That is why I think that the with the indivisible and indissoluble nationality of Australia must base distributions on need and not on ideas of disabilities suffered under federation. No one can tell what disabilities any State's inhabitants have suffered, because no one can establish what position they would be in if they had not entered the federation. Newfoundland did not enter into the Dominion of Canada and its history should not encourage any State of Australia to say that it would be better outside of the federation. Newfoundland is not only bankrupt, but it is also unable to develop its territory on to it. We have heard a great deal about the disabilities which Western Australia, suffers in having been coerced",28,Casey
100,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) 112.20].,"into joining the federation. In some degree that is true, but the people who say these things conveniently forget that for years and years Western Australia consistently voted for enlargement of the powers of the Commonwealth Government. In 1911, Western Australia alone voted for a wide extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Government. In 1913, it voted again with South Australia for a wide extension of the Commonwealth powers, and again in 1919, thus indicating quite clearly that the people of Western Australia had a strong sense of the necessity for the federal union, and a strong sense pf the desirability of having the functions of the Western Australian Government diminished. It is a fact that the States have important functions of government to perform and that they differ in resources and revenue that makes these grants necessary. How are the States efficiently to discharge the functions committed to them by the federal scheme? The Constitution makes provision for the States and the Commonwealth. Both are creatures of the 'Constitution, the only difference being that there was no machinery ready, at hand to be put into use for the central organ, so it was that the framers of the Constitution spent most . energy and time in creating a scheme of central government. then said, ""There are existing machines of the old colonial government and, subject to this Constitution, these can be used with no immediate alteration at all for the States"". Thus we find in-the course of time that this position arises: The same functions must be discharged throughout Australia. If Australia is to be efficiently and properly governed there must he an efficient educational system in Western Australia, and in Tasmania as well as in New South Wales and Victoria. There must be an efficient local governing system in the poorer States as well as in the big States. Tho people of Australia, if the national system is to be really federal, must get from the governments the same benefits and protection all over Australia. Therefore this system of grants-in-aid came in ; this lead to the corruption of smaller States. system of distributing federal revenue among the States came in, and the only way in which it can be fair and true to national principles is to distribute according to the needs of the various Statesnot according to the needs of the people of the States, but according to the necessity for the State government to finance such schemes as will distribute social services and benefits equally all over Australia. Tliat is why the Grants Commission bases its recommendations properly upon the needs of the State governments and not upon the disabilities which the people of any State have suffered-wit h the object of helping the State governments to discharge those necessary functions of government which the Constitution has committed to them. They are not independent of the Constitution; they are not sovereign States; they are creatures of the Constitution as is this Parliament of ours. It is very proper that the duty of assessing on the needs of the various States should be entrusted to a commission. I am not very keen about commissions. I believe that one of the greatest evils of our system is that we have entrusted legislative powers to commissions. We have delegated to commissions not merely the task of advising us but also that of making decisions.. When a commission has made a decision we are told in this House, "" This matter has been investigated by a commission which knows more about it than we can know, and all They that we can do is accept the recommendation "". I do not agree with that at all, but if there is one kind of commission which is deserving of more consideration than another it is the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Before. we had this commission, at elections we would find candidates, very often Ministers, coming forward in Tasmania and saying that they were entitled to be returned to Pa -liament hecause of the great sums of money they had got, for their State. I remember one former Minister of State who was pictured bearing in his hand an immense bag labelled so many hundred thousand pounds, which was represented as having been granted to Tasmania. A system which permits that sort of thing to happen is dangerous, in that it may That was the great disadvantage which I saw. The Commonwealth Government might, by such means, attach certain smaller States to itself. became very much increased under tlie Financial Agreement, by which the Loan Council was clothed with greater powers than formerly. Agreement, each State has one vote and the Commonwealth Government has two votes. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, might by its treatment ""of, say, the States of Western Australian and Tasmania, attach those States to itself by making la.rge grants to them, and so control the Loan Council. It was for that reason that I opposed the Financial Agreement. under discussion in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, I pointed out that what we feared, myself and others, was that under it the Commonwealth Government might attach to itself, as subordinates or vassals, the governments of Western Australia and Tasmania, and so control the council. I am not pure that something of that kind is not taking place to-day. At any rate, hut for the existence of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the danger of it would be there. Those who talk about the disabilities of certain States should remember that such remarks arc inconsistent, with the idea of Australia as one nation. There is actually no community of Western Australia, or of Tasmania, or of Queensland or of any State. There is one community of Australia. That community is controlled hy the Australian Parliament and the State parliaments. These parliaments together control the whole Commonwealth. and State parliaments alike are the creatures of the Commonwealth Constitution. The State parliaments and State governments exercise their functions in territories which differ very greatly as to population, resources and circumstances. The State Government of Western Australia, on the one hand, has a measure of control over a very large territory, but a very small population. .It, has an enormous task to develop the undeveloped territory of that State. Government of Tasmania, on the otlier hand, has a relatively small territory and a small population. that State are less than the resources of the States on the mainland. But the Mr Blackburn. Thajb danger State Parliament is required to perform the same functions as the parliaments of the other States. It is charged with the responsibility of providing the people Under the Financial with the same standard of education as is given to the people on the mainland, and also the same standard of justice, of local government and of social services. It is not desirable that the standard of the people of Tasmania should be lower than that of, say, the people of Victoria. The Commonwealth Parliament, with its unlimited power to collect revenue, and its exclusive When the agreement was authority over certain fields of taxation, must come to the aid of certain State governments/not on a merely money basis, and not even on the basis of the needs of the inhabitants of certain States, but iu order to ensure that the people of all the States of Australia shall be able to live on similar standards. For this purpose it may need to make monetary grants to certain States. It seems to me to be useless to embark upon the problem of ascertaining the disabilities from which the people of each State suffer. In my opinion, Tasmania is better off as the result of federation. This appears to me to be quite obvious. It is a good thing for Tasmania, for example that the industrial laws of the Commonwealth have application in Tasmania. The workers of Tasmania have thus had the benefit of Commonwealth industrial enactments. Had it not been so, I can conceive of two things happening. If Tasmania had been separated from the remainder of Australia cither Commonwealth the Tasmanian Legislature, by a process of unfair competition, would have attempted to attract industries to Tasmania by fixing lower industrial standards than those of the mainland, or the working people of Tasmania would have been attracted to the mainland by the prospect of higher wages and better employment. Por this reason I say that the union of Australia in the federation has. been of advantage to the peonlo of Australia as a whole. The State The attitude of the people of Western Australia for a great many years was. certainly, that even if they had been The resources of forced into the union they had -drawn great advantage from it. if they suffered any disadvantage it was because their territory was so large tliat the State Gowould have suffered considerable losse3 vernment could not, with the limited financial resources of the State, carry out its State functions effectively. The cure for this was the transfer of State functions to the Commonwealth Government, not the taking away of federal functions from the .Commonwealth Government and the giving of them to the State governments. The Commonwealth Government has a duty to perform to draw upon the general resources of the Commonwealth to enable State governments to perform tlieir functions. Air. PROWSE -The honourable member ought to a3k for a plebiscite on that subject. Air. BLACKBURN 1 did not regard the secession plebiscite in Western Australia as a very remarkable or overwhelmwhole of which I can agree. I refer to ing expression of opinion. That plebiscite the remarks of the honourable member for was really an organized attempt, not to secure the release of Western Australia from the federation, because I do not think that the people of Western Australia really expected that they could obtain that freedom, but to secure further graphical and not party lines. concessions. We all know that attempts have been made, over and over again, by certain provinces to free themselves of membership in federations. That has been true of Nova Scotia for example. Such attempts rarely succeed. No one contemplated that Western Australia really desired to withdraw from the Australian Commonwealth. What was contemplated was that, as the result of the secession campaign, Western Australia would obtain special concessions. It is my settled opinion that the secession referendum was merely a process of polite blackmail upon the Commonwealth Parliament and the people of Australia as a whole. Personally I very much regret, that the British Parliamentary Committee did not investigate the claims of Western Australia. I believe that had those claims been examined in the light of the history of Western Australia it would have been seen that Western Australia had benefited very greatly from, federation and that any disabilities that the State inh„ have suffered had been exaggerated. I do not think that the people of Western Australia would have got anything by secession that they have not already got, and T believe that they had they withdrawn from the federation. [12.40] -M I reply-The debate on this bill has proceeded, not upon party lines, but upon geographical lines. We have had the spectacle of honourable members who represent three States ranging themselves, irrespective of their parties, against the representatives of other States, and some have discovered themselves with strange bedfellows. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney), for example, has found himself in remarkable unanimity with the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), and the honourable member for Forrest (Air. Prowse). Aloreover I have just listened to a most interesting speech by an honourable member of the Opposition with almost the Bourke( Mr Blackburn), which caused frowns and lines to appear on the faces of the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Forrest. These lines, again, were due to conflict on geoAir. BLACKBURN -They were parallels of latitude! Air. CASEY -In the course of the debate there has not been any very great disagreement with the findings of tbe Commonwealth Grants Commission, or with the decision of the Government in relation to those findings. One thought, has, however, been common to quite a few of the speakers. The Leader of the Opposition (Air. Curtin) and some other honourable gentlemen practically suggested that the Government should adhere to the pot-shot method of dealing with this problem. Air. Curtin -That remark was utterly uncalled for. WhatI said was that we. should now be able to fix the grant for some period ahead, basing the amount upon the average of the recommendations in the last five reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. There is no pot shot about that. Air. CASEY I think it was tlie Leader of the Opposition himself who used the words ""pot shot"". I invito honourable members to cast tlieir minds back a few years. I have ventured to do this, by deputy, and I have discovered",29,Casey
101,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer )that the criticism of the grants made to various claimant States was of a very much more acid nature before the Commonwealth Grants Commission was appointed than it has been since. Previous to the appointment of the commission, the Commonwealth Treasurer, with the hcl"" of Treasury officials, endeavoured to determine what would be a fair amount to grant to each claimant State. No one could say, however, that there was any really logical or reasoned basis for calculating the grants in those days. They were, in fact, pot shots; and I can well imagine that the representatives of the claimant States would regard these potshot, grants as illogical and unfair. know that the officers of his department were fortified, even in those days, by the recommendations of tw o royal commisT sions, and also by the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, which made a close investigation into the disabilities of Tasmania. those circumstances. But neither the royal commissions nor the Public Accounts Committee could discover any definite principles upon which the grants should be made. No principles whatever emerged from their inquiries. In that respect the work of the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been very valuable. commission during the last five years have evolved some definite principles, and I think they have also enabled all of us to understand, with a great deal more clarity, the financial relations of the Comgrants to the States would probably be monwealth to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. If the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition were adopted and grants made over a period of years on the basis of the average grants of the last five years, I have no doubt that a certain amount of dissatisfaction would soon be noticed. accept the findings of the Commonwealth ""E have dealt with "" strange bedfellows,'' Grants Commission during the last five with the ""lines on the forehead of the years, and use them as the average for Chairman of Committees,"" and also with the grants for a specified term, in order to the heading "" pot shot"". I would like, if avoid the two years' lag which is now I may, to emphasize for a moment what being experienced. itself admits that this lag is a disadvantage. I did not criticize the commission. [ really suggested that we should accept and profit by the results of its work, so that the grants to the claimant States could be stabilized. right word. Possibly the representatives of the claimant States would be glad to agree to grants on the basis of the average of the last five years, but I do not know that that would be a fair basis, for they had been years of emergence from depression conditions, and possibly the grants on that account have been more substantial than they would have been in average years. If that basis were adopted the claimant States might receive a good many hundred thousand pounds more than they would otherwise obtain. It would probably suit them, therefore, to crystallize the grants on the basis suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, but I do not think that procedure would' be fair to the other States, which, in a large measure, have to find the money for the grants. Moreover, I believe that that policy would cause a great deal more dissatisfaction than if the claims of the States were assessed year by year as the result of some logical, careful and unbiased examination of State accounts. It has been said that the Commonwealth Grants Commission gave up all attempts to base grants on disabilities. That subject was dealt with in the report presented by the commission two years ago, in which it was pointed out that very considerable investigations had been made into the alleged disabilities of certain States due to Commonwealth policy. The commission also added that the very much lower on the disabilities basis, than on the needs basis, which had been actually adopted.

Canada during the last twelve months very great interest has been manifested in the means adopted by Australia to endeavour to find a solution of the matters aifecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. The Canadian Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the relations of the provincial governments and the dominion government.

I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer ( Mr John Lawson) if he were prepared to ask his colleagues to withdraw the bill and introduce another in its place which would provide for . the making of a grant to Tasmania equal to the amount provided last year. I have not heard any arguments advanced either by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) or by the Parliamentary Secretary justify the imposition of the cut in the grant to Tasmania this year. No such heavy cuts have been made in the grants to other States since the Commonwealth Grants Commission was appointed. The grant to Tasmania seems to be subject to sliding scale reduction. Honourable members, I feel sure, are all agreed that that State has suffered very severely from the effects of federal policy; it has been most outstanding in that respect. outstanding State in the Commonwealth. ing the position very closely and I am satisfied that a certain amount of potshotting has been indulged in in connection with the method adopted by the commission in calculating the proposed grants. The Treasurer himself has admitted tliat it is practically impossible to than it received before the constitution of arrive at a.n exact basis for ascertaining tbe disabilities of the various States. I ask in fairness to the Tasmanian people that the grant to Tasmania be increased to the amount provided last year. If the grant is progressively reduced each year a time will eventually come when it will be wiped out altogether. It will he remembered that, on a former occasion, when the commission recommended a grant of £70,000 for forestry purposes in Tasmania, the Treasurer said that the Government was not obliged to accept the commission's recommendation. In view of that I think he should now consider withdrawing the bill and substituting it by another providing for an increased grant to the island State. It would be appreciated very much by the Tasmanian people if the honourable gentleman would intimate that he is prepared to use his discretion in this matter and not accept the commission's recommendation in regard to the grant for Tasmania. After listening to the remarks of other honourable members. I feel certain that no opposition would be raised against such a proposal.

The Treasurer of Tasmania lauded in the public press the work, the fairness, and the unbiased attitude with which the Commonwealth Grants Commission had approached its task, and I am quite sure that he would not be prepared to eat his words as the result of what has happened in the last month or two. I also point out that Tasmania is unique among the claimant.

I say this so that it may be understood that, while I differ from the commission in respect of certain of its conclusions, I none the less realize, as must every student of the problem, that the commissioners have brought to the discharge of their functions very rare qualifications. I am confident that they have shown to every State a complete readiness to examine everything placed before them, and that they have done invaluable work for tlie Commonwealth in having enabled us to have a better appreciation of the true inwardness of the problem. I said earlier in the consideration of this bill that the problem remains unchanged, and I stand by that statement; hut because of all that has occurred, I should not like to leave any misunderstanding as to what I think of the personnel of the commission and of the nature of their labours.

Bill read a third time. 19 3S. Debate resumed from the 22nd June, 1938 (vide page 2,504), on motion by Mr That the bill be now rend a second time. The object of this measure is to awaken from its slumbers the Inter-State Commission. Although there is still on the statute-book an act providing for the Inter-State Commission, that body does not function because, although the act gave effect to the clear intention of the framers of the Constitution, it was held to be ultra vires. It provided that the Inter-State Commission should have judicial powers; that among other things it should have the power to prevent a State from infringing section 92 of the Constitution. That provision was considered by the High Court of Australia, which, in a majority judgment, held that the Inter-State Commission could not have judicial power conferred upon it ; that is to say, it could not exercise some of the powers for which it had been created, and could not possess -certain powers which the framers of the Constitution were confident they had given to it. The bill that we now have before us proposes to confer upon the Inter-State Commission power of two kinds, one being to make investigations of all sorts. A special kind of investigation will be « that now made by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That is the principal form of investigation which is to be entrusted to it. Apart from that, the commission is to be a sort of roving royal commission. The second function pro(Corio-Treasurer ) posed to be given is that of reviewing State railway charges and prohibiting such as it may think are undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State. The House, of course, has been referred to the provisions of the Constitution relevant to this bill. Section 51 of the Constitution gives to the Commonwealth Parliament power over trade and commerce between the States, while section 98 extends that power to State railways. Section 101 makes the following provision :-There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and admini-",35,Casey

The provisions relating to the InterState Commission had their root in the grave dissatisfaction felt in the 'nineties, and prior to that time, with the differential railway rates in the various States. Sir William Lyne, a New South Wales member of the federal convention and a member of the first Commonwealth Government, had allotted to him the task of introducing the Inter-State Commission B ill . He then said that the foundation for the Inter-State Commission had been that there had never been need for it to laid at tlie Adelaide convention, upon the do so.

Sir John Qu ck, Mr another member of the first CommonMoira, a Victorian border constituencywealth Parliament, who also had been a and Sir John Quick joined in thinking member of the federal convention, was that the bill was premature. Sir John particularly concerned about, the InterQuick proposed that the bill should be State Commission. The final form which passed, but that its operation should be the provision in respect of the Interpostponed for six months in order to impel State Commission took, was of his draftthe States towards a. f a ir settlement of ing. He shared the view that provision for the Inter-State Commission would not have been made but for the necessity io deal with differential and unfair railway rates.

H is collaborator in that bookSir Robert Garran-probabl y more than any other man has shaped the legal development of the Constitution. Giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the Commonwealth Constitution in 1926, Sir Robert, almost repeating Sir John Quick's words, saidThe only real necessity for having a provision for nn Inter-State Commission in the Constitution arises from those sections-10 2 and 104-of the Constitution, both of which nre for the protection of State railways. Tho Parliament would have power in the trade and commerce., power to deal with trade generally, but not to deal with State railways as regards preference and discrimination, except through the Inter-State Commission. Those two clauses were limitations upon.the power of the Commonwealth to deal with State railways for preference or discrimination, and the InterState Commission was set up as the guardian of tlie States in that respect, but it never functioned in that way, even while it existed. The reason it did not so function was Mr Higgins, : Thomas Kennedy-membe r for the railway problem. That fai r settlement has been made by agreement among the States, and the need which called into existence the provisions of the Constitution for the Inter-State Commission conference adopted the following resolution, moved hy Mr Dugald Thompson, a member of this House and Min'ster for It is desirable that the State governments should themselves abandon all preferential or differential rates which would be abolished by Commission Bills of 1901, maintenance expense of the appointment of He agreed with Sir John Quick, Sir William Lyne and MrH . B. Higgins, in thinking that the only thing which justified bhe existence of the Inter-State Commission was the necessity for curbing the unfair propensities of the State railways commissioners. That resolution was carried and acted upon. At 'the conference of Premiers in 1909, it was reported that Victoria, New .South Wales and Queensland had made an agreement which, while allowing to eaoh State a full measure of freedom in the development of its internal resources, precluded the imposition of special terminal rates, or the granting of rebates to influence the course of traffic in the future. That agreement still stands, and has been extended by the adhesion of South Australia. That was not the last proposal for flhe creation of an Inter-State Commission. Since then there have been other attempts Nio\ use it for other puiposes. The second hill was introduced in 1909 by the Deakin Government. It was introduced into the Senate by . Sir Robert Best, who started his speech by saying tliat the State railways commissioners had fallen into line, and that there was now no need for an Inter-State Commission to secure fair railway treatment, but he made a claim that the bill of 1909 had a different object. It wa3 mainly intended, he said, to work out the policy of New Protection, that policy by which part of the benefits of a protective tariff was to be secured for the workers. The new protection, however, had been considered by the High Court in the Bargers case just before that, and had been declared to be invalid. However, the Inter-State Commission Bill was persisted with, but before it finally disappeared some interesting remarks were made by Senator Pearce, who was then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and led the opposition to the bill. He saidUntil wo have proof Unit there is : i likeliInter-State Commission was left with hood of the railways commissioners abrogating the agreement at which they have arrived, u'e should uot be in a hurry to establish this costly commission. That was the opinion of Sir George Pearoe in 1909, and it was still the opinion of the Government in 1932, when, in answer to a question in the Senate, Sir 'George Pearce said that the Government was of the opinion that there was no need for a bill to re-constitute the Inter-State Commission. The next bill dealing with the matter was introduced by Mr W. M. Hughes, in 1912, when he was Attorney General. It became law, and nine months later the act came into force. In the course of the debate, Sir John Quick saidThe conditions that obtained when tlie convention authorized the constituting of the [nter-State Commission, mid gave it this speeia.1 class of duties, no longer exist. There is now no longer the sunie necessity for federal intervention or for work to he done by the [nter-State Commission of the kind there was when the Constitution wns adopted aud the bill oi 11)01 introduced. That is to say, the reserve power to create the Inter-State Commission had induced the State railways commissioners to make a fair agreement for the abolition of differential rates. If the reserve power was sufficient to check this evil, there was, of course, no need actually to create the Inter-State Commission. Sir John Quick, and all the other framers of the Constitution, thought that the InterState Commission would have judicial power, and Sir Edmund Barton dissented from his fellow justices on the High Court"" when they held that it did not have such power. The InterState Commission dealt with an application for an injunction against New South Wales to prevent it from stopping the free movement of wheat from State to State in alleged violation of section 92 of the Constitution. The High Court held that, as the members of the InterState Commission held office for seven years, and no longer, as prescribed by the Constitution, they could not exercise judicial powers which could be conferred only on persons who enjoyed practically a life tenure of office; that is to say, upon persons who held office for life, subject to removal on address by Parliament. After the decision of the High Court the practically nothing to do. It could not exeroise the judicial powers that Parliament had tried to give it ; it could not exercise control over the railways because there was no need for that. If the Commonwealth Government of the day had not been able to find something for it to do its members would have enjoyed the -luxury and dignity of a sinecure; but tbe Commonwealth Government got busy very quickly, and gave it a good deal of work investigating"" claims for tariff protection. The only work it did for the rest of its l if e was work of a kind now done by the Tariff Board. There was some inquiry into costs and 'prices, but, in the main, the Inter-State Commission functioned as the Tariff Board does now. The chairman was MrA . B . Piddington, K . C , formerly Mr Justice Piddington. He gave evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1926, in respect of the Inter-State Commission. His evidence was summarized by MrH . S. Nicholas, counsel assisting the commission, in this wayVou will note that Mr Justice Piddington's evidence on judicial functions states tn.it iu all probability there would seldom be need for tlie commission to investigate competitive railway freights, the chief function assigned u> it by the Constitution, ns that difficulty had been removed by agreement between the railways commissioners ""themselves. At this point I may say for the benefit of members from Western Australia who have become, curiously enough, supporters of this measure, that the only State railways system which does not support the agreement between the railways commissioners is that of Western Australia. Giving evidence before the royal commission in 1926, MrE . A . Evans, a Deputy Commissioner of Railwaysf o r Western Australia, saidl leei certain that the formation of an luter-State Commission, having for its object the control of freights and fares, and the working of the railways nf .Australia, would tend to bumper seriously the constructive policy adopted, in this State. He implored the royal commission not to encourage the re-establishment of the Inter-State Commission, because a necessary result would be that it would interfere with the running of the railways in Western Australia. Those railways were not competitive with those of other States, but they could impose special rates against goods not produced in Western Australia, just as the New Zealand railways impose special rates against goods not produced in New Zealand. so. Deputy Commissioner in Western Australia said that the railways authorities there did not want the Inter-State Commission interfering with their developmental policy. In 1919, writin g in his book Legislative Powers, Sir John Quick, who was practically the father of the Inter-State Commission, saidThe decision of the High Court involved the complete breakdown of the Iutur-Statc Commission ns originally passed by Parlia-"" ment, and it has reduced the status of the commission itself to that of an ordinary royal commission appointed to inquire and rccom mend. The usefulness of the commission ns contemplated by thu framers of the Constitution has been paralysed. That is, paralysed by the H i gh Court's interpretation of the Constitution, which interpretation still stands, and cannot be affected by this bill. If this measure is passed by Parliament, the decision by the H i g h Courti n the Wheal case w ill still remain, and for so long as it does, the commission, in the opinion of Sir Johnn Quick and other constitution*! authorities, can do no effective work. The view expressed by Sir John Quicki n 1919 is confirmed by the authors of the Casef o r Union prepared by Sir Robert Garran, Mr Keating and Mr Somerville. A t pages 26 and 27, Sir Robert Garran saysI t (the Inter-State Commission) could be brought into being by the appointment of commissioners; but, of course, tlie decision of the .High Court that it cannot be given judicial power still holds good, and under the Constitution as it stands the commission could be little more than an investigating body without effective power to deal with any abuses that might '.io disclosed. be otherwise. orable member contradicts all persons who have contended that the Inter-State Commission was intended by the Constitution to have power over interstate trade, and to correct the abuses of unfair competition. It is obvious that the InterState Commission cannot do that, though it is possible that the commission may he given investigatory powers. It may now be seen how illusory is the contention that this bill seeks to give effect to the intention of the framers of the Constitution.

The only argument that can be advanced for the re-establishment of the Inter-State Commission is that it is in the bond. We have lived, for more than one-third of a century under the Constitution, and the bond has not been observed.

Blackburn-. who have knowledge of or interest in the subject to be inquired into. One cannot refer all possible matters to the same set of persons, and expect satisfactory results. One gets the most satisfactory results by referring different matters to specially constituted bodies. There is a possibility that, by conferring upon the lnter-Stato Commission powers of investigation of matters that have no relation to trade and commerce, it may be made constitutionally impotent. The question of grants to the States has no relation to trade and commerce.

The opinion given by Sir Isaac Isaacs nearly 30 years ago was that the only powers that can be given to the Interin State Commission are powers which relate in some way to interstate Inter-State trade and commerce. Therefore, The Industries Preservaif powers which relate in some, way to trade and commerce are the only powers that can be conferred upon the individuals Inter-State Commission, an attempt to The company confer upon it other powers may mean that it cannot function at all, and it w ill Commission, not be the body contemplated by the Con: stitution.

If that were so, honorahle It is very strange that, after the long time Australian in which we have got on very well indeed without an Inter-State Commission, we Commission has never had are now asked to reconstitute one. I believe that the power to make decisions and carry out those decisions should not That be entrusted to such a body, but should Royal commissions rest with the Executive, relying upon the courts for assistance. The Constitution of the Commonwealth places us in this position. We can make laws relating to trade and commerce and the Executive can carry them out without an InterState Commission. No Inter-State Commission is necessary to carry out laws relating to trade and commerce. The only constitutional necessity for an InterState Commission-to prevent unfair railway competition by unfair differential and preferential rates-n o longer exists. The States by agreement have put an end to it. It is true that the States were pleaded with the Government on induced to act because the Commonwealth Parliament had the reserve power to create the Inter-State Commission, but, as the States are doing the work without the control of the Inter-State Commission, why create it? I remind the House that the only functions that can be exercised by the Inter-State Commission are already being done by the Conimonwealth Grants Commission and by the various royal commissions that Ave have created ad hoc. There is no need for this bill to create at considerable expense an entirely new office which is entirely unnecessary and which may be injurious to this country if the powers and functions which are so well exercised by the Commonwealth Grants Commission are exercised by a new personnel of which we knownothing. Debate (on adjourned. MENT ON COAL-FIELDS CHRISTMAS MENT. Motion (by MR. CASEY) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. [3.15] I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter of very great importance to the public at large. It is a delicate matter to discuss because of the danger of being misunderstood. I assure you, Mr Speaker, I am not making a personal attack upon any one. During the last year or so the Commonwealth Government has continually urged the workers of Australia to take to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court any matters affecting their employment that they wish to be reviewed. We, on this side of the chamber, agree that most of these matters may be dealt with effectively by the court. One matter, however, presents difficulties because of certain circumstances which I wish to discuss. I refer to the readjustment of working hours, which is to-day a burning issue with our people throughout Australia and the world. I refer to the claim for a 40-hour week. We have various occasions to deal with this matter, at least in relation to its own employees; but the Government has said very definitely that the subject must be dealt with by the Arbitration Court. One of the reasons why the workers have not been prepared to submit their"" case to the court is that Chief Judge Dethridge, in particular, has referred to it in a way that suggests that he has actually prejudged the issue. It is very regrettable that just about the time when conferences of workers' representatives were being held to consider this subject, and particularly to decide whether they would submit it to tbe Arbitration Court, a public pronouncement was made by a judge which either ridicules the claim of the workers for a shorter working week, or else sugThe repercussions of such statements can be easily understood They invariably discourage any approach to the court by the workers concerned. I am jealous of the status and authority of our ArbitraDAYS-UNEMPLOY tion Court, and I must admit that on the various occasions when I have appeared before different judges as an advocate I have been treated fairly. For this reason I think that Chief Judge Dethridge is, in this particular instance, performing a grave disservice to our whole system of arbitration when he makes definite pronouncements upon a matter before it has been presented to him. It is not as though the statements of which I shall complain have heen made after the evidence of the workers has been presented and sifted by the judges. The trouble is that these ill-judged and distasteful observations appear in the press or are made on occasions when the issue",40,Lyons

Consequently, if any single judge makes statements which appear to prejudge the issue, the workers naturally feel that they w ill not be given a f a i r deal if they submit their case to the court, because the judge has already made up his mind.

Eor this reason the Government should give serious consideration to the desirability of announcing the commencing days of the future weekly sittings. If it endeavoured question on the notice-paperto plan sitting days in advance, honourable members would be able to arrange their business in their own electorates to fit in grant to the unemployed equivalent to a fortwith their duties in this House. Any 3uch plan would be most welcome by those honourable members from distant States who wish to attend to the needs of their constituents without absenting themselves from the sittings of the House. port the remarks of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). Honourable members have to make appointments to interview their electors, but under the present unsatisfactory conditions they do not know where they stand, and consequently are unable to plan their appointments ahead. the House for at least a month ahead were announced a week ago. be changed at any time. In my opinion the Parliament is not summoned to meet often enough to deal adequately with the many intricate problems with which this country is faced. Arrangements should be made to set aside at least a couple of days for the discussion of the very vexed question of unemployment, which, in spite of its rosy promises during the elecfunds should be provided for the improvetion campaign, the Government has made no attempt to tackle. It has refused to face up to the position, preferring to aet like the ostrich, which buries its head in the sand. Government members are constantly stating that unemployment has been reduced. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), who went through my electorate some time ago, was not game enough to tell the people that unemployment had been reduced in the mining areas. The problem of unemployment in the northern coal-fields has been greatly accentuated since the 1929-30 lockout, which was brought about as the result of the mechanization of the coal industry. The electors in the mining districts have a claim to the consideration by the Government equal to that of the more fortunate people in electorates represented by Government supporters in this House. Recently, in an endeavour to ascertain if the Government proposes to provide any measure of relief for the unemployed during the Christmas season, I placed the following Does the Government propose to make, as a gesture of goodwill for Christmas, a monetary night's relief pay? The reply I received to-day wasProvision has been made in the budget this year for over £16,000,000 for expenditure on works in Australia, including the defence works. It has been necessary to budget also for an increase of ordinary expenditure this year, apart from new works, particularly in relation to the expansion of the defence forces. The provision of these moneys should make a great deal of work available, and in view of this fact the Commonwealth Government does not propose to make a monetary grant to the unemployed at Christmas. I made representations to the Government that, as it is ' not proposed to undertake any government works at Cessnock, some provision of funds should be made for relief of distress among the unemployed people of that town and of other coal-<fields towns. The Government ignored the request, and would not provide a "" razoo"". The people in these districts have suffered for a long period of years through unemployment, which is greater, having regard to population, than in any other two electorates in Australia. In an attempt to provide work for these unfortunate people, I requested that ment of Cessnock aerodrome, the unsatisfactory state of the landing ground there preventing it from being used as an intermediate stopping place by",44,Grants Newne S Shale Oil Develop

Because Cessnock, a very important centre with a population of approximately 22,000, is represented in this Parliament by a member opposing the Government, nothing is done to alleviate the distress that exists there. No attempt is even made to undertake important work such as the improvement of an aerodrome, which in time of emergency would be useful for defence purposes. In the event of war, I have no doubt that all aerodromes would be taken over by the Defence Department; but despite tlie fact that the Cessnock aerodrome is regarded as of some importance for civil aviation purposes, the Government will undertake no responsibility for its improvement, leaving it to the municipality of Cessnock to undertake that work. Adjacent to my electorate and situated in that represented by the Assistant Minister( Mr Thompson) is Port Stephens, to which a number of my constituents go when out of employment in order to supplement their dole allowance from the State Government by fishing. Recently naval and military manoeuvres were held there, but normally not a gun of any sort is provided for its protection. It is completely unprotected. An enemy coming into Port Stephens could blow up the important city of Newcastle which is only 8 or 10 miles distant by air. As I have said on other occasions, the roads leading to Port Stephens are in such bad order that it would not be possible to transport heavy guns over them for its defence. I have asked on numerous occasions that, as a means of relieving the unemployment in the mining areas, the .work of reconstructing these roads should be undertaken but to no avail. Recently when travelling from my home to CanberraI met a very high official of the Defence Dejjartment who informed me that it would not be possible expeditiously to transport troops or guns -over the roads from Newcastle to Port Stephens. Honourable members opposite have much to say about the proposed expenditure of £16,000,000 for defence purposes, but out of that huge sum the Government is not prepared to spend a penny in defence works in this or the Cessnock district as a means of relieving unemployment. Many unfortunate peojde there have been unemployed for ten years. Some of the lads at Cessnock have reached the age of 26 years and have never known what it is to do a day's work. They are not eligible for unemployment relief because of the permissible income limitations imposed by the State Government in respect of the earnings of their parents. Although the Government has disregarded the claims of these people entirely, it has at the same time meted out much better treatment to the people in those electorates in which the political fate of the sitting member is uncertain. true. electorate it was promised during the last elections that if the Government were returned to office work would be commenced at Newnes without delay. The workers were completely fooled by that promise. Work has not started there yet, and is not likely to start. I have no doubt that Avhen the next elections are imminent we shall hear a good deal about furtlier proposals for the development of Newnes. The Government hopes by promises of this sort to swing the pendulum in favour of its endorsed candidates. During the coal dispute in the northern coal-fields some years ago £100,000 was set aside by the Scullin Government for the assistance of unemployed miners. Portion of that money was expended at Newnes, but when the United Australia party subsequently came into office the balance was held in abeyance pending another election. Subsequently some of the money once more was spent there in the interests of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) who represents that district in this Parliament. Proposals for the relief of unemployment should be completely divorced from party politics. I regret that it is necessary at times to become heated over this important question, but it is necessary to do so iu order to endeavour to bring it more forcibly under the notice of the Government. The miners have just recently emerged from another coal strike. To bring about a settlement of the dispute they have had to go cap in",45,Grants Newne S Shale Oil Develop
152,Mr Casey,That is completely un,46,Grants Newne S Shale Oil Develop
153,Mr Ward,It was done in Macquarie.,46,Grants Newne S Shale Oil Develop
154,Mr James,"That is so. In thathand to the various governments in Australia. The leaders of the Miners' Federation had to fly from New South Wales and Queensland to Victoria to get the Premiers of Queensland and Victoria to agree with the Premier of New South Wales in regard to the terms of settlement. It was wholly and solely the responsibility Government by means of a conference convened under the provisions of the Industrial designed to regulate disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, but it refused to do anything, and will continue to refuse whenever that particular locality in whose interests I am nowspeaking is involved. Why? Because it knows that there is not the slightest possibility of any representative of that district "" ratting "" on the Labour movement and supporting the Government. Definitely this is a matter on which we should have a full-dress debate, because of the promises made by the present Administration The first and second Lyons Administrations asked the electors to repose confidence in the United"" Australia, party and thereby secure a good job at steady wages. Where are those good jobs at steady wages? Thousands of our people are compelled to live on a miserable dole of 8s. a week, while their womenfolk are ashamed to leave their homes because of the threadbareness of their clothing. That is not right. I have asked that decent clothing be made available for them. The Defence Department was given a Commonwealth grant of £3,000 to enable it to make provision in that direction, but the clothing which it sent to that locality was condemned by the municipalities. It consisted of boots that were worn out, and blankets covered with blood, vermin and other filth. Although the people were poor, they were clean, and they were not prepared to accept such filthy stuff. I do not say that the Treasurer was to blame; it was the fault of the Defence Department, which took advantage of the grant and supplied what was fit. only to be sent to an cern as to whether or not it affected my incinerator. When people are treated in this way, how could they be expected loyally to defend this country if it were Mr James. assailed by an enemy? They ask what there is to defend. Have they to defend a miserable dole of 8s. a week? Many of the young men who have had an advanced education are unable to obtain employment. Parents have come to me with careworn looks and have told me that, having expended practically the of the Commonwealth whole of their resources in providing to settle the trouble their children with a proper education, they have not been able to obtain a position for them in the Air Force or any Peace Act, which was other arm of defence. A statement of the qualifications and social position of those who are admitted to the Air Force would make very interesting reading. able member has exhausted his time. [3.50] -It is not my custom, in ordinary circumstances, to reply to statements made in a reckless or an irresponsible way, entirely regardless of the facts of the case; but when allegations are made, such as have just been made by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr and its predecessor. James), alleging the grossest form of corruption against the Government in negotiating an agreement with the National Oil Proprietary Company Limited for the development of the Newnes shale oil resources, and further alleging against me the grossest form of corruption in my advocacy of the development of those fields, then I feel called upon, in the interests of truth and justice, emphatically and catechetically to deny the allegations against both myself and the Government. In amplification of that denial, I would say that in not a single instance did I urge the claims of Newnes upon the Commonwealth Government because I thought that that might improve my prospects in the electorate that I represent. In fact, I think I can say quite truthfully that almost all that I said in urging the claims of Newnes upon the Government was said on the floor of this House; there was no hole-and-corner business, no crooked business, no back-door business. I was prepared to accept the decision of the Government in the matter, without conprospects either for the good or for the bad. I have never considered that the development of Newnes would help me",46,Grants Newne S Shale Oil Develop

After a further period to which it is impossible to place a prospective limit , it may be practicable to minimize the work to be done by the Wwrreen in temperate regions and concentrate for a time on the tropical regions of the east and west coasts and possibly also of the northern coast. A maximum of 12,000 miles per annum is a l l that the Warreen can cover effectively.

213,Mr Holloway Asked The Minister For,"orable member's questions are as follows :1. The present policy of the British Government is, and has always been, one of strict neutrality and non-intervention in the Spanish dispute, as it believes this policy Is in the best interests of Spain and also prevents the dispute from extending into a major conflagration. At the moment the aim of the British Government is to procure the implementation of the Non-intervention Committee's plan for the withdrawal of all foreign volunteers from Spain. 2. The Commonwealth Government stated in Parliament that its policy as regards the Spanish civil war is one of strict neutrality and non-interference in the domestic disputes of another country. notice1. How does he view the bill passed by the Tasmanian Parliament empowering the Hydro Electric Commission to borrow money merely with the consent of the State government? 2. Does this action, and the reported proposals of the Victorian Housing Board to raise £2,000,000 with the consent of the Victorian Government, mean that the ""gentlemen's agreement"" regulating semi-governmental borrowings is now a dead letter? 8. Isi t a fact that this move away from properly regulated borrowings results from the difficulty experienced by some States to get their loan requirements through the Loan Council, and that such States have consequently decided that they must borrow outside the Loan Council or abandon necessary reproductive developmental works? able member's questions are as follows:1. I am not in a position to express an opinion on the .bill referred to. I have not yet seen this bill . 2. No. Under the ""gentlemen's agreement "" all borrowings by semi-governmental bodies to the extent of £100,000 and over in any one year are required to be submitted to the Loan Council for approval. This arrangement would apply to the borrowings by any somi-goveriimontal authorities set up by State legislation. 3. I regret that I am not in a position to express an opinion as tb the reasons for the establishment of tliese new borrowing authori' ties, nor is there any indication that the creation of new borrowing authorities will make possible the raising of additional moneys by governmental and semi-governmental authorities as a whole. notice1.
