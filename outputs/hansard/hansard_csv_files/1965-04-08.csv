The representatives of the company in question saw me not very long ago. It conducts quite extensive operations in the United States of America parallel with those of the Federal Housing Administration, and has developed a number of very useful and novel financial techniques. Indirectly, its operations have had the effect of bringing into the housing field a quite large volume of investment funds that otherwise would not be devoted to housing. This matter has to be considered against the background of the fact that, over about the next 25 years, we shall build about 3 million dwelling units at a reasonably conservative estimate. In addition, we shall have the problem of financing the exchange of existing houses. In this kind of picture, there is room for many kinds of operations, and the activities of any reputable people who have useful and constructive contributions to make will be extremely welcome.

31,Mr Mcewen,"1 recall the matter toalthough he is not completely correct in representing what I said. I was proposing that at a point of time, over several years, there ought to be a multi-nation contribution of funds which could be used to purchase certain foodstuffs. I was speaking particularly of wheat, but not only of wheat, to be either given or sold on concessional terms to those who, by reason of their exchange position or need, require such treatment. This idea has been canvassed. I was taking the view partly that while the needs of such people must be recognised and ought to be attended to, the responsibility should not fall only on those countries which produce an item, such as wheat, in surplus, but that all the wealthier countries should join together. I suggested that those who grow wheat in surplus might be doing the right thing to those in need and would be making an appropriate contribution if they were prepared to sell wheat to such an international organisation for this purpose at something less than the going commercial price at the time. This was the general thesis that I have been speaking of for some three years now. To bring the matter to a point, I may say to the House that there is now scheduled a resumption of the discussions in the G.A.T.T. Kennedy Round in what is known as the Cereals Group where discussions on international arrangements for wheat will recommence. Australia will be represented at these discussions by the permanent head of the Department of Trade and Industry, the deputy secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, the permanent head of the Department of Primary Industry and other officers who left last weekend to go overseas. They will convey the policy suggestions of the Australian Government. They will enter into negotiations with other countries, both producers of wheat in surplus and those who may be described as importers of wheat, but comparatively rich countries; and part of the discussions that they will advance, authorised by the Government, will be in conformity with this general thesis that the honourable member has referred to.

Tbis is particularly another. The Government has no intention of removing them. Secondly, proceedings before the Commonwealth Industrial Court under sections 1D9 and 111 should be used only as a last resort. Thirdly, the Government wishes, in its positive approach to industrial relations to encourage responsible discussions between the parties when claims are made, and wants to encourage the parties to take full advantage of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It is axiomatic that conciliation is to be preI think it is necessary that we keep the perspective. In fact they have a minor me demonstrate this.

56,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister for used: The number of strikes per annumso where there is highly developed machinery for determining wages and conditions of employment. In some cases real grievances have existed. Most cases which have led ultimately to resort to the sanctions provisions have involved claims for more than the award provided. There have been cases where advantage has been taken of the shortage of labour to make irresponsible and excessive demands. In other cases industrial issues have been the cloak for the promotion of dubious political objectives. It is not surprising that, faced with some situations, employers have felt obliged to resort to the sanctions provisions. I often hear the argument that the mere resort to the sanctions provisions, let alone their existence, contributes to industrial unrest. This is the type of propaganda which seeks to confuse the symptom with the illness. What is necessary is that an attempt should be made to cure the illness. It will not be denied that in some industrial disputes individual employers have failed to show the wisdom of Solomon. Even Solomon would not have sustained his reputation if he had had to deal with the thorny problems which arise in the field of industrial relations. As a Government, faced with the responsibility of protecting the community's interest, our problem has been to seek a solution which will, first, encourage responsible discussions when claims are made and, as necessary, resort to the conciliation machinery provided for by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; secondly, therefore reduce the risks of work stoppages; and fourteen days or such longer period as the thirdly, therefore reduce the need for resort Commission has determined must elapse to sanctions. Let me make it clear that the Bill is based Commission in its conciliation function felt on the assumption that reasonable people that it was possible to settle the dispute it should act responsibly. Conciliation can only would clearly be sensible to allow the necesfunction in these circumstances and whether sary extra time. In this situation, the Comor not it is between the parties directly conmission would doubtless expect assurances cerned or is done with the aid of a conciliaof sensible behaviour on both sides and partor. Of course conciliation involving the ticularly so that work would proceed. most responsible people may lead to stalemate. It may lead to a stalemate because there is no infallible reason why claims the Commission to act in a particular way. should always be conceded in whole or in As I have said the Commission's function part. If there is merit in the claim then there will largely be one of conciliation. It could is a reason for meeting it in whole or in be that the Commission is so well informed part. This Bill deals only with a situation where clusion that there is nothing useful it can a breach of an award has not occurred. If do. In some circumstances, it could be that one side or the other has decided, in effect, to take the law into its own hands it must take the consequences. The consequences of such actions are those for which the existing legislation provides. In contrast, if there is a claim with the threat of a strike or some other form of direct action but not an actual breach, this Bill will apply. It says in effect that tbe Commonwealth Industrial Court cannot commence to hear an application for an injunction against somebody from committing a breach or non-observance of an award unless it is satisfied that three conditions have been fulfilled. The first condition is that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been notified that a breach or non-observance is likely to occur. The second is that that notification was given without delay or, where there is delay, the Commission has certified that there is reasonable cause for it. We do not base our thinking on the assumption that where an argument starts the employer must immediately notify the Commission. The employer may very well consider that given the opportunity for discussion with the union the threatened breach will not eventuate. With this in mind, if the employer commences discussions and they are abortive, then the employer should not be denied his remedy simply because he has failed to notify the Commission when the matter first arose. This is the sort of situation in which the Commission would certify that there was reasonable cause for the delay in giving the notification. The third condition is that a period of since the notification was given to the Commission. What is in mind is that if the The Bill does not place any obligation on of the circumstances it can draw the conthe situation would justify the exercise of an arbitral function. To this third condition there is a proviso. It is that the period of fourteen days shall not apply if the applicant for the injunction is able to satisfy the Industrial Court that the breach or nonobservance is likely to occur within the next ten days. This proviso is another aspect of what I said a moment ago-that what we are trying to do is to provide for reasonable people behaving responsibly. If a union has no intention of giving any opportunity for conciliation, whether outside, or with the assistance of, the Commission, then the employer against whom the threat is made should not be deprived of his remedy. Honourable members will notice that the Bill places no compulsion on a party to notify the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at all. If the party does not, then of course he cannot secure an injunction against the threatened breach or nonobservance of the award. When in fact there is a breach, the party aggrieved will have the remedy of an injunction against continued breach or a mandamus to observe the award. In this case a party taking action under section 109 for such an injunction or mandamus will not be entitled to his costs. This will be covered by regulation under provisions included in the Bill relating to the making of regulations as to costs. It will be an incentive to notify the Commission of any threatened breach. While on the subject of costs-and clauses 8 and 14 are relevant-it is proposed, when the regulations are being made, to provide first, that in order that a party should be encouraged to make the maximum use of the processes of conciliation as envisaged by this Bill, no costs will be allowed where action is taken under section 109 in respect of a threatened breach and the breach does not take place. Secondly, it is also proposed that costs of representation in relation to proceedings under sections 109 and 111 will be limited to junior counsel unless the Indusmay be situations, for example, in the trial Court considers that issues of such a nature are involved that the use of senior counsel is justified. These proposals as to costs should be seen as an integral part of our approach to the whole problem. If matters get to the contempt stage then clearly the party in contempt should carry the full responsibility. Our proposals limiting costs to those of junior counsel, except where special circumstances exist, are based on our study of past practice. They will remove any justification for the argument that costs of sanctions proceedings have been deliberately inflated by use of senior counsel. It may be said that the provisions of the Bill do no more than lay down the sort of practice that is followed by those employers and unions who now behave responsibly. Our objective is that this legislation will provide the opportunity for all employers and all unions to behave more responsibly. The Bill seeks to remove obstacles, either real or imaginary, in the way of the Act's functioning in accordance with its expressed objectives contained in section 2 of the Act. It will expand the opportunities for those genuinely interested in the conduct of industrial relations to pursue and protect their interests in a spirit of responsibility. No comfort will be found in this Bill by those in the industrial relations area who advocate or resort to direct action for the achievement of their claims. I have now dealt with the principal provisions of the Bill; that is to say, the provisions that appear in clauses 6, 8 and 14. Tbe Bill also tidies up certain provisions of the legislation and deals with some procedural problems. I need only refer to some of these. Clause3 and clauses 9 to 12 deal with the Inspectorate under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and facilitate the recovery of sums due under awards. We have inspectors who are officers of my Department and we have arrangements with some of the States under which State labour inspectors perform inspection functions under our legislation. The Bill takes power to enable the Minister for Labour and National Service to authorise officers of the Public Service of: the Commonwealth other than of my Department to perform the duties of an inspector under the Act. There Northern Territory where it would be much more convenient to use officers of the Department of Territories as inspectors rather than have officers of my Department stationed tbere. This would, of course, involve agreement with the Minister concerned. The Act, as it now stands, prevents inspectors taking action in respect of a breach of an award, including recovery of wages if proceedings are not commenced within six months of the breach of an award. In complicated cases this is sometimes too short a period to allow inspectors to complete their investigations. So the amendment made by clause 9 will permit proceedings to be commenced at any time within twelve months after the commission of the breach. The second provision to which I want to gation to register initially under the Act, to refer is found in clause 4. Under section notify the Department of Immigration 44A of the Act the President may, in the annually, at a specified time, of their circumstances there described, constitute a address, occupation and marital status. This joint session of the Commission where requirement will replace the present obligabenches differently constituted have before tion to notify a change of address or occuthem common matters for consideration.

The present proof Australia's alien population to enable vision does not authorise a joint session the Government to implement its immigrawhere matters under section 33 such as the tion policy on sound and scientific lines. basic wage are concurrently before the Commission with reference of appeals. Honourable members will remember that in 1964 the President found a device for meeting this problem. In 1964 the basic wage bench was composed of four presidential members and the total wage bench of the same four presidential members and a lay commissioner. The lay commissioner .sat in as an observer to hear argument that was common to both cases. This device met the circumstances; it was, however, contrived. The Bill's provisions will enable this type of case to be dealt with without resort to such an artifice. They will also permit the President to constitute a joint session whenever as initial registrations are concerned, as there are matters common to different prothese are effected under official supervision. ceedings before different elements of the However, the degree of failure to notify Commission and the President considers a subsequently a change in address or occujoint session would facilitate the hearing and pation is high, despite endeavours to endeliberations of these matters.

The Register of Aliens is complete so far far less accurate than is desirable, so far as the current address and occupation of the check has confirmed this. However, to",21,Conciliation And Arbitration Of Industry At Large The Stevedoring
57,Mr Opperman (Corio,"Minister forR assess the degree of accuracy of the present Register would require a separate approach being made to each individual alien in the country. Apart from this there would be no other practicable method for establishing whether the addresses currently recorded are accurate or not. The requirement for an annual notification by every alien would provide a basis for an immediate check to be made with respect to those aliens who, having registered initially, fail subsequently to comply with the annual notification requirement. In this way follow-up action would be confined to actual defaulters; that is, those persons only who fail to comply with the annual notification requirement. The Government considers that the replacement of the present ad hoc notification of changes of address and occupation as they occur by a system of annual notification by all aliens of these particulars, together with details of marital status, will result not only in a more accurate and up to-date Register of Aliens, but also that it will be a less onerous requirement for the aliens themselves, especially those who in their early years of residence frequently change their address. It is proposed that the period in which annual notification would be required will be from lst to 30th September in each year, with respect to any alien who was in Australia on 31st day of August that year. These dates will be prescribed by regulation. The necessity for the alien, after registering initially on arrival, subsequently to notify his address, occupation and marital status during a specified period each year would be the subject of wide publicity in advance of its being introduced.

Question proposedThat grievances be noted. I would like to put before the National Grievance Dehate. Parliament and the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) a matter which has relation to the Bankruptcy Act. I want to deal particularly with section 84 of that Act which deals with moneys to which employees of a bankrupt person are entitled for annual holidays, public holidays and long service leave. It is assumed that long service leave would be treated in the same manner as annual leave, and in this case a worker would be entitled only to long service leave accruing over a period of four months. I bring this matter up because of the great concern that is being felt by employees in the building industry in New South Wales. One of the leading unions in the building industry, the Building Workers' Industrial Union, which has 23,000 members in New South Wales, is most concerned about fly-by-night sub-contractors who go bankrupt leaving their employees holding the bag in the sense that they do not receive the money to which they are entitled. All that they receive is a very small amount indeed-u p to about £50. The Bankruptcy Act has been in operation since 1924 and there have been no amendments to section 84 of the Act although there have been 18 amendments to other sections of it. The number of cases of bankruptcy in Australia is increasing. The thirty-sixth annual report on bankruptcy issued by the Attorney-General to cover the period from 1st July 1963 to 30th June 1964 showed that in that period 2,678 persons in Australia went bankrupt. In New South Wales alone 116 persons connected with the building industry went bankrupt. These included brick, tile, cement and lime manufacturers and merchants, bricklayers, plasterers and masons, builders, builders' merchants, carpenters and joiners, contractors, decorators, painters, plumbers and glaziers and labourers. As I have said, the Building Workers' Industrial Union is concerned about the situation in New South Wales, as is the Australian Council of Trade Unions. On one big construction job in New South Wales one of these fly-by-night subcontractors went broke, owing £700 to 14 employees, who could see no hope of getting any of that money. However, the Union conducted negotiations with the principal contractor, who made good the money. The Union is also greatly concerned about another fellow who was declared bankrupt,",24,Aliens Bill 1965
58,Mr Devine (East Sydney) [11.49],"owing £20,000, and who is now handling the affairs of another company, the directors of which include the man's wife and his brother. I think this is a matter that the Government should have a close look at and that the Government should make inquiries to see whether it can bring down legislation to protect employees in such circumstances so that they will be able to obtain money to which they are entitled, including payment for annual holidays and long service leave. The Commercial Travellers' Guild in New South Wales has also expressed concern about the situation. The secretary of the Guild wrote a letter to the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) about section 84 of the Bankruptcy Act on 10th February 1959. Although the letter was written six years ago, no attempt has been made to bring in legislation to amend section 84. In another place, a senator referred to a case in Western Australia in which money owing to employees amounted to £993 15s. Due to the operation of section 84 of the Bankruptcy Act the five employees involved received £21 between them. I am sure that there are many other honourable members who are perturbed about this situation. It is about time the Government brought in legislation to protect employees in these circumstances. The Bankruptcy Act was first introduced in 1924. It was based on the English act of that time. In the ensuing period of 40 years we have had a recession, a world war and, according to the Government, prosperity. The Act has been amended on 18 occasions, but section 84 has remained unaltered. The British Parliament has made several amendments to the United Kingdom act, especially to that section which is equivalent to the section of the Australian Act that I have mentioned. An inquiry was conducted in England in 1957 and the amount stated in the priority section was increased to £200 sterling. In 1924 the basic wage was between £3 and £4 a week. Today it is approximately £15 8s. Commonwealth employees and most State employees receive three weeks annual leave. The New South Wales Labour Government has granted four weeks annual leave to its employees. So, the £50 mentioned in this Act would not cover even holiday pay. The Act also provides that a claim in I simply say that I have been impressed respect of long service leave or holiday pay with his sincerity on this matter. I am sure is limited to the amount that may have accrued in a period of four months. This is definitely not enough. More protection should be provided for employees. The Government should ensure that employees are the first people to be paid amounts that are due to them. The Government should take immediate action. The Commercial Travellers Guild has submitted recommendations to the Prime Minister. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is discussing the matter and the Building Workers Industrial Union has made statements about its employees. I am sure that a very good case for amendment of the Act could be presented to the Government. I believe that section 84 could easily be amended to give greater protection to employees, who are being denied their right to receive payment for their services. People who have been working for any of these contractors for 10 years or so would lose a considerable amount of money through the bankruptcy of the contractor. The amount they can receive is limited by the Act to the amount that would accrue in a period of four months. This is ridiculous and it is about time that the Government amended the Act to afford protection to these people. All the States agreed to the Companies Act of 1961-62 and the Commonwealth Government issued ordinances in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. This Act provides for a priority payment of wages to employees of £300. The amount varies in the States from £300 to £500. I say, as a member of the Opposition, that the workers in this country must be protected and should be paid all that they are entitled to receive. These fly by night contractors employ a lot of workers, get their pound of flesh and then find it easy to become bankrupt. The result is that the employees do not receive the amounts that are due to them. The employees need the protection of the Act and I ask the Government to amend it so that it gives the greatest possible protection to employees. sure my friend, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Devine), would not expect me to comment in detail on the argument he has put to the House this morning.",25,Grievance Debate
59,Mr Killen (Moreton) [11.591,"I amhe will be interested to know that there is on the stocks, so to speak, a new draft Bankruptcy Bill. When that Bill will be presented is a matter of speculation, certainly for a private member. However, a very comprehensive report on bankruptcy was tendered to the Government I think some considerable time ago and I suppose, all in all, one may reasonably expect that a new Bankruptcy Bill will be presented to the House this year. This morning I want to occupy the time of the House by saying a word or two about the buying of civil aircraft by the two major operators in Australia, Ansett-A.N.A. and Trans-Australia Airlines. Immediately, I want to express my very great concern that both of the Australian operators have shown a preference for the Douglas DC9 twin jet aircraft -1 want at the same time to express the hope that an opportunity will be presented to both of these companies to turn even now to the purchase of the BAC-111. My philosophy towards life is, I hope, tolerably well known in this House. I would hope that nobody would be tinder any misapprehension about my belief that governments should stay out of matters of business. I hesitate to tender any advice to the Government to interfere in normal business operations where such interference is not necessary. But I believe that on this occasion there exists a very much pointedup state of affairs in which the Government should say quite firmly, and politely no doubt, to both Mr Ansett and T.A.A. that they should buy the British aircraft, theBAC-1.11. The British aircraft industry today is sick. cheaper to operate. If the Australian order for new aircraft is to be given on this occasion to the Douglas Aircraft Co. and not to the British Aircraft gin of preference duty.

If the Comsomebody in the Establishment tell me how monwealth of Nations and the Western we can explain away a difference of world lose the skills that have been acquired £500,000 between the prices of two aircraft by the British aircraft industry over a long of comparable performance. If any person period, in my judgment the Commonwealth argues that their performance is not comof Nations will have been dealt a treparable, I would be very interested to hear mendous blow. No one regrets more than his arguments. I do that the British Government has found it necessary to suspend the development of the TSR2. But that is another matter and it is open to legitimate argument. In the matter of civil aircraft, there exists an overwhelming case against the purchase of the American aircraft on this occasion. What of the merits of the two aircraft? I think that a person who says that the American aircraft, the DC9, is superior to the BAC-111 is standing on very shaky ground indeed. Of the 96 BAC-111 aircraft that have been sold or are under option of sale, 73 have gone to the United States of America. The United States, with its tremendous industrial capacity and know how, is buying 73 of these aircraft because, in the judgment of the airline operators concerned, it is a better aircraft. In my respectful submission, more experience has been had with the British aircraft than with the American aircraft. The British aircraft has been developed to the present stage for longer than the DC9 has. Let us consider the position of United Air Lines Inc. This is a very large airline operator and is one of the four largest airlines operating in the United States of America. It has placed an order for 30 short to medium haul BAC-111 aircraft to support the fleet of Boeing 727 aircraft that it presently operates. I am reliably informed that the British Aircraft Corporation has offered Trans-Australia Airlines a 96 seat version of the One-Eleven, at a price £300,000 cheaper than that of any aircraft that could be offered by its main competitor. This version, equipped with Rolls-Royce engines, is 5 per cent, Let me turn now to the 7 i per cent, marber give us the picture concerning the range of the two aircraft? ranges are approximately the same.

This is the only reported decision available for the guidance of magistrates in determining what circumstances are "" so exceptional and unusual"" as to justify the granting of consent. The circumstances of this case were so unusual as to permit two quite rational interpretations of the decision. The first would support a ruling that only extremely unusual circumstances justify the granting of consent and that pregnancy alone is not a circumstance so exceptional and unusual. The second interpretation would justify a ruling that circumstances that appear to make the persons fit for married life and raise a presumption of the success of the marriage are sufficient circumstances.

ThenI noted a row of unsightly barrack-like huts which, for all the world, had the appearance of a penal settlement. On the slopes of Middle HeadI saw cheap, unpretentious Service houses peeping rather self-consciously through the green foliage. They presented a general picture of depression of this wonderful headland area. I cannot agree with the Minister for the Army when he says that the erection of houses at George's Heights is designed to promote the attractions of the Army. Obviously, these houses would not be for other ranks; they could only be for officers -and only a few officers at that. I am particularly disturbed to note that in a public statement the Minister said that 11 houses would be built on the ridge of Middle Head. Even the very best architecture and the most imaginative landscaping will not hide the butchery of the natural beauty of this area. In my view-and I presume, in the view of legions of other people in Australiathe Army has no business to be on these headlands which face the Sydney Heads. Surely the Army is not there for any defence purpose. In the days of cannons, no doubt it was of some defence value to have the Army on the headlands; for instance, to guard the Heads against expected Russian attack. I understand that history tells us that. But, of course, the only Russian activity has been not an attack but a friendly visit by a Russian whaling fleet which came into the harbour yesterday.* I am certain that the Russians were very impressed with what they saw. In this space age, surely it must be absolutely useless to have the Army on the headlands for the original purpose. No-one denies that Service personnel should be well and effectively housed. The Minister is well aware of my concern in that regard. But why does the Army not seek to acquire alternative sites in residential areas? Why does it not acquire home unit accommodation in suburbs such as Mosman, Cremorne, Neutral Bay and Manly. Surely these alternatives are well worth considering as propositions which would preserve headland and foreshore areas which could be' converted into national parks for the people of Australia. In my opinion, the arguments in favour of preserving the headlands in their natural state are compelling and unanswerable. They may be summarised as follows: First, the headlands are an integral part of the scenic beauty of the harbour. Secondly, the need to preserve open spaces close to the city for the inspiration and creative activities of future generations is urgent when we consider that in 35 years' time, at the present rate of population growth, 5 million people will be residing in Sydney. Thirdly, I suggest that the Federal Government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to preserve the nation's priceless scenic assets. I conclude by reiterating my protest against further building and facility development of the headlands around Sydney Harbour by the Service departments. I suggest that the Commonwealth consider transferring the headlands to the New South Wales Government so that they can be preserved as national parks and recreation areas for the benefit of the people of Australia. the outset 1 express my wholehearted support of the remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) about the very great social problem in respect of minors being permitted to marry. The legislation, as it stands, is quite vague. It has caused considerable distress in a number of cases that have been brought to my notice. I hope that the honourable member's words will not go unheeded by the Attorney General( Mr Snedden). This morning, as I listened to the Canberra commercial radio station, I heard yet another advertisement by the Country Party indicating its policy points for the forthcoming State election in New South Wales. As usual, the advertisement made great play on the Country Party's policy of decentralisation. the members of the Country Party who are in the chamber at present. But I merely ask the electors of New South Wales, particularly those in country areas, to be mindful, when they hear these enticing words and seductive phrases, of what this Commonwealth Government has and has not done to help the decentralisation of industry and population.

Probably he can foresee that I intend to refer to the 16$ months' delay so far in introducing legislation to implement a major promise that was made by the Federal Liberal-Country Party Government in the last House of Representatives election campaign in respect of petrol prices in country areas. A promise was solemnly made that the price of petrol in country areas would not be more than 4d. a gallon more than city prices. Euburbs railway? honourable member's sensitivity. It is clear evidence of his consciousness of the Commonwealth Government's neglect of country people in the field of decentralisation. 1 am talking not about creating something in the country but about a matter of administration, namely bringing about a near-equalisation of petrol prices. Of course, I do not need to emphasise the significance of such legislation in attracting people to country areas, in facilitating the establishment of industries in country areas and in reducing transport costs. Of course, we remember that this promise, which was made principally at the instigation of the Country Party, was made to counter the Labour Party's promise to bring about not just a differential of 4d. a gallon but the equalisation of petrol prices everywhere. I have mentioned that point this morning in order to help people who might be inclined to listen to the seductive words of Country Party advertisements about decentralisation. As a matter of fact, where Country Party governments have existed in their own right or in conjunction with the Liberal Party, there has been a gross lack of decentralisation. South Australia is a case in point, In that State about 60 per cent, of the population lives in the metropolitan area of Adelaide. I turn now to the principal matter about which I want to speak this morning, namely this Government's failure to give any leadership in the matter of education of the public on smoking and its alleged association with the incidence of cancer. In comparatively recent months we have seen how the British Labour Government has set about attacking this problem, first of all, by banning television advertisements on behalf of cigarette companies, and how the United States Government, which is a Federal government like our own, is now taking action to require all cigarette packages and all advertising of cigarettes to bear a warning about the danger to health involved in smoking. These two leading Governments have taken action in this matter. In a recent statement the Minister for Health( Mr Swartz) said that the highest medical authorities in Great Britain and the United States had produced reports which established a definite link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. What does this Government do about it? I have heard questions from members of the Country Party about the dangers of the introduction of foot and mouth disease and the need to enforce very stringent quarantine regulations in respect of animals coming to this country. It seems to me that the Government is more concerned about foot and mouth disease in cattle than it is about the incidence of the wretched scourge of throat and lung cancer in human beings. Evidence of the highest order has been produced to indicate .the high probability of a direct association between prolonged smoking and lung cancer. Those of us who in our public duties, and often in our private affairs, have to visit patients suffering from this disease in public hospitals must wonder how the Government can abdicate its responsibility in such a grave matter of public hygiene and public health. As a matter of interest, on l l t h March 1964 in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) saidThe Minister for Health has now informed aw that at a meeting in February",31,Grievance Debate

Where is the campaign? Who has seen it? AllI see when I get a chance to watch television is a saturated succession of seducements to cancer by the many and varied cigarette companies of this country. This, I would estimate, constitutes almost half of the advertising on television. I have not made any statistical analysis of the advertising, but I think anyone who watches it must ask why, if, as the Surgeon-General of the United States says, there is grave danger of cancer from smoking, the Australian Government, which raises £111 million annually in excise and customs duty from cigarettes, cigars and tobacco, sits by and does nothing to educate our young people, quite apart from our old people, about the grave scourge of cancer and the probability of its being caused by smoking. If any kind of public disease raged in the community or if there were any grave deficiency in our public hygiene there would be an outcry for action; but here is something, involving millions of pounds, which is being proliferated throughout the community with not a word of leadership being given by this Government, which abdicates its responsibility by saying: "" It is our job to put before the people the facts. It is up to them to do something about it "" . Of course, the Government did not do this when it came to adding fluoride to the Canberra water supply. No fear; the Government took its own action. It thought that was a matter of public health which affected the people. However, in respect of smoking and its association with cancer, one becomes cynical and wonders whether the revenue which the Government gets from the tobacco industry is so great that the Government is not prepared to come out and publicise the grave dangers to the health of our community. Labour Party done about issuing a industrially strong, which we must do if we statement? to conduct a campaign-the New South our primary industries to produce export Wales State Government, or the Commonincome. wealth Government which expects to raise £111 million this year alone in customs and excise on tobacco products? Within the next door to door campaign, is being launched in Victoria to raise £500,000 to combat the scourge of cancer. While citizens in their generosity and public spiritedness will respond, the Commonwealth Government, which has all the funds necessary to try to educate public opinion, will do nothing about the problem. The Government has abdicated its responsibility and it deserves great censure for having done so. not but be amused by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Reynolds). No doubt the policy speech of the Leader of the Australian Country Party in New South Wales has created so much interest that it has pricked the Australian Labour Party in a very tender spot. When one realises that the present New South Wales Labour Government has promised works costing more than £350 million for the metropolitan area and under £5 million for country areas, it gives the lie to accusations against the Country Party. I want to deal with something far more important than the remarks of the honourable member for Barton. I refer to the importance of the training of operatives in Australia's most important industry-the wool industry. I have spoken at length on this topic in the House, and it is a matter of vital national importance. This is our most important industry. It is the industry on which our whole economy is based. But it is an industry in which no attempt has ever been made to train or to give standing to shearers and shed hands-the operatives in the industry. In the last few years we have seen tremendous increases in the flocks throughout the Commonwealth, yet a decrease in the number of shearers. Our export income depends largely on wool. The importance of earning export income and of increasing our export income has been highlighted by the actions of the United States and British Governments in trying to limit the flow of capital from those countries. If are to hold it, we must increase our exports.",32,Grievance Debate

The Graziers Association of New South Wales has promised funds to build the shearing shed. Shearing contractors are behind the move and have guaranteed to supply some students. Grazcos Cooperative Ltd., that large co-operative shearing company, has guaranteed two students for each course. The New South Wales Department of Technical Education is interested and is behind the move. I point out that despite the expansion of support by the Commonwealth Government for education, no allocation of funds has been made to this industry. There are no technioal scholarships for the training of shearers or shed hands. It has been estimated that 2,000 new shearers enter the industry every year but only a few over 1,000 remain after two years, mainly because they have to teach themselves to shear and they are not efficient at it. It has been estimated also by reliable sources that bad shearing costs this industry and the Commonwealth about £200 per shearer per annum in second cuts and in breaking of fleeces, making classing more difficult. The primary producers have shown their usual independence by going a long way towards setting up this school, but they seek Federal Government support in the form of a subsidy or scholarships. If we are able to train the men and give them some certificate of qualification it will increase their standing in the community. This is a highly skilled occupation and we are getting better types of men into it. Most of the men entering this industry will be drawn from the ranks of those who cannot afford to pay high education fees. It is proposed to pay living away from home allowances to provide for the keep of the men and to give them some spending money. A course will last about six weeks and £10 to £12 a week should be sufficient to cover the cost to each student. We are not asking the Government to consider providing heavy expenditure in supporting this industry, but it is an industry which is vital to Australia's economy. minutes to 1 o'clock and in accordance with Standing Order No. 106 the debate is interrupted and I put the questionThat grievances be noted.

The two documents are the letter of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) to the President of the United States of America, and the President's reply. The Prime Minister's letter expresses the Government's concern that the American Government's measures to improve the United States balance of payments position will harm the Australian economy. In his reply, the President expressed some sympathy for Australia's position but holds out little hope for any radical change of American policy in our favour. By far the more significant of these two documents is the Prime Minister's letter. It is significant because it is one of the most",33,Grievance Debate

This is the real problem. The Prime Minister's letter shows that, at last, his Government must realise it, although it is never specifically stated in such terms.

86,Mr Calwell,"' I do not misrepresentA fundamental difference between the attitudes shown in the two letters is that the President recognises that his prime responsibility is for the American economy and that the United States Administration has the right and the duty to act in what it considers its own essential interest. The President is first and last pro-American. It is time some overseas. capital. We welcome some this Government showed itself to be equally first-and last pro-Australian. And it is time that the Government realised that our fate is in our own hands-that we must act and work for ourselves and stop hoping for someone else to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for us. The Prime Minister's letter flows from an action of the American President to correct difficulties in the United States balance of payments position. A country that does not take steps to remedy such a position allows its internal economy to be open to the threat of being overwhelmed by events outside. There can, of course,' be differing views as to why the Americans have got themselves into this position. We can differ as to whether their policies of economic aid have been benevolent or self-interested and as to whether their military assistance has been as enlightened as it ought to be. But what we cannot argue about is that America was entitled to take steps to correct its balance of payments situation. What has to be asked in this debate is surely this: Why has Australia not faced up to the reality of its balance of payments difficulties? We on this side of the House have averted time and time again to the dangers inherent in replying on the flow of foreign capital, whether from Britain, the United States or anywhere else, to bolster our international reserves. member do? to plead guilty. The Government has always appeared to be gratified about the level of its international reserves and never concerned as to how they were in fact obtained. BeforeT go further, I wish to state, once more, in general terms, the policy of the Labour Party towards overseas investment. Perhaps the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp) anticipated me slightly. I am not speaking only of American investment. 1 must make it clear that by foreign investment 1 mean capital that comes from Hong Kong, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Britain, America or Ttmbuctoo-that is, anywhere overseas. Our policy is this: We recognise Australia's need, as a growing country, for forms of capital assistance for our development. We particularly welcome capital which brings with it the special advantages of research, know-how, and marketing methods new to us. But we do not, as the Government has done, welcome overseas capital uncritically. We believe, as the Treasurer himself was forced to admit here three weeks ago, that there are dangers associated with foreign capital. Unlike him, we believe it is the duty of the Government to take action to minimise and avoid as far as possible those dangers-the dangers that he realises. We believe it requires government initiative-direc t and indirect-to ensure that all available capital, local and foreign, is directed into the most productive channels for the growth of Australia. The warnings that the Australian Labour Party has given on the disadvantages of overseas investment, and the reasons we have given for some measure of regulation of the nature and direction of overseas investment, have been based on four grounds. Firstly, we have given the general warning that no nation can afford to pursue an economic policy which requires exploitation of key national assets in order to pay its way from year to year. Secondly, we have given a particular warning that the day would soon arrive .when the outflow of capital in the form of dividends to foreign capitalists would equal or exceed (he inflow of new foreign investment. That day is arriving. Thirdly, we have sought Australian equity and Australian participation in the ownership of foreign owned companies. And fourthly, we have warned that as vital sectors of the economy came under foreign control, and as the reliance on the maintenance of capital inflow developed, then Australian industry and the Australian economy would be less and less determined by decisions made here in Australia, and more and more determined by decisions of companies, interests and governments overseas.",35,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
87,Mr Chipp,What would the honourable,36,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
88,Mr Calwell,"I am waiting for youEach of these warnings is justified by every line in the Prime Minister's letter. But, though the need for this letter proves that we were right, the Prime Minister is still unwilling to come to grips with the real problems at issue. He stated in his letter. . . if tbe United States investors were to begin repatriating capital, substantially increasing the protion because the official United States pubportion of profits remitted, or adding largely to their fixed interest borrowings or other forms of capital raising in Australia which gave Australian investors no equity share in the businesses in question. The Prime Minister continuedDevelopments such as these could very well force upon us the need to reconsider the policies we have hitherto followed in these areas. Those are important words. I wonder if the Prime Minister even yet realises what a damning indictment of his Government's indecisive policies that paragraph contains. He recognises at last that changes in policy by overseas companies or overseas governments, quite beyond our control, may embarrass the Australian economy. He further admits that we are at present powerless against such changes. And then, in a kind of gambler's last throw, he declares that the Australian Government might actually be forced to develop some kind of policy for the protection of its own economy, unless somebody helps us out. Even at this late stage, even when the Prime Minister has to make a special plea to the United States Government not to be too difficult, he still does not seem to realise that action must be tnken now. He still does not seem to realise that the situation that-to use his own barrass'"" us is actually upon us. It is with us right now, and it is here to stay until a way out is found. It is our duty, not that of the United States, the United Kingdom, or any other country, to find the solutions to our problems. In the last three years, 1962, 1963 and 1964, for instance, what the Commonwealth Statistician describes as "" Investment income payable overseas by companies in Australia "" was £97.6 million, £127.8 million and £133.2 million, respectively, against new "" direct investment"" of £78 million, £126.1 million and £131.7 million respectively. We are now a net exporter of capital. We seem to be reaching the point of no return. From the text of the Prime Minister's letter, it is apparent that he is more concerned that the flow of capital from America will cease than about the situation that has been reached with America, in particular, although the facts of that situation are detailed in the letter. The Prime Minister's letter was dated 12th we would be troubled and embarrassed March 1965, but in a sense he was not telling the President a thing about our posilication "" Survey of Current Business"" for January 1965, in an article on the United States balance of payments, had notedExport gains by country were widespread throughout the world with especially large advances in shipments to the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa. And on the other sideThe reduction in meat imports resulted in substantial declines in imports from Australia and New Zealand in 1964. In other words, the very things which our Prime Minister regards as bad have been regarded as good in the United States. Of course, the reason is obvious. The same article also went on to imply that the United States had already looked at another factor which the President has taken into account in his recent actions-the position of the reserves of international currency of various countries. It said Most ot the increases (of gold and foreign exchange) entered the reserves of continental European countries, mainly France, although reserves of Canada and Australia also rose notably. In his reply, the President statedWe intend to emphasise primarily the need to words"" would trouble and emcurb the outflow of such funds to industrialised countries already rich in reserves. The President is clearly referring to countries of the kind which he believes Australia to be. The Prime Minister seems to rely on a special sympathy being extended to Australia because we lie in some special category between the developed and underdeveloped nations. The President is relying upon voluntary co-operation from investors and the American banking system. Unlike the case of direct government action, it will be extremely difficult to allow particular exceptions to the general rule. The proposal relies for its effectiveness on a clear understanding of a clearly defined policy. The Prime Minister gives no inkling that he really understands the nature of the enterprise in which the President is engaged. It is to be hoped that the Treasurer will have comprehended all that is involved by the time he visits Washington and, maybe, when he goes on to London. I think he ought .to go on to London because the position of Australia in regard to Britain is just not as good as he seems to think, or as his advisers tell him it is. But whatever the results of his visit-w e cannot be optimistic on this score-n o real solution of the real problem will have been found. There will be no solution, and no move towards a solution, until the Government acts to reduce our dependence on foreign capital. Members of the Government sometimes speak as if it were almost impossible to raise capital within Australia. In fact, four-fifths of all new private capital expenditure here is Australian in origin. But in all too many cases, that one-fifth foreign capital has skimmed the cream of Australian industry, and picked the eyes out of investment opportunity, if I may change the metaphor. More importantly, foreign investment controls the most vital sectors of the economy. At a recent symposium organised by the Melbourne Stock Exchange, Senator Gorton, a prominent Minister in this Government, dismissed the problem as of virtually no account, on tbe ground that only one quarter of Australian secondary industry was owned and controlled overseas. But replying to Senator Gorton, Mr J. C. Wilson, a Managing Director of Australian Paper Mills, showed how superficial Senator Gorton's approach really was-and Mr Minister describes Australia as a free enterWilson is not a member of the Australian Labour Party; he is a strong supporter of the Liberal Party. Mr Wilson pointed out that almost all of that 25 per cent, was invested in key industries, and that absolutely vital industries such as petroleum refining, drugs, telecommunications, motor vehicle manufacture and oil exploration and production were almost 100 per cent, in overseas hands. The tragedy of this nation is that we have allowed ourselves to drift into a stage of dependency on foreign assistance to the extent that it has paralysed us from doing what we ought to do, and what we could do for ourselves. Overseas research and know how is important, but that does not mean we should not be doing much more in this field ourselves and for ourselves. The rich private companies of this nation should be doing F.3537/65 -[30 ] more, and the Government should be assisting industry to do more. We have allowed vast natural resources to be tied up for years and released for development only on terms dictated by overseas interests. These interests do not share our national aims and aspirations. Their only interest is to make profits on the grand scale and to make them quickly. The development of iron ore in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, and the development of coal exports, are cases in point. The same thing threatens oil exploration and exploitation. The Treasurer speaks as if we had only two choices-eithe r to become a rich quarry to be mined for the profit of, and at the convenience of, foreign monopolists, or to allow our great natural resources to lie forever idle. If that sort of defeatist thinking had paralysed the Chifley Labour Government there would be no Snowy Mountains scheme today. In the implementation of that scheme we have used overseas skill and knowledge to the limit-bu t ownership, control and all the benefits remain, inalienably, in the hands of the people of Australia. We need a national development authority along those lines which will really get on with the job of developing our resources. In this task there is a place for both Australian private capital and for Government endeavour. In his letter to the President, the Prime prise economy. Unfortunately, there has been far too little enterprise on the part of Australian business. This, rather than shortage of local capital, is tbe reason why so many of our key industries-the most important as well as the most profitablehave fallen under the ownership and control of foreign interests. The entire strategy of encouraging and rewarding the enterprising, and penalising the inefficient, has been neglected by this Government because of its slavish adherence to outmoded laissez faire philosophies and its wilful refusal to institute genuine economic planning. The field of export credits has been equally neglected, and too slowly and unimaginatively developed. And the import policy of the Government also must be overhauled, if we are to live within our means. These are the things that should have been done in the period this Government has held office. And these are the things that should be done now. Because they have not been done, we are now faced with an emergency which will be part of a chronically ill crisis until our domestic economy is developed on a soundly planned national basis. The degree of dependence this Government has allowed to be grafted on to our economy may be difficult to remove immediately but it is time to act now. It is no more anti-American for us to take steps to remedy our balance of payments situation than it is anti-Australian for President Johnson to have done what he has done, lt is no more anti-British for us to act in assertion of our national interests than it is anti-Australian for the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain to have done the same for Britain. Our sister dominions, Canada and New Zealand, have taken legislative action to grapple with capital inflow. Why should Australia not so act? If the American curtailment of capital outflow is thought to be the real problem, then we will be viewing things through the wrong end of the telescope. This is only one aspect of the problem of our reliance on foreign capital, which in turn is only one aspect of our failure to develop a self-reliant economy. If the President's action awakens the Government to the dangers of its present policy, then far from doing Australia harm, the President will have done us a tremendous service. surer) [2.41] I thank the House for the opportunity to discuss the important matter before us at rather greater length than is permissible under the Standing Orders. I hope that what I have to say is informative and not too tedious by its length. Seeing that overseas for the development of this conI go abroad for discussions in Washington not merely as a member of this Government, but representing, I hope, Australia as a whole, it would have suited me personally better, and I think the purpose that we have in mind in common as fellow Australians, if the discussion today could have concentrated on what is in substance the motion before us. It will be recalled that when the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) tabled the exchange of correspondence between himself and the President of the United States of America, he did not comment on that correspondence at the time; but the Opposition indicated a wish to discuss the letters, and we were only too glad to provide that opportunity. Rather than concentrate on the terms of the correspondence and what is directly implicit in it, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) has seen fit to deliver a speech on the policy of the Australian Labour Party on overseas investment in Australia. I do not begrudge him that opportunity. Indeed, I invited the Opposition to do this some time earlier in the session. The Leader of the Opposition having made a quite blatantly party political speech, a highly critical speech, much of it vague, most of it groundless, and a good deal of it emotional, it becomes necessary, before I get down to the particular matters which are raised in the correspondence with the President, and other matters which I feel it desirable to discuss while in Washington, to do a little ground clearing. I apologise if, in doing so, I find it necessary to introduce a fairly large quotation by myself. But I think it is as well to clear the ground on where the Government stands in relation to overseas investment and, I hope, to destroy on this occasion, so that I will not have to go on doing so, the misrepresentation about the position of myself and other members of the Government which has provided Opposition members with opportunity for a good deal of mischief and has served for them the purpose of allowing them to misrepresent to the public mind just where we stand on this very important question of policy. I preface my remarks on this aspect of the subject by reminding the House that the Government is now in its 16th year and that throughout its term of office it has consistently pursued a policy of encouraging the inflow of capital from tinent. We have been endeavouring to increase our population by an active and vigorously pursued programme of immigrationa programme supported on both sides of the House. Most sensible people realise that it is a corollary of this situation that as we bring more people in-and more than 2,250,000 immigrants have come here since the programme got under way-w e encourage the inflow of capita] which will enable us to employ those people-to absorb them and to expand the economic base so that this process can go on. There has been a very happy association in harness of the capital which has come, to",36,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme

I doubt that any of them, with the possible exception of tbe honourable member for Scullin( Mr ment capital they need. Capital inflow has been Peters) would deny that we have derived great national advantage from this capital inflow. representation is your stock in trade. to have the honourable gentleman's assurance that he has not denied this. It makes the House unanimous in the belief that at least the nation has derived great advantage from the inflow of capital. The honourable gentleman talks about misrepresentation. I think I can claim to have experienced something of that myself. It was only three weeks ago that when I talked about some of the risks associated with capital inflow the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) commented that this was the first time he had ever heard me say that I recognised that there were any risks. Again, today, the Leader of the Opposition has repeated that comment. In the course of his speech the Leader of the Opposition sought to make great play of what he alleged to be differences existing between members of the Government. Let us just try to clear the ground on this aspect of the matter for a moment or two. Let me turn, first, to a statement. I made in 1963 when I was replying to some remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The date of this statement was 12th July 1963. I shall not quote the ful l text of it, but it is available for any Opposition member who wants to see it. I saidOver more recent years, the field of investment interest has widened with increased activity from the United States and a growing investment from Europe and Asia. Our post-war growth owes much to the strong flow of loans and funds from these sources. Investors have been attracted by the political stability they have found in this country and their assessment of its growth potential. Undoubtedly also, they have been attracted by an environment and economic climate favourable to private enterprise. Capital goes where it is welcome and stays where it is well treated. Overseas interests which put capital into a country are themselves giving hostages. They become subject to our domestic policies, laws and tax systems. There is a worldwide shortage of capital for development purposes. It has been Australia's good fortune and great national advantage to have succeeded in attracting this large and continuous flow of investment funds against the competition of other developing countries, themselves offering all manner of inducements to secure the developof great assistance to us over a period in which the terms of trade had moved heavily against us. It has enabled us to absorb our migrant intake. It has accelerated and vastly diversified our industrial expansion. We have gained access to more resources, the use of valuable techniques, the fruits of continuous research conducted overseas, new managerial vigour and sharpened competition. Labour has little regard for overseas invest; ment. Some of its spokesmen are openly hostile to it. A Labour Government following methods implicit in Mr Whitlam's statement would inevitably produce doubts and hesitations amongst those already sensitive to the risks they run when they invest in another country. Confidence, once shaken, would not be easily restored. Then followed the point that I am now leading toThe Government is not unmindful of Australia's risks and problems associated with overseas investment. There is, of course, the problem of servicing the interest payment on overseas loans or of financing the remittance abroad of profits earned in Australia. We have found ourselves the more comfortably able to meet these payments by the expansion of the nation's industrial base so materially assisted by overseas investment. Just pausing there, the problem of our national product and the level of our export income required to finance these obligations is no greater today than it was when the process began. In other words, we have expanded our economic base as the capital has come to us. My statement continuedBut there are other problems as well, including that of Australia's participation in enterprise financed from overseas. The Government has at all times made known its wish to see an effective partnership between those investing from overseas and Australian interests. Australia remains a largely underdeveloped and underpopulated continent. We do not have unlimited time in which we are left free to populate our country, and exploit its resources. We can speed these processes by the additional resources which come to us from overseas. Whatever risks we accept in encouraging this investment on however substantial a scale, they are of minor order when set against the risks we rnn if we fail to populate and develop our country as speedily as we can. I think that was a quite balanced account of the attitude, not only of myself, but also of the Government of which I am a member. I mentioned the date, 12th July 1963, and I direct the attention of the",39,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme

91,Mr Harold Holt,"Well, I am gladHouse to the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) on 12th November 1963. He spoke of investment from overseas, and the policy he enunciated was the policy which had been subscribed to by all members of the Government. I in my turn had been following, as Treasurer, the policy pursued during his nine years of office by my predecessor, the then Leader of the Country Party. We have pursued substantially the same policy since that time, and it was expressed in the policy speech made by the Prime Minister in 1963, when he saidInvestment from overseas countries tins taken an important place in our economy. Over the last 15 States. Fortunately, I think that those in years it has amounted to over £1,500 million. This the United States who read his speech might investment has produced great advantages, but under some circumstances produces problems we do. But is that a fair description of the which need to be handled with care and underAustralian people? The fact is that we have standing. As, from a national Australian point of view, we would wish to see new capital from established a remarkable savings record overseas employed for the great purpose of over the years in which this Government developing new industries or extending existing has been in office.

I repeat that, as a percentage of our export income and of our gross national product, it remains still within comfortable manageable proportions. The honourable gentleman also spoke about the rake's progress of our reliance on overseas borrowing. I do not think that is a very happy phrase to use about the Government of one's country.

I have now completed what I may recent years. describe as a ground clearing operation and I turn to the matters that are covered in think is worth spending a moment or two more detail in the correspondence. One of on is the fact that, as is well known, the the substantial points we have made is that Australian Government has borrowed in we have a great task of development and New York on a number of occasions. We we have been assisted considerably in our have raised loans from the International tasks of growth by what has come to us Bank for Reconstruction and Development, from the United States of America. Last but, compared to our total borrowings within year, it amounted to 45 per cent, of the Australia, these sums have not been large. total intake of capital into this country. However, this borrowing has enabled us to Now, because we now encounter some diffimake a very useful addition to our overseas culty from the policy measures adopted by resources and has assisted us in overcoming the United States, the Leader of the Opposiour budgetary problems. The Prime tion describes the letter of the Prime MinisMinister, in his letter to President Johnson ter as a confession of failure with national statedpolicy. He tells us that we seem to rely on some special sympathy from the United tralian Government has commitments of nearly though, there is our trading relationship. We have proved ourselves to be a very satisSo we have with the United States a scale at which we have bought overseas in The other aspect of the situation that I An additional consideration is that the Aus$200 million in the United States over the next five years in respect of debt maturities and sinking fund commitments. This figure is exclusive of instalment repayments of approximately $130 million due to the International Bank over that period. One of the points of interest about our borrowings in New York is that these did not represent any drain on dollars supplied from within the United States, as the level of borrowing might suggest, because, in the result, about half the total came through New York from European investors. So, when we remit these repayments in full, we experience some drain ourselves and the dollar holdings of the United States build up. No doubt, those who hold bonds in Europe are able in turn to draw on dollars. But you would get a quite misleading picture of what we have drawn in New York from dollar supplies from within the USA. if you took the overall figure. I believe, Sir, that there is a very stron» case for Australia to be permitted access to the New York market without being subject to this interest equalisation tax. This would assist us in meeting these maturing loans and other commitments, the meeting of which will benefit the dollar earnings of the United States. I discussed this matter with the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States of America when I was there last. At that time, special arrangements had been made to assist Canada. I did not seek exemption from the tax because I realised, as a result of my discussions in the United States, that this could embarrass that country in its relations with Japan, which are very important for both countries and also for Australia. Since that time, the United States has come to an arrangement with Japan that enables the latter country to have access to the American capital market to the extent of 100 million dollars a year. This is a new feature of the situation which, I think, we would find it proper to discuss when I am in Washington. The other aspect of what I have described as a special relationship concerns the situation of Japan. In this area of the world are three powerful forces making for stability. First, we have the United States, which is a great Pacific power and the strongest economic and military force in the world today. Then there is Japan, which, year by yeaT, is rising in importance its an industrial force in this part of the world. Next, we, as suppliers of raw materials and foodstuffs to Japan, form an important element in this sort of triangular relationship. We normally have an unfavourable trade balance with the USA. and Japan has a favourable trade balance with that country We, in turn, have a favourable balance of trade with Japan. The growing prosperity of each of these three elements has a very definite bearing on the welfare of Japan and Australia. Also, we believe, our welfare is of material significance to the United States in relation to its international policies, particularly in South East Asia and Asia generally. Finally, Sir, there is the very special relationship that derives from the fact that we are allies. Australia is an ally of the United States in the security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which we know as the ANZUS. Treaty, and in the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. We have been making a direct material contribution to the discharge of our obligations in both those alliances. Arising from our recognition of these obligations, we have recently committed ourselves to a considerably enlarged defence programme. We have virtually doubled our budgetary provision for defence. This, too, was mentioned by the Prime Minister in his letter to President Johnson, in these wordsOversea expenditure in 1965-66 and later years arising from existing defence commitments and the new three years defence programme is estimated at about £400 million or the equivalent of ahout $880 million, of which about £250 million or some $550 million will relate to procurement in the United States. Although recent arrangements reached with you to phase payments for some major items over a longer period will ease the burden to some extent, it will still be considerable. At the time we undertook these commitments we had no reason to anticipate that our payments position vis-a-vis the United States would be altered for the worse by action of the kind you have since announced. We believe that these circumstances put us in a special situation that justifies our having talks related to Australia's economic programme and its bearing on the aspects of our relationship with the United States that I have mentioned. I am sure that these matters are well understood in Washington. I do not share the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter. I think we all felt encouraged by. the tone of the President's letter and I , for my part, am quite optimistic that there will be a useful outcome from the talks that we will have. BeforeI conclude, let me refer again to the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition when he talked about the President's responsibility. As I recall it, he said that the President is first and last pro-American, that the President's prime responsibility is for the American economy. But why did he not go on to say, what is undoubtedly the truth, that the President recognises the responsibility that he has from his high office and from the country he leads for a large influence on the economic well-being of the rest of the world. He will not take a course of action in the United States of America unmindful, reckless or regardless of the effects of that upon the rest of the world. But I do have apprehensions that the combined effects of the action taken in the United States of America and the action which the United Kingdom has felt it necessary to take in order to strengthen its own position-wit h these things coming together at the same time from the two reserve currencies of the world-ca n have quite serious repercussions around the rest of the world, not just on Australia but on the international economy as a whole. I hope in the course of talks in the United States of America to find out, not merely from officers of the Department of State but from the International Monetary Fund and from others, what view is taken of the consequences of these measures and what courses are being studied or are proposed in order to avoid any international recession which otherwise might develop out of action on this scale. There used to be a saying some years ago that if the United States sneezes the rest of the world gets pneumonia. We are rather more robust than that at the present time, but what happens in the United States still has a tremendous weight and significance on the world economy as a whole. Finally, on that aspect I conclude by the growth of international liquidity and saying that our first and most direct interest this could, in turn, check the growth of in this matter lies in the effects the United world trade in point of both volume and States and United Kingdom measures could value. Generally, it could have a tightening have on the net inflow of capital to Auseffect on the whole network of international tralia. Those two countries have been our trade and commerce. World prices could be main sources of overseas capital. They have affected-amon g them the prices of raw both set out now to reduce substantially materials and foodstuffs such as still form and rapidly the overall amount of net the greater part of our exports. At least, capital outflow from their respective counconsequences of these kinds could follow tries and we are concerned, in the first place, with the particular impact that their actions could have on the amount of capital coming to Australia. Clearly, however, the situation has wider possibilities and must be seen in a wider context. As a major exporting country, we are vitally interested in the volume and value of world trade, especially trade in raw materials and foodstuffs. But one of the main factors which influence world trade is the condition of international liquidity. Essentially, it is the same as the influence of internal monetary liquidity within a domestic economy where the amount which people can and will spend on goods and services within a given period depends not only on what they earn but also on what they can borrow and what they can draw from bank balances and other cash resources. International liquidity is usually measured and discussed in terms of the foreign exchange reserves held by various countries and of the credits and drawing rights of various kinds upon which they can call to supplement their own reserves. By and large, if world trade is to increase, then the available amount of international liquidity should also increase. Over recent years international liquidity has been increasing and that has helped to make possible a rising volume and value of world trade. One of the mam reasons why international liquidity has been increasing has been that the United States has been running a deficit in its balance of payments and this has led to a net outflow of dollars from that country. As the dollar is regarded as a reserve currency, these have found their way into the official reserves of other countries and have thereby increased the funds available for international trade and payments. On a smaller scale this also has been happening in the case of the United Kingdom. If now this process is to be put into reverse, obviously there can be a check to unless, in one way or another, means can be found to ensure a continuing increase in the level of international liquidity. In this connection, the proposed increase in International Monetary Fund quotas and hence in the ability of the Fund to extend credit to countries suffering temporary balance of payments difficulties must obviously be regarded as a very timely move. As I have said, we are concerned in this developing situation in more ways than one. A reduction in capital inflow could go against us from the standpoints of both our balance of payments position and the rate of economic growth we can sustain. But besides this, it could have a redoubled effect obligations. upon our balance of payments and upon growth if it were to restrict expansion of world trade, cause commodity prices to fall and so reduce our export earnings. I think honourable gentlemen will agree that probably what I have said in the last few minutes are matters of rather more immediate importance to us than the political argument in the first portion of my remarks. It is on these latter matters that we shall need to concentrate a good deal of our attention constructively together over the years immediately ahead and, indeed, in the months immediately ahead. I feel that the House will, as a result of the Prime Minister's letter and the supplementary items that I have added to his narrative today, realise the consequence for Australia of a satisfactory outcome from my discussions and a better knowledge on our part of the international ramifications of the policies which the United States has adopted and the view taken of those policies by authorities of the Administration. It will be tremendously valuable to have talks on these matters. I look forward to reporting to the House the outcome, as soon as I can conveniently do so after my return. J do not know what effect the Treasurer amounted to 3,022 million dollars, or ( Mr Harold Holt) will have on the Presi£A.1,350 million. In other words, the indent of the United States of America. I do flow of capital over that eight year period not think he has done much so far to conwas at the rate of nearly £200 million a vince honourable members on this side of the year. It is only that flow of capital that has House that he has even recognised what the built up Australia's overseas reserves to problem is. First, I should like to indicate their present level of about £700 million. that there are some thines that have been said by honourable members on this side of the chamber which show that we recognise it-is that there is no immediate balance of that historically it cannot be denied that payments crisis for Australia. What we are some benefit or advantages have flowed from foreign investment. But I do not think that that is the question at issue. The question at issue, so far as the Labour Party can see in this immediate context, is why we should need to continue to rely on foreign investment in Australia. We are not facing an immediate balance of payments crisis. I do not think the Treasurer will say that we are. The latest figures that I have show that yesterday Australia's gold and foreign exchange reserves were in the region of £700 million. So there is no foreseeable financial crisis due to our failure to be able to meet balance of payments I am sure that the House welcomes the opportunity to debate this matter, and I hope that an opportunity will be given later to discuss separately the matter that the Treasurer raised at the end of his speech, namely the problem of improving what is called overall international liquidity. I do not want to get that debate mixed up with the present debate. I believe that they are separate matters. I hope that on an early occasion, after the Treasurer has returned after Easter, the House will be given an opportunity to debate that problem separately. What we members of the Opposition abhor is the attitude of the Government that foreign investment has to continue, and has to continue at the same levels as in the past. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), in his letter to the President of the United States, quoted certain figures. He quoted them in dollars. I will convert them to pounds Australian. The Prime Minister said that in the eight years from 1956-57 to 1963-64 the accumulated deficit on current account transactions was 2,417 million dollars, or £A.1,070 million. In the same period the flow of private overseas investment into Australia, primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom, The first point I wish to makeI reiterate",40,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
92,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [3.23],"concerned about in this instance is the statement by the Prime Minister of Australia, on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, that he is worried about the repercussions in Australia of the action that the President of the United States has taken, legitimately enough in terms of his own Government's responsibilities. Somewhat the same sort of action has been taken within the last day or two by the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer. The President and the Chancellor have taken action to correct balance of payments difficulties. What we want to do, and what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) did in his speech, is point out that it is time Australia took action to correct its balance of payments position. In an effort to put this matter somewhat in perspective, I will quote a limited number of figures. I believe that they put in perspective our reliance on foreign investment and the dangers that such reliance can constitute to our economy if we are not careful and if we do not take steps to remedy the situation. I wish to quote three sets of figures. First, figures indicate that the gross return on I will quote some figures that are supplied annually in the United States. They are contained in the "" Survey of Current Business"" of August 1964. The figures show that at the end of 1963 the amount of direct private investment in Australia by American firms had reached 1,277 million dollars, or approximately £A600 million. Those figures relate to the ownership by American firms of undertakings carrying on economic activity of one kind or another in Australia. The second set of figures is contained in a United Kingdom publication-the "" Board of Trade Journal"" of 7th August 1964. These figures are reasonably up to date, too -£34 i million on securities and £5i milThey show that at the end of 1963 the amount of direct private investment in Australia by United Kingdom undertakings was £A662 million. So the total United States and United Kingdom private investment in Australia is £A 1,250 million. That is a significant sum. The United Kingdom figures exclude oil company and banking activities which naturally would increase the total. The other figures that I wish to quote by more than £45 million last year. As the are contained in one of our official publicaLeader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) tions"" Government Securities on Issue at said, on the capital side we are paying out 30th June 1964"". Tbefiguresshow that at that date Australia owed £772 million in Australian currency to governments outside Australia, and we still owed £112 million that we had borrowed from the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Those two sums total near enough to £900 million. The total of the figures for direct United Kingdom investment in Australia, direct United States investment in Australia and what the Australian Government owes to residents outside Australia is about £2,250 million. Those figures do not include what is called portfolio investment, which could well aggregate hundreds of millions of pounds. Let us say that the figure is £250 million. I do not think that is an unreal figure. That means that the flow of money into Australia from foreign sources has totalled £2,500 million. Even if the return on that sum were only 5 per cent., the annual interest and profit liability would be at least £125 million. In fact, the liability is a great deal more than that because the United States American investment is not a mere 5 per cent, but well over 10 per cent. Those aggregate figures are borne out by figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician in another official publication. These figures were quoted by the Leader of the Opposition. They show that in the year ended June 1964 the investment income payable overseas by private companies in Australia totalled £133 million. That does not include Government indebtedness. The figures supplied by the Treasurer indicate that the annual interest outgoing on the Government incurred liability is £40 million lion on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. That means that last year the annual bill for servicing this capital was near enough to £180 million. Let us look at the other side of the picture, the new investment in Australia. Again my figures are for 1964. They indicate that when unremitted profits are excluded-and , of course, they are not new moneys-the new investment totalled £131.7 million, so we were down the drain more now than we are getting in, yet this Government wants this type of situation to continue. Surely the time must come when a country must take stock of its position. We are not asking the Treasurer to go to the United States of America to sue for mercy because of a step which has to be taken in that country to protect its position. We are saying to the Treasurer, as the custodian of the nation's finance: ""Why don't you do something in Australia to make us less dependent on this flow of foreign investment, because if you do not take stock we will continue with the situation where we pay out more than we get?"" Are we to be a perpetual traveller to the pawnbrokers, as it were? Surely there comes a day of reckoning and of repayment. When it does come we will have a crisis with our balance of payments. We must do something to make Australia self-reliant on its international account, and basically the only way is by increasing the quantity of goods exported from Australia. This is the type of thing that must be done, but what is happening? I cite what I regard as an appalling situation described in the most recent issue of the overseas journal "" The Banker "". It relates to a new firm which is being formed in the United Kingdom by a merger of two old banking concerns, merchant bankers and discount houses-M . Samuel and Philip Hill. About Philip Hill the article statesPhilip Hill is well established in South Africa, Rhodesia and Australia. What are the duties of Philip Hill? The article continuesPhilip Hill has been more active in the takeover field, in domestic new issues, and in property. their inactivity. Why do we need in Australia the machinations of a firm like Philip Hilla specialist in take-overs? At least the New Zealand Government took action in this regard. I have an example in my electorate at present whereby a firm which has been established in Australia almost since Australians learned to wash-J . Kitchen& Sons Pty. Ltd., makers of soap-ha s been recently taken over by Unilever (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., an overseas octopus which has decided that in future it will manufacture soap not in Melbourne but in Sydney, while the Melbourne side of its activity will process food. That is a remarkable decision to be made in London, but its impact here will affect the employment of 300 people in my electorate. It would be easy for the Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) to say that those workers can shift from Melbourne to Sydney, but why should they have to go from Melbourne to Sydney? Why has a decision of this type been made overseas at all? The Commonwealth Government apparently is doing nothing to stop this sort of thing. I should say that no honourable member knew what the firm' of Philip Hill was or what it did, but apparently that firm knows what it can do in Australia because of the inactivity of the Government. We have taken this opportunity to point out to the Government that we are not making one, two, three or ten points about what should be done but are suggesting that the Government should at least take stock now and should not be begging the United States of America to make inapplicable to Australia conditions it thinks should be applied to safeguard its balance of payments situation. We ask the Government: Why not do as the United States of America has done and as the United Kingdom has done-recognis e that this is a critical problem? We believe that much of the money which comes to Australia-and which is referred to as private foreign investmentis applied to doing what we could be doing ourselves if some of our Australian firms got off their tails and became active instead of taking things easy. It is all right for the Treasurer to suggest that the Opposition is making an attack on secondary industry. We are not attacking secondary industry at large, but some sections of Australia's secondary industry deserve to be attacked for Can the Minister at the table-the Minister for Housing-tel l me why we need overseas interests to exploit our iron ore resources in Western Australia? Can the honourable members who represent electorates in Sydney tell me why we need a consortium of Japanese, American and English firms to export coal from New South Wales? These overseas interests are apparently clever enough to export in unison and they play one colliery against another to get the best price. This is to the detriment of Australia's overseas earnings. This is the sort of problem of whose existence, we claim, the Government should be aware, and for which it should be taking remedial action.

98,Mr Bury (Wentworfo,"^Mini9ter for' Housing) [4.2] I moveMr Speaker, Customs Tariff Proposals No. 35, which I have just tabled, relate to proposed amendments of the Customs Tariff 1933-1964 and give effect to the Government's decisions in respect of the Tariff Board's reports on umbrellas and sunshades; static transformers; laboratory, hygienic and pharmaceutical glassware; and continuous filament acetate yarn. The new duties will take effect from tomorrow morning. At a later stage I shall table the relevant reports. The Board's report on umbrellas and sunshades indicates that the Australian industry produces articles of unquestioned quality that compare favourably with the best produced anywhere in the world and that the industry has increased its production and sales over the past three years. In the Board's opinion, the present duties are more than are required to enable the more efficient producers to obtain a reasonable return on funds employed. On its recommendation, therefore, the duties on ordinary umbrellas are being reduced by 7 i per cent, ad valorem and other types of umbrellas are being grouped under one item at rates about equivalent to the present level. The Board, in its report on high voltage static transformers, has recommended extension of the present protective rates of duty to cover all transformers with ratings exceeding 50 kVA. This will remove the upper capacity limit from the protected range and obviate the need for periodic reviews of the industry as the capacity to produce larger transformers is developed. In place of an upper limit in the protected range it is proposed that any transformers of a type or size not reasonably available from local production should be admitted at concessional rates of duty under customs by-law in accordance with normal by-law criteria. In addition, transformers which are on firm contract overseas on or before today, and which would otherwise have been dutiable at non-protective rates, will Housing) I present reports by the Tariff be admitted at concessional rates of duty Board on the following subjectsunder Customs by-law. The Tariff Board has recommended continuation of the current level of assistance accorded the manufacture of laboratory glassware and recommends that hygienic and pharmaceutical glassware be made dutiable at the same rates, namely 20 per cent, ad valorem under the British preferential tariff and 30 per cent, ad valorem otherwise. In arriving at its conclusions, the Board had regard for the fact that the industry provides considerable employment, uses indigenous raw materials and is an important sector of an integrated glassware industry. Two references were considered by the Tariff Board in regard to the production of continuous filament acetate yarn. The first arose from the need to review the bounty of 9d. per lb. which was recommended by the Board in March, 1962, and the second arose from alleged dumping of acetate yarn in this country. The Board has found that marked increases in production, coupled with greater efficiency, have substantially reduced costs in Australia and allowed improved returns on funds employed. The Board has therefore recommended that the bounty be discontinued as from 30th June, 1965, that the existing duties on secondary acetate yarn-1 0 per cent, ad valorem British preferential and 22i per cent, ad valorem otherwise-be not varied, and that minimum rates should be applied to triacetate yarn which is not produced in this country. The Board found that dumping of continuous filament secondary acetate yarn had occurred and appropriate action is therefore being taken by my colleague, the Minister for Customs and Excise under the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. I commend the proposals to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Dr. J. F. Cairns) adjourned. Reports on Items. Continuous filament acetate yarn. Laboratory, hygienic and pharmaceutical glassware.

99,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forMinisterial Statement. Debate resumed (vide page 787). Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [4.8] -It has been obvious during the course of the examination of this problem over the last week or two, and today, that the Government considers that the Australian economy and, in turn, the Government of Australia, are facing a very serious situation because of the changed policy in the United States of America and elsewhere with respect to the export of capital, including its export to Australia. We have had the advantage of listening to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) foreign capital. Then he added about 150 spend some considerable time delivering one of the most suppressed speeches I have ever heard him make in this chamber. We know he is facing a difficult situation. We have just heard an admission from the Minister for Housing (Mir. Bury) that the Treasurer is facing a complex and difficult situation. He wished the Treasurer well on his difficult mission. Having listened to the Treasurer, and having had the opportunity to evaluate his attitude to this question of capital inflow, I do not think the Secretary to the Treasury in the United States, Mr Dillon, has anything to worry about with respect to the strength, relevance or significance of the effect that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia will have on him. I hold this opinion because the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Mr Harold Holt, does not fully appreciate the difficulcapital inflow, I have very little hope for ties and risks that are imposed upon our economy by the importation of foreign capital into it. The Treasurer went to some trouble this he had had something to say about the risks afternoon to point out that he had searched of capital inflow. But ever since then-in through the records and found one occasion fact, since 15 years ago, 10 years ago or -12t h July 1963-o n which he had had even 5 years ago-the Government has something to say about the risks of capital followed the same policy. It has never inflow. He said he had done this because, changed its favourable policy towards all over a period of months, he had been capital inflow. Even today it is following challenged by me and others to give some the same policy as it did years ago. Although evidence that he was even aware of the on one occasion the Treasurer might have risks and difficulties involved. After searchrecognised some of the risks of capital ing through "" Hansard "", he was able to find inflow, the policy of this Government has one occasion-12t h July 1963-whe n remained the same. It has remained the he had said something about the risks of same desnite the clear and vivid warning capital inflow. We heard him read from given by the Minister for Trade and what he said on that occasion. The astonishing thing was that he began with a great eulogy of capital inflow. He told us about the need for it to maintain growth and stability in Australia. He said that capital goes where it is welcomed, and, of course, it was welcomed to an unlimited extent in Australia, and that it stays where it is well treated. It has certainly been well treated in Australia. He said that capital inflow was of great assistance in maintaining our balance of payments, in carrying out our immigration programme, in developing our resources, in enabling us to carry out better research work and in enabling us to introduce new managerial techniques. In fact, he used about 600 words on praising words of criticism of the Australian Labour Party for its attitude to the question. Finally, in a mere 100 words or so, he said something about some of the risks that were involved. Only about one-tenth of his total time was spent in telling us something about the risks. Then he said that the Government was not unmindful of the risks, and he referred to the difficulty of servicing the interest bill and of financing the export of profits. He referred also to the question of Australian participation in industries. After having said so little on the question he returned to a eulogy of foreign capital and saidThe risks are minor compared to the risks of not encouraging capital inflow. If the occasion to which the Treasurer referred is the only one he can discover on which he said something about the risks of his mission to the United States of America. But that is not the only thing. The Treasurer said that on one occasion in 1963 same party as that to which the Minister who will be following me in this debate belongs. I should like to know what the Minister who will follow me thinks of the contrast in the attitudes of the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Treasurer on this matter. I should like to know whether the Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair) who is to follow me, is satisfied with the Government's inactivity with respect to a policy on these matters and the fact that it has done nothing to discourage takeovers in Australia or to discourage our selling of our heritagea little bit of the farm every year, as the Minister for Trade and Industry put it on one occasion. I should like to know how the Country Party Minister for Social Services reconciles these things. The Treasurer then went on to criticise the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) for saying that we had a dangerous dependence on capital inflow, and he quoted figures relating to capital inflow from the year 1959-60 to the year 1963-64, when capital inflow totalled £215 million. The Treasurer stated that during these years the capital inflow had been steady and that the figures showed no indication of an increasing dependence upon it. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) completely disposed of this argument, and the Minister for Housing, who obviously did not prepare his speech well, ignored completely what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had said. He ignored the fact that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had completely demolished the Treasurer's criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that we had an increasing dependence upon capital inflow because, despite the fact that the inflow itself was good, the outflow had now reached a point where it exceeded the inflow and that therefore the inflow was making no net contribution to the balance of payments at all. In this way he proved that we must have an increasing dependence upon capital inflow to maintain our balance of payments. WhatI want to know, and what the Opposition and the people of Australia have a right to know, is whether the Treasurer is aware of this and whether the Minister for Housing, who is said to have had experience in Treasury matters, is aware of it. Why is it that we find the Treasurer being proved wrong in one case and in the other case the Minister for Housing completely ignoring the effective criticism of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports? What kind of Government is it that allows a debate of this kind to pass in this fashion? A little while ago the Minister for Housing, chose to attack the Leader of the Opposition. He said that the Leader of the Opposition should bring himself up to date. We are living, he said, in a world economy in which the best results can be achieved only in a large country. He said that 50 million people are not enough. How are we going to get 50 million people in Australia at this rate? In any case the Minister for Housing said that this was not enough, that we are living in a world economy, that the Leader of the Opposition has cut himself off from it and wanted to cut us off, too. When a country is in difficulties over its balance of payments it may adopt one of two alternative procedures. If it is short of overseas currency it can adopt a policy of restricting expenditure at home which reduces income and employment until, having restricted expenditure everywhere at home, on things that are essential as well as on other things, it must restrict also its expenditure on imports until the balance of payments is brought back into line. This is implicit in the position of the Minister for Housing. The Minister is living in the 1930's, with his head in ancient textbooks. What the world has seen since that time is the alternative method of dealing with a balance of payments problem. That method is not to impose a credit squeeze to restrict expenditure in every section of the economy and so bring employment and income down; the method involves taking a much more sensible attitude towards your balance of payments and saying: ""We are not going to be dictated to completely by our balance of payments and we are not going to see unemployment rise as it did in the 1930's "". That sort of development only produces a Hitler, as the Minister for Housing has already said; it results inevitably in what happened in 1961, a situation which almost brought about the defeat of the Government.",52,Tariff Board
100,"Industry ( Mr Mcewen), A Member Of The","However much the members of the Government including the Minister for Housing who still follows the textbooks of the 1930's and earlier dislike the fact, they cannot follow that kind of policy because if they do they will be swept out of office. The Minister for Social Services and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Who is right, the Prime Minister of AusMalcolm Fraser), who also lives in the 1930's as far as economic textbooks are concerned, will have their opportunities to deal with this matter later, and I challenge them to do so. We now need something much more permanent than the haphazard credit squeeze policy to which the Government is dedicated. Let me return to the situation that brought about this debate. The Australian Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) considered that Australia's economic situation was so serious that he had to direct to the President of the United States of America a letter which I do not think has been equalled in modern times in Australia as a statement of the severity of the difficulties that face this country. I will refer to that letter in a few minutes. It points out vividly and in detail the difficulties that Australia faces at the present time. It makes out a strong case to support the contention that the situation is serious and urgent. Would the Prime Minister of Australia direct such a letter to the President of the United States if he did not think the situation was serious and urgent? Then what reply did he receive from the President of the United States? He received an answer which showed that the Prime Minister's view of the situation is as far removed from that of the President of the US. as the Prime Minister's view about negotiations in South Vietnam yesterday was from that of the President of the US. today. The Prime Minister said that he was forever opposed to negotiation in South Vietnam and denounced negotiation, but today the President of the US. has said that he is in favour of unconditional negotiation in South Vietnam. The reply received by the Prime Minister to his letter about the economic situation shows that his view is very different from that of the President of the US. Is this an illustration of the special relationship between Australia and the US. about which the Treasurer was so concerned a few moments ago? Let me now turn to the letter sent to the President of the US. Having looked at the Prime Minister's letter which said that the economic situation in Australia was serious and difficult, the President saidWe believe, therefore, that this programme will not impose undue strain on Australia. tralia or the President of the US.? The point I want to make as clearly as I can is that these two letters show a fundamental difference between the diagnoses by the two gentlemen of the Australian situation. It is the responsibility of the Government, of the Treasurer, the Minister for Housing, the Minister for Social Services and whoever will be following him to deal with this fundamental difference between the leaders of the two countries. Nobody on the Government side so far has considered it necessary to mention the matter. Let us look at the Prime Minister's letter and see whether we can form some judgment ourselves as to how serious the situation is. The letter began with an illustration of the difficulties. It said at page 4For the financial year ahead, the signs point to a continued drain on our external reserves. The Prime Minister said that we will be in difficulties because of this continuing drain. On page 5 he saidIn what at present appears to be a deteriorating balance of payments situation, any substantial falling off in capital inflow would be a matter of serious concern to the Australian Government. The Prime Minister said that if there is a falling off in capital inflow-and there is no doubt that there will be-it will be a matter of serious concern to the Australian Government. He said, furtherOn the other hand, however, we would be troubled and embarrassed if United States investors were to begin repatriating capital. Is this an illustration of the special relationship that Australia has established with the United States? The Prime Minister also said on page 4 of his letter that Australia had agreed to spend 550 million dollars on procurement in the United States. He said that this undertaking was entered into without any realisation that America was going to change her policy in respect of capital outflow. Have we here another illustration of the special relationship that exists between Australia and the United States? We commit ourselves to spending 550 million dollars in the United States on defence procurement and then the United States Government changes its policy in relation to the export of capital. Surely we can establish a little better relationship than that with the United States. What this country needs is not sycophancy; it needs a government that will stand up for Australian interests for a change. If we had a Government that would do this we would achieve much better results with the United States, because whatever you may say about the United States Government it is always ready to listen to people who speak clearly about their own interests. I do not think that the American Government appreciates the subservience that has been demonstrated by the leaders of this country in their dealings with the United States in recent years. The Prime Minister went on to mention the general deficit that Australia has suffered for so long. He pointed out that we have been living on capital inflow for 14 or 15 years. He gave the details and astonishingly high figures were revealed. Then he referred to the particular position with respect to the United States and he saidIn the half year to December 1964 Australia's recorded exports to the United States were 153.2 million dollars compared with 180.3 million dollars for the same period of 1963, a decline of 15 per cent., whereas Australia's recorded imports from the United States increased as between these two periods from 273.7 million dollars to 392 million dollars, a rise of 43 per cent. Does this give us an illustration of the special relationship that exists between Australia and the United States and upon which the Treasurer has laid so much stress? If the Government cannot do something better than this in respect of the export to the United States of the critical commodities of wool, lead, zinc, meat and sugar, then it cannot claim to have established any special relationship with that country. I think we must face the fact that Australia cannot afford to waste its resources. We have for too long conducted ourselves with a sort of affluence consciousness. We do not believe that Australia really must be careful with her resources. But we must be careful with our resources and we must devise an economic policy that will reflect this care. I will turn for a minute or two to some of the steps that we can take to exercise this care. I think the situation is a serious one. The letter written by the Prime Minister to the President shows the seriousness of the situation. What we need in this country is not a reduction of productive capital from overseas. I believe we want someone who will stand up for Australian interests and who will not be subservient. I believe we want someone who will be able to distinguish between one form of capital inflow and another. I believe we want more Australian control of the kind of capital we are getting. We want productive capital, but we do not want portfolio or takeover capital. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports spoke of the firm of Philip Hill, which has established itself in Rhodesia, South Africa and Australia as take-over specialists. We do not want any take-over specialist in this country. The Minister for Trade and Industry has for a long time been stressing that something must be done to discourage portfolio and takeover capital, Whatever we may do about productive capital. I am sure die Minister for Social Services, who will follow me in this debate, cannot ignore this. When will the Government, which the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Social Services so consistently support, take action on the lines made so clear by the Minister for Trade and Industry and by the Australian Labour Party? I believe that we want more control over the type of capital coming into this country. We want all the productive capital we can get, because we need to expand our economy as much as possible. In addition, we need to consider the industrial policy of the foreign capital investment. We have recently had the example of the stoppage at Mount Isa, which has devastated part of the Australian economy for a considerable time. That stoppage came about because of the policy of the American company that owns Mount Isa. It is a policy that will not allow any industrial democracy in that industry. It is a policy which means that the decisions made about the employment of men in this country will be made by experts acting on behalf of the company, and the men will never have an opportunity to speak for themselves. We have to be concerned to know whether we will accept this kind of industrial steamroller on our economic conditions or whether we will be prepared to stand for industrial democracy on the part of the Australian worker. I can understand the Fascist type of mentalities of those who react to this type of thing, who are activated by foreign ideas and foreign ideologies, and who are prepared to see Australian democracy broken down by the monopolies that come from overseas. I suggest that we must also give up relying on monetary policy and fiscal policy, because these methods of trying to regulate the economy have failed so significantly in recent years. We must not rely any longer on a credit squeeze policy; we must realise that there are more successful ways of controlling and developing the Australian economy in the future and that these are closely related to the problems that arise out of foreign capital and investment. honourable gentleman's time has expired. for Social Services) [4.29] -It is indeed surarguing to and fro about the relative merits prising in a debate of this nature to hear the of overseas investment in Australia. There is honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. no doubt that Australia's present prosperity Cairns) being so bold as to mention the is due to a considerable extent to this overMt.

Indeed, in his letter to the economic progress has been significantly Prime Minister, the President of the United disturbed by the quite unwarranted dispute States refers to the high standard of living at Mt.

The honourable member for Yarra that we enjoy in Australia and to the way in probably knows more of this dispute than which this high standard of living is related does any other honourable member in this back to United States investment and to House. I believe that if we are really to other overseas investment in this country, consider the future of our country, we must ft is not only the President of the United ensure that we continue to receive large States who is aware of this considerable amounts of overseas capital. When capital is effect that overseas investment has had on invested in this country, as it has been our overall prosperity.

In fact, overseas capital has come into the country, it is necessarily bad, and because it is overseas capital these people apparently are prepared to cause unrest and to prevent production, without any consideration whatever for the overall effect on the Australian economy. If we look at the consequential effects of the Mt. Isa dispute on the price of copper, for example, and the price of goods sold in the stores right throughout the country, there can be no doubt that the Mt. Isa struggle, if you like to call it that, has had a disastrous effect on every section of the Australian economy. The men and women in the street, the people whom Opposition members claim they represent, are probably being more affected than most.

102,Mr Sinclair (New England,"Minister have spent most of their time this afternoonI think overseas investment has made two notable contributions. The first, of course, is the improved living standards and the other is the development of other means of production and of industries that otherwise we may have found it impossible to start. The industry at Mount Isa, which was mentioned this afternoon by the honourable member for Yarra, is more notable than most. But for overseas investment, Mount Isa would not have been the prosperous community of yesteryear or the community we hope will be prosperous tomorrow. Without overseas investment, Mount Isa would never have existed, and it is for this reason that I completely deplore the honourable member's reference to the Mount Isa situation. In terms of the present and future of this country, we will continually be dependent, at least in the immediate future, upon the import of capital. Considerable reference has been made to this by the Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) and the Treasurer. If we look at the statistics of Australian trade in the immediate future, the necessity for the continuation of overseas investment is even further emphasised. Unfortunately, the prices that we are at present receiving for so many Australia exports seem to be declining. When we compare the picture of last financial year's trade receipts with receipts in the eight months to February of diis financial year, it seems that the future position will be considerably worse than it otherwise might have been. As all honourable members are only too weU aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, approximately 78.5 per cent, of Australia's export income is earned by our great primary products. This percentage, of course, is made up by a wide range of products, but notably wool and sugar, and these are the two commodities that I wish to mention particularly. The figures for the eight months period to February 1965, compared with the figures in the export price indices, show that wool export earnings have fallen by 12.2 per cent, and sugar export earnings by 41.7 per cent. This decline must have a considerable effect on Australia's net export income in the current year. Our export earnings will be even more affected if the dry time through which so much of eastern Australia is passing at present is prolonged. If not only the prices that we receive for our primary products but also the volume that we produce declines, our situation will be considerably worse than it otherwise might be. For this reason, I believe that of more moment, probably, than the latter parts of the letter written by the Prime Minister to President Johnson of the United States of America are those parts that refer to Australia's trade relations with the United States. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, will recall that the Prime Minister referred in particular to wool, which I have just mentioned. He mentioned also lead and zinc, meat and sugar. I thought I might take up a few minutes of the time of the House in describing what I think is the situation and the reasons why I think that as important as any part of the negotiations conducted by the Treasurer in the United States of America will be that part concerned with obtaining greater access to the United States market for Australia's major exports. As honourable members are only too well aware, as a result of the inauguration of the European Economic Community, the balance of payments situation of the United States vis-a-vis Europe came under deep consideration in the United States of America. As a result of this, during 1962, the late President Kennedy developed a proposal for negotiations on the basis of a 50 per cent, across the board cut in tariffs, coupled with simultaneous negotiations on non-tariff barriers to trade -that is, import quotas, etc. At a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade held in Geneva in May 1963, it was decided that certain principles would be adopted as a basis on which the Kennedy Round of negotiations could proceed. These principles were: The tariff negotiations should be based on a substantial across the board linear cut, with a minimum of excepted items. The negotiations should deal with agricultural products with a view to providing expanded free world markets for these products. The negotiations should deal with non-tariff barriers-that is, quotas, etc. -as well as tariff barriers, and every effort should be made to reduce barriers to exports of the less developed countries. Fortunately, as a result of the efforts of representatives of the Australian Government, led by the Minister for Trade and secure recognition of the peculiar situation",57,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
103,"Industry ( Mr Mcewen), It Was Possible To","in which Australia found herself. This was a situation in which Australia was not quite one of the developed countries; nor was she one of the under-developed countries. This situation arose from the tremendous preponderance of primary products in our export trade. Because of this situation and the fact that we were trying to develop our exports of manufactured goods, Australia's situation was seen as somewhat different from that of the other countries concerned. Certainly, a tremendous amount has been achieved in recent years in the expansion of our export trade in manufactured goods. This is an aspect of the situation that I want to emphasise before I conclude. With respect to the Kennedy Round of negotiations, Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that the United States has shown her apparent willingness to open across the board negotiations and to reduce tariffs and trade barriers. Unfortunately, in our trade relations with that country, certain of our primary products are not earning as much in dollar currency as might otherwise be the case. The first instance that comes to mind, for example, is that of sugar. I understand that Australia is the second largest sugar exporting country at present. Honourable members are only too well aware of the situation that arose after the breach with Cuba. Since that breach occurred, Australia has built up a very valuable trade in sugar with the United. States, which, I understand, is now our third largest sugar market, coming after only the United Kingdom and Japan. Under the terms of the United States Sugar Act of 1962, certain allocations of sugar quotas were made for specific countries. Australia's quota is not a specific one. quota restrictions on wool imports, mainIt comes under a section of the United States Act which, I understand, is described in the phrase "" other country quotas "". This makes no recognition of the substantial size of our exports of sugar to the United States and no real recognition of the very considerable part that sugar exports play in our developing economy. But not only sugar exports are affected. reduction in the demand by American manuThe United States has imposed restrictions facturers for raw wool and a turning also on imports of meat. The Prime towards artificial fibres. In fact, the USA. Minister's letter to President Johnson is the only highly industrialised country that mentions the effect of the meat quota that today imposes a heavy duty on wool was applied some years ago. As honourable imports. While we do not deny for one members know only too well, at one stage, moment the right of a country to maintain Australia's exports of meat to the United a reasonable level of protection for domestic States increased considerably and, but for the very buoyant situation that arose in the United Kingdom and Europe, the restrictions imposed by the USA. might well have severely affected our overall meat exports. As it happened, although we voluntarily limited exports to the United States the considerable increase in our exports to Western Europe and the United Kingdom meant that these quota restrictions in the United States had no real effect on our total meat exports. In fact, there was a reduction in Australia's exports of meat to that country which was caused solely by the rise in prices on the United Kingdom and European markets, with a consequential diversion of our meat exports from the American market to those markets. But for this rise in prices in the United Kingdom and Europe, Australia may have been considerably affected by the American quota restrictions. One of the things about which some people in Australia were perturbed at that time was the fact that, following these voluntary restrictions and substantial agreement between the Governments of the USA. and Australia on this matter, the United States Congress, in August 1964, passed legislation that imposed meat import quota restrictions in certain circumstances. This is another instance of restrictions imposed by the United States on imports of Australian exports affecting our balance of payments position with respect to that country. I believe that the situation is perhaps more acute in respect of wool than any other product. Unfortunately, at present, the United States, though it does not impose tains a heavy duty on imports of raw wool. I understand that at present the duty is 25i cents per lb. of clean content finer than 44's, greasy or washed. This very heavy import duty has meant that Australia is not able to export to the United States as much raw wool as we would otherwise be able to sell in that country. One of the problems that arises is that there is a consequential Industries-ther e is no doubt that perhaps in many ways the wool industry in the United States has been in need of some duty restrictions on the imports of wool in the past-it does seem that there is a basis for consideration by the United States Administration at this stage of some lifting of the present rates of duty. Surely if this were done Australia would be in a better position to improve its balance of payment situation because of the trade between the two countries. Quantitative restrictions apply to dairy products and apply also to lead and zinc. The situation in regard to lead and zinc is probably worse than it might have been because since lst October 1958 imports of lead and zinc by the USA. have been restricted to 80 per cent, of the average commercial imports in a period between 1953 and 1957. Since 1958 there has been considerable internal development in Australia in our capacity to manufacture lead and zinc with the result that greater quantities of lead and zinc have been available for export. I do not think Australia can be accused, as honourable members opposite have suggested, of going cap in hand to the United States and suggesting that Australia will be in a disastrous position unless we are able to achieve some lightening of the implications of the measures which are to be introduced by the United States Administration. Within Australia a tremendous amount has been done to stimulate exports by Australian manufacturers and to stimulate interest in exports among other people in Australia. I was somewhat intrigued this morning to read the editorial in the ""Australian"" under the heading ""Go it with Exports"". In the article emphasis is given to the fact that the whole future of Australia depends upon our increasing ability to fend for ourselves, on our increasing ability to be able to earn by exporting and on our increasing ability to be not dependent upon the inflow of overseas capital to offset the adverse balance of trade but to earn by increased trade a more favourable position. This is what we all hope will occur in the future. But as the Prime Minister very rightly pointed out in his letter, Australia has not sought aid in the past. We have not at any stage participated in the tremendous foreign aid programmes of the United States Administration. Rather, we have supplied aid to underdeveloped countries. This is a country that has stood on its own two feet. It is a young country and a developing country. For this reason I feel that we must continue to have considerable amounts of overseas capital coming into Australia. I believe that it would be disastrous to our whole future development if excessive restrictions were imposed by friendly countries such as the United States on the continued export of their capital. I believe that our trading position could well be improved if we could only get greater access to the United States market. honourable member's time has expired. Minister for Social Services( Mr Sinclair), who has just resumed his seat, quoted at some length remarks made by the Minister also introduced into the debate a number of matters associated with Australia's trade with other countries. Naturally that subject must form part of this discussion. But where is the Minister for Trade and Industry? Why is he not taking part in a discussion that, fundamentally, is concerned with the Department that he administers? I am reminded of a picture of a negro fleeing from a bear and saying: "" Qh Lord, if you cannot help me, for God's sake don't help that there bear"". The Minister for Trade and Industry has evidendy said to the Government: "" I certainly cannot go into that House and help you in this debate; the best I can do is not help that bear-the Opposition in this Parliament"". That is quite evident. What is the problem that faces Australia today? Is it as grievous as the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) set out in his communication to the President of the United States of America? Is it of such importance that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) must immediately drop everything that he is doing in Australia and make a frantic dash to the United States in an endeavour to do what the Prime Minister's communication has failed to do? Is the problem such that the Treasurer should then go to No. 10 Downing Street to plead for preferential treatment for Australia to save our economy from disaster?",58,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
104,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The,60,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
105,Mr Peters (Scullin) [4.49],The,60,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
106,For Trade And Industry ( Mr Mcewen). He,"member think? tainly is the position. Our trading operations with other countries this year have been such that we will have a deficit in our balance of payments of about £400 million. Only once in our history have we had a greater deficit in our balance of payments. How is that deficit to be met? How has it been met in the past? It has been met by the inflow of capital from other countries. Obviously, if we are not to be in a worse position at the end of the year than we were at the beginning of the year £400 million of overseas capital must flow into Australia. During question time today I asked the Prime Minister whether it was true that during the March quarter of this year there had been not an inflow of capital-to liquidate that deficit of £400 million there should have been a capital inflow of about £48 million a month or £120 million for the March quarter-bu t the reverse, with the outflow of capital exceeding by £17 million the inflow of capital. Unless that situation is means, amounted to a little over £1,000 rectified it spells disaster. The flow of capital in that period has been brought about merely as an immediate result of the appeal by the President of the United States to the business interests of that country and tbe action taken by the USA. to reduce the flow of capital from America to Australia and to increase the flow of dividends due to Americans from Australia to the United States. Since the United Kingdom Budget to reduce the outflow of capital from the United Kingdom by at least £125 million a year has become operative, and because a big proportion of that capital comes to Australia, our difficulties have multiplied. That is why the Treasurer, at the behest of the Prime Minister, has dropped all that he has been doing to go to the President of the United States in an attempt to do what the Prime Minister could not do by means of his written communication. That is why, as I said previously, the Treasurer will have to go to the United Kingdom as a suppliant at the feet of the Labour Prime Minister to secure some sort of preferential treatmentat the expense, let us remember, of the people of Great Britain-to promote activity in Australia and to keep our nation solvent. The President of the United States of America and the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain are entitled to say to Australia's representatives: "" The wounds of your country are wounds that have been inflicted by your Government"". In 1950, when this Government took control of the treasury bench, Australia hid full employment and was free of debt to the rest of the world. We had overseas obligations amounting to approximately £500 million but we had overseas funds totalling about £600 million; so we had a favourable overseas balance of about £100 million. At that time the overseas investments in Australia which had accumulated throughout its history totalled between £100 million and £200 million. As I say, in 1950 Australia was free of debt, it had full employment and was self reliant. But since then we have drifted until we have become suppliants at No. 10 Downing Street in London and at the White House in Washington. The inflow of capital into Australia during the past five years, encouraged deliberately by Commonwealth and State Governments by tax concessions and other million. In the previous five years the total was a little over £500 million. In the five years before that it was about £290 million. Every five years the inflow of capital has doubled but the capacity of Australia to meet the demands created by that inflow of capital and to pay off any portion of it has not increased proportionately. Capital is of use to Australia only if it is invested here in such a way that it reproduces itself and if it created goods and services with which to repay the capital and pay dividends. But that is not the position. If it were, periodically our exports would become more immense. They would grow so much that the income from them would exceed the cost of imports plus the cost of invisibles. Instead of becoming increasingly a debtor nation, increasingly under obligations to foreign exploiters, Australia would become a creditor nation, levying toll upon the other nations of the world. I do not want that to happen, but I do want to see Australia stand on its own feet. I want it to be able to meet its obligations overseas by the toil of its people, the utilisation of its manpower and the development of its resources. I do not want to see Australia becoming more and more dependent upon more and more money invested here from overseas.",60,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
107,Mr Nixon,What does the honourable,61,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
108,Mr Peters,"I think that most cerTo a great extent, the inflow of capital to community and contribute nothing to the Australia has not helped in our development. I have always said, and I say now, that insofar as the inflow of capital is of advantage to the Australian people and to the development of the nation, it should be welcomed and encouraged. There is no limit to the amount of wealth of other peoples of the world that we could utilise to develop this nation and its resources to make it more secure in the face of the dangers we must expect in the future. But the capital that has flowed into Australia has not done that. As I have said, it comes into Australia in the form of goods which are unnecessary and unwanted. If it comes in the form of exotic foodstuffs, not to the tune of £5 million, £10 million or £100 million, but to the tune of £1,000 million during 10 years, then the mere entrance of that capital into Australia does not improve our resources or help us in any way. I was horrified the other day to read that it is necessary for the Government of Victoria to go overseas to get manufactured trams to run along the tram lines in the City of Melbourne. That is utterly preposterous. When we want something like that we should not have to look elsewhere. Of course, a considerable proportion of the capital that has come to Australia has been diverted into channels which have constructed large skyscrapers. Manpower and resources in the capital cities and throughout the length and breadth of Australia have been used to build on practically every street corner buildings 20 storeys high for insurance companies, oil companies, hotel companies and organisations of that sort. This has created only surplus office accommodation but it is an avenue of investment for the insurance companies, oil companies and other organisations which have made vast profits here. These things do not add to the production of Australia. They will not enable us to defend ourselves in the hour of danger. They do not create those things that are necessary to enable us to pay our overseas debts. It is not only in that way that capital coming into' Australia had been dissipated and wasted. It has been utilised in vast import organisations which stretch from one end of this country to the other. They are of no use to the ordinary individual in the general welfare of the nation. These things are to be deplored. But they are not like the rains that fall from heaven, over which we have little or no control. They are the direct result of the policies of this Government, which has been warned not once but 50 times in the course of the last 15 years that the policies would cause the disaster that confronts us today, if the Government did not change them. But the Government would not listen to the warnings. It would not listen because it is the jumping jack of pressure groups and the sensitive political instrument of predatory capitalist interests throughout the world, and therefore does the things which capitalism wants it to do and the things which pressure groups and exploiters want it to do and for which ultimately the people of Australia have to pay. I listened with horror to the Minister for Housing( Mr Bury), who traced what happened in the 1920's and 1930's, when, because of the failure to use properly the resources that had come to this country, something that people call a world depression occurred. Of course, in reality the depression was not caused by there not being enough goods in the world. It has been said that difficulties have occurred because the overseas prices of primary products had fallen and there were too few primary products. The Minister for Social Services said that the prices of sugar and wool had decreased already and that, because of droughts, the quantity and quality of goods for overseas will be much lower in the future than in the past. Therefore, in the future, within the resources of this country, we will be less able to finance the smooth working of the Australian economy and the importation of the raw materials and other commodities that are essential to the employment of our people and the smooth working of our economy. That is the position into which this Government has got us. Despite the .. fact that today the Treasurer said: "" I saw that there were some inherent dangers in the inflow of capital and I mentioned them "", what did he do or suggest should be done in order to prevent those inherent dangers bringing about disaster? All he did was to ridicule the Labour Party when we suggested that measures similar to those which operate in Japan and other countries should figures over the last seven years. They are be adopted. Other governments regulate as followsthe flow of capital and goods into thencountries, so that they receive only capital and goods which will promote the development of the country and the welfare of the people and preserve the country's inter; national solvency. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I feel that in this debate so far there has not been the necessary realism from either side of the House, because honourable members have not faced up to the root of the problem that confronts us. There has been a change in the world, particularly in London and New York-tw o great capital markets. It would seem that no longer will the flow of capital available to us in Australia with the same period last year, and we be the same as it has been in the past. We cannot entirely control that situation. We arc not masters of the decisions of overseas two or three other matters which make the investors and businessmen who make these decisions in their own interests or in their sight. In the first place, over the last seven companies' interests. Australians cannot expect to control their policies. We had better concentrate on controlling our own destiny. The investment of foreign capital in Auson which we depend for our export earntralia has been praised and denounced; but the reality has not been recognised. The reality is that when you have an adverse balance of payments on current account you have to get in overseas investment, or you have to draw on your international reserves, if any, and if it is not possible to draw on international reserves you must just go bankrupt. Those are the choices which lie before countries which have adverse trade balances. Australia's trade balances have been adverse. Therefore, we need capital coming into the country unless we are able to draw on our international reserves which at present stand at more than £700 million. As we have these international reserves, the ture by two-thirds, a lot of which will have situation is serious enough, but it is not critical. We do have manoeuvring time, but we had better not waste it. I want honourable prognosis in respect of our balance of trade members to consider our trade balance 195758 -£15 4 million 195859 -£19 2 million 195960 -£23 0 million 196061 -£36 8 million 196162 +£1' million 196263 -£22 6 million 196364 -£1 9 million. Thosefiguresadd up to an adverse balance of nearly £1,200 million. The adverse balance has been more than offset by the capital inflow of approximately £1,500 million over the same period. So we have added £300 million, in round figures, to our international reserves in the last seven years. However, I want honourable members to look forward a little. For thisfinancialyear we will have an adverse balance in excess of £350 million. Honourable members will have seen the trade figures for the first nine months of this financial year. They show a deterioration of £250 million as compared ended last year with a deficit of £19 million. I want honourable members to remember also picture rather worse than it appears at first years we have had a run of exceptionally good seasons. We cannot hope that that run will continue indefinitely. Indeed, it may have ended already. These deficits-the y are very large deficits-hav e been accumulated during a period when our primary industries ings have been enjoying a remarkably favourable run. I will not say anything about the prices that they have enjoyed. It is difficult to forecast what the level of prices will be. However, one other thing should be said: During this period our expenditure on defence has been very much smaller than it has to be in the future. The United Kingdom Budget for defence for this year is more than £A50 a head. Defence expenditure in Australia is less than £30 a head. So to get even up to the United Kingdom level-w e are in a lot more danger than is the United Kingdom at the moment-w e will have to increase our defence expendito be used to purchase equipment from overseas. So the long term or medium term is not favourable.",61,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
109,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,63,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
110,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [5.9],"Tn extenuation, we may urge two things. First, we may argue that we have been absorbing a number of migrants and that the increase in population has put a strain on our interna] resources. Secondly, although not so cogently, we may argue that the rate of development in Australia has been very great. I do not intend to discuss that matter, because there is not sufficient time in which to do so. I summarise my thoughts by saying that, in comparison with the rate of development in other countries, I believe we flatter ourfar too much furnace oil and far too little selves when we speak of our rate of development. We come back to this point: If we are to be less dependent upon capital importsI hope we will be-w e must do something about our trade balance. That means that we must either increase our exports or decrease our imports. Of course, we should try to increase our exports, but our capacity to do this is rather limited by cirumstances in the outside world. We already find it difficult to sell surpluses of some of our primary products, and if we were to increase our production of others very likely we would cause a world suplus and a world slip in prices. We could increase our exports of manufactured goods. We should do so discriminately and within limits, because it would be quite silly for us to try to send manufactured goods to Asia when we do not enjoy in Australia some special inherent advantage in regard to location or materials or skill. The Government's export policy in regard to manufactured goods has, unhappily, been rather indiscriminate and not well judged. If we are to close our trade gap-w e must do so if we are not to maintain our dependence upon imports of capital-w e must decrease our imports of goods. This means, unfortunately, that we must look in Australia for a concerted plan of import replacement. Adoption of such a plan is well and truly overdue. I urge the Government to take this matter in hand before it is too late. There is no need for panic now, because we have overseas reserves of £700 million or even more, including our second line reserves. We must not allow these reserves to be fritted away, unless we use the time available to us to put into effect a concerted plan of import replacement. This would mean going through the schedule of our imports with a fine tooth comb. We must impose tariffs or adopt other means, to substitute local manufactures for imported goods. As I have said, this means that we must adopt a real plan to drive the manufacturing industries forward. They alone can enable us to close our dangerous trade gap. Earlier today some of us were discussing the subject of oil. We import far too much oil because we do not process it in the way in which we should. Our refineries produce petrol from every barrel of crude that they import. It is necessary for us to ensure that our refineries change their practices so that we may use an indigenous fuel such as coal, or better still indigenous oil and gas when we get them, in place of the oil that we import at present. This is the kind of thing we must do. We must cease to import a number of items that we can make in Australia, even though we may produce them more expensively and perhaps not as well. How are we to do this? At the present time we have virtually no unemployed workers; we have full employment in Austraia. There may be some new resources that we can draw upon. For example, we may be able to draw upon elderly, retired people. I know of one sphere in which there are large numbers of women who require employment. We could do more by making better use of our idle machinery. Australian factories work very short hours. Because of idiotic restrictions that are imposed in many cases, our factories are unable to work around the clock when they should, with the result that our costs of production are being driven up. In our present emergency we cannot tolerate this sort of thing. We must see that the machinery that is already in our factories and which does not call for new investment works longer hours. We must get greater efficiency in secondary output. I do not intend to go into the details of how it should be done. There is no general solution of the problem. The little things in hundreds of industries make the difference. Let us resolve to get rid of all artificial impediments to increasing the efficiency of production in secondary industry. To do all this and to reduce our imports-the v must be reduced-wil l mean shortages and a tendency to a rise in prices. I come now to another factor that honourable members on both sides of the House have refused to face up to-the inadequacy of the savings ratio. This is an endemic trouble in Australian industry. It is fairly obvious that our savings are insufficient. A few moments ago in this place the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said otherwise. But he was demonstrably wrong. If our savings were sufficient, we would not be in the position of requiring foreign capital to be imported in order to keep going. The Government, using its power to controlfinancein various ways, must set its sights on an increased savings ratio in the Australian community. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, but I shall mention only two. The time is long overdue to do more to alleviate the pensions means test. The means test has two undesirable features so far as the problem we are now discussing is concerned. The operation of the means test is responsible for removing from productive effort people who would like to work, perhaps only part time, but who adopt the attitude that if they earn additional income they will get nothing extra in the long run because their pension will be reduced and they will lose the benefit of medical and other services. Secondly, the means test in its present form is an impediment to saving and, in some cases, a cause of dis-saving. All honourable members knOw of instances where constituents have come to them and said: "" We have spent our money-dissi pated it. We would not have bought these things if we had not to qualify for the pension "". Every honourable member, if he is honest, will admit that this goes on. It is high time that the Government turned its attention to doing something about the means test which is an impediment to saving and production and is one of the causes behind the balance of trade difficulty with which the Government is labouring and which made it so essential for the Prime Minister to address himself to President Johnson as he did. The second possible approach to the savings problem concerns taxation. We could amend our taxation legislation in such a way as to increase the savings in the community by putting a premium on savings. I have endeavoured to bring forward something of this nature in this House on other occasions and when next our income tax legislation is before us I intend again to move an amendment along these lines, and I hope it will get support. We cannot go on drifting in our present manner. We should not allow ourselves to drift, in this economic sense. This is not a crisis. We have £700 million in kitty in overseas reserves. This allows us manouevring room. It give us time to make the necessary reforms. We cannot expect to continue to maintain adverse balances of trade which, over the past seven years have averaged about £170 million annually and which, for the present year, will be at least twice that sum. We should be tackling the evil at its source. We have to do something. I am afraid we may have to restrict imports to put the fires under our manufacturing industries and drive them forward-. At the same time we should be undertaking, at the Government level, these measures which will increase savings in the community. honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) showed an unexpectedly reasonable approach to this subject. If one looks through his discourse one will see some threads of Australianism in it. He was not completely pessimistic. He did not suggest that even under this Government there is nothing Australia can do to mend its position. This, I think, is partly in the Wentworth tradition, which goes back to his great grandfather. Unfortunately, few honourable members opposite speak and think this way. I would, however, challenge some of his approaches. I think the means test is very important. After all, to place a higher value upon savings than upon wages imposes a burden on the people who live on wages-thos e who have to live on the inadequate basic wage and on the lower income levels generally. However, on the whole I think there were some messages that other honourable members opposite ought to read and learn from the honourable member's speech. I want to challenge the whole basis upon which this debate has proceeded from members opposite. In the last 15 years there has been a serious collapse in the national morale. I am an Australian and I do not think we need to crawl to anyone. Australia is one of the world's wealthiest nations. I wonder how it was that our",63,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
111,Mr Bryant (Wills) [5.28],"Th egrandparents and great managed to create some of the assets of which we make use today. It would be worthwhile for some honourable members to take a look at Australian history. Let them consider how the overland telegraph line was built in 1872, or thereabouts, when the population of this country was a couple of million people. Let them take a look at some of the railway lines-thousand s upon thousands of miles spanning the continentwhich were built when the population was only a half or one-third of what it is today. How is it that a country with the defects and disabilities which honourable members opposite seem to see is able to operate an airline like Qantas? How is it able to construct and develop projects like the Snowy Mountains scheme? Of course, it was symptomatic of the whole philosophy of the conservative parties over the last generation that they could not see any hope in that project. It is worth canvassing history to recall that they thought that the project was a waste of money. Hardly any members of the present Government parties attended the opening ceremony. In many otherfieldsthis nation has made an impact beyond its mere numbers. I discard the idea that we cannot become more self-reliant. We are one of the world's largest exporters of sugar. We are the world's largest fine wool producer. We are one of the world's largest trading countries. We are told that our steel industry is first class and that at various levels it is one of the world's best. These achievements have been accomplished primarily by Australians. We had no need to import anything more than the know how and technical knowledge. We have kept our minds open and Australian management has been capable of meeting the situation. In 1949, this Government inherited a very strong economy. The honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) pointed out some of its features. Our overseas balances were a trifle larger than our overseas indebtedness-w e had a balance of payments in our favour-and despite the our nationhood in this way? When will we rigours of war we had been able to liquidate ever learn? Surely it is one of the simple many of our past difficulties. Australia is a nation with a great deal external position. Of course, the American of internal strength and with people well Government, is very conservative. That it equipped in health, physical vigour, perwould leave action until late in the day sonality and vitality to tackle any problem was logical. But it is illogical that the Auswith which they are faced. I challenge the tralian Government should not have seen grandparents whole premise upon which this Government has been operating in so many fields, of which this is only one. I challenge the Government's encouragement of foreign investment. Actually it has been not just encouragement, but a pleading for it. Our whole financial philosophy has been based upon foreign investment. This applies all through our foreign policies and defence policies, and I challenge them, too. The honourable member for Mackellar says that the Government is not facing the problem. How can it? It has its head in the sand on these questions. Australia is one of the few nations which have not tackled the problem of controlling their economy. Honourable members opposite say: "" You cannot control these things"". How is it that New Zealand has managed to control its economy and overseas investment? What about India, a new nation in a sense? It has found no difficulty in getting Indian shareholdings in some of the American companies. For instance, the International Harvester Co. which operates here, I think exclusively under American management and with American shareholding, in India operates with some Indian shareholding. Other countries with long traditions and long histories have found it necessary and advisable to exercise controls. I instance Holland and Japan. Japan is one of the world's great trading nations. If Japan has found control necessary, and has been able to exercise it, why cannot we do it? This goes for France, and a number of other countries, too. I want to know what is wrong with our commercial intelligence. The Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) spent many years in the United States of America and he took part in international financial dicussions. He indicated that we had received advice; that warnings had gone out over the last few years intimating that what is happening now was likely to happen. Why did we not look and act before now? Why have we so continually abdicated elements of economic policy that governments take internal action to preserve their that this would happen. Of course, this is one of the most doctrinaire governments in the Western or free world. It is stricken with doctrines which have been discarded practically everywhere in the world. The Minister for Housing says that this is the world of the bigger and bigger country. He says that even Great Britain will not be able to control its own destiny in this way. The logical deduction to be drawn from his remarks is that eventually and inevitably there will be a takeover by the Chinese. What nonsense this is. Do representatives of other nations speak in this pettifogging and pussyfooting way? Can honourable members imagine an Israeli, a Swiss, a Swede, a Dutchman or a Belgian speaking that way? Of course not. They have tiny countries; but history has not been made by the big battalions. England was only a tiny country when it started to impress itself upon the history of the last 300 or 400 years. What is wrong with us? Why must we plead with people to pour their money into this country? And do they pour it in? Examine for a moment General MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd. which has established a magnificent industry under first class management, though occasionally it has rows with tbe industrial unions. But what did it bring to this country? Is it not true that its initial investment was a loan of £2.5 million from an Australian bank to launch the industry? Now its capital value is about £78 million, which has all been obtained from Australian customers, from the happy owners of Holden vehicles. In return, Australia has acquired a millstone of debt in repayment of the investment. What did Australia gain that was worth £76 million over and above the £2i million borrowed from an Australian bank? Consider the case of the Mount Isa railway. The Queensland Government was at the time of its reconstruction, and is now, very conservative. A few years ago it was unable to find from its own resources the means to remodel the Mount Isa railway. So it pleaded to the Commonwealth Treasurer who in turn pleaded to the World Bank. The World Bank said: "" You are one of the wealthy countries of the world. Do it yourself "". And we found that we were able to do the job. What would have happened if we had borrowed money overseas for the purpose? Would we have imported one sleeper, one rail, One pound of ballast or one engineer? No. We would have gained only a millstone of debt for every railroad user in that area for years to come. SoI regard the document we are discussing as one of the most humiliating documents placed before the Australian Parliament for a long time past. I repeat: What is wrong with us? The Prime Minister, repeating the Treasurer's words, writes to the President of the United States of AmericaAustralia is not a "" developed "" country. . . . That is absolute nonsense. We have three million square miles of territory and we have eleven million people with greater personal wealth than almost any other nation. We have a greater investment in railways, telephone systems and roads a head of population than almost any other country in the world. We may well say that there are lots of jobs still to be done. So there are, everywhere. I visited the tiny country of Israel, with a population of two million people-fewe r than Melbourne-and a territory of eight thousand square miles. This is not equal to a decent sized Federal electorate. The Israelis are able to find plenty to do there. It is a case of humanity, not a question of space and having it all. It is a question of the vitality of the people and its Government. The Australian Government has deserted its post. So we find in the letter admissions of past improvidence and we are pleading for help because we have to pay back overseas debts. A debt of 200 million dollars matures in the next five years; 130 million dollars is due for repayment to the International Bank in that period. Whose fault is that? What was the great profit to Australia when we acquired most of these debts under the present regime? Is this the way in which a sovereign, national government should place its case before another nation?. Of course not. The Prime Minister said in his correspondence-an y substantial falling off in capital inflow would be a matter of serious concern. . . . Why is that so? Because the Minister for we have to sell part of the farm to pay off the mortgage and the interest burden. We are creating a future storm for later generations to weather. The Prime Minister, who",65,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
112,"Trade ( Mr Mcewen) Has Said On Occasions,","at one point in time ventured onto the world stage to solve a lot of problems, writes that we would be troubled and embarrassed by a cessation or diminution of the inflow of capital. We have 11 million people. We are one of the world's largest trading nations. We can buy aircraft worth £3 million each by the half dozen, yet our Prime Minister says that we would be troubled if the inflow of capital dropped by perhaps £50 million or £100 million in a year. We would be troubled only because we have failed to face the facts and the problems that would flow from such a consequence and because we have not taken the action we ought lo have taken. I come now to the most touching part of the letter, a part which ought to insult every Australian. The Prime Minister saidOur own policies in these important fields have, we believe, had the encouragement and approval of successive United States' Administrations. The tame colonial boys. The new generation of colonial spirits. The people who have had to have the approval of somebody else bestowed upon them. Defence projects are mentioned. A lot of them are ones for which necessarily we would have to acquire equipment overseas, but a great deal of them can be challenged, I think, on the ground that they should have been completed here. One of our largest investments overseas is in the construction of destroyers which could well have been built in this country. What did the President of the United States think? He said. . . we believe after careful review that our Balance of Payments Program is not likely to have a serious adverse effect on the Australian economy. Government never learns. The Opposition But, of course, he did not know with whom he was dealing-wit h people unable to learn any of the lessons of history. Any nation with any sense of its own security takes corrective action and planning action. We do not need to go very far to find the answer. It was in all the history books when I went to school. Most honourable members opposite probably learnt about the British Navigation Acts. They may not have been as successful as some historians say, but this goes back over 700 or 800 years during which time the British protected their line. Sweden, with a population of about trading position by special acts of Parliaseven million, is able to do these things. ment and special regulation of trade. What about the United States of America, becoming just another Japanese quarry. the home of private enterprise and free Our mining interests are falling increasingly flowing capital? In his letter the Prime into the hands of foreign investors. Of the Minister pointed out that American wool 500 largest companies in Australia, 225 are tariffs are a serious inhibition of our trade. America's attitude toward our exports of lead and zinc has prevented us expanding our trade. The Minister for Trade constantly pleads for Americans to buy more meat from us. They will not do so because they are protecting their own home producers. The United States, obviously the world's most powerful industrial country, has found it necessary and expedient throughout its history to protect its national position by innumerable methods and pieces of legislative machinery. It has usually been a high tariff country. It was pointed out at question time this morning that America is paying a subsidy to wheat producers. It has its own shipping industry. One of the basic reasons why Australia is continually in trouble is because we have failed to establish our own shipping line. The United States has realised that shipping is vital to its commerce and defence, and substantial support has been given to its shipping industries in all sorts of ways for many years. Construction subsidies are paid, loans granted and preferences granted for certain cargoes. If the great nation of the United States and almost every other nation on this planet throughout history have been conscious of the necessity to protect their trading position and interests by implementing controls of all sorts, why has not this Government controlled overseas investment in Australia over the last 15 years? Britain, Switzerland, New Zealand, India and France have done so. You might say that everybody is doing so except us. But the present believes that it is the duty of every country to take an active interest in determining its own destiny. I say that is the Socialist view. It includes political action. Our political policies flow from this type of thinking. So it is in economics. We must be self reliant in the economic field. But the Government has ensured that in so many fields we cannot be self-reliant. We are always crying poor and pleading that we cannot do it. Australia should have its own shipping The Australian continent is rapidly controlled as to more than 51 per cent, of their capital by non-Australians. How can we tolerate such a position? This is a problem that the whole world will have to face. These multi-national corporations are getting beyond the control of even the most powerful governments because, by operating across national frontiers, they are becoming supra-national. This is a challenge to all of us. This is not just something that challenges people like members of the Opposition, who are Socialists and who believe that this kind of enterprise should be controlled. It challenges anybody with any national spirit and concern for his sovereignty. We are constantly conscious of decisions made elsewhere affecting our welfare. We have one of the largest motor car industries in the world. If decisions are made to make retrenchments in the industry, those decisions will be made in Detroit, London, Hamburg or elsewhere but not in the board rooms of Melbourne and Sydney or the directorates of Canberra. The same thing applies to shipping freights. Recently the freight on apples was increased to 16s. a case. That must have been a bitter blow to Tasmanian interests. Who made that decision? Did any Australians participate in it? Of course, a few people represented by those who sit opposite-Governmen t agencies and so on-were conniving in it, but the decision was made by other people. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) referred to Kitchens, the soap people. I have mentioned bauxite. Australia possesses 3,000 million tons of the world's 10,000 million tons of bauxite reserves. Those 3,000 million tons are almost completely alienated to foreign investment and foreign capital control. No nation with any sense and spirit should tolerate such a position any longer. One of the reasons why I hope the people of Australia will pay earnest attention to this debate is because the Government has completely abdicated its duties. It has sold out Australia's interests in the name of financial doctrines. It is living in the past so mitted what was regarded by it as additional far as these matters are concerned, denying all the lessons of history-of our own history-and lessons of common practice in every other nation. It should no longer have the confidence of this country. Debate (on motion by Mr Fox) adjourned. Ministerial Statement. General)-by leave -In view of newspaper references to possible interruption of Post Office services by the members of certain unions employed in the telegraph and postal services areas of the Department, I feel that honourable members will be interested in the situation which has been reached in this connection. The salaries of all members of the Post Office staff are fixed either directly by the Commonwealth Public Service Board under the Public Service Act or through cases being referred to the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator. There are a very large number of unions numbered among the the 90,000 odd full-time employees of the Post Office and there is a very wide variety of types of work carried out. It follows through that the fixing of appropriate salaries from time to time is frequently a very complex matter. In the present instance the Public Service Board was approached in November 1963 by the union, which is called the Third Division Telegraphists and Postal Clerks Union. A formal claim for increased salaries was left with the Board on that occasion. Because there are other telegraphists and postal clerks, however, in the Fourth Division of the Service, it was necessary that their interests should be considered as part of the one operation. The second union, known as the Fourth Division Postmasters, Postal Clerks and Telegraphists Union joined with the first union in lodging claims with the Board for similar increases in February 1964. In June 1964 the Public Service Board informed the unions that on the material put forward it could not agree that any increase was justified. The Board did, of course, give the unions the opportunity to think the matter over and bring forward any new material if they were so inclined. In August 1964 the Third Division union submaterial. The Board suggested that a joint conference including the Fourth Division union, but the Third Division union was unwilling to agree to such a joint discussion.

At the opening of the conruary President Johnson informed Congress ference, the Board informed the unions of that he proposed to take certain measures the increases it considered to be justified. to improve the external payments position A whole week was then spent discussing of the United States of America.

115,Mr Fox (Henty) [8.0],"On l l t h Febperhaps in terms of the value of the imports which we make from that country but in terms of the amount of money which actually changes hands between our two countries. For as long as I can remember, the balance of payments has always been against us. I have obtained from the Bureau of Census and Statistics figures relating to our exports to and our imports from the United States over the past 10 or 11 years. As I could not obtain complete figures in relation to thefinancialyear 1963-64, I wish to cite figures for the 10-year period between 1953-54 and 1962-63. I believe that President Johnson should give careful consideration to thesefigureswhen he is considering the case that will be presented to him by our Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) in the very near future, because they show that in this 10-year period our actual trading deficit with the United States of America was approximately £828 million, or an average of nearly £83 million a year. In the year 1963-64, which I have not included, the trading deficit against us was £137 million. Over the same 10-year period the amount of investment income payable by companies in Australia to the United States and Canada was approximately £394 million. I was unable to obtain a split-up between these two countries because of the rather complicated capital mix-up of some of the companies, particularly those related to the automobile industry. Thefiguresthat I cite relate to North America, but I have been assured that the Canadian content is very small. This made a total outgoing from Australia of £1,222 million. Against this there was a capital inflow from North America over this period of £502 million. This includes some profits which have been re-invested in Australia. Altogether, this left a net result in favour of the United States of £720 million, or an average of £70 million a year over the 10-year period. It is of interest to note that our trading deficit over the past three years has been gradually increasing. For instance, in 1962 it was £65 million; in 1963 it had risen to £98 million; and in 1964 it had risen to £137 million. I should like to cite some figures from skimmed milk powder, butter oil, lead and a publication called "" Survey of Current zinc. I remember the trouble we had only Business "". I think that the honourable mema few years aso at Mt. Isa because of the ber for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) severe restrictions placed by the United quoted from it earlier. I quote from the December 1964 issue. Under the heading ""Summary, United States Balance of Payments "", this deals with United States financial transactions with all foreign countries. It covers the nine months period to the end of September for both the year 1963 and the year 1964. In 1963 the United States had a favourable balance on its trading with all countries amounting to 476 billion dollars. This was more than offset by an outflow of capital of 3.8 billion dollars and also unilateral transfers to foreign countries, including military aid, amounting to 3.26 billion dollars. Overall, bringing into account one or two other items, the net unfavourable balance for the United States for the nine months period in 1963 was 2.3 billion dollars. It is very interesting to have a look at the section which relates to this part of the world. Unfortunately, there are no sepaarte figures for Australia, because Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are all grouped together. They show that in that same period the favourable trade balance of the United States was 200 million dollars. Whereas the United States finished up with a world deficit of 2.3 billion dollars, in respect of this part of the world it was 151 million dollars in credit. The figures for 1964 are not complete, but the total result is shown. The overall deficit of the United States for the nine months period in 1964 was reduced to 1.2 billion dollars, but there was a favourable trade balance against this area of 386 million dollars. This is explained by the fact that we get very little of the foreign aid, but it also shows me that we are helping to finance the United States deficit with the rest of the world. Another of the measures which was announced by President Johnson was "" a call for redoubled efforts to promote exports"". This is fair enough, but as far as I am concerned it should not be directed towards increased exports to Australia unless the United States is prepared to reciprocate by granting Australia easier access to its markets. At the present time, I believe, every one of our exports to the United States is subject to a quota. This applies to butter, cheese, susar, meat, States at that time on imports of lead and zinc. By these actions the United States was able to transfer some of its unemployment problems from that country to Australia. On 25th February the Minister for In the last few years, Australia has been the most rapidly growing market for American exports. know-how which we have received from the At the same time, the gap between Australian exports to and imports from the United States has been progressively widening in favour of tbe United States. This is very true. Our Government is doing everything possible to encourage exports by offering incentives in various forms, but our efforts to increase our exports to the United States are being frustrated by United States policies. The United States maintains a duty of 25i cents per lb. on Australian wool, and this is the only high wool duty in the world. A fact sheet or bulletin issued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics on 22nd March shows that the value of our wool exports to the United States for the first eight months of the current year amounts to less than £15 million out of a total of £246 million worth of wool exports. The figures also show that the total value of greasy wool exports from Australia over this same period had fallen by £47 million when compared with the same period last year. Unfortunately, we have our own problems in relation to balance of payments and, if my calculations are correct, every penny change in the price of greasy wool affects our export income by over £6 million. On 17th February the Minister for Trade and Industry spoke on the subject, "" Investment in Australia with Emphasis on the Next Decade"". He did this at a symposium banquet conducted by the Stock Exchange of Melbourne. He saidAll the indications show that over the next decade our economy will become more capital hungry and the population growth for which we aim will require an accelerating investment of capital. The plain fact of the matter is that if Australia is to continue its rate of development and if we are to pursue our current immigration programme we will not be able to obtain all the capital that we require from our own resources although, as the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) pointed out in his letter to the President of the United States, we are at the present time generating four-fifths of the capital which we require from our own savings. I believe that we need foreign capital today more than ever before but I agree with the Minister for Trade when he says that we must borrow but we should not sell out. We are grateful for the capital and United States but surely it is in the interests of the Americans that Australia is strong financially and industrially because, apart from Japan, we represent the strongest bastion of democracy in the South East Asian region. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to persuade President Johnson to do nothing which will interfere with the present rate of capital inflow into Australia. But if he is unable to do so I believe that we will have to take whatever steps are necessary to protect our own balance of payments position. From figures obtained from the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics I learned that during an 11 year period, from 1953-54 until 1963-64, we imported from the United States motor vehicles and parts to the value of £156 million. We imported cinematograph films to the value of £14 million and tobacco, cigarettes and cigars to the value of £103 million. IfI know the American people, they are hard headed business men. I believe they will listen if we point out to them that all of these commodities can be obtained from other sources. They can be obtained from countries with whom we have favorable trade balances. We can obtain cars from the United Kingdom, and heaven knows that she has problems which, I believe, are far greater than the economic problems of the United States. Likewise, we can purchase whatever films we require from the United Kingdom and European sources or we can spend some of the money which we spend on imports in encouraging our own film industry. We can obtain tobacco and cigarettes from the United Kingdom or Europe or we can increase the content of Australian tobacco in cigarettes manufactured in Australia and thereby encourage our owntobaccogrowers. I am not anti-American. I have a great respect for the Americans. I am proAmerican but I am even more proAustralian.

116,Trade And Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Said,"our ability to the President of the United States the American people will respect us for it and our relations with the United States will become even more cordial and our ties with that country will become even stronger than they are at the present time. Three years ago Government members would have had us believe that it was Great Britain that let us down. The issue then was Britain's application to join the Common Market. On that occasion it was the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr years. Since dollars and sterling are the McEwen) who had to go abroad and plead for our salvation. The Treasurer ( Mr Britain and America in a special position Harold Holt) at that time was not quite so concerned at the prospects. His assistant Minister, now the Minister for Housing( Mr object to this. Financially and diplomatically Bury), expressed the Liberal hesitations at the Australian Country Party cries of ""wolf"". The Australian Labour Party merely pointed out that Britain's application today as she was in the 1920's and the to join the Common Market highlighted a position into which Australia had been drifting for years. Now, Government members would have us believe that it is the United States of America which has let Australia down. This time it is the Treasurer who is to go abroad and plead for our salvation. The Minister for Housing is supporting his mission. This time the Minister for from participation in the debate and abstains from attendance at it. Only one member of the Country Party has spoken and he has contented himself with giving advice to the Treasurer on the arguments which might appeal, if not to the President of the United States, at least to Country Party supporters in Australia. The Treasurer practised on us this afterseas investment. He has ignored the serious noon, I gather, the arguments that he will dangers of our dependence on overseas put to Mr Dillon and to President Johnson. investment and the extent to which it props I do not think honourable members were very up our balance of payments.

It is poor taste to point out that it is the Government which has been in power for are manifold. There is the growing level of IS years which is letting us down in this case, and which would have let us down if Britain's application to join the Common Market had succeeded. As the Minister for Housing pointed out this afternoon, the tax equalisation proposals of the United States Government which have occasioned this debate, and now the United Kingdom Budget, must be viewed against the background of international liquidity problems in general. Both America and Britain have been running deficits for two international currencies, this has placed where they must protect the strength of both their currencies. Australians cannot Australia is so involved with both America and Britain that she is directly involved in their liquidity problems almost as much 1930's. We must try to break down this dependence. We should do more to convert the financial institutions of the United Nations into an authentic world bank and to develop an international currency. But this is a wider problem. We are concerned at the moment with investigating the immediate and very serious position developing in our balance of payments. The Treasurer was whistling this afternoon in order to keep up his courage. He misses the whole point at issue if he believes that if only America will relent for a while then all will be well. The American action is only a warning, a symptom of a fundamental problem-ou r failure to pay our own way and to reduce our dependence on overThe reasons for the fall in our reserves",72,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
117,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [8.14],,73,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
118,Trade And Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Abstains,"our imports. In the first nine months of this financial year the value of our imports was £204 million higher than in the first nine months of the last financial year. Secondly, the value of our exports was down, mainly due to lower prices for primary products-woo l and sugar. Our exports were £46 million lower in the first nine months of this financial year than in the first nine months of last financial year. The net effect of these two factors-ou r imports and exports-is that our trade balance is £250 million worse off in the nine months' period than in the corresponding period a year before. The third factor is the fall in capital inflow, which in the December quarter of last year was only £57 million compared with £88 million in the December quarter of the year before. The Prime Minister, in his letter to the President, speaking of external reserves, saidThese seem certain to decline over the year as a as an inflow and an outflow, there was an whole by appreciably more than £100 million. It looks as though they will decline by £150 the 16 years from 1947 to 1963. In that million. A fall in international reserves in period profits and dividends remitted 1965-66 is likely to be even greater than in totalled £650 million. Thus there was an the current year. I quote again from the investment balance of £550 million or £34 Prime Minister's letter. He wroteFor the financial year ahead, the signs point to a continued drain on our external reserves. The first reason for this, in addition to the factors already operating, which I have mentioned, is seasonal conditions in eastern Australia. The second reason is heavy defence expenditure overseas. AgainI quote the Prime Minister's letterOverseas expenditure in 1965-66 and later years arising from existing defence commitments and the new three-year defence programme is estimated at about £400 million. The third additional factor this coming year is that we will have maturing debts in America of 200 million dollars in the next five years, and the fourth additional factor is the decline in capital inflow, worsened by the action of America and Britain in correcting their balance of payments situation. Next financial year our international reserves are likely to fall by £250 million. That is £100 million more than in the present year if the present trends continue. By June next year our reserves are likely to be about £450 million or £400 million below the figure of June last year. This is F.3537/65 -R -[32 ] a worrying prospect. It is obviously what prompted the Prime Minister to write to the President. Quite apart from the result of American and British action to limit capital outflow, some action would have to be taken to correct our own balance of payments situation. This would have involved some measure of deflation or recession. Recent action by America and Britain will now make this adjustment more painful. Once again we see how vulnerable our economy is to a change in the attitude of overseas investors towards Australia. This is likely to occur at a time, such as the present, when our balance of payments situation is already deteriorating. Too often the Government emphasises the value of capital inflow to the balance of payments without giving similar prominence to the outflow of dividends and profits. Leaving aside undistributed profits, which are treated both inflow of new capital of £1,200 million in million on an average each year-hardl y a great amount of new money at all. Overseas investment is excellent as a stimulant, but not as a drug. The Australian Government has become addicted to it. When it is withdrawn or reduced the Treasurer gets the shakes. It is no good the Government crying "" wolf "" over recent actions by the British and American Governments as it did over the European Common Market. The Government has itself to blame for our trade failures and our dependence on overseas investment. It has had sufficient warning to get its house in order and reduce our dependence on overseasfinanciers,but it has foolishly continued on hoping that all would be well. It lived from day to day hoping for the best. This is no way to run even afinancecompany like Reid Murray, let alone a national economy. In the last 10 years Australia has had a £1,540 million deficit on current account in its balance of payments. The inflow of private overseas investment in that period was £1,570 million. The Government was borrowing capital in order to pay current expenses. This was what the Deputy Prune Minister called selling a bit of our heritage every year. That is why he is out of the House now. His presence would be too embarrassing to his Liberal colleagues. The Government believes that the methods pursued so disastrously by the Reid Murray group internally can be used successfully in international finance. Both concerns-Reid Murray and the Australian Government-wor k on the principle of borrowing fast enough to keep ahead of repayments. But this only postpones the day of reckoning. Sooner or later the inflow is likely to be seriously reduced, and it is likely to be reduced when our balance of payments can least stand it. In the 1930's and in the three credit squeezes we saw this situation occur. In 1951-52 the inflow was £86 million; the next year it was £25 million. In 1955-56 the inflow was £117 million; the next year it was £104 million. In 1961 the inflow was £235 million; the next year it was £149 million. There has not been the steady inflow that the Treasurer suggests. The inflow has fluctuated and it fluctuates against us when we need it most. Furthermore, as the amount of overseas owned assets build up in this country, so the figure of remitted profits will grow and become a heavy drain on the balance of payments. This has been the trend in the post-war period during which overseas investment has been concentrated in the fastest growing and most profitable sections of the economy. In the long term, capital inflow is not likely to grow as fast as remitted profits. Between 1947-50 and 1961-64-thos e two triennia-capita l inflow from overseas increased by 290 per cent, but the income payable on that investment increased by 330 per cent. In 1961-62 the following industries short sightedness, and it may come very remitted more in profits than they brought soon. in-1 . Founding, engineering, metal working, vehicle parts and accessories. 2. Food, that the Government should establish an drink and tobacco. 3. Finance and property, overseas investment trust. The functions of in 1956-59 the income payable overseas on this trust would be, mainly, twofold. I North American investment in Australia mentioned one of them last August. First, was £46 million. The capital inflow from it should arrange a transfer of equity in North America in that period was only £28 overseas companies to Australians. I said million. Both figures exclude unremitted that there should be an initial transfer of a profits. Income payable overseas will 10 per cent, equity in fully owned overincrease steadily, and the Government is seas enterprises. At that time our balance now faced with having to ensure a high of payments could have afforded the £250 level of inflow to service that debt. American action is a clear warning to us to put our own house in order, to reduce our dependence on overseas investment and to recognise the long term problems as well as the short term gains of such investment. This situation has occurred because the Government has failed to plan the long term growth of our economy, and because of its uncritical "" open door "" policy to all overseas investment. It is so uncritical of overseas investment that it has failed to maintain even a register of overseas investment. The Government has no continuing and overall plan. Such planning is not an end in itself but an essential means to an end. The Australian economy cannot progress without such planning. Control must be exercised in accordance with a coherent and co-ordinated plan, designed to achieve the development of Australia on the basis of proper social and economic priorities, one of them being expanded exports to reduce dependence on overseas capital. Overseas investment must be regulated in conformity with these plans. We should insist as far as possible that such investment establish new industries, introduce new techniques, allow genuine export promotion and import replacement, and provide Australian participation in ownership. It is the height of folly to permit the unplanned growth of our economy and to allow overseas investment to come and go as it pleases. No businessman worth his salt allows his business to be so dependent on the whims of outside financiers as does the Menzies Government. A detailed assessment should be made of all overseas investment-it s relative advantages and disadvantages to this country. There will be a financial reckoning for this Government's In the Budget debate last year I said million remittance required. Our balance of payments situation has now deteriorated. But the policy for the future should be clearly laid down and the machinery for its implementation set up, even though it might have to remain dormant until our balance of payment situation improved. Overseas companies, of course, would be given a certain period in which to adjust their shareholdings. Tbey would be obliged to do this either by taxation inducements or direct statutory prescriptions. When I say that an equity should be transferred to Australians, I do not mean transferring shareholdings from a group of wealthy overseas shareholders to a group of wealthy Australian shareholders. I believe that the trust should retain the majority of transferred shares itself. In this way the whole community would benefit from the profits and share in the losses of these overseas companies. It would also give the Government, through the trust's shareholdings, a voice in the policy of the companies concerned. Even more importantly, the trust should, for the future, promote the co-operation of Australian and overseas capital in joint ventures or consortiums. In some cases it could co-operate with local companies in raising loans overseas and employing experts in order to establish a particular industry which we require. Far too often we have to wait until an overseas company is prepared to develop new resources in Australia. Then we pay a high price for its investment. This dependence is objectionable. In the end, it involves handing over the control of our resources to overseas companies. It is not good enough, as the Minister for Housing( Mr Bury) suggested this afternoon, that our future should depend on being the site for some branch offices or branch factories of international monopolies. In other cases it would be necessary for the trust to co-operate with an overseas company to establish a new industry or enterprise. Without the overseas company the new enterprise might be denied access to techniques, supplies or markets. I am thinking here particularly of the mineral industry. In his letter President Johnson said. . . certain large direct investments in the production of iron ore in Australia are planned States companiesI think about 370 in all for the near future -and recommend to them that they take We believe that there should be a significant Australian public participation in such enterprises as these. An overseas investment trust could help us reap the benefits of overseas investment and overseas know-how whilst at the same time protecting our national interests and ensuring that company policy conforms to the general lines laid down by government economic policy. There are problems of financing such a trust, but it could be built up steadily as funds became available. It should be able to draw upon the capital market in all the ways open to private concerns. In Italy, Istdtuto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, commonly called I.R.I., has shown the way. This is the way that we can develop our resources. We can avail ourselves of international skills. In this way we can help make ourselves invulnerable and impervious to the decisions made in Britain and America, without consultation with us and without solicitude for us. Our big allies, economically and diplomatically, expect us to look after ourselves more than we have done in the past. Labour and National Service and Vice President of the Executive Council) [8.34]. -A t the moment we are debating the actions that have recently been taken by the United States Government in order to slow up the movement of international capital out of the United States into other countries. When the late John Kennedy was the President of the United States, he became worried about the constant movement of capital out of the country. He imposed what was called an interest equalisation tax. The purpose of that tax was to compel United States business interests overseas to repatriate their dividends and capital and to prevent a too rapid expansion of United States companies in overseas countries. It had an immediate impact, and I am sure it will have a continuing impact, on what we call the portfolio market in Australian securities. In the course of the last few weeks, following the practices that were adopted by President Kennedy, President Johnson decided that he would call together a large number of United",73,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
119,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister foraction on a threefold basis in order to prevent the drain on American payments. The bases on which he recommended that they should act were these: First, he wanted the slowing up of capital investment in other countries; secondly, he wanted the repatriation of both dividends and capital overseas; and thirdly, he wanted United States capital, where practicable, to be raised in the overseas countries rather than in the United States itself. I think that we should immediately ask the question, that has not yet been asked: What was the reason for the aotion by the United States Government? If one looks at the total trade and finance transactions of the United States over the last few years, one will see that it can be divided into three sections. In the first section, which is called its balance of trade on current accountI will not go into the details of it, but it is really the United States trade relations-on e finds that over the years the United States has had a credit surplus of the order of three billion-that is, three thousand million-dollar s per annum. To offset that, it has had on capital account, which is the movement of US. capital investment and the buildup of its investment in other countries, of the order of three billion dollars per annum. That balances its normal payments. But, and this is the important point, its defence and aid expenditure also bas been of the order of three bilUon dollars per annum. So over the years, one finds this deficiency in total payments, mainly due to the fact that there has been this extraordinary increase in defence and aid expenditure. Of recent years a change has occurred. WhatI choose to call the end of the post war era has occurred. That has had problems for the United States, as it has had problems for other countries. Western Europe, under the influence of the economic union-the European Economic Community-ha s found that in industrial terms it can now compete in many ways with the United States. It does not need the vast capital inflow that it required before. I do not want to be critical, and I hope that others will not be critical of the actions of the United States. If it had not been for that country in the post war years it is doubtful whether, from a defence point of view, Western Europe would have survived. Equally true, it is doubtful whether Western Europe would have been able to build up its economic structure and its industrial reconstruction to permit it to again become a force in world affairs. What can be said about Western Europe can also be said of Japan and of other countries. In other words, none of us wants to be critical of the United States. Many of us want to pay credit to the United States for its generous contributions which have brought world safety and world development. I have said that the post-war era has passed. Now we find that the economics of Western Europe, including the European Economic Community, are expanding. There is a gradual shift of financial and other economic resources to Western Europe and this, in itself, has created an additional balance of payments problem for the United States. I think the figures can be summed up in' this way. Over the last 15 years the United States has had a total deficit of 34,000 million dollars, but her total out-payments or loss of gold have been in the vicinity of 9,000 million dollars. The reason for this is that the United States is a centre of world finance and its currency is a reserve currency and an international trading currency. Many of the countries which earn dollars deposit them in United States banks or United States organisations. By this, means America has been able to maintain her substantial foreign reserves. Conditions have changed. In the changed conditions there were many in the United States who held the view that the time had come for capital outflow to be reduced and, in some cases, substantially reduced. I am not, for the moment at least, entirely convinced that the appropriate time had been reached when the United States needed to have taken that action. In discussions with a number of very important financial authorities in the United StatesI learned that they felt that perhaps the action, if it were takenI point out that I was discussing this matter in January of this year-migh t be premature. Nonetheless, it was on the stocks at that dme and was the subject of thought. WhatI want the House to recognise is that fundamentally the problem arises because of America's consistent surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the world. This surplus amounts to £3,000 million a year. That is what is known in economic language as a fundamental cause of disequilibrium. Sooner or later there must be a recognition of the fact that this trade balance must move a little, or substantially, against the United States, and that other countries must be given the capacity to trade rather than be faced with the necessity of obtaining aid. We are hopeful that the Kennedy Round of negotiations, negotiations that were commenced by the late President Kennedya man of considerable talent and genius-wil l permit a greater flow of international trade and that that greater flow will help other countries, and incidentally the United States itself, to solve their problems. Let me now apply this problem to Australia. Over the last six or seven years our imports of foreign capital have been running at the rate of £200 million a year. Over the last few years we have had an annual deficit in our trading account with the United States of about 400 million dollars and a credit on our capital account of 200 million dollars. Therefore, we have had a deficiency running in favour of the United States of about 200 million dollars a year. As I have said, we have had a capital inflow of about £200 million a year or, over five years, something of the order of £1,000 million. The question that we have to ask and the question that the Labour Party has to consider is: What has this meant to us? The answer is that we have been able to implement a migration programme which now brings to Australia about 150,000 people a year. We have been able to expand in a way that few other countries have been able to expand. Over the last couple of years we have had a rate of growth in our national income of 5 per cent, per annum. I do not know of any other country in the western world that has, at fixed prices, been able, unless it is in the process of reviving from wartime devastation or has been prostrated as a result of inflation or from some other cause, to maintain a growth rate of 5 per cent, per annum or, if you go back six years, of 4 per cent, per annum. We have been able to establish standards of living and rates of growth that are a matter of pride for everyone in this country, certainly everyone in this chamber sitting on the right of the Speaker. The important fact is that we could not have achieved these purposes to the extent we have or increased our expenditure on education and national development, as well as implementing a policy which gave us full employment more or less constantly for the whole period that the Menzies Government has been in office if we had not relied substantially upon the inflow of foreign capital. This foreign capital provided for us the ability to build schools, provide social services and ensure full employment. What members of the Labour Party, including the honourable member for Yarra and the unfortunate member who spoke before me, who read his speech but did not understand it, have to answer is this simple question: If you want to cut down foreign investment, what activities in this country do you also cut down? Is the cut to be in the field of employment? Is it to be in the field of social services? Is it to be in our national growth and development? Do we cut down investment in our iron ore deposits in Western Australia? Are we to stop the oil companies establishing refineries here? Shall we cut down foreign investment which has permitted us to attain standards of living about which every Australian should be proud? I turn to the next question: What are the problems that we have to solve? If we wanted to sustain our education programme and our rate of development at the high rate we achieved and at the same time mount a massive defence effort of a kind not previously known in peace time in Australia's history, we could not have managed without this capital inflow. The problems that engage my attention are these: The Prime Minister, in his letter to the United States President, pointed out the deficiency in our balance of payments to which I have just referred and stated that if there were a restriction on capital inflow to Australia-capita l outflow from the United States to Australia-a t a time when we were confronted with balance of payments problems, there could be a compounding effect and we would have to look very seriously at our trade with the United States. I have said that I have no wish to be critical of the United States. I believe that in the postwar years she has acted magnificently, sometimes, as is true of all countries, a little selfishly, and sometimes considering her own self interest. Perhaps this is putting it a little too high, but few people of a responsible frame of mind would be prepared to be strong in their criticism of the actions of the United States. We have pointed out that we have this chronic deficit. I regret to state that in the last six months that deficit has grown worse. So we pointed out to the United States that the position regarding the commodities that we export to America, which are in the class of exports that earn about 80 per cent, of our export income, should be looked at. Let us consider the major items such as sugar, lead and zinc, wool, meat and one or two others. The United States imposes quota restrictions that are not in our interests. Although our letter contained no specific request, we pointed out the contrast between our policy and the policy of the United States. In other words, we have pointed out that we maintain a truly open door policy for imports and that there are quota restrictions on very few items. We say to the rest of the world: "" Come, bring your goods here. We need them because 85 per cent, of our imports are raw materials necessary for our manufacturing industries."" We allow those commodities to come in, but we say to the United States: "" If you go ahead with this policy of restricting capital inflow to Australia you must think of the consequences and consider what policies we must adopt if you insist that there is not an open door policy for the raw materials and the foodstuffs produced in Australia "". That is the position as I see it. There are two other matters to which I wish to refer. I believe that we could press somewhat more strenuously than we have for Australian equity participation in American companies in Australia. I also think that we are entitled to ask of the United States that, if investment does take place here, there must be a greater degree of processing here. In other words, we would like, for instance, to see bauxite converted to alumina and then to aluminium, and the day must come when the whole of this process is carried out in Australia. Equally, too, we are entitled to say in the case of iron ore that we want the iron and steel to be produced here and that we want further processing and manufacturing completed in Australia. What of the future? What is to happen? Have we the means at our disposal to overcome difficulties, should they emerge? These are the questions that I think we should be answering tonight. First of all, I want to make it clear that at the present time we have healthy reserves, so that we have plenty of time, or adequate time within which to make changes if they should become necessary. Nevertheless there are some questions that should be answered. First, under no circumstances can we now be thinking in terms of establishing a formula that can be rigidly adopted. We cannot think of that formula for the good and sufficient reason that we do not know yet what is likely to happen. We become better informed, and that is why my colleague, the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) will be proceeding to the United States in order to find out from the Americans what they intend to do in connection with capital repatriation and interest repatriation and how they intend to finance the future building up of American industry in this country. The second thing that we need, and it is something that I regard as essential, is economic and financial intelligence. In other words, we must rely first of all on the integrity of stock exchanges, business houses and trading banks to adopt a realistic policy, and we must ask the American corporations to adopt realistic policies when they are in fact raising capital on the Australian market for expansion in Australia for the benefit of American overseas investors. We have other methods that we can adopt in order to ensure that, should difficulties emerge, remedies will be available provided we have, as I have said, the fundamental economic and financial intelligence upon which to base our action. We have not contemplated what action we may take. It has not yet become necessary. One kind of action that might be taken is action through the banking system, through the Reserve Bank, and the life offices to ensure that too much of our lending capacity is not diverted to American institutions which are expanding here. We can also in the same way as has been done in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, ensure that the taxation mechanism is used for exactly similar purposes. In other words, we have the means. I cannot go into them in detail, but I have mentioned two methods that might be used. If time permitted, I would be able to show that we have a wide range of economic weapons that would permit us to minimise the influence of a sharp fall in capital inflow from the United States. We do not think this will continue in the long term. We believe this country of ours provides too rich an opportunity for overseas investors. It provides a wonderful opportunity for them and a wonderful opportunity for our own development and progress. We hope that the United States will see the light and will be only too ready to co-operate with us in the continued growth and prosperity of this country. it is true to say that there is a great deal of concern amongst Government members over the impending action of the United States of America. Surely during the 15 years for which this Government has been in office it should have foreseen what is now about to happen. HereI think it is as well to put on record just how much foreign ownership of industries there is in Australia. The figures I have disclose that from 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, of Australia's secondary industries are controlled by foreign ownership. The amount of foreign ownership in the pharmaceutical industry is 97 per cent., in petroleum refining and distribution 95 per cent., in motor vehicle manufacture 95 per cent., In oil exploration and production 85 per cent., in telecommunications 83 per cent., in soaps and detergents 80 per cent., in bauxite and aluminium 75 per cent., in iron ore, except for Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., 75 per cent., in chemicals 60 per cent., in motor vehicle parts 55 per cent., in food 50 per cent., in lead, zinc, copper and mineral sands, from 45 per cent, to 50 per cent., in heavy engineering 30 per cent., in sugar milling and refining 15 per cent., in glass 15 per cent., in papermaking 10 per cent, and in iron and steel 10 per cent. Although that is the present position, I have not yet heard one honourable member on the Government side explain to this House why the Government found it necessary to dispose of such Australian national instrumentalities as Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd., Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd., and our interest in the aluminium industry. All these undertakings wereflourishingin Australia. A.WA. was playing a most important part in the defence of this country. One thing that I always remember is that when the Japanese were only 32 miles from Port Moresby, A.WA. was supplying the scientific instruments that were installed in such defence components as aircraft and ships for the defence of this country. But, during its 15 years of office, this Government has seen fit to dispose of its interests in A.WA. It has also seen fit to dispose of C.O.R. and has been content to say: ""We will not refine oil in this country; it will not be under Australian ownership. We will bring in foreign companies to refine oil here."" Mir. Barnard -They sold out our interest in the aluminium industry. the same with that. I have not the time to go through all of them, but that is the sort of thing that has happened to all of them. I am like the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox). He said that first he wants to be a good Australian, and that he is not anti-American. I am not anti-American, but I do want to be a good Australian. I think we should all bear in mind these famous lines which were penned by ScottBreathes there a man, with soul so dead, Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land? If we allow things to go on in the way in which they are going, it will not be long before we do not have a native land. I shall say something about that later. We are debating two letters-on e from the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) to the President of the United States of America, and the reply from the President to our Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in his letter, which he chose to describe as direct and clear, pointed out that Australia is a free enterprise country that has welcomed private overseas investment and treated it with exactly the same consideration that it gives to private investment of Australian origin. He also pointed out our present commitments to the United States and those for the year 1963-64. He said that in that year the value of our exports to the United States was 312.9 million dollars as against imports from the United States amounting to 555.9 million dollars and that, we also had net invisible payments amounting to 194.7 million dollars. All this means that we had a deficit of 441.7 million dollars with the United States.",76,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme

121,Mr Benson,"The Government didIn his rather short reply of one and a half pages to our Prime Minister's letter of five and a quarter pages, the President of the United States gives no sign of yielding to the Prime Minister's request. I will quote from the President's letter a passage which I think goes to the crux of the whole matter. The President saidIndeed, I understand that certain large direct investments in the production of iron ore in Australia are planned for the near future. And in the case of loans by our banks and financial corporations, we intend to emphasise primarily the need to curb the outflow of such funds to industrialised Minister, Charles W. Court. countries already rich in reserves. We believe, therefore that this programme will not impose undue strain in Australia. I wish to emphasise a point that President Johnson made. Let me repeat it. He said. . . need to curb the outflow of such funds to industrialised countries already rich in reserves. The President was talking about Australia, which is a country already rich in reserves. The President's action could be good for Australia in the long run because if the United States is not going to find the money we need to assist our development, we will bave to find it ourselves. Surely the Com-, monwealth Bank, other lending institutions and the people of this country generally can find the wherewithal for our development. Dr. GibbsI suppose the honourable member will print some more money. country. I hear talk about Socialists. Has the honourable member for Bowman (Dr. Gibbs) ever seen a Liberal collecting his Socialist cheque. Has the honourable member ever seen that? Why does not the Government start to do away with that? Why does not the honourable member look at 'the meaning of the word Socialist? Dr. GibbsI said that the honourable member would print his own money. country. On the contrary, it is a prosperous country and, as such, should not be requiring or seeking outside finance. We do not need foreign money to build roads, ports, ships and iron ore quarries. That is the point that the President of the United States is making. I think he is trying to tellus in a decent way: "". For goodness sake, get off my back and do a bit yourself"". But since this Government has been in power it has said: "" Let us get some more money from Dad. Let us get some more money from Uncle Sam."" At present a Western Australian Minister is in Japan. I quote from a newspaper of today's date which saysTokyo, Wednesday. Western Australia will sell some 200 million tons of iron ore to Japan over the next 20 years, according to Western Australia Industrial Development Mr Court, here on a fortnight tour of Japan, told newsmen yesterday that an iron ore import agreement between leading Japanese steel interests and three Australian mining concerns would mean 200 million US. dollars in iron exports over the next two decades. we intend to emphasise primarily the As I said before, Australia owes the United States vast sums of money because this Government will not allow Australia to stand on its own feet. Look at defence commitments to the United States. I am a great believer in defence for this country; I cannot speak about it enough. If we want to save Australia from aggression, we must have the wherewithal to do so. But we must get it into our heads that defence must be built, not bought. Any country that starts running around the world saying "" I will have some of these and some of those items of defence equipment"" will get into trouble. I am very glad that we are getting three destroyers from the United States, but I am not glad that we are sending £100 million out of the country to get them, because these ships, as every honourable member knows, could well be built in this country. Mr Malcolm Fraser -When would we get them if we did that? quickly as we wanted them as long as we put a workforce on to do the job. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) knows this.

It is wrong for any honourable member to rise in his place and knock them by asking how long it would take to build those ships here. I want to say something about the aircraft industry. Australia is getting aircraft from America at present. These aircraft should be built in this country. I know that when the Second World Warfinished,we were building a pretty poor type of aircraft, but actually we were then growing up in the aircraft industry. We were then in much the same position as Sweden, a country with 7 to 8 million people. We are not even now building any aircraft with what I may term an Australianflavour.Indeed, we are not building any aircraft at all. Actually, we are assembling some French aircraft. But we should be planning and building our own aircraft. Until we do things like that, we will be in trouble continuously because we cannot rely on other people to provide our defence needs. Surely we should be doing something in this Parliament to make this country sound for its inhabitants, not for overseas interests. established by this Government-and I am In conjunction with the various States, we should be overhauling the various Companies Acts so as to keep Australia's natural resources in our own hands for all time. Most developing countries have such legislation, but Australia does not. I was speaking to an important official of a big company not so long ago and he said it was remarkable that any overseas investor who came to Australia, said that he could bring money into the country and asked what he would be given if he did so, could get practically what he liked. We had the position in this countryI think it has just been rectified-that foreign interests were taking over the iron ore industry whilst an Australian company, Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., was not allowed to export iron ore. I do not want anyone to think that I am standing here sticking up for BHP. Far from it. But it is wrong that a Japanese company and an American company can commence operations here and export iron ore against the interests of an Australian company. I have not heard whether this situation has been rectified yet, but I understand that BHP. is about to FJ575/6J -R -[33 ] be given permission to ship iron ore from Yampi Sound in the near future. As far as Japan and the United States of America are concerned, there is a fait accompli; the permission has already been granted. There are some things which I consider should be socialised. I know that that word is not very nice in the ears of some of my friends opposite. A country like Sweden says that defence production, timber rights, mineral rights and forestry rights must be in the hands of the government. And they are. I say that this country would be in a much sounder position if we worked somewhat along the lines that Sweden has worked. We get the shakes every now and again and think we are about to be invaded or to become involved in a war. What happens when there is a war? Ships and aircraft are taken over and are used in national service. It is said that we cannot find the money needed to develop our country, but what would happen if a war broke out tomorrow? Would we be able to manage, or would we have to say: ""We have not the money, so there will be no war ""? Honourable members are well aware that the Commonwealth Development Bank was very pleased that the Government did establish it-in 1959 to supplement the activities of the trading banks and other institutions. In my opinion, the decision to establish this organisation was sound and farseeing, but I ask honourable members whether the bank has been allowed to act as it should. It began operations in 1960 and until June 1963 it had approved of only £90 million in loans to approved applicants. In other words, it has made loans to approved applicants to the extent of only £30 million a year, and this is the bank that was formed, as its name surely suggests, for the development of this country. I am glad that the Government founded this somewhat hamstrung institution, but I often wonder what would have been said-and I think this is important-ha d a Labour Government been in office and founded a bank of this kind. I think that at the time the bank was established it was said in the Press that it was a good job that a Liberal Government founded the bank and not a Labour Government, because if it had been a Labour Government its members would have been accused of extreme socialism.",81,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme

The extent of Communist domination of these unions is known to everybody, and it has been described by a former Labour leader as a running sore in the Labour Party. As we know, the United States of America Administration recently announced restrictive measures to apply to American companies that invest or intend to invest in overseas countries. The actual terms of the restrictions have not been cited for some time and I would like to repeat them briefly. First, American investors or companies have been instructed to avoid or postpone direct investment in developed countries. Secondly, they have been asked or instructed to finance overseas investments with funds raised overseas. Thirdly, they have been asked to remit more of their dividends to the United States of America. We can see from the letter of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) which we are discussing that if these restrictions are implemented they will have a serious effect on our economy. The word "" economy "" is one that rolls rather glibly off our tongues in this House. Never let us forget that when we use this word we are talking about the community and that every family in this country is affected by a deterioration in the state of of our economy. As I say, we must not forget in this debate tonight that we are talking about human beings in Australia whose standard of living may be adversely affected. The fact is that during the last eight years we have had a deficit in our trading account of more than 2,400 million dollars. This means that the price we have had to pay for our imports has greatly exceeded the total amount we have received from overseas for our exports. I find nothing extraordinary in this, for a country in the state of development in which Australia at ber object to what he said? present finds itself. As the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said this afternoon, to sustain such an immigration programme and such ber for Kingsford-Smith, as a fair minded a rate of development as we have been able Australian, agree that this was a fair thing to achieve, as a nation primarily still reliant for the Leader of the Opposition to say in on primary production to earn our export public in respect of the Treasurer who is income, this is not an extraordinary state of affairs. As one who has been concerned in some way with the business community, I do not know any business or, in fact, any family which can develop from a young and unsophisticated family or business into a more prosperous one existing on its own resources at the root of its development. SoI find nothing extraordinary or wrong about the situation in which Australia finds itself today. To compensate for the loss of trade deficit in the past eight years there has been an inflow of private investment, including unremitted profits, of over 3,000 million dollars. This means that, overall, our dollar reserves have increased by 600 million in that time. Of this 3,000 million dollars, about one-third came from the United States of America. Surely it is not a difficult exercise for anybody to understand, if during that eight years one-third of our total private investment came from the United States of America, the serious implications of these restrictions which the United States Administration now intends to place on investors. Is it then unnatural for the Prime Minister to write a letter such as he did to the United States Administration? Is it unnatural for the Treasurer to make personal representations, in the light of the most friendly reply received from the President of the United States and to go there and make personal representations on behalf of this country? I would have hoped-perhap s it is a futile hope-that when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) rose in his place today he would have seized the opportunity to make a respectable impact on the Australian people by looking at this problem in an objective way. But we were disappointed, because again he succumbed to the obvious temptation of trying to make cheap political capital out of the situation for his own parry, and I must say that he did not succeed in doing that.",83,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme

I venture to suggest in all sincerity that, if the honourable gentleman by some mischance had been Prime Minister of Australia in these circumstances today, he would have written precisely the same letter as the Prime Minister wrote. If the honourable member for Melbourne chance-ha d been Treasurer of this country today, instead of making the speech he did he would have been on the next plane to to the United States to make representations on behalf of his country. We had no interesting appraisal of the Australian economy today by the Leader of the Opposition. We heard all the old adjectives and statements that the country is in chaos and that calamity is just around the corner. Again, not for the first time, I find the Leader of the Opposition in disagreement with the President of the United States. For the sake of the record it is worth repeating one paragraph from the President's letter to our Prime Minister with regard to the chaotic state of our economy.

Did we hear any Labour speaker suggest prohibitive tariffs or credit restrictions? Here is a way in which we could dampen down our imports. We heard many members of the Labour Party waxing eloquent on the evils of this course, but no honourable member opposite suggested credit restrictions. Did any honourable member opposite go into the question of more double taxation agreements? I think this is an area where this Government might examine more fully the possibility of increasing overseas investment in Australia.

He said: ""We raise four-fifths of it here now. Why cannot we raise it all here? "" I do not know what is the honourable gentleman's association with business, but let me quote one example, oil-and one could quote many-fro m the evidence which the Department of National Development, through the Bureau of Mineral Resources, recently gave at a Tariff Board inquiry on crude oil. It had this to say about Australia being selfsufficient in oil or petroleum productsThe minimum reserves required to support production are commonly regarded as equal to 15 years production. If Australia is to become selfsufficient in oil, therefore, reserves of at least 2,000,000,000 barrels are required now and by 1970 about 3,000,000,000 barrels. It went on to say laterAssuming a future discovery cost of 10s. per barrel of reserves, the cost of finding our required power to acquire, compulsorily, a 10 per reserves by 1970 should therefore be about £1,500.000,000.

It is £300 million a year for this one project alone. I have not time to quote from the other publications in which we see projects of £150 million by Alcoa of Australia Pty.

He has the solution to this problem. He devoted 17 minutes of his speech to the diagnosis of the problem. He concluded that we are short of funds in our current account. Anybody could have come to this conclusion by simply reading the second paragraph of the Prime Minister's letter. The last three minutes of the honourable member's speech were full of fascination. He said he would institute-presumabl y if he were in government-a n overseas investment trust. That is a nice sounding title. He went on to state the functions of the trust. I must admire the wording he used. He said that this trust would arrange-wha t a beautiful word-for the transfer of 10 per cent, of the equity in all foreign companies to the trust. I wonder what that means. As one who, I think, reasonably understands the English language, I would interpret it to mean that this government trust would be formed and would be given cent, equity in every foreign company in this country.

135,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [9.35],"No-on e that this was a rather juvenile and humorousthe' image of Bob and Lyndon striding manfully forth, taking the lead on the road of progess for the world's destiny; of Bob and Lyndon discussing world affairs before decisions are made. Unfortunately, the President of the United States has not heard of this story. He made his decision on the control of overseas investments without referring the matter to this country in the first place, just as he made his decision to seek a negotiated settlement in the Vietnam dispute, and announced it to the world today, without conferring with the Australian Prime Minister first, and despite the Prime Minister's statement that he would, if necessary, be the last Prime Minister to oppose a negotiated settlement. Two arguments were put forward by the Government. One was that it is necessary to have overseas investment in this country so that we can build up our overseas reserves and the other was that overseas investment brings with it technical know how which is necessary for our internal development. What honourable members opposite repeatedly and consistently ignore is the need to discuss the obligations that are concomitant with the acceptance of overseas investment. Among these obligations is the servicing in perpetuity of the overseas investment capital that comes into Australia. To illustrate the point that foreign investment can become an increasing burden on a country, let me point out that between 1948 and 1960 Australia's gross national product increased three and a half times. Total private debt, however, increased five times. Payments abroad to service our obligations increased eight times. The proportion of our exports that is required to service our overseas debt is increasing all the time, and this is becoming quite a problem. Indeed, one can scarcely see the value of overseas investment if its main purpose is only for the building up of reserves. One can hardly see the value of continuing this kind of economic activity when we can just as easily build up our reserves by promoting exports. In the year ended 30th June 1964, our external payments on private capital were £133 million and our payments abroad on government debt were £40 million, making a total of £173 million. This is getting fairly close to £200 million a year, which is approximately the level of the inflow from abroad. So one oancels the other. For the life of me, I cannot see that any advantage is to be derived from this situation. Another thing that honourable members opposite ought to realise is that profits are made from the investment in industry of the capital that flows into Australia. A certain percentage of this profit is remitted overseas, but a percentage is re-invested here. This means that the Australian assets of foreign firms are much larger than is indicated by the figures showing the bare inflow of capital. This is the significant factor that we must consider when we are thinking about the repayments that we shall have to meet. From the end of World War II to 30th June 1963, the net capital inflow into Australia totalled £2,195 million. The chief components of this total were £574 million of undistributed profits, £880 million of direct investment, about £200 million of portfolio investment and £99 million of net government borrowing. These figures illustrate the importance of looking beyond the bare inflow figures. It is doubtful whether we derive any great advantage, in terms of our overseas reserves, from the inflow of investment from the United States of America. Between 1948 and 1960, we received from the United States 17 per cent, of our total capital inflow. Twenty-six per cent, of the profits remitted from this country went to the United States and 48 per cent, of the profits on overseas investment retained in this country derived from the investment of American capital. But only 2 per cent, of the net gain in foreign currency came from our transactions with the United States. Obviously, our relationship with that country is pretty expensive for us. This is a pretty expensive way of getting foreign currency. Furthermore, when one looks at a breakdown of thefiguresrelating to the United States at the present time-and this is the specific situation that is giving the Government cause for concern just now-and compare that situation with the situation relative to other countries, we find that United States investment in this country has one of the highest profit earning rates enjoyed by overseas investors. I think the rate of profit earned by United States investment here is about two or three times better than that of United Kingdom capital. Members of the Government suggest that the overseas investment that has taken place here has caused no problems. They say than only 25 per cent, of foreign capital invested in Australia is under overseas control. The important point is that the proportion is rising, and rising fast, l t has perhaps much more powerful in the sense increased about 5 per cent, in the last five years. Another important factor is the strategic concentration of this investment in the economy. Overseas investors in this country are raising themselves to the commanding heights of economic power within Australia. Because of their strategic economic situation, they will be able to pressurise, direct and ignore the Government on matters of internal economic policy. They will be able to do this, as I have said, first, because of their strategic situation in relation to the economy. Secondly, and more importantly, because they are subsidiaries of overseas firms, irrespective of internal economic controls, they will be able to obtain from parent companies outside Australia all the financial support that they need. Let us look at some of the relevant figures. In Australia at present, 95 per cent, allowed to operate here, as they do, and of the motor vehicle industry is controlled overseas, as is 55 per cent, of the motor parts and accessories industry, 82 per cent, of the telecommunications equipment industry, 95 per cent, of the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and toilet preparations, 80 per cent, of soap and detergent production and 95 per cent, of petroleum refining and distributing activities. Foreign ownership also dominates mining, oil exploration, aluminium extraction and fabrication and copper production. The foreign companies concerned do not always operate in the best interests of Australia. Because of international ties with overseas firms, the economic activity of a foreign owned company within Australia usually is geared to the overall international activities of the parent organisation. Let me illustrate how huge and powerful these big international organisations are. The world wide sales of the General Motors enterprise in 1964 totalled 17 billion dollars. Western Australia are only some of the This was 10 per cent, more than Holland's gross national product. This will give honourable members some idea of the size and ramifications of this firm. Incidentally, 17 billion dollars is probably only a little more than the gross national product of Australia each year. When we talk about how big and important we are and how we shall control these overseas firms that invest here, we ought to reflect a little and remember that these firms, economically, are every bit as big and powerful as we are as a nation and that they are able to exert tremendous pressure through their associated Australian and international concerns. In fact, the available evidence shows that a number of these firms that are exploiting our minerals and our other national resources are doing so by adopting a sort of double standard. They pay us low prices for our minerals and the major return on the product is obtained at the stage of secondary production. These concerns regulate their production and their exports. Indeed, some of them do not even export from this country, because such exports would interfere with the well regulated international trading arrangements that they have developed. To this extent, Australia suffers. I see no advantage to the internal development of Australia to be derived from a situation in which international firms are indulge in takeovers of existing Australian enterprises. The Deputy Prime Minister which we permit this to happen as, I think, selling a little of the farm each year to meet the mortgage. These activities that I have outlined are some of the things that are taking place. However, the Government has been amazingly inactive, or else it is unaware of what is happening. I refuse to believe that it is really unaware of events. I cannot understand the amazing attraction which overseas investment has for it and which leads it completely to ignore the important implications for the future of Australia. We are told that our natural resources are being exploited by overseas companies for the benefit of the Australian nation. The coking coal of north Queensland and the tremendous iron ore deposits of the north west of minerals that are being exploited by overseas firms. All we are getting in return is a small rental payment, as it were. We are being provided only with potholes in the ground for posterity. The major benefit derived from the exploitation of our minerals and other natural resources is not coming to us. It is going to the concerns that are exploiting our",87,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
136,( Mr Mcewen) Has Described The Process By,"raw materials in secondary treatment processes in other lands. It is not good enough for anybody to say that we have not the necessary technical know-how and that we have to import foreign capital. It is of no use to say that we have not the necessary industrial capacity to exploit our resources ourselves. Other countries are exploiting their own resources. There is no need for us in Australia to import this so called technical know-how by foreign investment and have to pay for it in perpetuity. There is no need for us to cripple ourselves by accumulating an ever increasing burden of debt. Our overseas debt has now reached the stage at which we are only just able to meet it, and it will soon be so great as to be beyond our capacity to meet. One of the things we could do is to look at the possibility of hiring and firing techserve our international reserves because they nical advice, of having some establishment from overseas come into this country. If we want to start a steelworks, for instance, we could have people come in as technical advisers, pay them for their technical advice in establishing a steelworks, or some other industry or project that we have in mind, and when their commitment to this project is finished dismiss them because the term of their contract has run out. This is not something novel but something which Premier Nehru conducted in India during his lifetime and with some success. He established steelworks there with German technical advice which was hired and then fired when the term of the contract had run out. This is a far more responsible way of conducting the internal affairs of this country. I can recollect a discussion that took place at the Federal level on the need to develop north Queensland. It was suggested that to rebuild the Mount Isa railway line we would have to import capital from some source or other. An application was made to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for this money. The application was refused and the money was eventually found within Australia because precisely the things that we were going to use to carry out this reconstruction were available here. All the productive resources which were necessary for the job were available in Australia. But the muddled thinking which pervades the attitude of the Government, and particularly that of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), never ceases to amaze me. I remember last year when there was a discussion about raising a loan of a relatively small sum in terms of national spending for Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. If my memory serves me correctly the amount required was about £10 million. Instead of drawing on our overseas reserves at the time when they were fairly healthy and when the future prospects indicated that we were not likely to run into any trouble -in fact, they indicated that conditions would become much better-the Treasurer told the country that he was going to borrow the money overseas and pay interest on it. He did not say why this was necessary. First of all I cancel out the possibility that it might have been necessary to prewere climbing. Secondly, he did not suggest that we would invest £10 million of our reserves at better interest rates to pay for this loan and so enable us to be better off. He mentioned no alternative to borrowing the money overseas. There seems to be some sort of peculiar, sacrosanct, holy cow attitude to overseas reserves, an attitude that we must continually go into this crippling debt to carry the country along. The suggestion is that this overseas investment takes place in our community to enable us to develop the country. There is a fairly large body of evidence to suggest that most of the foreign investment that comes into Australia, or a large part of it, takes over local or existing industries. We can do a major part of the development ourselves. The finance which is coming in is not so much for the development of the very fundamental state of the economy; it is coming in for the establishment of a sort of import replacement for industry hiding behind the tariff barriers which, I rather regret, seem to encourage a certain degree of inefficiency and some slothfulness in some sections of industry. Productive resources are being attracted away from our export industries at a time when we need our resources to be directed to them. If we are going to get on top of this problem we must do some central planning and give some direction to the economy. We must allocate our resources efficiently. I agree with the sentiment that perhaps the decision of the Government of the United States of America to restrict overseas investment has virtues fqr this country because we will have to start putting our thinking caps on to devise means of using our industrial resources for maximum benefit. We will have to start thinking of priorities, of buildcountries is one that cannot be sustained ing roads instead of service stations which are too numerous already, of building hospitals before hotels, and schools and universities before television stations of which there are already all too many in the community. Last of all the Government has to sit down and do some broad thinking on the economic situation in Australia today. Apart from the problem of our overseas balances deteriorating further on present trends, we also have some internal economic-problems. We have a very serious problem in primary industry with wool being sold for 10 per cent, less in the last 7 months according to the export price index. Sugar is also down 40 per cent, for the same period, and the position for wool will become worse because of the drought. Rural holdings are overvalued in relation to the return that they are providing. This is a bubble which may burst very soon. honourable member's time has expired. [9.55] -There are occasions when any Opposition would do itself credit in trying to take a point of view that would strengthen not necessarily the Government's position but the country's position in an intricate and possibly difficult negotiation United States to other countries. This outwith some foreign power. If, in this debate, the Opposition had taken such a point of view in relation to thesefinancialproblems, it would have done itself a great deal more credit than it has achieved in the debate. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and those who followed him quite truly put a most reactionary point of view in relation to these particular economic problems. They might well have been talking in the 1920's or 1930's, as though they could shut the doors and bring down the barriers on one particular country to insulate and isolate it from everything that has happened in regard to prices, trade or capital movements overseas. This is a difficult proposition to sustain in a great trading country like Australia where employment and development depend on our trading ability, on the prices we can position has come about, apparently, as a persuade other people to pay for our goods and on the capital that we can attract here to assist in our development. The point of view that the Opposition has put in trying to erect barriers to cut us off from other in this day and age and one that I had hoped had been forgotten by the end of the tragic depression of the 1930's. In announcing his recent programme the President of the United States of America said that the United States had the strongest creditor position in the world, that it had 88 billion dollars in claims against foreigners, which was 37 billion dollars more than foreign claims against the United States. He said also that the United States had the world's most favourable trade position, that its exports had increased by 27 per cent, in four years and that it had a trading surplus of 3.6 billion dollars a year. He said that the United States had the world's largest supply of gold, holding 35 per cent, of the free world's supply. Despite these great marks of strength in the United States economy there has been a deficit in that country's balance of payments of something over three billion dollars in each of the recent years. This has been reducing slowly and had been reduced to three billion dollars in 1964. But there has been this overall deficit for two particular reasons, because of the extent and size of the United States civil and military aid and, more particularly, because of an increasing outflow of investment from the flow of investment is itself a function of the Americans' own particular domestic problem. They have, as we know, problems of unemployment with which they have been trying to deal in a somewhat courageous manner, but their unemployment problem has been much more intractable than that in many other countries such as Australia, Britain and the countries of Europe. This is one of the main reasons why their rates of interest are kept at levels much lower than in Australia or in Europe. Thus there is an incentive for holders of American capital to send their money abroad to invest it in some other country, and this is one of the reasons for the difficulties in which the United States finds itself. The recent improvement in the American",89,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
137,Mr Deputy Speaker Order! The,,91,United States Of America Balance Of Payments Programme
138,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon),"result of four measures that have been introduced in the United States in recent years. Their aid loans are now tied very largely to purchases in the United States. There has been a reduction in civil and military aid and expenditure abroad. These things have probably been cut pretty much to a minimum. There has been a highly successful export drive and there has been a campaign to sell military equipment to many foreign countries. This has been a highly successful campaign from the United States point of view. Then again their position has been improved because their profits and interest from foreign investment have increased by two billion dollars over recent years. Their gains have been, over a very short period, about 3 i billion dollars a year, but this has been offset by an increase of 2 i billion dollars in private capital outflow annually since 1960. This is a very substantia] increase in the rate of foreign investment from the United States, but it is clear from this picture that the United States has not in fact been living beyond its means. It has been investing beyond the capacity of its immediate foreign income, but this is quite different. There is a marked distinction between a country living beyond its means and one investing more than its immediate income can afford. Despite this, it is clear that we must recogof the things said in the President's letter. nise that there has been a need for some There is no need to remind honourable memaction on the part of the United States.

Unless that programme is scope and the time of the equalisation tax thought through to the end, it is clear that and has instituted various voluntary this could have some results which would restraints on the banking and business world have disastrous consequences for many that could have a far reaching effect indeed. countries. The company programme, under which individual companies are asked to improve world reserves can be divided into two their own positions by 15 to 20 per cent, kinds. There are assets that are readily over a year, is one that could bite very available; they might be gold or convertible deeply indeed into countries in which there are substantial United States investments. The United States Administration has asked for foreign earnings to be returned and not retained in a foreign country. It has asked that debenture capital should be raised abroad instead of funds being re-invested which could be returned to the United States. At this point, it may be pertinent to bear in mind the remarks made in the Prime Minister's letter about debenture capital and other related matters. This is an aspect of United States policy which could have unfortunate results for Australia if it were pursued. If the United States programme is not administered in a manner that avoids harm to Australia, it could lead to the abandonment or reduction of United States programmes here because we are certainly not obviously included in any of the exceptions which have already been announced in relation to this programme. These exceptions are Japan and Canada, as well as the United Kingdom because of her balance of payments problems. However, if the administration of this programme is directed primarily towards Europe, as apparently is the intention, it may be that the initial effect of the programme will not be great. In this connection, we can take heart from some But the secondary effects of the United the United States is in fact trying to institute a programme which will withI might explain that world liquidity or foreign currency that a country has in its own hands. Then there are assets that are available after negotiation-asset s of a kind which may be made available through negotiation with the International Monetary Fund, through various bank to bank or government to government negotiations or through arrangements of one kind or another. An example of this is the underwriting of three bUlion dollars by a group of 10 within the International Monetary Fund to help the United Kingdom out of its particular problems round about Christmas time. The volume of liquidity required to finance world trade depends not only on the value of world trade but also on fluctuations in that trade and in the movement of capital between one country and another. Although there is no precise mathematical relationship between these things, it is obvious that the volume of liquidity must grow as the value of trade and fluctuations in trade between countries grow. It is significant that liquidity, whatever way it is measured, has been growing much more slowly than has the value of world trade in recent years. So, even before this American action an argument could be advanced to the effect that the volume of liquidity available to finance world trade will be insufficient unless something else is done to counterbalance the scales. It is important to note that too much less developed countries have just about liquidity or too many reserves being readily maintained their reserves at a static level. available could lead to quite a remarkable In fact, liquidity has moved from the kind of inflation. It is doubtful whether United second line negotiable reserves of the kind which can be made available through the maintained their position for various International Monetary Fund can be too reasons. There is no need to go into those large. These reserves are dependent upon reasons at the present time. appropriate national policies being pursued. That is a condition on which much of the policies which are intended to withdraw money that is made available through the between three and four billion dollars a year International Monetary Fund is made from the world pool of liquidity or the available. These reserves are required for world pool of reserves. Unless the protemporary fluctuations in trade and capital gramme has been thought through and movements which otherwise would unduly unless action has been taken to balance the strain a country's resources. First line effects that the programme could have, it liquidity needs to be adequate to finance could result in a substantial shortage of first appropriate levels of trade and trade expanline liquidity to finance the normal intersion and to accommodate normal capital national trade transactions. The President movements between countries. Too little of the United States, in his statement on first line reserves, or too little liquidity of a thesefinancialmatters, mentioned the need first line nature, would certainly lead to a to watch this problem, but he made no shortage of foreign exchange, a reduction in specific suggestions about what should be world trade, a reversion to the nationalist done. economic policies of the 1930's, with the disastrous results that were seen in those years, and to the kind of situation that developed as a result of the initial balance of payments problems of the early 1930's under the restrictive, automatic, harsh and cruel mechanisms of the gold standard to which, for some unaccountable reason. France appears to wish to return. On the other hand, a shortage of second line liquidity would lead to an inability to deal with temporary problems and to offset large scale capital movements between countries. AlthoughI have tried to draw a distinction between what I have called first line liquidity and second line liquidity or first line reserves and second line reserves, it is clear that no sharp and clear cut division can be made between the two. For example, the smaller the first line reserves available to finance trade and capital movements are, the greater is the probability that large volumes of second line reserves will be required. So there is a clear interaction between the two. At this point I direct the attention of the House to the movements in reserves between countries in the last nine or ten years. The industrial countries of Europe have increased their reserves or their liquidity to a remarkable extent, at the expense of the United States of America in particular. The States of America to Europe, while the less developed countries have jurt Tn this setting the United States proposes To the United States action must be added the restrictive policies that the United Kingdom once more finds itself forced to undertake as a result of its balance of trade problems. Although there is no immediate curb on United Kingdom investment in Australia, it is clear that the United Kingdom's restrictive policies inside that country will mean that it will be buying less of our goods. That could lead to a reduction in the prices that we receive for various exports and it could mean that some goods that we sell will be harder to sell and that markets will be harder to find. This would not only affect us; it would affect all the countries with which the United Kingdom deals. If the policies of the United States merely prevent further expansion of European reserves, particularly those held by France and Germany, there may well be no particular harm done. But if as could, and I believe will, happen the United States cannot confine its policies to these particular areas by administrative means, and if at the same time her policies put Europe's balance of payments into deficit, this will provoke counter action on the part of European countries. Thus reduced United States investment in Europe could lead to reduced European purchases from many other countries, lt is likely that the European countries, especially the Common Market countries, would try to tackle their particular balance of payments problems by reduced purchases. They have an ill developed capital market; they have no real tradition of large scale capital investment overseas. The method I have just mentioned is their traditional method of curing their own balance of payment problems. Thus, despite the intentions of the United States, it is likely that her action will affect not only Europe but also the less developed countries, and indeed all the countries of the world, unless some countervailing action is taken on a world scale. At this point it is appropriate to examine what could be done to mitigate the position. There are in existence plans to increase International Monetary Fund quotas, and those plans would certainly be supported. But the fund is ill equipped to deal with a permanent shortage of any particular currency. Surely that is emphasised by the necessity to introduce the Marshall Plan and the European Payments Union during times of acute dollar shortage. The International Monetary Fund is more able to deal with temporary shortages in trade between countries and with normal capital movements. It may well be that some of the principles of Keynes' proposals for a Clearing Union, which were not accepted at the original Bretton Woods conference, will have to be adopted in the future. Under those proposals some responsibility was placed upon creditor nations, whereas under the International Monetary Fund all the onus is placed on the debtor nations to get themselves out of their debtor position without any real recognition being given to the fact that very often countries find themselves in that position because of a policy that has been adopted by some large and economically more powerful creditor country. Therefore, it could well be argued that some responsibility should be placed on the creditor nations. This is something that should be looked at in any future discussions. The programme of the United States of America cannot be looked at in isolation but must be thought through to the end. We must make sure that the withdrawal by the United States of three billion or four billion dollars from world liquidity does not lead to the economic nationalism that was seen in the 1930's. If it is just let go by default, this could well happen. The next International Monetary Fund talks may well be more important than any other talks that have been held since the original Bretton Woods conference. World liquidity for trade to correct trade imbalance and to counter capital movements may become an urgent and vital problem in the not too distant future. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Leader of the Opposition) [10.16] -During the day honourable members on the Government side took frequent opportunities to assert a special relationship between this country and the United States of America and to deplore the fact that the United States appeared to have cut the ground from underneath the Government's policy as regards foreign investment and overseas control. For a long time the Government has been making the same claim concerning our diplomatic relations with the United States. Last week the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) stated, in answer to a questionThe Australian Government is in the happy position ol enjoying such a state of confidence with the United States Government that it enables us to be in close and constant communication with it. I do not propose to talk about the details of private communications, but I can assure the lionorable member and the House that in every phase of the operations of South Vietnam we do have the opportunity to express a view and we are in constant communication with the United States. In the last fortnight the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), apparently without consultation with the Minister for External Affairs, has expressed himself both inside this House and outside on our relations with the United States over South Vietnam. I propose to compare his remarks on this subject with the remarks which President Johnson made at the Johns Hopkins University yesterday. The President expressed the same courageous and forthright attitude to external affairs as he has demonstrated so often in internal affairs. He saidOnce this is clear, then it should also be clear Such peace demands an independent South own relationships to all others-fre e from outside interference-tie d to no alliancea military These are the essentials of any final settlement. We will never be second in the search for such There may be many ways to this kind of peace: in discussion or negotiation with the Governments concerned-in large groups or in small onesin the reaffirmation of old agreements or their strengthening with new ones. We have stated this position over and over again fifty times and more-to friend and foe alike. And we remain ready--wit h this purpose-for unconditional discussions. United States. I now quote a considered statement, full of moral indignation, in which our Prime Minister dressed down a dozen Anglican bishops on 25th March. Rhetorically he askedIs the United States to withdraw, and abandon South Vietnam? This would no doubt lead to a conquest which would end the armed conflict by conceding victory to the Communists. Their lordships had not made any such suggestion nor, do I apprehend, had any other person in public life. The Prime Minister continued, in what he meant to be rhetorical termsOr is the United States, without withdrawal or abandonment, to negotiate for peace? With whom? About what? These are two vital questions. How would they negotiate with the Vietcong, well organised but hidden, practising the night attack upon villages, determined upon revolution by violence? How would they negotiate with North Vietnam, a country which had shown that it will be bound by no agreement? How could they negotiate with Communist China, the home of aggression, except upon a basis of assured independence and freedom for South Vietnam and those other countries of South East Asia which' are now threatened by Communist expansionism?

142,Mr Whitlam,"The President of theThe President of the United States does not say that he will not negotiate with North Vietnam. Clearly he includes the North Vietnamese Government among the governments concerned, at least. The President does not say that he would not negotiate with Communist China. Earlier in his speech he refers to the rulers in Peking; it is open to inference that he is ready to confer with Communist China, among the governments concerned. The President is not waiting for a change of heart in the Communist bodies before he indicates his readiness to negotiate. He is taking the proper steps to force that change of heart, to expose to the world the genuineness or otherwise of the Communists' case, should they decline to negotiate. He has anticipated that possibility of negotiation and, we hope, he is forcing it. The Prime Minister two days ago replied to a question by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). Again he denounced the idea of negotiation. He said. . . negotiate with an enemy which has violated its obligations in relation to a cease Are; ber when he said that President Sukarno negotiate with a country that has ignored its interhad passed the point of reason. The follownational obligations; and negotiate with people who will keep on shooting when the Americans have stopped shooting. That seems to me to be a fantasy, and if I am the only Prime Minister left to denounce it, I denounce it. The Prime Minister might have added that even if the Pope and the Anglican Bishops do not denounce the idea, he would still denounce it. What are we to think of the President of the United States, who is ready to negotiate with a country which has ignored international agreements, violated its obligations and kept on shooting? The President is prepared to negotiate, as was his predecessor at the time of the Korean conflict. No conditions were set by the President of the United States at that time. He started the negotiations which have at least prevented a recurrence of hostilities in that country. The Prime Minister has clearly in this case once again displaced his Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck). The Minister for External Affairs takes a more responsible attitude in his answers to questions, his considered statements in the House and very often in his correspondence with people who write to him. But the Prime Minister has become established as the most conservative and bellicose head of government elected in any free elections in the world today. He is well behind every other leader in what he would call the free world. He is behind the Pope, the Prime Ministers of Canada and Great Britain, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, his good friend Pat Gordon Walker, as he describes him, and his contemporary and counterpart, General de Gaulle. He is behind the lot of them. That is the position in which we find ourselves on Vietnam. In some other respects the Prime Minister has calmed down. I must not misrepresent the right honourable gentleman. hour ago to be here. Four months ago, during the Senate election campaign, he was mounting an increasing war upon Indonesia. On 19th November the Prime Minister referred to infiltration into our side of New Guinea. He had warmed up by 23rd Noveming day he said that aggression by Indonesia against our territory in New Guinea would be met by armed resistance. Indonesia had now passed from infiltration to armed aggression; President Sukarno was out of his mind. On 30th November, interjectors during an election speech were toldI see you are on Sukarno's side. I can assure honourable members that the attitude of the Prime Minister has had a deplorable effect on South East Asia. His attitude to interjectors has made many people in South East Asia think there is much more opposition to the Government's help for Malaysia than in fact there is and that there are many people in this country who are, as he glibly says during an election campaign, on the Indonesian side. The panic is now over. Things have quietened down since then. Once the election was over Indonesia became more reasonable. His attitude on Vietnam, however, continued until two days ago and would have still continued if the President of the United States had not cut the ground diplomatically from under the Prime Minister's feet as he has cut it economically from under his feet.

As long as he is head of the Government of this country, Australia will always be last in that search. External Affairs) [10.26] I do not usually question the motives of people who speak in parliamentary debates but I must permit myself to ask what is the purpose of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr two words "" remain "" and "" unconditional"". Whitlam) in introducing a debate of this kind. Is he trying to drive a wedge between Australia and the United States of America? Does he imagine that by proving the existence of differences between Australia and the United States or trying to create an opinion among the Australian people that such differences exist he is serving the interests of our nation or the causes which I believe not only the whole membership of this side of the House but also a very large number of members opposite sincerely and warmly support? Thefirstpoint made at the outset by the honourable member was that a statement. I had made about the closeness of diplomatic relations between the United States and Australia was not justified. I do not qualify in any way the statement. I made. It is an exact description of that close and harmonious relationship and state of confidence which exists between the present Australian Government and the United States Governmenta state of confidence and harmony which we on our side value very much and believe to be very much to the advantage of Australia and the security of our people. The honourable member tried to make out a case that there was some kind of conflict between statements made today by President Johnson and statements which had been made on other occasions by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) or myself. The honourable member quoted a very small passage from a very long speech but distorted the passage in such a way, particularly in the manner in which he delivered tt, as to try to support the case that he was trying to make. I will repeat the passage on which the honourable member appeared to rely. In the mouth of President Johnson the passage read as followsWe That is, the Americanshave slated this position over and over againfifty times and more-to friend and foe alike. And we remain ready-wit h this purpose-for unconditional discussions. I want to emphasise two words Dr. J. F . Cairns -Unconditional ? with my remarks. I want to emphasise the The use of the word "" remain "" shows consistency. There is no change in the President's policy. ""We remain ready."" There is consistency and continuity in his policy. The other word to which I refer is "" unconditional"". Anybody with a fair mind and an honest intention, trying to arrive at the meaning of the President's words, would read that passage in the context of the whole speech and would know that the President was referring to the attempt by North Vietnam to state conditions, one being that the Americans must withdraw before any discussions can take place. The sense of what the American President said is not what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition implied. The sense of what the President said was plainly this: ""We will not accept the condition which North Vietnam wishes to impose, that American troops must withdraw before any discussion takes place; but if there are no conditions to discussions we remain ready to enter into those discussions."" I emphasize the strength of that case by going to earlier passages in the President's speech. I have the authentic, official text in my hand. At the outset of the speech, the President made it quite clear that the United States was taking up a position in Vietnam because of principles. If one were to compare some of these passages with statements made in my own statement to this chamber on external affairs and with statements made by the Prime Minister, he would find an almost complete identity of thought. It is true that the President expresses them more forcefully and more clearly than it was within my power to do, but they are the same principles. The President saidWe fight because we must fight if we are to live in a world where every country can shape its own destiny. And only in such a world will our own freedom be finally secure.",96,Adjournment

149,Mr Galvin,"Well, you are doingrefreshing voice of sanity and wisdom. That is what it is. The Prime Minister has turned his back on negotiation. He has said: "" It is hopeless. You cannot do it. With whom do you negotiate?"" Well, he has been answered today by the President of the United States. It is worth comparing these two gentlemen, if one can compare them for a moment. In world affairs and in the diplomatic world President Johnson is a political giant, a leader and fighter for democracy. He is a fighter who is prepared to use the weapons of war, if necessary, to preserve the small countries. But whilst fighting, he realises the need to fight for peace, negotiate your place in the world, particularly in South for peace, and to look after the millions of people who are suffering. He has put forward to the world a proposition for peace and those who do not agree with him and those who do not support him will be judged. They can only be termed warmongers. It is no good for Government supporters to pick out members of the Labour Party or to turn the heat on somebody else. They themselves must say whether they agree with the President of the United States that you should negotiate. The Prime Minister, in his letter to the bishops, said: ""With whom do you negotiate?"". If the Prime Minister would read carefully the statement of the President he would find out with whom to negotiate. It clearly points out that it is possible to negotiate with countries or with small or large groups. As the Labour Party says, nothing is given away by negotiation. You fight but you fight also for peace at the same time. As I said earlier the President of the together the parties in a struggle for peace United States is a political giant in diploand not for war. macy.

It is no good having peace Apparently something has gone wrong with unless you have a plan for development the diplomatic channels and the Prime Minister, when he said that there was no room for negotiation, did not know that the President was going to make this statement. Department of External Affairs has very skilled and expert men on its staff. It has good diplomats. I think we are fortunate to have them. But no matter how skilled a team may be and no matter how hard it works, unless it gets a lead from the Prime Minister of the nation and unless you show it that you want to negotiate and to take East Asia, as a nation fighting for those unfortunate people of South Vietnam, it is not sufficient. You must also fight for peace. The Government's communication system seems to have gone astray. The Minister says that he knew these things. If the Prime Minister knew them, it is strange that only yesterday he should say in reply to a question that negotiation was not possible. What is wrong? It has clearly been shown in his letter to the bishops that the old camp follower has lost the last column. In world affairs the Prime Minister is a camp follower of the United States. He hangs on behind. Once he was a camp follower of the United Kingdom but he has lost contact there because a Labour Government, with Mr Wilson as Prime Minister, has set in motion a move to send to South East Asia-thi s trouble spot so close to us-Patrick Gordon Walker to investigate and try to find an avenue for negotiation and a possible way to bring Our Prime Minister has drifted along.",98,Adjournment

I think the main thing is that we bring peace to South Vietnam. The President, of course, is prepared to negotiate provided that South Vietnam remains independent, provided that she is free from Communist infiltration and provided that she is free of foreign military forces. 1 believe that the Australian Labour Party is endeavouring tonight to besmirch the Prime Minister. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition laughs, but he is a past master at doing this in a subtle way. As I said earlier, leadership of the Opposition by the present Deputy Leader is something to which, I believe, it will never be his right to succeed. member's time has expired. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [10.56] It has become quite clear that there is a vast difference between the position taken up by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and his supporters on the other side of the House, as oufMned in his speech yesterday, and that adopted by the President of the United States of America. Over the last few weeks, the Prime Minister and his supporters on the Government side have consistently stated that we must not negotiate in connection with Vietnam now, or under any conditions. They have taken that we must not negotiate. They have taken the view so clearly expressed by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) the other day when he said that the only alternatives in Vietnam' were escalation or surrender and that there was no possibility of negotiation. Negotiation was, .in fact, surrender because there was nothing you could negotiate about. No one can twist the words used by the Prime Minister in answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) in this House only yesterday with relation to negotiation. They are plain enough. The Prime Minister saidThat seems to me to be a fantasy That is that we can have negotiations with countries that are concerned in the war in Vietnamand if I am the only Prime Minister left to denounce it, 1 denounce it. Does that mean anything other than that he denounces the possibility of negotiation in Vietnam? Of course it does not. The Prime Minister takes up that attitude on the very day the President of the United States of America is saying: ""We are prepared for unconditional discussions."" There is a vast difference between the attitudes of the two gentlemen. Hoping to divert the attention of those listening from the main issue involved in this debate, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) asks: ""What is the purpose of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in raising this matter?"" The purpose of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is to inform the Australian people that we have a Prime Minister and a Government who are uncompromisingly committed to an aggressive course, and who are unwilling to consider negotiating in international affairs. That is the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister on every occasion on which he has entered into discussion of international affairs. We want to point out to the Australian people the differences that exist between the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister and that taken up by those who are prepared to settle the great problems of the world today peacefully by negotiation.

We want to show that there is a better alternative than the one suggested by this gentleman who is quite incapable of negotiating at the same time as he is quite incapable of fighting. Let us consider the facts. Let us take first the speech made by the President. President Johnson saidWe will never be second in the search for a tions will not be considered unless the peaceful settlement in Vietnam. Can anyone claim that the Prime Minister aggression in South Vietnam-is no longer can say the same? Of course he cannot. considered to be a necessary condition. The He cannot say: "" We will never be second President is saying quite clearly: ""We will in the search for a peaceful settlement in go into negotiations of an unconditional Vietnam "". Why, on the same day on which kind "". We are going to see if we can stop President Johnson made that statement, aggression by negotiation. If honourable the Prime Minister said that he denounced members on the other side of the House the possibility of negotiation and that if he do not accept that interpretation, they are were the only Prime Minister left in the deliberately trying to twist words. world to denounce it he would denounce it. Of course, it is impossible for the Minister for External Affairs or anyone else on the other side of the House to say that this is not the position of the Prime Minister in this matter. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS -Impossibl e to say it this country to the matter. The Press saw truthfully. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS I think withdrawal of that remark. The honourable member for Yarra said, in reply to my interjection that I did say a certain thing, that I did not say it truthfully. honourable member for Yarra to withdraw that remark. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS I withdraw the word "" truthfully"" and I say that the Minister cannot say it accurately. We now find that the President of the United States is laying down the policy that he is prepared to come into unconditional negotiations in respect of Vietnam. The Minister for External Affairs endeavours to confuse the issue by saying that what the President really means is that he is prepared to go into negotiations and that when he says he will do that unconditionally he is not referring to the North Vietnamese demand that all the forces of the United States be withdrawn. What the President of the United States is saying is that he is now prepared to consider negotiations even if that remains the demand from North Vietnam. He is prepared to consider withdrawal because he wants a neutral South Vietnam. He is saying that the particular demand that has been made in the past on behalf of the Government of this country, and has been expressed by it-that negotiaGovernment of North Vietnam ceases We know what the significance of this speech is. President Johnson has referred to "" unconditional discussions "". He wants to make it clear to all the parties concerned that any negotiations will be free of the conditions that were underlying negotiations before. This is the reaction of the Press of it desirable, necessary and appropriate to emphasise matters such as this in their reports covering the matter. The"" Sun"" saysThe United States is ready for unconditional discussions aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam war, President Johnson announced tonight.

(The honourable member for La Trobe thereupon withdrew from the chamber.) Dr. I . F. CAIRNS Mr Speaker, an additional point of great importance has been made by the President of the United States. He saidFor our part 1 will ask the Congress to join in a billion dollar American investment in this elfort when it is underway. The President also saidI dope that all industrialised countries including the Soviet Union will join in this effort to replace despair with hope and terror with progress. This also is a new development. This is the first time that we have had a proposal for a thousand million dollar development programme for South East Asia. It is a matter on which we need to know the attitude to the Australian Government. This is in line with an aspect of policy that has been propounded all the time by the Australian Labour Party. We have pointed out that military methods cannot solve problems in Asia and we have stressed continuously the importance of economic progress. Now we welcome the magnificent proposal for an economic development programme in South East Asia by the President of the United States of America, who has said that his Government will contribute 1,000 million dollars. I ask the Australian Government at this stage to consider Australia's position in this situation. Why should Australia not contribute, in addition to what we do now, a proportion of her gross national product equal to the proportion of the gross national product of the United States represented by the 1,000 million dollars offered by the President of that country? If Australia did contribute in this proportion it would cost this country at least £20 million for the development programme in South East Asia. I ask the Minister and the Government to announce that Australia will join with the United States in this significant policy development, and that Australia will undertake as a matter of official policy to support unconditional discussions for the peaceful settlement of the war in Vietnam. I ask tbe Government also to announce that Australia will join with the United States and contribute an appropriate proportion of her gross national product, to the extent of at least £20 million, towards the development programme in South East Asia. I submit that if the Government undertakes to adopt these two items of policy at this stage, it will be adopting a policy quite inconsistent with that followed by the Prime Minister and the Government in the past. all, I want to refer to the remark of the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) that it appeared that every member on the Government side of the House was opposed to any moves in Asia that would bring about peace or would bring peace closer. Let me point out that in the debate on international affairs my colleague the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) saidBut now that America has said: ""You can go so far and no farther,"" and has shown strength there is a real chance to get peace. Later on he saidI believe that there will come a time when we will be able from strength to negotiate an end not only to the present conflict but to general Communist aggression in this part of South East Asia. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is to be congratulated tonight. It is obvious that there is a realisation amongst the members of the Opposition that one of the real sources of strength in this Government is the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), and that in this political sphere as long as the Prime Minister holds the strength and the prestige that he does in this country and overseas, the Opposition, torn asunder as it is by internal strife, will have no possibility of occupying the Treasury bench in this Parliament. TonightI believe we have seen a very shrewd diplomatic move on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If he can take out of its context something that was said by the Prime Minister and present it so that it appears to be completely contradictory to a. statement by the President of the United States, also taken out of its context, then he can gain a political advantage for the Opposition. As I have said, we have seen this evening a very shrewd political move. There is no need for me on the floor of this Parliament to defend the Prime Minister. He has a prestige and a position in",103,Adjournment
174,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [11.6],"First of Australia and overseas that has commanded the respect of many people and many nations. I can remember that in previous debates in this House members of the Opposition have referred to certain occasions on which they have said that the Prime Minister has failed. I would like to hear of any distinguished personage in international affairs who has had complete and absolute success on every occasion on which he has ever negotiated. One of the occasions on which members of the Opposition have said the Prime Minister failed was that occasion of the Suez crisis. Let us remember that on that occasion our Prime Minister was chosen by the leaders of many nations to confer and hold discussions with President Nasser. It was unfortunate that certain circumstances arose at that time, not the least of them being a presidential election in the United States, which had an effect upon the negotiations between our Prime Minister and President Nasser. Irrespective of the result of those negotiations I , and I think many other people, believe the Prime Minister handled those negotiations in a way which brought credit to himself and credit and prestige to this country. We have seen many problems and complexities in the situation in Vietnam. One of the outstanding correspondents in Australia, Denis Warner, pointed out a few days ago that the determined action by the United States had brought about a change of heart and feeling in many of the countries of Asia which, up to this stage, had been frightened that they were going to be left out on the end of a limb by the United States and some other Western powers. I believe the policy of the United States has brought hope to many countries in Asia which, a short while ago, were walking and living in fear and trembling because of the threat of Red China. For that reason I believe this move by the United States has brought the possibility of negotiations in Vietnam closer. 1 am really amazed at times at the constant talk about an independent policy by Australia. We are an independent and proud nation and we will never forget it. For many years the men and women of our fighting forces have given evidence of that. But let us be realists. What could and would Australia do without the magnificent support of the United States? The honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) say nobody would discount that. Every time one of the members of the Opposition .talks this nonsense about a complete and absolutely independent policy for Australia it is evidence of the fact that there is no realisation by honourable members opposite-o r some of them-of the facts. Let us face the situation. In all these things there must be co-operation between Australia and the United States of America-co-operatio n between Australia and the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As I have said on the floor of this House on many occasions, God help the rest of the world if between our Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America there ever comes a rift, because at that stage our civilisation as we know it and as we believe in it is doomed. In this regard I will refer to the words of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Michael Stewart. I know that quoting only part of a speech is perhaps not complimentary, but that is all I can do in the time. I have. He saidWhen we discuss international affairs we must necessarily say a great deal about restoring or keeping the peace. This involves frequent mention of the necessity to resist aggression and to keep up our defences. He speaks of the situation following the settlementFor a time both parts continued to endeavour to put themselves in order and make economic and social progress. Those possibilities remained open until, in 1959, there was a call from the Government of North Vietnam for an intensification of the Viet Cong activities in the south and for full-scale guerrilla warfare against the Government of South Vietnam. Not only did the northern government call for that, they then proceeded to help it with more weapons and military advice, as was made clear by the majority report of the International Control Commission in 1962. Faced with that situation, South Vietnam appealed to the United States for help and the United States responded. He talks about the suggestion that the United States should withdrawIt would further be an admission that what is in fact the aggression from the North had succeeded. He means if the United States forces were withdrawnI assure the House that that event would be regarded with profound alarm by all the non-Communist countries in that part of the world. I have noticed this among the very many letter* which I have received about this matter and which my honourable friend and honourable members opposite have sent to me from their constituents that, although many of those letters ask urgently and naturally that Her Majesty's Government should do everything possible to get a peaceful solution, very few indeed ask for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the United States forces. He went on to sayMore recently President Johnson has expressed ultimate aim of aiding the social and economic the matter thus: "" It is, and will remain, the policy of the United States to furnish assistance Malaysia and Indonesia, without military, political to support South Vietnam for as long as is required to bring Communist aggression and terrorism under control. The military actions of the United States will be such, and only such, as serve that purpose at the lowest possible cost When I said that, honourable members in human life to our allies, to our own men, and lo our adversaries too."" Mr Stewart addedT do not feel that that can be regarded as bers opposite claim that they are the great the language of a man or a nation eager to engage a reckless escalation of the conflict. In these remarks there is a determination any of them say what President Johnson to halt Communist aggression in this area. has said in his declaration that appears in Taking the totality of President Johnson's the newspapers tonight. He has said that statements and the statements that have instead of spending billions of dollars on been made by others, we find they are in destruction, something should be spent on no way contrary to the statements made by construction-the construction of peoples to the Prime Minister or to the policy of lift them out of the morass of degradation this Government, which is in keeping with that they are in. These are the ideals that the preservation of the safety and security have been postulated by Opposition memof our land and future. Evident in the speeches made by many seem to believe that we should drop bombs honourable members on the Government side and destroy mankind. of the House tonight and on previous occasions is disappointment that the action of the President of the United States of sayAmerica has saved the world from nuclear destruction and disappointment that bombs have not been dropped on China. Honourable honourable member for Mackellar or any other members opposite can jeer if they wish. The advocate Australian Labour Party has consistently had suffered the horrors of mass destruction. called for negotiation. We have asked the Government to get behind U Thant, the I wonder what their attitude would be if Secretary-General of the United Nations, in they had been in the position of the people an effort to stop the slaughter that has been of South Vietnam or North Vietnam. It is going on in Vietnam. But the Government one thing to be the yictim of war in has said: "" We are right. There will be no countries that have been cursed with negotiation."" The honourable member for persecution and whose people have faced Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) advocated, the horrors of disease and hunger, and practically openly, that Communist China another to sit in a soft seat here in should be denuclearised. Apparently the Canberra, as the honourable member for idea is that, if we cannot get the United Mackellar does, and advocate the dropping Nations to say to 740 million people: "" Give of bombs on unfortunate people on the us your nuclear secrets now; you are not other side of the world. entitled to them "", and if these people do not hand over their nuclear arms, we should drop a few bombs on them. The honourable members who are jeering tonight jeered when I spoke on a previous occasion in a similar debate. I said thenI believe it is possible to negotiate a mutual "" hands off"" agreement between Russia, China and the Western Powers, with all parties having the development of South East Asia, including or economic gain to any one party. Surely this is not a proposition too radical for the Australian Government to accept. opposite jeered at me. I was one of the humble fry of the Opposition. But today the President of the United States is saying exactly the same thing. Honourable memdefenders of peace and of the underdeveloped nations. But I have never heard bers time and time again.

175,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) [11.16],"Let us get a little realism into this debate. This evening, honourable members opposite have been hoist with their own petard and they do not know how to get out of their difficulty. Time and again, we have heard honourable members opposite rise in this chamber and advocate total war. Their attitude is: Clean out those who are on the other side. That is the sort of proposal that we have heard voiced in this place time and again. Such thoughts are sickening in this day and age. All the time, honourable members opposite know that it is only a short step from conventional war to total war, or what is described as new war, with all the accompanying horrors of nuclear destruction. Government supporters should think of that instead of asserting that Opposition members are anti-American. Honourable members opposite should think on these matters and let the people of Australia see that both the Opposition and Government supporters are for Australia and will work to give Australia an effective voice in the affairs of the world. If we could do that and bring some wisdom into the thoughts of the warmongers, we would bring some humanity to bear on the situation. It would be much better if, instead of decrying what others have said and denying the wisdom of their words, honourable members opposite bared their souls and said that others were right and they were wrong and that, in the future, the course advocated by others would be followed. If Government supporters, instead of jeering at me when I proposed the solution to the war in Vietnam now suggested by President Johnson, had acknowledged that perhaps it was the right solution, we would not have been embroiled in the kind of discussion that we have heard here this evening. sonal explanation, Mr Speaker. I have been deliberately misrepresented. I have never Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr advocated mass destruction.

But to honourable members to get a little realism the honourable member for Hughes who, into this debate. I join him in that plea and I propose, if I can, to introduce some realism. A sense of realism in this matter will be attained if we look at the attack' launched by the Opposition in its proper context. That context is very interesting. In the light of what has happened this evening and of certain events of the past few sitting days, the activities of Opposition members in the field of foreign policy can be seen to fall into a very clear and well defined pattern. Let me insance certain things that form part of the pattern. First of all, we heard a lot of sententious, pompous and thoroughly insincere moralising a week or so ago about the use by the United States of America in South Vietnam of non-lethal riot control gas for the purpose of gaining control over villages and outposts controlled by the Vietcong. A more insincere and nonsensical attack could hardly have been imagined. Yet it was pressed with considerable vigour, or at least with such vigor as is left in the Opposition after its years in the political wilderness. Why was this attack pressed? It was pressed because the left wing of the Australia Labour Party, above all else, wants to drive a wedge between this country and the United Stales. I would be the first to recognise that not every member of the Labour Party wants to do that. Johnson. orable member and his crocodile tears in a moment. I now turn to the next matter.

That was another step, in this thoroughly antiAmerican approach of the left wing of the Labour Party, along the path of driving a wedge between us and our principal ally. Then what do we find tonight? We find a somewhat odd trinity of people at work leading this little skirmish from the Opposition benches. We started off by hearing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was followed Galvin) who, I may say with respect to him, I thought found himself in rather strange company, because the third member of the trinity was my friend, the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns). So there we have the right wing, the left wing, and the wobbly wonder boy in between. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the wobbly wonder boy of the Labour Party, was sandwiched in between. What did they do? They tried as hard as they could again to drive a wedge between us and the United States, and they did that by resorting to a freedom of interpretation of the printed word which I can only say in relation to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was very free for somebody who has had training in the law. We can forgive, perhaps, the honourable member for Yarra, because he is at times given very much to tergiversation. But the proposition that has been put is this: Because President Johnson said that he was prepared to undertake, unconditionally, talks with a view to achieving a peaceful settlement in Vietnam, he is to be taken as consenting or submitting to the condition or term imposed by the North Vietnamese Government that the Americans must get out before any negotiations start. I should have thought that that interpretation of what appears in tonight's newspapers was nothing short of a perversion of the plain meaning of plain words. I was surprised and rather disappointed to find that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, despite the necessity he finds to ride sometimes with one camp-sometime s side saddle-and sometimes with the other camp, should take this interpretation, despite the honourable member for Yarra for his the urgent necessity that besets him in his quest for leadership. Why should he do it, and do it in such strange and ill-assorted company? It is quite plain, if one reads this evening's newspaper in a sensible way that President Johnson has said nothing that conflicts in substance or in fact with what the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) said in this House the other day in answer to a question without notice. Dr. J. F. Cairns -I s your legal training helping you now? better than the honourable member for Yarra, legal training or no, because I do perversion of ordinary language to make a cheap political point, as the honourable member for Yarra did tonight and as he has not infrequently done in this House. I ask honourable members to listen to what the "" Daily Mirror"" reports the President as having saidWe will not be defeated. We will not grow tired. We will not withdraw. A point has been missed by honourable members opposite. I feel that the Opposition wants to miss this point because if its members took it into account they could not succeed in making a cheap debating point. The point that has been missed is that the North Vietnamese Government has always said, "" No peace until the Americans get out"" and here is President Johnson saying now, "" We will not get out"". Could anything be plainer? I turn now to another newspaper in which is published comment by American officials on President Johnson's remarks. I have heard no reference by the Opposition to this comment. . . neither the United States nor the North Vietnamese would be obliged to stop hostilities nor take action of any kind as a condition for agreeing to talks. The Prime Minister the other day said no more in substance than this. The right honourable gentleman asked: "" Who would agree to the proposition that the Americans should negotiate after they have stopped fighting?"" Is that any different from what President Johnson said? I would have thought it was exactly the same. We are accustomed in this House to hearing strange interpretations of words by own purposes. I can only say that I am",107,Adjournment

Are (a) air-conditioning units or (b) overhead fans installed in some houses provided for postmasters in country areas? 2. If so, does this apply in any particular area of each State? 3. If this is the case, which are those areas? 4. If such units or fans are not installed, is any other cooling system provided in high temperature areas? Houses Houses Totals able member's questions are as follows1.

188,Cb) Mr Hulme,"The answers to the honorAvaition has supplied the following information1. At present the Department has 79 houses of which 71 were purchased to provide accommodation for departmental employees. 2. The houses are situated at Albany 2, Broome 11, Carnarvon 12, Derby 7, Forrest 3, Geraldton 4, Halls Creek 1, Jandakot 1, Kalgoorlie 6, Meekatharra 5, Onslow 2, Perth Airport 9, Port Hedland 11, Wyndham 5. All these houses are occupied by departmental employees except eight recently acquired to permit development of Perth Airport. These houses at Perth are to be disposed of progressively, but are at present leased to tenants. 3. Staff occupying departmental houses at Grade6 and 7 District Allowance localities, i.e., at Broome. Derby, Halls Creek, Port Hedland and Wyndham, are charged rental on the basis of 10 per cent, of their minimum actual salary. At other localities, except where the occupant has an incidental departmental obligation of supervision over personnel or property (e.g., a caretaking responsibility), rental is based on an economic formula. This provides for recovery of the capital cost of the house plus interest at 34 per cent, over the estimated life of the house in addition to the cost of maintenance, insurance, general water and sewerage rates, and a 5 per cent, administrative charge. Australian Investment in Indonesia. (Question No. 943.) Mr Whittorn asked the Minister for External Affairs, upon noticeIn view of the takeover or confiscation of American oil interests in Indonesia by the Government of that country, can he say whether Australian investments in Indonesia are of large proportion, what form they take, and whether they are in jeopardy as a consequence of the recent moves by the Indonesian Government? able member's question is as followsThere is only one Australian firm which has established a subsidiary in Indonesia, and there is no other significant private investment there. The firm concerned is engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. The Indonesian Government has given no indication that this firm will be affected by the recent action taken in respect of oil Commonwealth grants to the States for companies operating in Indonesia. Education Report. Sir Robert Menzies -This morning the honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury) asked me when the Annual Report of the Commonwealth Office of Education for 1964 will be available for the information of honourable members. I am informed that the report is in the final stages of preparation. I am confident that in the week that Parliament resumes following the Easter recess I shall be in a position to table the report. Shipping. (Question No. 916*) Mr Reynolds asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice1. Has consideration been given to the construction of "" Empress"" type roll-on, roll-off ships for use along the east coast between, say, Sydney and Cairns? 2. If so, does he share the optimism of shipping authorities that such services would be in great commercial demand and would lead to immense development of the tourist trade? 3. If no consideration has been given to the proposition, will he now examine it? able member's questions are as follows1. The Australian Coastal Shipping Commission has actively pursued the possibility of extending its roll-on roll-off, lift-on lift-off shipping facilities around the eastern seaboard of Australia. Tenders are expected to be called for one, two or three roll-on roll-off vessels in the near future for use in selected trades on the east coast. These vessels are being designed, however, primarily as cargo vessels. 2 and 3. There is little evidence of optimism among shipping authorities that a passenger cargo vessel would be in great demand in the particular circumstances. The opportunities for the trade have been examined closely by the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission which is not satisfied that the potential demand would justify the building of a special passenger vessel for the proposed service at the present time. The Department of Shipping and Transport is not aware of any private shipowner being interested in the trade. Commonwealth Aid Road Grants. Mr Harold Holt -On 6th April, the honourable member for Hume( Mr Pettitt) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) asked me questions without notice concerning the manner in which roads are subsequently distributed by the States. I am now in a position to supply the following information to the honourable members. While the terms of the Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation specify that each State must spend at least 40 per cent, of its total grant on rural roads, other than highways, trunk roads or main roads, the detailed allocation of these funds-includin g its distribution among particular local authorities-is determined solely by the",110,Answers Toquestionsuponnotice

191,Mr Freeth,"The answers to the honorState Governments themselves. If, therefore, certain local authorities-suc h as tbe Shire Councils mentioned by the honourable rr.ember for Hume-fee l that they are not receiving an equitable share of the road grants being paid to the States by the Commonwealth Government, this is a matter which should be taken up with the State Government concerned. The responsibility for determining that the road grants paid to the States are spent in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation rests with the Minister for Shipping and Transport. To satisfy the Minister on this point, the States supply him with annual statements-certifie d by the State Auditors General-showin g details of expenditure of the grants under the relevant sections of the Act. The Minister for Shipping and Transport has been satisfied that over the years since the introduction of the 40 per cent. "" rural roads "" provisions in 1954, all States have in fact expended on rural roads, as defined, the required proportion of the total grants received. I understand that there have been only two or three occasions involving very minor amounts, when the Minister for Shipping and Transport decided that expenditure on certain items-not , however, related to the "" rural roads"" provision-coul d not be regarded as legitimate expenditure within the provisions of the 1959 Act.",111,Answers Toquestionsuponnotice
