Has he discovered, as the result of his inquiry, that what the National Bank of Australasia Limited actually stated was that from tiie official estimate of last year's national income adjusted in terms of the wholesale price index and the population increase, it would appear that real income per head of population had improved to the extent of about 14 per cent, on pre-war levels. Did the hank's statement continueyet how can the finding that roal income has increased be reconciled with the experience of greatnuuiberE of people who now find their present income less than adequate to obtain goods and services which nine years ago were relatively plentiful and inexpensive.

Sd. a fortnight, giving him a gross income of £7 Os. 8d. a fortnight. In 1947 the Government increased superannuation benefits by 25 pei cent. The net result 1 was to increase this injured lineman's superannuation pension from £5 to £0 5s. a fortnight; but at the same time he was informed by the Postmaster-General's Department that as the result of the increase of the superannuation pension hi conipensation payments had been reduced from £2 Os. Sd. to os. Sd. a fortnight. The final result was that this injured man, who, incidentally is a married ex-serviceman whose two sons served in World War IL , and who has two children still at school, has had his income reduced by 10s. a fortnight.

The equalization of returns from cheesesold locally and that sold overseas is carried out by Equalization Limited. 1 am making inquiries into the matter but so far as I can ascertain it is not admitted that cheese manufacturers cannot compete with butter and other factories processing milk. I admit that there has been a disputation, and I am taking steps to have omcers made available to investigate the figures of some of the complaining butter and cheese factories to see whether there is any real substance in the allegations that have been made that they cannot compete with the people who purwill have some officers seconded to thai work.

Can he inform Speaker and Mr President in association with the committee set up for that purpose. I shall, however, bring the honourable member's question to the notice of Mr Speaker. The matter raised in the second part of tlie honourable member's i|uestion does not come directly under my control, because it is one associated with certain functions of the House, in connection with which several authorities II re concerned. I shall certainly have the honourable member's question brought to fhe notice of those authorities. of the recent additional drastic cuts in furnish it to the House at a later date? petrol and the provision that ration rickets which are not used within the two-monthly rationing period are canthe honourable member has quoted for the celled, will the Prime Minister consider production of petrol in the Netherlands the reasonableness of allowing counEast Indies are not correct.

A question was raised in this House yesterday concerning tourist buses, which, of course, provide facilities for families to travel to certain centres. It was suggested that services should be curtailed. The honorahle gentleman now raises the question whether provision might be made for country people to drive cars to seaside resorts. These requests appear to be in conflict. However, I shall refer the honourable member's question to the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the petrol situation, which as he cities and particularly in country districts where nroduction, and social and sporting life depend, on transport. Has the right honourable gentleman seen the published figures to the effect that in the Netherlands East Indies petrol production exceeds 2,600,000 tons per annum, whereas Australia's requirements are uie where the petrol refined in the Netherlands East Indies is sent? Why cannot Australia obtain more petrol from that source? Is some of the petrol* being sent to the United States of America? If it is, has he seen published figures showing that America's petrol position is eminently satisfactory, and that this year, the United States' reserves will exceed the reserves for many years past?

The Vacuum Oil Company Proprietary Limited has oil refineries in Sumatra, and the Shell Oompany Balikpapan and elsewhere in the Netherlands East Indies. The refineries at Balikpapan were badly damaged, during the war, but the Vacuum Oil Company of Australia Limited, has been able to get its refinery at Sumatra into operation rapidly. I understand that both oil companies are increasing production, but I am not able to inform the honourable member of the exact output of oil from those sources. One of the problems associated with petrol at the moment is not so much the supply of crude oil as refining. Tbe closing down of the big refinery at Haifa has meant the loss of production of between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 tons of oil per annum. Proposals are now under consideration, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in other countries, for the construction of additional refining plants. It is perfectly true that oil may be diverted' from the Netherlands Piast Indies to countries other than Australia, but the destination of the oil is a matter for the companies concerned to determine. The Vacuum Oil Company has already 'brought a numher of tankers to Australia. However, rather than cover at this stage all the ground involved in the honourable members question, I shall adopt his suggestion and prepare a statement on the subject. M.r.

Air any information to support the report, that the programme for the production of Tudor aircraft has been cancelled?

Of course, I do read a large number of extracts from American economic papers, and I am supplied by our Bureau of News and Information in t.he United States of America with facts which enable me to obtain a knowledge of the opinions of various people who claim to be authorities on economics in that country. The impression which I have gained from reviews of the position is that at the moment, as the result of rising prices, Americans are spending, in the aggregate, more than they are earning, and that there has been some tightening up in the matters which the honoriible member has mentioned. Some economics reviewers are pessimistic about the position, and believe that a measure of recession is inevitable. Others believe that the Marshall Aid plan and the demands that it makes on American industry, and the rearmament programme which is proceeding in that countiy, will provide a further stimulus to industry :ind production.

If the honourable member will supply me with the details, I shall ascertain whether the widow fo whom he has referred is entitled to a benefit.

50,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade rSydney Sun published the following story from its Canberra representative:The Britisli Government is urging Australia to impose more stringent secrecy safeguards-on scientists associated with the Central Australian rocket range project. Britain insists that only scientists who will give unqualified assurances that they w ill comply with secrecy requirements shouid be employed on the project. It is understood that a reason why the United States Governnient is not co-operating on the project is it fears for the secrecy of its scientific data. It is supplying data to Britain on condition that it is not made available elsewhere. Australia is not specilically mentioned, but it is understood that the "" elsewhere "" referred to is Australia. On the following day, under the heading ""Dedman is Satisfied on Security"", the following appeared in the Sydney Sun:( Mr Dedman) said to-day he was ""perfectly satisfied "" with the security measures to protect rocket range secrets. "" As far as my knowledge goes, the same opinion is held by the British Government"", he said. Mr Dedman said that lie had no comment to make on a report that the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research had been ""frozen o u t "" of rocket range secrets at the request of the British Government. "" From the security angle, what the British Government thinks about security is not a matter for public discussion "", he argued. So, it will be seen that, more than four months ago, the Australian press called attention to the fact that Australia was being denied important defence secrets. [ turn now to the 24th July, when the Sydney Morning Herald, in an article headed "" US. Hugs Secrets, Leakage Here Feared "", stated that it was understood that tlie United States had in the last year shown reluctance to reveal atomic research secrets to Australian scientists because, it was claimed, leakages were likely to occur through Australian Communists. inform the right honourable gentleman and all other honourable members at the outset The Chair does not wish to confine the of the debate that discussion of the motion debate.

56,Mr Fadden,"Many things hapmust assuredly have come to the knowledge of the Qovernment and its investigation officers, or it should. have done so, as far back as the 13th June last. WhatI disclosed in the House were thc facts as published in the press. In addition I brought proof that responsible Ministers had mislecl not only the House but also the country in ihis matter. That matter may not be debated. fact that prompted the making of my motion was the vi.=it of two men in plain clothes, accompanied by a parliamentary messenger who ordinarily accompanies interviewees, to my typists' office a week mons to JamesI . in the early sixteen .igo to-day. They requested an interview with mc. wa.s "" Mr Wilks"". until they were actually in my room stud hacl introduced themselves that I knew they were investigation officers n nc! not interviewees such as every lionorable member sees in the ordinary course of his business as a parliamentarian. inquired at tbe side door, and then they came into my room through the front -loor of the room opposite the entrance from the corridor to this chamber. No telephone request for an interview had lx;en made, and no mention was made of the fact that the men were investigation officers before they gained acc&3s to my office. The fact that one of them, for the purpose of gaining access into my office, stated his name to my staff as "" Mr"" , fere with the parliamentary privilege of :ind did not preface it with ""detective inspector"", shows how carefully they concealed their identities and the true: purpose of their mission until they had established themselves within the four walls of my official office. That is apparently what the Prime Minister described as ""security police asking for ;i nd being afforded an interview"" and what he subsequently described as a ""voluntary interview"", in his letter to me. I reiterate that the security police gained access to my room by not disclosing their identity until they were inside. By accident or design, they passed themselves off to my typist as ordinary citizens wishing to see me. Any member )C the puhlic is entitled to request an interview with me as a member of this Parliament. That so-called voluntary interview, at the express direction of both the Prime Minister and the Acting Attorney-General, occurred a week afteT 1 had raised the .matter on the floor of the House. By that time tliose Ministers should at. least have had before them the report on the Sandys case, and consequently should have known the extent of the privileges of honourable members. Interference by the Executive with members of Parliament in the free exercise of their duties has, from the dawn of constitutional history, been bitterly resisted in England. In the petition by the Comhundreds, it was asserted thatThe name given Freedom of debate being once {ovccVceed, the It was not essence of liberty of Parliament is withal dissolved. P y m subsequently saidParliaments without parliamentary liberties are but a fair and plausible way into bondage. It was H favourite device of the Stuart kings, who apparently had tbe same idea In the first instance they of divine right of the executive as have some modern dictators, to throw into prison any member of the Commons who was too outspoken in the House to suit, them, their policy, or their cause. Sir John Eliot and Sir Dudley Digges wew two of the earliest martyrs to be committed to the Tower in the cause of free speech. James II . lost his crown-eve n as the Australian Prime Minister lost his head-largel y through attempts to interfree speech, and his immediate successors, William and Mary, were compelled to subscribe to the third great charter of English liberty, the Bill of Rights, in 16S9. This gave the death-blow to the theory by which the Stuart kings had attempted to resist parliamentary privilege. Section9 of the Bill of Right"" statesThat the freedom of speech, and debates tn proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or plac* outside parliament. That is the law in Australia to-day, ancl the privileges springing from it are equally part of our law by section 4P of the Constitution, which lays down that, the powers, privileges, and immunities of",20,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

58,Mr Fadden,"The commencing;i member of parliament shall be such as are declared by the Parliament and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the Tjnited Kmgdom. and of its members and committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. The Sandys case is an exact parallel to mine and, I submit, is binding on this House and upon its members, for the same settled and established reasons. About ten years ago a member of the House of Commons, Mr Duncan Sandys, heard a speech by the Secretary of State for War, who intimated that the antinircraft gun position was entirely satisfactory. That was just before World War II . , and the international position was not unlike that prevailing, unfortunately, in the world to-day. On being Htiked by Sandys whether he wa9 stating the truth, the Secretary of State reaffirmed, his statement. Sandys had in his possession secret information to the contrary, and he drafted a question to the Minister, giving precise details of antiaircraft guns and their positions, which effectively proved that the Minister was not telling the truth. His question was provoked by the Minister's original denial on a most vital defence matter, and in the face of such official denial, Sandys ticted in the interests of the defence of the country in getting at the truth in the only possible way left to him. The Attorney-General questioned Sandys and pointed out that failure to disclose the source of his information could mean imprisonment for two years. He said that a refusal could result in a charge under the Official Secrets Act. Up to this point, at least, the two cases ground that it was suspected they were usinj: are strangely parallel. I have also been threatened with the Crimes Act, imprisonment here under that aot, I am told, being for seven years. Also, according to a statement which appeared in the press and attributed to the spokesman of the Governinent, I have also been threatened that I am liable to be exI should like the lionorable member for pelled and will be expelled. I challenge Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) to note that. this Government, in the name of Mr Attlee continueddemocracy and constitutional authority, to expel me. Honourable members The right honourable gentleman is entitled to be heard without interruption. General did not himself interview me, but, at the express dictation of the head of tlie Executive, the Prime Minister, he sent his security police or gestapo to do so. In principle, there is no distinction between the Sandys case and my case. In England, the British Parliamentary select committee, whose decision is, I. submit, binding on * this Parliament under the Constitution, completely upheld Sandys's parliamentary privilege, and denied the right of the Attorney General or any court of military inquiry to question Sandys. Mr Attlee, who wa? then leader of a political party opposed to Sandys, and who is now the Leader of the Labour Government in Britain, said in that debateI think that thc issues are very far-reaching. I think they are of the utmost importance to . . . democracies throughout the wliole world. They involve tinliberties and the rights of membertin this House, acting in the performance of their duty to tlieir constituencies. There can be no greater blow to democracy than the admission of any right of the Executive to hamper, hinder, or restrain members of this House from carrying out their duty to the nation. The freedom of members from pressure by the Executive wa? forced and won years ago, and must be de fended against attack, even if tliat attack should be cloaked under anxiety for thf national safety. . . . We cannot have tinassumption that members of this House nridel ibera tei y acting against the interests of the country. . . If it once could be thought that members could be brought up and interrogated and obliged to give up the source of their information when they speak in this House on the official information improperly got, there would come a cutting away of members from the public service, and there would be apprehension among members of the Public Service when mixing with members of Pari in ment. . . . In practice members do not abuse their privileges. We. are not a House of spies or traitors. . . . I .beg all honourable members, irrespective of party, to realize that this is not a light matter. It is a very big matter and involves interjecting, our rights which we had from our forefathers.",21,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

60,Mr Fadden,"The Acting Attorneyand which we have to protect and hand down to our successors. In these days when liberty is challenged and derided in other countries we rather than one which had a bearing on should be especially vigilant to set an example national security. If any matter affectto the world of the preservation of our parliamentary rights. If this Parliament once decided to break witb the upholding of freedom, an example of which comes to us from tbe Mother of Parliaments, it would be a sorry day for members of this House, irrespective of tbe party to which tbey belonged. Tbere would be no trust between tbeir constituents and themselves. They would be subject to shadowing by the secret police and the gestapo that have been set up by governments such as this. The electors would be afraid to approach their members, whose telephones would be tapped, ancl whose mail would be interfered with. statement made on the floor of the House could be made the excuse for subsequent questioning by the Attorney General's secret police, and imprisonment could be the penalty for a refusal to supply information. It is the business of this Government, as of every government, to guard its own secrets, and it cannot escape that responsibility by attempting to cast it upon members of the Parliament, who have no hand in deciding what information should be withheld from publication. We, in this Parliament, are all representatives of tbe people. This is not Chifley's Parliament! Labour party's Parliament! Parliament of the people of Australia. We owe a duty to the people wbom we represent. My responsibility to my electors is greater than any fear of reprisals. At the first hint that there had been a leakage of security information, the Government sbould have closed the gap if ODe existed. The Government and its investigation service should have been sufficiently vigilant to know as far back as June last, that tbere had been a leakage, but nothing was done to investigate the matter, important as it is now claimed to be. Why was that? It was because the Minister for Defence, by bis misleading and untruthful statement, had bluffed his way through, and the Government was prepared to let the matter rest there. That was the position until I made my statement. ifr. Fadden. taken to make of it a political matter, ing security was involved, why did not the Commonwealth investigation officers begin their inquiries two and a half months ago, when the newspapers first printed reports on the subject? Newspapers in Johannesburg and NeAv York, the London Graphic and our own newspapers publisbed tbe same information as I disclosed. The only difference was that tliey did not have the means to disprove the misleading statement of the Minister. I produced proof, and I must now defend my right.' and privileges as a member of this Parliament, which is an integral part of our British institutions. The action of the Prime Minister in directing CommonEvery, wealth investigation officers to interrogate me is now unmasked as a political manoeuvre, rather than as something which was done in the interests of the national security. The Prime Minister hopes to divert attention from the real issue, which is the truth or falsity of my disclosures, his own probity and that of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman), and the state of preparedness of Australia's defences in the event of a third world war. The fundamental principle involved is whether the Executive or the Pariiamem shall be supreme. If Ministers are to be regarded as oracles, and their statements It is not the or misstatements, even on the most vital It is the defence matters, are not to be questioned by members without fear of reprisal, then the Ministers become dictators, and the authority of Parliament is no more. If to-day members of tbe Parliament refuse to defend their privileges-and this applies to members on both sides of the v House-the y cannot afterwards complain if they, in their turn, bave theii private lives investigated, their private telephones tapped, and their freedom of speech curtailed. As Mr Benn, a member of the select committee in the Sandys case, saidCabinet Ministers, in their relation to the House in which they sit, arc in the first place colleagues of all other members, and only secondarily executive dignitaries. The substance of the parliamentary privilege that they have to respect is the recogThen the opportunity was nition of all their colleagues as confidential and responsible counsellors of state, who are prima facie to be trusted and, if tbey are found to possess and use official secret information, presumed to be acting from motives as patriotic as those of any Minister. Unless this honourable presumption is allowed alike to supporters and opponents of the Government, tlie parliamentary system loses its foundation. We have not yet been in for m e d by the Prime Minister of the truth or falsity of the statement referred to in my original question to him. He is strangely reticent on what is, in fact, the very kernel of the matter. The honourable member is not entitled to discuss the contents of the documents. instead of threatening police action, could have treated the matter as one between responsible counsellors of state. Did he invite me to come to his office? N'o! He resorted to abuse, and called me a "" fence"", a receiver of stolen goods, and at the same time refused to say whether the documents were true or false. Did he approach me and seek my cooperation? He did not. He, as head of the Executive, attempted to use his gestapo to intimidate me. Since he used his secret police against me, he would use them against other honourable members who dared to question his Executive acts. I!f once the Executive, as represented by Cabinet Ministers, is given power to override the Parliament and the privileges of members, then at that very moment our free democracy ceases to exist, and the institution of Parliament, as we know it, is supplanted by a dictatorship of nineteen Ministers answerable to no one but themselves. That is the plain issue, and it cannot be avoided. As the Times said in commenting on the Sandys caseOf any deliberate attempt to encroach upon the historic privileges of the Parliament the committee found no trace. What they did find, and allowed it to appear at least between the lines of their report, was a growing tendency to depart from the traditional relationships between Ministers and private members of Parliament. Here the intangible spirit of the constitution is at issue, and the point was developed very ably by Mr Wedgwood Benn. . Cabinet Ministers, he argued, in their relation to the House in which they sit, are in tlie first place colleagues of all other members, and only secondarily, executive dignatories. I have made this motion in the interests of constitutional government in Australia, and in order to scotch tbe activities of a gestapo, and prevent tbe setting up of a dictatorship. and reserve my right to speak. Minister and Treasurer) [3.45] I do not propose to speak at such length as the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has done, because the issues involved are. very simple. The right honourable gentleman has made some strong comments about tbe fact that two officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service called upon him, I think, last week knows when they called upon me. It is a week ago to-day. be admitted at once, even by the right honourable gentleman, that the investigation officers did not accost bim anywhere in the precincts of tbe House or in bis own rooms.

Some of the facts about tbe interview to which he has referred are most interesting. When the two officers entered his room, they introduced themselves to bim. About the first intimation that they received from the rigbt honourable gentleman was that be intended to summon the press. intimation. The Prime Minister should keep to the facts. mit to that.

The Prime Minister agreed to fix a time for such a motion to be discussed. Notice of motion was given accordingly. However, the salient point in the Sandys case was that, before the House had considered tbe mattei , Mr1 Sandys was summoned to appear, in unir form, as a witness before a military court of inquiry. That act constituted the breach of privilege. Mr Sandys was an officei' of an anti-aircraft brigade.

The Sydney Morning Herald, which used to bave a reputation for accuracy, omitted to mention that salient point. So; also, did the Leader of the Australian Country party.

97,Mr Chifley,"I shall now referread a copy of it in the press. My letter co the right honourable gentleman statedI acknowledge receipt of your letter of 7th October in which you set up a contention that the seeking of an interview with you by officers of tlie Commonwealth Investigation Service on that day in your room in Farliament House constituted a breach of parliamentary privilege. As you are of course aware, your letter did not reach me until after you had published it to the House of Bepresentatives and it had appeared in the press. May I remind you that all that has occurred is' that two officers of the Commonwealth In vestigation Service, charged with the duty of ascertaining whether certain documents to which you had referred were either stolen or were forgeries, asked for, and were accorded, an interview with you. Their purpose in approaching you, as indicated subsequently in tlie letter of the same day addressed to you by the Acting Director of the Investigation Service, was merely to usk that you allow them to examine tlie documents. 3. The taking of tliat course by the investigation officers can hardly be regarded as other than a preliminary step in order that they might be in a position to pursue their inquiries witli a clearer understanding of what ihe nature, and tlie direction, of their inquiries should be. Nor does it appear to me that any person, not even a member of Parliament within Parliament House itself, can have any legitimate objection to a request of t h a t ' kind, a request courteously made at a voluntary interview-not , be it noted, an. "" interrogation "" eitlier in the sinister sense is not the property of this Government that you attribute to tliat expression or in any other sense. 4. It was thought tliat you. as one who has borne responsibility as a Minister of State, would be only too sensible of the serious implications of the suggestion that the documents have been either stolen or are forgeries. Consequently, it was felt that you would be willing, aud"" indeed you would have felt under an imperative obligation, to aid proper inquiry to determine whether these documents were the subject of theft or forgery. I regret to note that there is no recognition at all in your letter of any such obligation. 5. The contention that wliat has occurred amounts to a breach of parliamentary privilege seems to me entirely misconceived and unwarranted, and I think, on reflection, you yourself will be forced to that conclusion. No one is more solicitous for the maintenance of the privileges of Parliament than I am myself, but, were your contention of privilege conceded, privilege would tend to become so strained us to lose its meaning and purpose. For your contention-is tantamount to a claim that, as a member of Parliament, yon arc to be regarded as virtually immune to any official approach whatsoever in relation to any document to whicli you may chance to have referred in proceedings in Parliament, notwithstanding the authenticity of the document is the subject of official investigation and the Mr Ohig.ey. result of the investigation may have an intimate bearing on tlie orderly conduct of government und on national security. I am quite unable to accept such a claim as valid, and I ain advised that no support for so extreme a proposition is to be found in parliamentary law or practice. 6. I am firmly of thc view tliat co-operation on your part is properly to be looked for in this matter, and I urge that you reconsider your attitude and allow the documents to be examined by the investigation officers. That is all they sought to ask you. 7. With regard to your first question, as already indicated, the purpose of the interview was to seek examination of the documents in question. S. With regard to questions 2, 3 and 4, J have nothing to add to the statements already made by me in Parliament. It would appear from your letter that members of the joint Opposition parties refuse to co-operate in any investigation directed to the question of whether thefts or forgeries have been committed by persons within or outside the Public Service. propaganda. Two documents have apparently come into the hands of the right honourable gentleman. The first is the property of the British Government, if it is genuine. If it is not a genuine document, it is a forgery. I emphasize that if the document is a genuine one, it but the property of the British Government. The second document is apparently marked "" confidential "" ancl relates purely to departmental matters. If that is a genuine document, it has been stolen from somewhere. If it is not a genuine document, it is a forgery. The Government made a request to the right honourable gentleman, who is a Privy Councillor and an ex-Prime Minister of Australia, to assist it in attempting to discover whether there are thieves or forgers in the Public Service or elsewhere. It appears clearly from the letter that the right honourable gentleman wrote to me and from the speecb be has made to-day that the Government can expect no cooperation from him or otber members of the Opposition in that inquiry. Tbe Government knows, therefore, precisely where it stands. It knows that the activities of thieves or forgers, no matter what damage tbey may do, will be condoned by honourable members opposite, or at any rate will not be revealed unless tbey may be turned to political",26,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

99,Mr Chifley,"Neve r mind aboutadvantage. There has been a great deal of shouting about security. An opportunity bas been afforded to honourable gentlemen opposite to assist in apprehending either thieves or forgers, but tbey have declined to perform that national duty. Anything tiiat they have said on this matter in this House has been said with the object of gaining some political advantage and not to benefit tbe country. They can go on tbeir merry way. If tbere are thieves in the Public Service, I do not suggest that tbe right honourable gentleman himself meets them, but they know that if tbey band their stolen material to the right peopkj those people will pass it on to the Opposition -and, if it bas some political value, it will be made public irrespective of what -damage might thereby be done. I do not tbink that that is a very nice state of -affairs.. If tbe Leader of the Australian Country party, with wbom I bave always had very pleasant relations in this Parliament, feels that it is, I can only say that my conception of privilege is totally -different from his. It bas been said that parliamentary privilege is a marvellous thing, but it has also been said that it is a coward's castle. I value it highly. I dislike the violent and sometimes slanderous attacks that are occasionally made upon people under the protection of parliamentary privilege, but privilege is of great benefit wben members of the Parliament find it necessary to make statements that, although they are perfectly -true, may be regarded in law as libellous. I conclude on this note. Nobody is imperilling the privileges of any member of the Parliament. No attempt has been made to> imperil tbese privileges. Further tban that, there has been no offence against privilege. ""Whatever interview was granted by the rigbt bonorable gentleman was granted with bis consent. ""When he said that be would give no information, the officers went away. Tbat was all that happened. Tbere was no duress. He was not accosted in balls or hotel lounges.

""We know precisely where we stand. ""We need expect no help from members of the Opposition.

If it has some political value, be will always know where to find people who are prepared to use it. Tbose who do use it will claim parliamentary privilege or, as otber people would put it, take shelter in a coward's castle. gentleman has said that before. tion. The Government now has it in black and white that, no matter whether national security is imperilled or not, it need expect no assistance from those who rant so much about security. We have listened to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). attempting, to defend a serious invasion of tbe privileges of members of the Parliament. We have also listened to laughter from the Government benches during tbe debate on this far-reaching issue. Tbe rigbt bonorable gentlemanattempted' to lay down a smokescreen to conceal the real issue. He spoke of thieves and forgers, but he bad not the faintest idea of what he was talking about. How can a document be said to be a stolen governmental document if it is not a governmental document ? How can a non-existent document be forged? Eight from tbe beginning of this matter, tbe Opposition has asked the Prime Minister, in terms that cannot be misunderstood', "" I s this document a genuine governmental document ? "" For some time the Prime Minister bas been in possession of our offer to consider tbe position if he will say that it is a governmental document, but be has refused to do so-. The Government is trying to lead tbe people of Australia to believe that it is a stolen document when they do not know whether it belongs to a government or not. Does that make sense ? It issaid that if thedocument is not a stolen one it is a forgery, but a document cannot be forged unless it exists. Tbe crux of the matter is whether",27,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

If tbe bonorable gentleman does not resume bis seat when I rise, I shall have to deal with bim. He is not entitled to indulge in an attack upon the Prime Minister. Tbe honourable member is aware of my previous ruling. He bas sought to discuss the background of this incident. The debate must be confined to the subject matter of the motion of privilege. the Prime Minister to deal with tbe background of the incident leading to tbe motion of privilege. I understand that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, asked for leave of the Prime Minister to interrupt his remarks. You permitted the right honourable gentleman to make an attack on honourable members on this side of the House and you refuse to allow us to reply to it. The honourable member must not reflect on the ruling of the Chair. The Prime Minister sought to establish that no breach of privilege had occurred. Honourable members interjecting, Dntil now the debate has been conducted in an orderly fashion. I insist that honourable members refrain from interjecting. Every honourable member must be heard in silence. The bonorable member for Warringah is debating matters irrelevant to tbe motion before the House. Tbe debate must be strictly confined to the incident of the calling of the investigation officers upon the Leader of the Australian Country party. I shall direct my remarks solely to certain allegations made by the Prime Minister. I assume that if they were relevant to the motion before the Chair, our replies to his charges are also relevant. Tbe Chair will be the judge of that. the Prime Minister is seeking to make is that tbe documents quoted from in this House were either forged or stolen and that the Opposition is doing nothing about it. As the rigbt bonorable gentleman and every member of tbe Cabinet know, the truth is that tbey have been asked to say whether or not the documents are genuine Cabinet documents. They have refused to make an admission on that point one way or another. How, in tbese circumstances, the issue can be closed in that way I am at a loss to understand. Tbe Prime Minister has sought to make it appear that two investigation officers, let U3 say, two gentlemen of the police force, went to the office of the Leader of the Australian Country party who, when he saw them, said, "" Come in and sit down "", shook them by the hand and asked, ""What is it all about?"" The truth is that these men were sent there as tbe result of intimidation exercised by the Prime Minister in this chamber. That is the whole gist of this matter. I propose to go into what was said by the Prime Minister of this country wbo now tries to suggest that there was nothing improper about intimidating members of the Parliament by seeking to prevent them from exercising their free and deliberative rights. On the 5th October the Prime Minister, again using terms that seem to come so inaptly from the political leader of this country, spoke about "" stooges "" and "" urgers "" who steal information from confidential documentsand disclose such information. The right honourable gentleman saidThus, the Comnionwealth Investigation Service, while continuing its efforts to tighten up the security of the country, now has thrown upon it the additional task of supervising the activities of members of the Parliament.

113,Mr Spender,"The charge whichThe Acting Leader of the Opposition askedWill the Prime Minister elaborate that statement? It implies a threat, and the right honourable gentleman should say what he means. The Prime Minister repliedIn case tliere is any mistake about the matter, I repeat that members of the Parliament have been prepared to quote from documents which they know are either stolen or forged. The honourable member for Indi by interjection askedWhat are they! The Prime Minister repliedI u this instance it did not matter what they they were. The action taken by those involved is entirely discreditable. The Commonwealth investigation officers will not be remiss Mark these words in their task of ensuring that public documents shall be safe from not only the Communists, but also others who are prepared to use them, not in the national interest, but solely in order to gain some paltry political advantage, not caring to what degree the country may be thereby discredited. Then the right honourable gentleman continuedThat brings us to what is to me a unfortunate position, that is, that the vernment becomes obliged to supervise the activities of some members of the liament. Tn the face of that statement from the Prime Minister where is there room for any suggestion that the visit of the investigation officers to the Leader of the Australian Country party could be described as a "" voluntary "" interview and not one made in pursuance of the intimidatory threats made by tbe Prime Minister? Immediately afterwards, we are told, two investigation officers were sent to look at the document. To look at what document? A document wbicb it was alleged bad been stolen? If tbe officers knew that it was a stolen document they did not need to look at it. If they knew that it was a' forged document they did not need to look at it. The sole purpose of their visit is transparent. The story of their visit to look at the document will not fool ""Blind Freddie"". N'o man in his senses would be fooled by it. The truth is that the investigation officers visited tbe office of the Leader of the Australian Country party solely to interrogate him. They were to find out tbe source of bis information. That is the gist of this matter. It raises the question of far-reaching importance -to the proper discharge of parliamentary government. The incident took place in quite clear circumstances. The Prime Minister issued threats in this House of his intention to supervise the activities of certain members of this Parliament, of whom, clearly, the Leader of the Australian Country party was one. Immediately afterwards two investigation officers were sent to the office of the Leader of tbe Australian Country party. They appeared tbere ten minutes before the Parliament assembled. It is said that the Leader of the Australian Country party granted them an interview. Any one who wishes to know the whole truth of tbe matter must realize how idle is such a statement because the immediate reaction of the Leader of the Australian Country party was to raise the matter on a question of privilege in this House. Does that indicate that he had freely interviewed these two investigation officers? In a word the alleged interview was unquestionably tbe commencement very of an interrogation which would have Gocontinued had tbe officers been permitted even to proceed. That is the very fabric of the Parmotion submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party. Unless members of the Parliament are entitled to claim privilege in respect of information that comes to tbem, there can be no proper discharge of tbeir duties in this Parliament. Thus, tbe maintenance of our privilege is a matter wbich not only touches us as members but also goes to the very framework of our democratic institution. It is rather significant to compare the reaction of the Prime Minister to the challenge to privilege in this House, with that of Mr Attlee, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and a representative of the same party, at least in name, when a similar matter was raised in the House of Commons. I ehall deal witb the Sandys case and show in quick outline how hopelessly again the Prime Minister of Australia has been misinformed. The right bonorable gentleman did not read the Sandys caee; be simply read what somebody gave bim to read. He did not know that there were three matters in the Sandys case; he thought there was only one. Mr Attlee, present Prime Minister of Great uttered words which have a direct bearing on this matter and sbould sink deeply into the minds of the members of the Government. Sandys bad information which, it was admitted, was a breach of tbe British Omciai Secrets Act of 1911. There was no dispute about that -He had received highly omciai secret information with respect to the defences of 'Great Britain. That he had received information in breach of the act was not disputed. 'The Sandys case is somewhat different from this case in that not tbe slightest evidence has been given, because tbe Prime Minister bas refused to make an admission on the point, that the document used by tbe Leader party was in fact a State Sandys threat from tbe then and the then .Secretary of State, who told him that unless he disclosed to them the source of his information liable to imprisonment up to two years. The matter was raised in the House of Commons, .and while it was under discussion, Sandys was called before a military Sandys also objected to .that as a breach he Government interrogate 'him with a view to ascertaining the source of his The matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges appreciation of tbe privileges of private members that it was established and bad dealt witb tbe matter witbin 4'8 hours. The committee held that there bad been a breach of privilege in 'both of tbose actions. Not in one of them, but in both of them! attempt by the Executive to a private member in the discharge of his duties, and the action of the Army Council in referring the matter to a court of inquiry, constituted breaches of privilege. When the committee's report was being debated in tbe House of Commons, Mr Attlee uttered words which I suggest might well have been read by the Prime ifr. Spender. Minister before be made his fatuous the speecb on this matter. Mr Attlee saidBritain, Looking for a moment at the issues raised by the possible use of the Official Secrets Act, the real danger is that it gives the Government the power to interrogate persons and to force them to state the source of their This is what took place. information if it is thought that that informagiven to bim tion has been obtained by breach of that Act. . .

I am not judging whether that occurred in this case, but the fact that it has been applied to Members of parliaThe committee said that tbe. ment shows the possibilities. It is not so much intimidate the actual application of the inquisitorial powers of this Act to Members of iParliament, as the apprehension. In other words, there would be tbe fear by public servants, lest it be said that tbey spoke to members of Parliament, and that as a consequence, they may be visited by security police. T-hey would fear subsequent action against themselves. There would also be fear by members of the viously lest it might be said that they have to be based upon confidential information, revealed secrets which tbey acquired that could come from you "" .

They might easily say something which a Member might use afterwards, and it before tbem. Tbe first was tbe question might be traced to them. Let us compare that statement witb the statement made by tbe Prime Minister of Australia on the 5th October, with regard to the Public Service, wbicb was as follows:I can only Bay that in future I should think formation that came into their custody that no decent public servant in this country would care to be seen talking to the kind of or under their notice, in breach of the people who quote from what, on their own Official Secrets Act of GreatB r it a in . confession, is a stolen document. Tbis statement by tbe Prime Minister held what would be denied here by was intended for the hearing of and conrejecting this motion. It upheld the sumption by public servants. Here, tbe supreme right of a member of Parliament Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) intimito receive information so long as he does dated the public servants by saying to not solicit it , and tben to iise it to tbe tbem, in effect: "" D o not be seen talking best interests of tbe country.

It comes down to this, that tbe members of the British Parliament have had longer experience than we have bad, and whilst they tend to enlarge parliamentary privilege, we diminish it . Tbe Committee of Privileges in thc Sandys case statedYour Committee are of opinion that disclosures by members in tlie course of debate or proceedings in Parliament cannot be made the subject of proceedings under the Official Let us consider the B ill of Eights.

In our legislation there is express propeached or questioned in any court or place vision retaining those privileges. Mr Spender. of the Parliament knew view of Sir Gilbert Campion is supported by an annexure to the report, which I take leave to read. It is in the form of a letter from tbe clerk of the committee to the Attorney-General, and reads as follows:The question was raised during yesterday's That criti proceedings whether the ninth article of the Bill of Rights had not been repealed by implication by tlie Official Secrets Acts 1911, so far as the unauthorized disclosure of official Thousinformation is concerned. It is clear to me from what you say on page 4 of your memorandum that you do not take this view, but if you would authorize me to tell my_ Committee so, it will save them from having to hear evidence on the point. Tbe relevant portion of the reply to that letter reads as follows:With regard to the point raised in the firsrt. paragraph of your letter, you were right in assuming that tlie statenient which I made on page 4 of my Memorandum was based on the view that the Official Secrets Acts had not repealed by implication the ninth article of the Bill of Bights. It is part of the law of this land. It was In 1908 a committee went into the matter of parliamentary privileges in this country. It drew attention to the fact that by the Constitution there is that we all may be quite sure that we ceedings in Parliament ought not to be imThe out of Parliament. Could there be a clearer case of the' disregard of that provision than the present one? Let us review what took place. Inside of this House the Leader of the Australian Country party regarded it as bis duty to the Parliament to show that Ministers of State and indeed the Prime Minister himself, were giving false information to the people of this country. Country party quoted two documents. It is not a matter of whether they were genuine or not. The Leader of tbe Australian Country party was questioned about what had taken place inside the House, because tbe documents were quoted by him in this House. Could there be any clearer case of an infraction of parliamentary privilege than this one? It is not without significance that tbe Prime Minister sbould speak about the revealing of official secrets, and sbould seek to castigate the Opposition. He was not so reluctant to reveal official question binges on that. The Prime Minister not very long ago said that no force in Europe to-day could withstand tbe Russians sweeping right through the continent. He added that his statement was based on private correspondence and official documents from British Commonwealth sources. Surely we have a case here of Satan reproving sin. quote the exact words of secret official documents, but in his feckless way he told the whole world the contents of those documents, and his statement was published throughout the world. I want to make it as plain as possible that the issue involved in this debate is not what happened to this or that document. The documents are beside the real point. The real issue touches on any criticism by any member of the Parliament or the Executive. This is the same fight which has been waged over and over again, the fight between the Parliament and the Executive. At one time, it is against a despotic king;' at another, it is against despotic Ministers who are members of tbe Executive. If honourable members do not realize that there is inherent in this motion an issue of far-reaching importance to our parliamentary institutions, it will be a bad day for us. Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [4.47J -Tb e Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) began his speech by relating a series of alleged events as background to tbe incident which occurred within the precincts The Leader of the Australian of this chamber, and in regard to wbich he claimed that a breach of privilege had been committed. He read what purported to be a number of press statements, and then he seized on the opportunity, as also did the bonorable .member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) to attack my integrity. In tbe light of the statements made in this House last week and this week, and in the light of the alleged documents, stolen or forged, as the case may be, I have examined all the speeches that I made on tbe subject of security, and there is not one word in tbem that I would alter. Therefore, any charge secrets himself. Another which the Opposition might make against me of having misrepresented certain things to this House is entirely false. The Leader of the Australian Country party referred to the Sandys case, and I propose to refer to it also. It may be that there are some similarities between that case and tbe incidents we are now discussing, but tbere are also some very great differences. Mr Sandys bad reThe Prime Minister did not ceived certain secret information. What did be do witb it? He took it to the Secretary of State, and discussed it with him in private.

118,Mr Dedman,"As I have said, itthe Winkler case. The former Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, did not make the information public until he had taken it to the then Prime Minister, who is the present Leader of the Australian Country party, and to the present right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies). Thus, there is a great difference between those two cases and the case we are now considering. The Prime Minister( Mr Commonwealth, or of any State or person. Chifley) made it clear that there was nothing wrong in two officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service coming to this building, and asking to see the Leader of the Australian Country party. It was not an interrogation in the sense that the officers forced themselves into his presence, or demanded that he should answer certain questions. The officers also came to me. I did not shelter behind privilege. I spent one and a half hours with them, and answered all the questions that they put to me about the matter. However, I am not so certain that the Leader of the Australian Country party could not be interrogated, either in this House or 'outside of it, because, let it be clearly understood, a criminal offence has been committed with regard to those documents. ment take action. gentleman will not help us to take action. sion by virtue of his office, and which it is That is the trouble. The plain fact is his duty to keep secret, except to some person that the documents were either stolen to whom he is authorized to publish or comor forged.

120,Mr Dedman,"The right honourable or any document which comes to his possesseparate from the statement made by the rigbt was the receiptof documents which were either stolen or forged. was quite right that officers of the Commonwealth, Acting Attorney-General, should make inquiries in an attempt to sheet home the offence to the criminal, whoever he might be, wbo either stole or forged the documents. It was right that the officers should t r y to obtain tbe necessary information from whatever source they could, including members of this Parliament, if they can throw any light on the matter. It is true that in this, as in other inquiries of the kind, a person, whether a member of the Parliament or a member of tbe public, who is questioned need not answer the questions put to bim. He can say, "" I refuse to answer"", or "" I do not know anything about it "" . However, the Acting Attorney-General, and the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, would be recreant to the trust reposed in them if they did not try in every possible way to find out wbo committed the offence. The Leader of the Australian Country party, by taking up the stand he did, has shown that he is not prepared to assist in sheeting home this very grave crime, because it is a grave crime since it endangered our good relations witb other countries. There is no question but that the officers of the Commonwealtb Investigation Service were entitled to act as they did, and that their action did not constitute a breach of privilege. Tbat point is brought out in the Sandys case itself. The honourable member for Warringah quoted several paragraphs from the report of tbe committee wbicb considered the .Sandys case, but he did not quote paragraph 16, which is as follows:Your conimittee are of opinion that the soliciting or receipt of information is not a proceeding in parliament and that neither the privilege of freedom of speech nor any of the cognate privileges would afford a defence to member of parliament charged with soliciting, inciting or endeavouring to pursuade a person holding office under the Crown to disclose information which such person was not authorized to disclose or with receiving information knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the information was communicated to him in contravention of the Official Secrets Act. I have already quoted the relevant sections honourable gentleman, which of our own Crimes Acti n order to show what constitutes an offence under it . Fbr It our purposes, it corresponds to tbe Official Secrets Act of Great Britain. I suggest instructed by the that the Leader of the Australian Country party, before he came into this House on the day he made his statement, was the receiver of information. In order to use the information in this House, ha must have received it from somebody. me. Minister propose to read the remainder of the paragraph 1 the honourable member in a few moments. It is perfectly clear that tbe Leader of the Australian Country party received information. .That act was quite separate from bis reading of the quotation from a document in the chamber, and. the investigation officers were entitled to ask him questions, wbich he could refuse to answer, as to how be came to receivethat information. The paragraph con, tinuesI t might well be that what the defendant had said in the House had caused the authorities to institute inquiries, but if the prosecution could prove its case without giving evidence of what he had said, the proceedings could not be regarded as a questioning of a debate or proceeding in Parliament. If , however, it were necessary in order to prove the fact charged to .produce evidence of what the defendant had said in the -House, it would be in the power of the House to protect him by withholding .permission for the evidence to be given. I direct attention to tbe word9, "" w it b in the power of the Housei t s e l f "" . That does not mean w it h in tbe power of any particular honourable member opposite, to decide whether the House should give permission. The criminal offence is distinct from what tbe right bonorable gentleman did in this chamber. He merely quoted from a document, and he has claimed that he was entitled to do so. The public shall be the judge of that claim. But before the right honourable gentleman made the statement an offence was committed against the Crimes Act..

123,Mr Dedman,"Yes , I shall satisfydone antecedent to the statement that he made in the chamber. I have now accomplished what I set out to do at the beginning of my speech. I am not ashamed of any statement wbich I have made in this House up to the present time. I have also made it plain that a breach of tbe Crimes Act has been committed, and that it is the duty of the Government to make all possible inquiries to try to sheet the crime home to the responsible individual. In connection with tbose inquiries, tbe investigation officers are entitled to question any person in tbe community, including members of the Parliament. I submitted myself to questioning by them, and I hope that the information which I have been able to give to tbem will hasten the day when the criminal will be discovered. Had the Leader of tbe Australian Country party given to tbe investigation officers the assistance wbich this country was entitled to expect him to give, the matter would have been cleared up long ago. But tbe Leader of the Australian Country party and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) want to lay down the terms on which they will permit the alleged confidential documents to be seen. It is obvious that it would be of great assistance to tbe investigation officers if tbey could see a copy of tbose documents for tbe purpose of ascertaining Avhether tbey were photostats, whether they were complete documents or whether some parts of them are missing. document. photostat. fall for anything. matter to the investigation officers. If the right honourable gentleman were as prompt in assisting them as he is in endeavouring to make jokes about this very serious matter, tbe investigation would proceed much more quickly than it is doing. There was no suggestion whatever on the part of tbe oflieers wbo interviewed the Leader of tbe Australian Country party that they would bring pressure to bear on him, or were intimidating him in any way. What, in fact, they did was to seek his collaboration to clear up a matter relating to tbe security of this country. For months, the rigbt honourable gentleman and otber honourable members opposite bave been emphasizing the necessity for tightening up security measures, but wben tbey have an opportunity to assist, they refuse to give any help to the Government and its officers. Several issues bave been raised in this debate, but I do not intend to be sidetracked from the main one, that of privilege. The Prime Minister( Mr Ohifley), in bis speech, accused the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) of cowardice, and of sheltering behind parliamentary privilege in making certain attacks and charges. Had the Prime Minister been outside the House wben he described the secretary to the Leader of the Australian Country party as an "" urger"", he would be liable to proceedings for defamation, and would not be able to claim parliamentary privilege. While the Prime Minister was addressing tbe House, he made a most cowardly attack upon one of the finest civil servants in the country, whose only crime, if crime it be, is his loyalty to his leader. Therefore, the Prime Minister himself, in attacking that public servant, took advantage of the protection afforded by parliamentary privilege. The Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) bas invoked tbe Crimes Act, and bas attempted in every possible way to at the conceal tbe real issues in this debate. He has alleged that the document has been either forged, or stolen. However, neither tbe Prime Minister nor the Minister for Defence will admit that the document is genuine. Their attitude indicates that it is genuine. If the document is genuine, it is self-evident that the Minister for Defence has told untruths to this House and to the country in relation to defence matters. For example, Mr Harrison directed the attention of Mr Dedman to press reports to the effect that America had refused to make available to Australia information on atomic energy. Mr Dedman denied the truth of those reports. mit that the honourable member for. Richmond is not in order in referring to the",36,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

129,"Mr Cat,Well","I rise to order. I subMinister for Defence as Mr Dedman, and to the Acting Leader of the Opposition as Mr Harrison. The' Standing Orders provide that an honourable member must be addressed by the name of his constituency. ( Mr Lazzarini) I uphold the point of order, and I also remind the honourable member for Richmond that he must not pursue his present line of argument. He must confine his remarks to' the terms of the motion. that line of argument. Parliamentary privilege is a matter which directly concerns every honourable member, regardless of the political party which he supports. In the course of the years, the Opposition of to-day becomes the government of to-morrow and vice versa. Tbe privileges of all members of the Parliament, irrespective of their party affiliations, must be safeguarded, not in their own interests, but in the interests of tbe people whom they represent, so that members may speak tbeir minds freely in tbe National Parliament. Parliamentary privilege is not of recent origin. At the commencement of every British Parliament since tbe 6th Henry VIII . , it has been the custom for the Speaker to present the following petition to the King's representative, the Lord Chancellor:Tn the name, and on behalf of the Commons, to lay claim by humble petition . to tlieir ancient and undoubted rights and privileges; particularly that their persons and servants might be free from arrests and all molestations; that they may enjoy liberty of speech in all their debates; may have access to Her Majesty's royal person whenever occasion should require; and that all their proceedings may receive from Her Majesty the most favorable construction. The King's representative repliesHer Majesty most readily confirms all the on wbich a member of tbe Parliament rights and privileges which have ever been has maintained his right not to be quesgranted to or conferred upon the Commons, hy Her Majesty or any of her royal predecestioned sors. Wben tbe petition claiming undoubted Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) was ancient rights and privileges was preasked to give evidence before a royal sented to the autocratic Queen Elizabeth, commission, he invoked section 9 of the Her Majesty rebuked Mr Speaker in Bill of Rights and claimed that he was these wordsThe members of the Commons have no right to speak what is freely in their mind. They said inside it. The honourable gentleman have only the right to say "" aye "" or "" nay "". was perfectly correct in so doing. The Commons retaliated. Before Mr Speaker presented the next petition to tbe Queen, the House passed a bill to emphasize its undoubted right to initiate legislation. Tbat practice bas never been discontinued and dominion parliaments observe it. Wben this Parliament began the present session on the lst September last, tbe Prime Minister introduced the Acts Interpretation Bill, and moved that it be read a first time. It will not be proceeded with, but will remain on the notice-paper as a gesture to tbe insistence of the House of Commons about 350 years ago that it intended to preserve its privileges. But our liberties are likely to be bartered away unless we take action to safeguard them. When an attack is made in tbe House of Commons upon parliamentary freedom of speech, or an attempt is made to molest or intimidate any member, every otber honourable member, regardless of the political party to which be belongs, who has a sense of public duty and a regard for parliamentary traditions, springs to bis defence and fights for the preservation of freedom of speech. The privileges of tbe House of Commons were adopted by the Congress of the United States during the War of Independence in 1776. Section 6, clause 91 of the American Constitution contains the following words:. . . and for any speech or debate in either House the Senators and Bepresentatives shall not be questioned in any other place. Those words first appeared in the Bill of Rights, to which tbe honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has referred. That freedom is enjoyed by the House of Commons, tbe Congress of the United States of America and tbe Parliament of the Commonwealtb of Australia. But bonorable members must observe and uphold it. This is not tbe only occasion on statements that he has made in the Parliament.

131,Mr Anthony,"I shall not pursueber did not say that at the time. perfectly within his rigbts in adopting that attitude, even though it was inconsistent with what he had said in the Parliament. I want to show how the privileges of the members of the Parliament bave been fought for and safeguarded. One honourable member went back to tbe time of -BarnesI . , and I propose to go back to tbe ;time of CharlesI . Those who have read -the lustory of that dramatic period in 'British history will recall that at that . time five members of tbe House of Commons were causing CharlesI . considerable trouble. They were John Pym, .John Hampden and three others whose -,names I cannot remember. CharlesI . I^bfiwoglat that they bad been speaking too freely in the Parliament, and be determined"" to arrest tbem. arrived at the House of Commons, he found that they had disappeared. They were shielded by tbeir colleagues. I direct the attention of the House to the similarity between what was said by CbarlesI . on that occasion and certain passages in the letter that was written to the Leader of the Australian Country party by the Prime Minister. Charles saidSinceI see that my birds have flown, I do Parliament or of the Members or Committees expect from you that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return hither. But I assure you on the word of a King that I never did .intend any force He arrived w it h a guard of 80 ruffians, all armed to the teethbut shall proceed against them in a legal and fair way, for I never meant any other. When Charles arrived at the House of Commons, he saidGentlemen, I am eorry for this occasion of coming unto you. Yesterday I sent a Serjeant-at-Arms upon a very important occasion to apprehend some that by my command were accused of very high treason, whereunto I did expect obedience and not a message. I must declare unto you here that albeit no king that ever was in England shall be more careful of your privileges, to maintain them to the uttermost of his power, than I shall be. In the letter that the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Australian Country party, he saidThe contention that what has occurred amounts tn a breach of parliamentary privilege seems to me entirely misconceived ttiitf unwarranted, and 1 think, on reflection, you yourself will be forced to that conclusion. No one is more solicitous for the maintenance of the privileges of Parliament than I am myself, but, were your contention of privilege conceded, privilege would tend to become so strained as to lose its meaning and purpose. Tbat was all very much like the statements of CbarlesI . It is 350 years since Cbarles entered tbe Palace of Westminster to intimidate the free Englishmen of that day, but the spirit lives on. The parliamentarians of Britain were then resisting the Executive of the day. We now have a constitutional monarch, who has no power to appoint Prime Ministers and virtually no Executive authority. The Executive to-day is tbe Government, and it is that Executive which is seeking to abrogate tbe privileges of members of the Parliament, just as the Executive sought to. do When he long ago. This attempt must be resisted. If the right honourable member for Darling Downs had to go to prison, he would go for a worthy cause. The Minister for Defence said that the Leader of the Australian Country party had contravened the provisions of the Crimes Act, but he did not refer to section 22 of that act, which statesNothing in this Act shall derogate from any power or privilege of either House of the of either House of Parliament as existing at the commencement of this Act. The Minister failed to refer to that paragraph. He was, as usual, attempting to mislead the House. Tbe privileges that are enjoyed by members of tbe Parliament are also guaranteed by section 49 of the Constitution. That section provides thatThe powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom. . . . We do not, however, rely upon those provisions, but upon the common sense of the English-speaking people. I propose to refer briefly to the Sandys case.

Eirst, there is a tap on the door; tben the man is asked politely to come along and have a word with the senior officers at bead-quarters. He is never seen again. That is the beginnings of the gestapo system. The Prime Minister should be the chief defender of our privileges just as is bis opposite number in Great Britain, Mr they defended the general rights and Attlee, who, in one of the finest speeches he has made in the House of Commons, identified himself witb the rights of members of the Parliament. I propose to say only a word or two in regard to what has been described as the "" voluntary "" nature of tbe interview with tbe Leader of the Australian Country party. Whether it was voluntary or not, this interview was in complete breach of the privileges of the right honourable member. In conclusion I desire to quote the greatest authority of the age on constitutional questions, Lord Bryce. In his work, Modern Democracies. Lord Bryce wroteEnough to say that although the conception »f individual liberty may be made to include the exemptions our ancestors contended for in the 17th Century, and although every kind of individual liberty may be called a civil liberty-tlier e is this significant difference that the civil liberties of those older days were extorted from arbitrary monarchs, whereas what we call individual liberty to-day, has to be defended, when and so far as it needs defence, against the constitutional action of a self-governing community. The fight is still being waged. Although these principles were laid down 500 years ago, the struggle still continues between the Executive, which believes it is allwise and all-powerful, and tbe other members of the Parliament. If , as tbe result of governmental action, we allow the privileges of members of the Parliament to be still further whittled away, to that degree we shall approach more closely the authoritarian and totalitarian state which has proved so disastrous in otber countries. I hope that when the feeling which has been aroused by this incident has died down a more balanced view will be taken by honourable members opposite of what it will mean tc them as Mr Anthony. well as to us of members of the Parliament are denied their rights. The day will undoubtedly come wben, with the swing of tbe political pendulum, honourable members now sitting behind the Government will bc in opposition. Then tbey may be glad to invoke parliamentary privilege to protect their rights against a majority. Wben that day comes it is to be hoped that they will be able to say that to-day privileges of all members of the Parliament. agree with honourable members on both sides of the House that this is a very serious debate on tbe question of privilege, but I cannot understand why it has not been brought down to the ordinary levels of good behaviour, and why the Leader of tbe Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has been beating bis breast around the House and the precincts of the House since last Thursday concerning it. The protestation of the Opposition that parliamentary privilege is a matter of high dignity, and one of the most preciouy things we have in the Parliament, has been debased on the dramatics of honourable members opposite. There is an atmosphere abroad in the House of Sexton Blake and his bloodhounds looking for some missing documents. Apparently the fire of tbe bull of New England, who is not in the House to-day, has been injected into bis leader, the right honourable member for Parting Downs, wbo normally sits in clo -e proximity to him. The impassioned speech appeared to come from -a man protesting his own cause too much. The speeches of honourable members opposite have been quite out of character. The first complaint of the right honourable member was that his rights had been threatened. He referred to the privileges tbe members of the Parliament have enjoyed since the early days of the seventeenth century. He spoke of tbe privileges of tbe Parliament and of the King rather than of the people and the Parliament. He took us through devious by-ways of history in a speech written, no doubt, by his very good secretary; but when he came to the",40,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence

The Prime Minister quietly and sincerely made his points. When tbe Leader of the Australian Country party got to that section of his brief, he decided to do nothing about it because he felt that tbe Sandys case did not strengthen his argument. I hesitate to join issue with tbe lawyers in this House, particularly with the bonorable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), who is indeed a very great lawyer if one may judge by the volumes which obscure our vision of his noble stature. Tbe honourable member quoted authorities which unfortunately for him cancel themselves out. Some of tliem even cancel out the bonorable gentleman himself. He quoted authority after authority until he was wearied and there was no original thought left in him. At tbe risk of being considered a humorist, I should say that bis quotations from authorities on parliamentary practice and procedure were a sort of happy combiniation of nuts and May. gentleman, by surrounding himself with books, bas created a figure of great legal dignity. It may be said of him as Shakespeare said of Henry V., recently so admirably portrayed by Sir Laurence OlivierTurn liim to any cause of policy, The Ci: rdian knot of it he will unloose, Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks, The air, a charter'd libertine, is stilt, And mute wonder lurketh in men's ears, To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences. Unfortunately, in assisting tbe rigbt honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member for Warringah unloosed more than his garter; he stripped him altogether; be revealed to us tbe fact that, he was naked of a case in this matter of privilege. He allowed his enthusiasm to go too far and be showed the rigbt bonorable member for Darling Downs as tbe sorry figure of a man trying to get out of the mess of his own creation. Since the bonorable member for Warringah has heen the attorney of the honourable member for Darling Downs in the past, he should have had some experience of this. ' In another case relating to stolen documents tbe bonorable member for Warringah was the attorney of tbe right honourable member for Darling Downs and it cost the rigbt honourable gentleman £400. I hope that, in this instance, his advice is very much better if no cheaper. gentleman admitted that tbe honourable member for Warringah would bave been underpaid at £400, so there is no need for me to make an apology on that point. Earlier in tbe debate you gave a ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the effect that the debate sbould be kept witbin certain limits. I ask you, sir, whether tbe derogatory observations made by the bonorable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), in relation to some other action taken by an honourable member on this side of the House is in order, and, if not, whether you will ask tbe bonorable member to return to tbe motion before the House. The honourable I have already called the honourable member for Parkes to order. If tbe Acting Leader of the Opposition had been listening be would have beard me do so. refer to the statements made by the right honourable member for Darling Downs in regard to security. For a number of months, nay, for years to my knowledge, the right honourable member has complained in this House of the inefficiency of our security measures and of those public servants doing tbe job; but he finds them very efficient when his privileges as a member of this House are threatened. I listened with bated breath to his story of the interview with the officers of the investigation service of which he has complained. I have had some experience as a journalist. 1 have heard of men going up into the skies and down, into the depths of the sea for experimental purposes and for a news story, but this is the first time.

143,Mr Haylen,"I propose now towho wanted to be interviewed by investigation officers in the presence of the press. That action probably reaches the dizzy htights of journalism. The honourable gentleman's future employment by, some newspaper or otber is assured. The two investigation officers quietly asked a few questions. They were taken to his office and ushered in , but when tbey asked to see tbe document from wbicb tbe right honourable gentleman had quoted, then, and then only, was tbe press invited to be present. members of the press were called in ? Is tbere any connection between these documents and the press? I s that yet to be revealed? There are rumours, and one does not want to repeat tbem in this House under privilege, that other people are involved in this thing and that there are sections of the press wbich have something to answer. I mention that in passing because in the interests of security and of our great parliamentary institution I think that everything that has to be said should be said. Getting back to the question of this whole unfortunate business, despite what the books say, despite what May says in his ParUamentary Practice. and despite the Sandys case, which is not completely analogous, as has been proved by the Prime Minister, tbere are some poople in this country who are vitally affected by the debate concerning these documents and by the charges levelled against one another by honourable members in this House. What tbe people want to know, so far as I can' gather, and tbe questions that remain to be answered by the Opposition, particularly by the right bonorable member for Darling Downs, are first, whether a public servant was suborned in tbe matter of these documents, and, secondly, was a document stolen or forged ? There is an extraordinary reply to that contained in the letter wbich the rigbt bonorable member for Darling Downs wrote to the Prime Minister, tbe most amazing correspondence I have ever seen, and which sbould make good reading for jurists for a long time to come. Tbe right honourable gentleman was asked to tell us whether the document was genuine or not, and tbe reply was in effectTell us wketlier it is genuine or not and wo will tell you, or consider telling you, where we got it. Mr Haylen. That is jnst the same as a pickpocket saying to his victim, "" Is this hard or soft currency Pve got from you or have I been tricked ? "" In effect, the right honourable gentleman says, shorn of all the legal sophistries, "" Tell me if the documeni is genuine, and I w ill tell you where I got it"". The right honourable gentleman finds he has a weak case, and nothing he has said in tbe House to-day strengthens that case. If ever I saw an intimidated man I saw one here to-day wben tbe Was tbere some reason why rigbt honourable gentleman faced the Prime Minister. He was intimidated mentally rather than physically-inti midated by the weakness of his case and the knowledge that be had taken the wrong line, on the matter. People outside tbe Parliament bave made comments on this matter, and I quote what has been done here as against what was done in another case. Some reference has been mude to tiie occasion on which another secret document was revealed, and to tbe conduct of the late Mr John Curtin, towards the then Prime Minister. In this connection I quote from tbe Sydney Sunday Sun. I understand the article is a reproduction of a Hansard transcript, with the necessary headings and other alterations. It readsSeven years ago, the late John Curtin, then Labour Opposition leader, ennie into possession of a confidential document. On September 17, 1941, he asked a carefully worded question in I'arliament about public administration. He did not refer to the document, first hint of which was given by the then Prime Minister. Sajd Curtin, in the debate that followed : "" I am not in the habit of having secrets given to me by employees of the Crown. The first thing that I did was to take the matter straight to the head of the Australian Government. When then Attorney-General Hughes interjected, Curtin said, ""Does the right honourable meniber think that I ought to read all the documents in this place?"" If ever there was a straight indication of what course should be followed, it was given on that occasion to the rigbt honourable gentleman for Darling Downs, and there is no excuse for bis action, because he has held the high position in this country of Prime Minister. The newspaper article continued"" I do not at the moment consider that it is a matter for this House to decide "". The then Prime Minister: "" Hear, hear! Curtin: "" I now say to the country that the head of the Australian Government had the text of both documents (one was a report, the other a copy of a cable), and that they were made available to him for hie perusal as early as was practicable for me to hand them to him."" tive had them. is the newspaper viewpoint. I shall now read portions of a long editorial which appeared in the Melbourne Age. In referring to the question of security it saidWhat caused the alleged state of mind of responsible people in Washington and London (assuming it existed) Mr Fadden did not explain. Even after the bitter debate, the question of whether the suspicions have any justification, or are groundless, must still be cleared up. A most unsatisfactory phase is that u party leader bearing an exceptional responsibility saw fit to quote in Parliament from documents which, the Prime Minister said, und has since reaffirmed, were either stolen or forged. That is a very serious statement, gravely disturbing in its implications. By deciding to take the course he did, Mr fadden took risks of finding himself in an awkward position. awkward position. tinuesIfr. Fadden's attempts to justify the usage of the documents do not remove the impression that a public man with a just sense of propriety would have adopted a different course to deal with communications made to him which he regarded as disquieting from the security standpoint, whether the material be genuine or fabricated. Those are interesting statements and are quite above party politics, as this matter should be. Yet the honourable member for Richmond, who joined in this debate, speaks revels in party politics and in anything else that might discredit this Government. His coneeni about what happened to Pym and John Hampden is in due ratio to his knowledge of that period of history. He reads a little here and a little there and then spits it out. I do not mind the honourable member being vicious, but when he becomes pious I am a f r a i d I become a bit sick. It is rather t i r i ng to hear Opposition members continually saying, "" We bave a document"". The Government also has documents. The Prime Minister's attitude in this matter was governed by considerations of security, and of how misstatements may affect Australia's reputation. Concerning tbe Prime Minister's approach to tbe matter, tbe Sydney Daily Telegraph, on the 8th October, bad this to sayW h a t I have quoted Whatever you may think of the squabble Mr Fadden started more than a squabble. the honourable member for Barker, is joining in . I can always picture this old Caledonian coming over the b ill , with bis kilts swinging, bis sporan swirling, a dir k in bis stocking and his bagpipes under bis arm. When I was a new member this display used to intimidate me. To-day I know that it is the same old windbag on tbe warpath. However, returning to tbe proposition concerning secret papers, wbich brought me to my feet, the DaUy Telegraph article continuesby quoting from documents which suggest that tlie Government had not told the truth about America's faith in our security arrangeme in an ments, you cannot seriously deny Mr Ohifley the right to inquire how these documents came into Mr Fadden's hands. That is the basis of our argument. I suggest that if the two people who called on tbe right honourable gentleman bad been two constituents from his new electorate of Macpherson it would have been all right, but the people who did see him were concerned with security. Tbe rigbt honourable gentleman immediately called in the press. It is a wonder he did not also call in the fire brigade. However, I shall read a little more of tbe article. It goes onabout party politics. He If they were stolen the Government's duty is to find out who stole them-and to prosecute. the honourable member is praising the Daily Telegraph ? praising it . I hope tbe bonorable gentleman w ill realize, also, that when I am quoting bim I am not praising h i m . Tbe remainder of the article readsThe fact that tliey happened to be stamped "" secret "" if they were-doe s not necessarily mean that they would arouse a Mata Hari's passing interest.

The Opposition is absurd and insincere when it represents as an invasion of rights and a step towards the police state the Government's efforts to find out what happened and who was guilty. The investigation is merely routine, which Mr Fadden himself would follow if he was in power and suspected that an unauthorised person had taken some' of his administration's papers. The Opposition would put its formidable case a lot more clearly if it cut out the barn-storming hysterics. Ont i e matter of the barn-storming involved. I listened to the honourable hysterics mentioned in the newspaper member for Warringah, who, in regard article, the r i g hi honourable gentleman to the Sandys case, made a f a i r prohas been striking his breast since last nouncement on the subject. The Leader Thursday week; it has really developed of the Australian Country party left ont into a long-range endurance test. When tbe salient facts of tbe Sandys case, the real test is put on him he quits which set it quite apart fro m the one easily. There has been nothing said on we are now considering. Actually, there the Opposition side of the House which is no relation between them at all. Tbe makes any stronger the contention that introduction of'the Sandys case gave the there has heen a breach of privilege. Opposition a great opportunity to go Most of these things which began romancing about tbe House of Commons, the scare were done well away from and to talk of the imperishable traditions the Parliament, and the photostats of that institution. Tbere are traditions are probably held in Sydney to-day. of decency and patriotism of the House of The originals, of course, could be held Commons which have descended to us, by the right honourable gentleman. This which I commend to honourable members is one of the things that come np every opposite. In conclusion, let me point out now and again; in principle it is as old as to tbe Leader of the Australian Country the three-card trick and it is regrettable party that a precedent was set bytbe late that a former Prime Minister, who in John Curtin, who, wben faced with a private life is a charming man, should similar situation, acted with great dignity have been caught in this way. I do not and propriety. He saw that the incident want to strengthen my case by offering did not get out of hand, as this one has any criticism of the personal virtues of done. Unfortunately, the Leader of tbe the right honourable gentleman, but I venAustralian Country party was carried ture to say that he is a very crass man away by the excitement of the moment. in this case. The point that is slipping He made the matter one for publicity away from view is that there are three rather than patriotism. If tbe security very simple questions to be answered, of the country were endangered, surely namely, whether a public servant was the rigbt bonorable gentleman did not suborned, whether a document was stolen, act in the best interests of this country and whether a document was forged. in bringing tbe matter before tbe House This debate has gone back a long way. in the way he did. A classic example was It has gone back to the days of K in g set by the late leader of tbe Labour party, Charles, to William and Mary. should bring it back to the realities of kind should be handled, and the record of to-day. Sitting suspended from6 to 8 p.m. of levity that I discuss this matter, even things ought to be done. The attempt to if, unfortunately, some provocation from associate the principle of privilege, as honourable members opposite may have it bas been gloriously exemplified in the given the impression that I was not takpractice of the House of Commons, with ing it seriously. The fact is otherwise. an incident wbich does not even touch After looking at the matter in the most sober manner, one must come to the conclusion that everything that needed to be said was said most trenchantly and adequately by the Prime Minister, who has the capacity for putting in the briefest and most forceful manner facts which tell against the arguments of the Opposition. A fte r he had spoken, all the fight seemed to go out of Opposition members. No question of privilege appears to be We Mr Curtin, as to how a matter of this how he handled it w ill be preserved in the archives of the Parliament as a guide to those who follow him. Ancient history does not help us, except that it It is in no sense may indicate the dignified way in which",44,Canberra Monday Ministe R For Defence
152,Mr Haylen,"the fringe of privilege, has failed most miserably. The two omcers of the Commonwealth investigation Service, who have been criticized by honourable members opposite, behaved attempted to do their job, and when the position was made untenable for them, when their attempts to investigate a security matter were turned into a kind of public inquiry, all they could do was to withdraw, which they did gracefully. I cannot see that anything which happened impinged upon the privileges of the Leader of the Australian Country party as a member of this Parliament. The newspapers, which are rarely on the side of the Labour movement, have referred to the incident in a representative way. If one may judge from the consensus of their opinions, they consider that the Leader of the Australian Country party has mulled the thing rather badly. This procedure started with great dramatic intensity, but it is finishing up practically without a curtain. As for the public, it will be concerned., not so much with tbe privileges of members of the Parliament, as with the security of the country, and with tlie statement that one of our war-time allies no longer trusts us in security matters. A charge of that kind is difficult to prove, but there is one matter which has to be proved. Tbese documents did not blow up and down the corridor waiting for any one to pick tbem up. Here we have a plot which ultimately came to fruition. Certain documents were handed to the Leader of the Australian Country party. In order to conclude the drama, we want to know wbo was the man who peddled the documents? He. is the real traitor. The other party to tbe incident was merely the cat's paw, but the real criminal lurks within tbe precincts of tbe House, or somewhere outside of it, where he is capable of continuing bis mischievous work against the security of the country. The Government must find out who he is. Eveni f he is a highly placed person, he should not be protected. The charges sbould be pressed home. There was much dour, sound common sense in the remarks of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman). When the issue is clarified and tbe culprit is discovered, we may depend upon it that the Government will act. genuine documents? Opposition has been trained to ask tbe same question, "" Were the documents genuine ? "" The real issue before us is, wbo was responsible for injuring the prestige of Australia? Is it a fact, as alleged, that one of our allies, with whom we played a not inconsiderable part in the war, no longer trusts us? Tbe position in regard to these documents must be cleared up, and we can get no assistance from the Opposition. Wouldi t not have been better for tbe Leader of the Australian .Country party to assist tbe Government, instead of trying to make a publicity holiday out of tbe incident? Anyway, he has failed miserably, and I think be is very sorry about it. Tbe nation has been let down wben a man of high distinction, holding a higb position, allows his flair for publicity to overcome his patriotic judgment. The important point to remember is that a man, who did a dishonourable thing affecting the security of this country, is at large. Honourable members opposite have mouthed cliches and talked much on the subject of parliamentary privilege, but tbe important thing is to find the traitor, and bring him to book. Opposition members are unhappy about this matter. Tbey do not present a united front. There is something unclean about the wboli! incident. They have defiled their hands with pitch, and they are now trying to wash tbem in the cold waters of privilege. 1.3.10] -The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) have already taken part in this debate, and I understand that I am to be followed by my friend and enemy, the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell).

The Government, although supported by an absolute majority, had so miich faith in Mr Attlee's"" goodwill and spirit of fair play that it appointed' him"" to the Committee of Privilege's, arid be presided over the hearings'in the famous Sandys case. Under"" the present' Labour Government in the United Kingdom, the' president of the Committee of Privileges is the Right Honourable Arthur Greenwood, a distinguished' member' of tbe Labour party. Ob the Committee of Privileges, the Incidentally; the"" House of Sight Honourable Winston Churchill has takett bis' seat.' About two years ago, a comTtnittee"" of privilege's, which was dominated by the Labour party, submitted a report which resulted in the expulsion from the House of a Labour member for having committed a breach of parliamentary privilege. Another member of the House of Commons lost his position as secretary of the Public Service Association .as the result of the finding of another committee of privileges. I raise those matters now in order to show the difference between the manner in which the Commonwealth Parliament and the United Kingdom Parliament privileges. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) referred in an interjection to a parliamentary inquiry into a matter in which I was involved. I was also a member of another committee wbich came to a sudden end. Certain disclosures were published in tbe Sydney Morning Herald and tbe Melbourne Herald about the proceedings of that committee. The Standing Orders clearly provide that no member of a select committee, and no person associated witb it, shall disclose any of its proceedings. Alhas been subjected to in tbe last few though that standing order was flagrantly v iolated on two occasions, tbe government of tbe day did not prosecute tbe Sydney Morning Herald or tbe Melbourne Herald. The Sydney Morning Herald published in full a secret document dealauthorizes a security check of the adminiing with certain customs matters. The information must have been supplied by some person who was serving on that select committee. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), who referred to the Sandys case, mentioned tbe position in wbich former Ministers of State in the United Kingdom find themselves after tbey cease to hold office. Every man who has held ministerial office must become, by the very nature of his duties, the repository of many importfor disclosure by civil servants and army ant secrets, particularly when war is threatening or is in progress. I bave had some experience. Earlier, I stated that a member should not be subject to any molestation, threat or intimidation. propose to refer to an incident in which I was involved. Certain honourable members in this House were involved in simistated that tbe shortage of steel helmets lar cases, but I sliall deal with my own because I have a thorough knowledge of the circumstances. AfterI had raised a ifr.

I saw him, but he said that he did not want to see me until the next day. When I saw him again on tbe 2'9tb February at 5 p.m., he told me that, under his personal authority, a complete search had been made of the Postmaster General's Department which I had administered, and that it had been discovered that I had done certain things. approach questions of They did not discover many of thethings that I had done, and tbey have not yet discovered tbem, but one matter on which they thought would "" rock "" me was raised. I was told that I sould'not proceed with my complaints about censorship because I bad left a record that,, on my personal instructions, a letter which' was registered and addressed to the bead-quarters of tbe Nazi party in Germany, under cover address, bad been opened and photographed. Was not that an example of intimidation? What the Leader of thc Australian Country party days is not new. It has happened before. The important question is whether it should happen at all. I sbould like to know on what authority any Minister, no matter bow senior be may be, stration of a Minister in an earlier government. Tlhat bas taken place. I could say a good deal more about that aspect if it were necessary, but I have said sufficient to show that tbose things do happen. Before Mr Churchill became Prime Minister, be spoke on the Sandys case, which arose in tbe House of Commons in 1938. He showed that had it not been and naval officers in World WarI . , certain operations would have gone badly for Great Britain. He stated that the shortage of shells was brought to a head I in 1915 only because somebody gave vital information not to a member of Parliament, but to the press. He also was overcome only when a visitor to the House of Commons, in order to impress upon members the seriousness of the position in France, jumped from the strangers' gallery on to the floor of the House and was badly injured. That incident led to the manufacture of steel helmets. .Certain junior naval officers, who -distrusted the Lords of the Admiralty, went behind the backs of their superiors to Ministers and members of Parliament, .and their proposals resulted in the introduction of the convoy system. Churchill said that he could not defend -a government misleading statements to comfort the -country and deceive the House. In the -same speech, he said that a few days earlier, he, and eleven other members of the House, of Commons, eacb one of whom was a Privy Councillor, had waited on the Prime Minister to discuss defence matters. The conversation had lasted for two days. Mr. Churchill recalled that, had the Official Secrets Act been invoked, he and tbe eleven Privy Councillors could have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating almost 800 years. In 1940, Mr Churchill became the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and during World War II . was tbe saviour of civilization. I defy contradiction when I say that he is the greatest parliamentarian that the British Parliament has ever produced. In the same debate to which I have reMinisterf o r Transport will agree. He ferred, Mr Churchill said that he sympahas availed himself of it more than once, thized with those public oflicials who had and twice in my hearing recently he has had placed upon them the strain of knowsaid that he would do it again.

While the term one of us has become the unwilling re"" proceedings in Parliament"" has never been cipient of information of that kind. I wish to deal one by one with the written questions that I propounded to the House everything said or done by a meinber in the a few moments ago. The first is whether exercise of his functions as a member in a the right honourable member for Darling committee of either House, as well as everyDowns was entitled to read the documents thing said or done in either House in the that be produced in this chamber. The answer to that question is to be found confined to words spoken or things done in the in the report of the Committee of P r i v i course of parliamentary proceedings, words leges of the House of Commons on the Sandys case. Incidentally, I correct the Prime Minister and point out that there were three separate reports made on that case. The report of the Committee of Privileges was lodged within a few hours. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) said it was lodged within Mr 48 hours, but I am not sure that it was not done sooner than that. Two separate which would make reports were made by a select committee that was appointed by tbe House of Commons and instructed to consider tbe Official Secrets Act as it affected members of that House. That committee was presided over by Sir John Gilmore, whose name will be known to one or two honourable members of this House who are familiar with the activities of the Imperial Parliament. The report of the Select Committee on the Official Secrets Acts, having referred to the Official Secrets Act of 1911, as amended by the act of 1920, states. . . a person who communicates information to a person other than a person to whom he is authorized to communicate it commits no offence provided the person to whom hedoes communicate it is one to whom it is in the interest of the State his duty to communicate it.

Question so resolved in the negative. for Informatio n and Ministerf or I m m i gration) [S.50] I listened to every word the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) uttered; I watched the manner of his delivery; and I could not but be impressed with the perturbation of mind that seems to be his and that of all honourable members of thc Opposition in regard to this most unfortunate situation which they have deliberately created for themselves. The Leader of the Australian Country party wandered down through the corridors of history. He paused for a brief moment at the vault of JamesI . of England. He passed on and again paused before the bier of the none James IL , the grandson of the first of that name and the last of the hapless, hopeless and helpless Stuart Kings of England and Scotland. He had a word with the departed spirits of William and Mary, and then proceeded to base his case upon the hoary precedents of those periods. Few honourable members opposite who have spoken in this debate have reached any period of history later than that of GeorgeI . I. believe that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) got nearest to modern times. The real principle of privilege does not go back to the periods mentioned by honourable gentlemen who like to take pride in their Jacobite ancestors or like to think of those spacious days long since past. The privilege of Parliament goes back only about 100 years to tbe time when those people wbo wanted to serve writs and court orders upon members of tbe British Parliament who were in debt, were restrained from entering the parliamentary buildings. The privilege extending to what honourable members may say inside tbe Parliament, wbicb goes back a long time, is not in question in this case. Nothing that has been said in this Parliament is in question in any way Chifley, J. B. whatever. Tbe real issue of privilege is Russell, E. H. D. not involved. Tbe motion of privilege James, R. submitted by tbe Leader of the Australian Scullin, J. H. Country Party appears to be an enSheehy, T. N. deavour to cover up, first, whether the Evatt, Dr. H. V. right honourable gentleman is guilty of receiving and using secret, stolen documents, and, secondly, whether be is using documents, not knowing whether they are authenic or not. He cannot bave it both ways. I noted what the right honourable gentleman said in tbe course of his remarks. In an unguarded moment he saidI t is the Government's responsibility toguard its secrets. That is the truth. The Government is anxious to guard its secrets, and that is wby it is essential for it to bave the cooperation of honourable members opposite in guarding the secrets that belong not only to the Government but also to the Parliament and to the people. It was the only true statement uttered on this subject by tbe Leader of tbe Australian too illustrious Country party. We bave beard a good deal about what honourable members opposite call tbe Sandys case. They cannot even pronounce correctly the name of the former member of tbe House of Commons. Tbe correct pronunciation is as though the name were spelt without the "" y "". Much of what has been said about the Sandys case has consisted of misrepresentation. In spite of what the honourable member for Richmond( Mr. Anthony) said in bis attempt to mislead tbe House into believing that it was the action of the British Attorney-Generali n interviewing Sandys that caused hi m to raise the question of privilege in the House of Commons, the t r u th is as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 9th October last. Either the honourable member for Richmond is right or the editor or tbe writer of tbe special article in the Sydney Morning Herald is right. Tbe article readsOn June 29, 1938, Mr Duncan Sandys, 30year-old son-in-law of Mr Winston Churchill and Conservative member for Norwood, rosein the House of Commons to make a dramatic claim of privilege. He astonished and electrified the House by announcing that he had received orders as a Territorial officer to appear in uniform before a military court of inquiry.",52,Clark
175,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rSandys's motion of privilege was based on the faet that while the case was before the British Honse of Commons he had 'been ordered by the military authorities to appear before tbem for disciplinary action. Warringah is also out of court with the leader writer of the Sydney Morning Herald read the case? I do not need the legal assistance of the Beale) either to read it or to understand it. The honourable meniber is known .among his colleagues as "" necessity"", because of the fact that, like necessity, he knows no law. The honourable member for Richmond quoted extensively from the paragraph proposed to be included in the report of the Privileges Committee by Mr M"".xton, :a former independent Labour meinber of the British House of Commons. He waxed eloquent .in his eulogy of Mr bers of the Opposition called him all Maxton's sentiments as though Mr sorts of names and demanded all sorts Maxton's views were the views of the committee; but in a manner alike dishonest and contemptuous of -the intelligence of this House, he failed to turn over the page and read the decision of the committee on Mr Maxton's paragraph. The committee rejected Mr Maxton's paragraph by nine votes to three. All his eulogy of Mr Maxton was entirely dishonest. We have heard a lot of the Sandys case: but we were not told of the epilogue of the Sandys drama. House of Commons spoke; the committee -of the House of Commons spoke; and -ultimately the people of England spoke --at a general election, and Sandys was relegated to the political scrap heap and iiiever came back into political life in England. Honourable members opposite have told us what the committee of the House of Commons did. I have pleasure in telling them that the people of England relegated Sandys to political obscurity as the people of Australia will releabout the matter. The honourable member gate to obsciwity most honourable members opposite who have used the Sandys case in this debate to bolster up an impossible position of tbeir own creation. . Mr this occasion he was consistent. He said Maxton bas been in heaven for some years now. Minister know that? members always have a better chance of going to heaven tban have members of the Liberal party. By some strange quixotic turn of fate, tbe bonorable member for Richmond sought to praise the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) dene so. Ministei' for Transport pleaded privilege in "" the Brisbane Line"" case some years ago and added, "" He was quite rigbt"". Fancy tbe honourable member for Richmond saying that the Minister for Transport was right in anything he did. It bas taken bim, and those wbo cheer him, five years to discover that the Minister for Transport was right. At the time the Minister for Transport was being attacked, memof action against bim. According to Hansard of the 24th June, 1943, to be precise, at page 319-tb e honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) saidWe want a royal commission to And out who gave the information to the Minister. Then the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), who is now in parts unknown, said that he wanted the Minister to divulge the name of his informant. The honourable meinber for Indi( Mr Tbe McEwen) demanded an inquiry into the identity of the Minister's informant, and used these significant words, "" He must, be discovered and dealt w it h "" . Tbe scene has changed. Honourable members opposite are protecting a contemptible individual wbo took either genuine documents or forgeries from a public office and gave them to a person not entitled to have them.

Tbe action of the Canadian Government, on tbe. basis, of tbe honourable member's subprivileges of the Parliament, by suspendmissions, was wrong.

He would bave been no more indifferent to tbe principle of tbe matter tban axe. bonorable members opposite.

Public opinion will not support that position. At least Sandys went along to the now? J Privilege. 1701 responsible British authorities and spoke to tbe British Prime Minister and the War Minister. Wben tbe late Mr John Curtin had certain secret information put into bis bands early in tbe war he took it to tbe right honourable member for Darling Downs, who was then the Prime Minister, before he did anything further. If the Leader of tbe Australian Country party,, who has raised this issue had gone to tbe present Prime Minister and talked the matter over with bim and told bim where the information was leaking from, be would bave been rendering a public service. Even then be would have been doing no more than his duty obliges him in his duty. There have been several episodes involving stolen documents before in tbe history of this Parliament. There was an occasion, wben Mr Joseph Alexander, of the MelbourneHerald, happened to be passing a certain room in this building one. nigbt and accidently, of course, and purely coinoidentally, too, walked into a. room and in a copy of Hansard, discovered secret cables wbich bad been passing between tbe Australian Prime Minister of tbe time, Mr Scullin, and members of tbe Ministry in Australia. The Melbourne Herald publisbed the documents, and this House of the Farliament expressed its displeasure at tbe action of the journalist in violating the ing, bim for the rest of the life-time of the Parliament. Mr Speaker( Mr Makin) took action in that regard. A paradoxical position arose because the anti-Labour parties controlled the Senate, wbicb. took no action against Alexander. He could gotbere and be entertained by senators, but tbe representatives of. displeasure in a very real way. Honourable members opposite bave forgotten that case.

In 1929, the Bruce Page Government was badly shaken wben a Cabinet document was stolen and published. At least I am talking of current history. The events to which I am referring bave occurred in tbe lifetime of this federation and some hundred of years later tban the time of CharlesI . and William and Mary. talking of ChifleyI . biblical times. the best of bis tribe. When the Cabinet agreed to vital changes being effected in the arbitration system, the tben Attorney General, Mr J. G. Latham, addressed a memorandum to Cabinet, in which he set out in detail, and with the logic for which he was always very famous, his reasons for objecting to the proposals to change the arbitration system. Honourable members will remember that it was about that time that the crisis occurred in connection with tbe alterations in our arbitration system that the Bruce-Page -Government was bringing down, and which the right bonorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) seized upon .as a fitting occasion to pay off a series of old scores. The Government fell and tbere was an election. History was made. The five-paged reasoned document prepared by the then Attorney-General, Mr paper in bis possession. A victim musi Latham, wbicb was stolen by some person still unknown, was published by tbe Canberra Times. That happening not only created a sensation, but it also caused a serious split in the Cabinet on a most important item of government policy. It will be conceded by every honourable member that a Cabinet document is a most privileged document-on e of the highest secrecy. The Government armed the Commonwealth police with search warrants, and various premises and private homes were searched in order to find the missing document. We bave not yet gone so far'as that in our attempt to find the culprit, the miscreant, the person who has been so false to bis trust as to -steal the document involved on this occasion-if it was a genuine documentalthough it is just as vital as was the Cabinet document. Tbe document quoted from by tbe right honourable member for Darling Downs was concerned with tbe defence of the country. genuine document? genuine or not, tbe right bonorable gentleman himself alone can say. He at least ought to prove that he wants to be rethe Minister is garded by this and succeeding generations as a true Australia, but he is not prepared to do anything about it. The other document of which I spoke was merely concerned with proposals for tbe alteration of the arbitration system. Among the private homes searched was that of a man named MacEarlane, an officer of the Prime Minister's Department, whose duties included the making of roneoed copies of documents for Cabinet meetings. The missing document was not found, but the police did find in MacFarlane's bouse a roneoed Cabinet document setting out cost of living figures for Canberra. Technically, the officer concerned had no right to be in possession of such a document, but he was personally interested in the subject, and had taken a copy home for his own information. He was studying it by tbe radiator wben the police called. The document had little political importanqe, and it was published a few days later. The real culprit was not discovered, but .MacFarlane bad a Cabinet be found; a bead must f a l l ; so MacFarlane was dismissed. Added to this crime was tbe additional one of having in his home a radiator which properly belonged to the Prime Minister's Department. That aggravated tbe offence! Unlike tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party, MacFarlane could not claim privilege, although be had not used the document to bis advantage, or publisbed it. The fact that be was a maimed returned soldier gave bim no special privilege. The fact that bis face was so grotesque from war wounds that he was known as ""Cyclops"" throughout the Public Service earned bim neither privilege nor pity.

The fact that he had been the close personal attendant of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when be was Prime Minister, and had given him loyal service, earned bim no privilege. Indeed, it probably counted against bim, because of the internecine warfare between tbe right honourable member for North Sydney and Mr Bruce and his associate, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). MacEarlane bad no parliamentary walls behind which to shelter, no parliamentary altar to which he could cling. He was kicked out of the Public Service witb ignominy and died soon afterwards in poverty and destitution. Tbat was how a government, representing the present Opposition parties, treated a man who had given long and faithful services, and wbo at most was guilty of a minor misdemeanour. In the past, they have been willing enough to sacrifice scapegoats, but when they themselves are found in possession of a secret document, they refuse their co-operation. On several occasions, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) bas urged tbe amendment of the Standing Orders to provide that any member of tbe Parliament who attacks a private citizen may be called upon to prove that his charges are based on fact. Now, when we ask members of the Opposition to state whether a certain document was stolen or forged, they run away from the issue. They abandon their protestations of other days, and reveal themselves as the close confederates and willing associates of those who, in their malevolence and their viciousness, abuse their trust, and expose tbeir eountry to additional perils and unnecessary dangers. Honourable members opposite demand that the Government clear out tbe Communists from the Public Service because, few though they be, they may give information, secret or otherwise, valuable or of no value, to a foreign power; but they would not have us interfere with any traitor or fifth columnist who supplies the Liberal party or the Australian Country party witb information of a highly secret nature, whether or not the disclosure of that information in the Parliament, and over the broadcasting system of tbe nation, might endanger the security of the country. personal explanation, because I bave been misrepresented by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell). He said that I bad misled the House, and misrepresented certain aspects of the Sandys case. In my reference to the Sandys case I was replying to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), who had said honourable member must keep close to the point. said that the Sandys case involved Sandys being called before a military tribunal, so that the incident was not analogous to the one now under consideration. Tbat, however, was only one aspect. The principal point was the interview wbicb tbe Attorney-General had with Sandys. think that the honourable member has reason for claiming to be misrepresented. He is merely arguing a point. He stated his opinion, aud the Minister was entitled to state his own. did not mislead tbe House. The Minister quoted a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, and said that, it contradicted me. I now quote from the official report of the committee of the House of Commons which considered the Sandys case. It statedWe have been appointed to inquire into the conduct of the Minister, and not into the conduct of Mr Sandys. I could quote further to prove my point, but that is sufficient. The concluding part of the report is as follows:The conduct of the Attorney-General is to be condemned as a gross violation of the proper and traditional relationship between members of Parliament and Ministers. I have shown that I did not mislead the House. I come now to another matter regarding which I bave been misrepresented. The bonorable member must resume bis seat.

I bave been given to understand that the terms of the motion will preclude me from making any reference to tbe document wbich has heen the subject of tbe debate just concluded, but I propose to explain the incidents wbich led up to this motion of dissent. On Thursday last, at 3.13 p.m., the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr gentleman made in this .chamber in tbe Fadden) rose in this House on a question of privilege. He stated that, just before the meeting of tbe House, two detectives, presumably at the direction of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), waited upon him in the precincts of the House, in fact in his own official office, and sought to interrogate him. arose out of matters mentioned by bim in the course of a debate in this House. Obviously, the detectives bad not acted on tbeir own initiative in approaching bim. Earlier, the Prime Minister, in answering the charges of tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party, made an open threat in this House that be proposed not the same to have oflieers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service maintain surveillance over members of tbe Opposition. He also mentioned tbe bonorable member for Eeid( Mr Lang), who bas not been given an opportunity to defend himself. It was in tbose circumstances that the officers waited on the Leader of the Australian Oountry party. We bave heard how they obtained admittance to bis office. We have beard that they were obviously acting under instructions from the Prime Minister and that, without question resolved in tbe disclosing tbeir identity, they sought, as ordinary citizens, to obtain an interview witb tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party. Tbey did not come forward and say that tbey were Commonwealth investigation oflieers and were seeking, as such, to interview bim. They sent in their names as ordinary individuals, but having obtained access to bis office,' tbey disclosed their identity. Tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party contended that that action was a grave abuse of parliamentary privilege, particularly as it was taken as tbe result of a direction by the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Australian Country party also regarded tbe Prime Minister's direction to tbe Commonwealth Investigation Service as a distinct act of intimidation. Freedom of speech is a priceless privilege. In the earlier debate to-day, 'Government speakers declared that parliamentary privilege was not in question. Tbe fact -cannot be disputed that tbe investigation officers visited the office of the Leader of the Australian -Country party, following a statement wbicb the right honourable best traditions of British parliamentary procedure, and in tbe exercise of bis undoubted rigbt of freedom of speech.

The threat is levelled, not only at honourable members, A blow is being struck at The privileges which represent some of the finest achievements of democracy. The representatives of What are parliamentary privileges, of speech is a privilege essential every free council or legislature. Its principle was well stated by the Commons, at a conference on the l l t h December, 1(507. Those words should impress honourable members, because they are the basis of freedom of speech. I regret that some honourable members have treated this subject witb a spirit of levity, and bave made derogatory observations. The parThis matter clearly have their origin in constitutional dequotation from May's Parliamentary Practice as follows:-No man tan doubt they said, "" but whatever is once enacted is lawful: but nothing can come into an Act of Parliament, but it must be first affirmed or propounded by somebody: so that if the Act can wrong nobody, no more can the first propounding. The members must be as free as the houses; an Act of Parliament cannot disturb the state; therefore the debate that tends to it cannot; for it must be propounded and debated before it can be enacted."" That cherished privilege must not be destroyed. I sliall now read another paragraph from May, which deals with freedom of speechIn 1021, the Commons, in their protestation, tice ' indicates tbe nature of those defined their privilege more consistently with ite present limits. They affirmed "" that every member hath freedom from all impeachment, imprisonment, or molestation, other than by censure of the House itself No tribunal or person outside of the House has the right to molest, question or challenge any statement which an honourable member has made in the chamber. However, the House itself may deal with him. In the present case, the House has not made any attempt to take action against the Leader of the Australian Country party. Evidently, the House is not prepared to consider the question of privilege, because it knows that any decision which it makes would be completely binding in future. The quotation continuesfor or concerning any bill, speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any matter nr matters touching the Parliament or Parliament business."" That was resolved in the B ill of Rights, the ninth article of which readsFreedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside of Parliament. Clearly, the B ill of Rights has established than an honourable member may not be molested or impeached by any outside tribunal for any occurrence in the House. Honourable members know f u l l well that the Leader of the Australian Country party was subjected to molestation wben he was approached by members of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and that, consequently, bis privileges as a member of the Parliament were gravely interfered with. The general public may regard those privileges as being purely the established Mr Harrison. privileges of the House of Commons. It m a j be asked what they have to do with Australia. Section 49 of the Constitution reads as follows:The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of tlie House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of> the United Kingdom and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. By that section of the Constitution we have taken to ourselves tbe privileges of the House of Commons. The following passage from May's Parliamentary Pracprivileges:,. At the commencement of every Parliament since the Oth Henry VIII., it has been the custom for the Speaker, "" In the name, and on behalf of the Commons, to lay claim by humble petition to their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges; particularly that their persons and servants might be free from arrests and all molestations; that they may enjoy liberty of speech in all their debates; may have access to her Majesty's royal person whenever occasion shall require; and that all their proceedings may receive from her Majesty the most favorable construction."" To which the lord chancellor replies that "" Her Majesty most readily confirms all the rights and privileges which have ever been granted to or conferred upon the Commpns, by her Majesty or any of her royal predecessors."" By section 49 of the Constitution, we have claimed all the rigbts and privileges for which the Mother of Parliaments fought and wbich are claimed at the commencement of every parliament. The Chair ruled that a prima facie case had not been made out in respect of the proposed motion of privilege submitted by the Leader of tbe Australian Country party which would j u s t if y the matter taking precedence over other business. I bave drawn attention to tbe fact that if an honourable member is molested because of an utterance be has made in this chamber, that is a distinct breach of privilege. I do not think it can be denied that, following tbe threat that was made by the Prime Minister, such molestation did take place and that it arose out of an incident that occurred in this chamber. Standing Order 111 providesAn urgent Motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of otlier Motions, as well as of Orders of the Day. Standing Order 2S3 readsAny Member may rise to speak "" to order "", or upoji a matter of Privilege suddenly arising. I have establislied that the interrogation of the Leader of the Australian Country party was a .breach of privilege. It took place only ten minutes before the House assembled and was, therefore, a matter of privilege suddenly arising. The Chair ruled that no claim of breach of privilege could be sustained and that a prima facie case had not been made out. It ruled that the proposed motion of the Leader of the Australian Country party could not be treated as a matter of privilege suddenly arising. Parliamentary privilege is something that should be the right of all honourable members of this House. By the rotation of the wheel, within the next twelve months, honourable gentlemen opposite may be occupying seats on this side of the chamber. It may well be that in those circumstances, wben tbey bave no benevolent government to look after tbeir interests, they may desire to take advantage of a parliamentary right or privilege. That being so, it behoves every honourable member, if be wishes to maintain the strength of parliamentary institutions, to ensure that the Executive does not deprive private members of the cherished privileges that tbey now enjoy. We know that from time to time the Executive exercises undue authority and exerts pressure upon honourable members of this House. It seeks to take to itself powers that do not rightly belong to it. If we have not the backbone to protect the rights of individual members of this House, the Executive may become supreme authority. If it does, our democratic institutions may well perish. If members of tbe Parliament are not free to speak their minds in this chamber, the representation of tbe people will be limited. How can we expect tbe people that we represent to approach us upon matters of national importance if tliey are afraid that the political police will be turned loose upon tbem and that tbey will be interrogated with regard to their conversations with us? Tbe interrogation of the Leader of tbe Australian Country party may well be tbe first step in a course of action that will lead to tbe destruction of our parliamentary institutions. We bave seen bow tbe supreme instrument of democracy bas been destroyed in otber countries. I appeal to honourable members opposite to protect their individual interests. Tf tbey do not, it may be that very shortly they will be subjected to some form of interrogation or intimidation if they express tbe opinions of some of their constituents. We must be jealous of our privileges and protect tbem at all costs. By so doing, we shall not only be protecting the interests of the people but also safeguarding our parliamentary institutions. Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) concluded his speech by saying, in effect, that this may be one of the last occasions wben we can defend tbe rights and privileges of this assembly. In the course of his speech he was at pains to point out that the rights and privileges of members of the Parliament were being undermined and destroyed. Notwithstanding that, almost the first words of the honourable gentleman wereThis motion which stands on the notice paper in my name, must be discharged. Judging from the hesitation with wbich the honourable gentleman approached his task and the words in which be expressed his thoughts, he regarded it as a distasteful duty that had been forced upon him because at one stage be had placed this motion on tbe notice-paper. man is misrepresenting me. and exercise tyrannical at the beginning of bis speecb, the honourable gentleman used tbese wordsThis motion which stands on the notice paper in my name, must be discharged.

Mr Deputy Speaker ruled that the motion that was submitted by the Leader of tbe Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) did not relate to a matter of privilege suddenly arising and was not entitled to take precedence over other motions or orders of tbe day. In so doing, be exercised the prerogative of the occupant of the Speaker's chair. This point is referred to in May's Parliamentary Practicei n these termsClaim of Privilege Over-ruled from the Chair -As precedence is naturally desired by members, care has been taken, by rulings from the chair, not to extend that claim to any miltion which does not strictly relate to an urgent matter of privilege, properly so called; an admission by tbe right honourable ami many motions, more or less aifecting privilege, have been brought on in their turn, with otlier notices of motions. Mr Deputy Speaker was only acting in the same way as other occupants of the Speaker's chair have acted throughout the years, and following a line of procedure that is laid down in a book to which the Acting Leader of the Opposition referred as the bible for the guidance of members of this assembly. Is this a matter of privilege suddenly arising? We know that it arose following statements made in this House that some documents were held by tbe right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden). Omcers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service subsequently visited tbe right honourable gentleman and presumably sought to question him about tlie documents and how they came into liis possession. There is nothing in May's Parliamentary Practice which says that a member is immune fro m interrogation, from the asking of questions or from the necessity to provide information upon some matter. Eveni f honourable members are protected in respect of statements that are made in tbe Parliament, the right honourable member for Darling Downs has delivered himself into tbe hands of those who sought to question hira and divested himself of the privileges of this chamber. In its issue of the 6th October, under the heading ""Needf o r DefenceI n for m a t i o n "" , the West Australian slatesThe Leader of the Country party ( Mr honourable gentleman, wbo can say that padden) to-night issued a statement on the Mr livrkc. Objection to Deputy [REPRESENTATIVES. ] Speaker's Ruling. documents produced by him in the House of llepresentatives during last week's debate on the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. . . . Mr Fadden said that he was not so foolish as tn underrate Australia's potential enemies. If a document could come half-way round the world to his hands unasked, it was obvious that many other people besides himself must have been aware of the contents. "" Only one very small portion of the document wus disclosed by me, in the form of a question to the Prime Minister, provoked by the thrice-repeated mis-statements of the Minister for Defence,"" Mr Fadden went on. "" IfI had wished to use this material solely for party political purposes, it could have been kept for disclosure on the eve of the next election."" There we see clearly stated in the press meniber for Darling Downs that he had the document in his possession. We have, clearly established two reasons why officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service should question the right lionorable gentleman, not because of something he had said in the Parliament, or because he had contravened his right to speak freely in the Parliament, but because he frankly admitted that he had in his possession a secret document that purported to contain secret information from the highest body in Great Britain, the British Cabinet. He may well have been questioned by the investigation officers in order to ensure that steps might be taken to prevent future leakages. He may bave been questioned by them in order to ascertain the source from which the document was obtained. The right honourable gentleman said that if the document could come half way round the world to his hands unasked, it was obvious that many otber people besides himself must bave been aware of the contents. Wasi t not his bounden duty to disclose the source of bis information to the investigation omcers in order that such leakages might be stopped? Furthermore, is not his position made more grave by reason of the fact that this document purported to record the discussions of a meeting of the British Inner-Cabinet where secrets of the utmost importance relating to the disposition of troops, military strategy, and the like are discussed ? If a document of that kind can f a l l into the hands of the right it will not also fall into the hands of the potential enemies of this country and of the British Commonwealth of Nations? It is the duty of all honourable members to disclose not only the details of secret information which may be passed on to them but also the source from wbicb the information came so that the necessary security measures may be taken to prevent future leakages. honourable gentleman has stated that this document from which he quoted was indeed a genuine document. document ? whether it is genuine or not. If it is a forgery, tbe right honourable gentleman is equally culpable. The possibility of tbe disclosure of portion of this document, particularly in tbose countries situated just off the rim of Europe must have caused some perturbation in the minds of those who are charged with responsibility for guarding tbe defence secrets of this country and of the British Empire generally. They do not know whether the document is genuine or whether it is a forgery. I certainly do not know whether it is genuine and as far as I am aware, the members of this Government do not know whether it is genuine or a forgery. We must assume that the Prime Minister of Great Britain and members of the British Cabinet do not know whether OT not the document is genuine, and that they are not aware whether it contains only information relating to Australian security measures and tbe preservation of the defence secrets in this country. For all they know it may contain otber matters of far-reaching importance, tbe disclosure of which might imperil the defences of Great Britain and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Tbe rigbt honourable member indicated in his statement to the press that only one very small portion of the document was disclosed by him in the form of a question to the Prime Minister, and we do not know what other information it contains. channels through wbich this document reached tbe right honourable gentleman there has been no infringement of the rights of members of this Parliament. The Leader of the Australian Country party has held the very highest ministerial office in the Australian Parliament and at present occupies a highly responsible position as the leader of a political party. Surely he cannot claim that he was not in duty bound to indicate The rigbt the source from which the document was obtained so that prompt action could be taken to deal, with people responsible for passing it on to him before they have an opportunity to cover up their tracks. As he failed to do so the investigation officers sought to ascertain from the rigbt honourable gentleman precisely what the document was and whence it came. It is possible that tbeir action was based on a discussion in this Parliament. It is also feasible, however, that they acted on the statement made by the rigbt honourable gentleman to tbe press. The right honourable gentleman made his statement to the press on the 5th October and he was visited by the investigation officers on the 7th October. Having regard to the unsettled state of the world to-day, I would look with great disfavour on any investigation service which, having learned that a secret document was in the possession of some unauthorized person, failed to endeavour to ascertain the source from which it came. Investigation officers would be recreant to the trust reposed in them if they failed to seek information about the document from the Leader of the Australian Country party, by personal interview, by letter, or by some other means. They might well have said to tbe right honourable gentleman, "" This document may be of great security value. It may indicate that there are traitors in our midst. Tbe highest plans and the most secret discussions of the British Cabinet may be made available to our potential enemies through the disclosure of the contents of this document and others from the Fame source."" The investigation officers were bound to investigate the statements made to the press by the right honourable gentleman. It has been said In seeking to uncover tbe that they did not visit the right honourable gentleman by voluntary arrangement. When visitors from any part",62,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling

214,Mr Btjbke,"We do not knowof Australia wish to interview a member of the Parliament it is customary for the member to ask their names and the business which they wish to discuss. Tf the right honourable gentleman wanted to know what the investigation officers wanted, he could have instructed his secretary to ascertain their names and the nature of their business. One would have thought that, having regard to the high and important office held hy the right honourable member, he would have said lo his secretary, ""Ask these men wliat their business isor least, "" Where do these men come from? "" Jt is evident that be was not concerned enough about tbem to inquire into the nature of tlieir business. admitted tbem to bis room, he did not have to give information. He could bave said to them, ""I am sorry; I have no information to give you. The interview is ended."" Instead, as soon as he had jiscertauied the nature of their business, he summoned tbe press to be present at the interview. That action appears to be just another publicity stunt on tbe part of the right honourable gentleman. T f , as the result of the disclosures of the right honourable gentleman, our investigation service is brought to a higher pitch of efficiency, some good may flow from this incident, but that will be possible only if the right honourable gentleman discloses the source of his information. If honourable members are permitted to refuse to be interrogated in relation to the nature and source of information wbich may come into their possession, claiming parliamentary privilege, the investigation service will be greatly handicapped. There is nothing in May's Parliamentary Practice to indicate that members of the Parliament may claim privilege against interrogation. Tf such privilege did exist, it could not be sustained on matters of vital security. permitted to claim privilege in respect of such information, and successfully do so, tbey may well jeopardize the lives of the people, not only of this country, but also of the Empire as a wliole. In any clash between, their rights and the safety and security of Australia, only one course is open to them. May also says that while the Speaker has a Mr Burke. right to refuse the right of privilege if it is specified that it is not desired.Neither House of Parliament have power, by :my vote or declaration, to create for themselves new privileges, not warranted by the known laws and customs of Parliament. That is tbe view expressed by May. The matter boils down to a very simple issue. The rigbt honourable gentleman said that he had in bis possession a communication which indicated a most serious leakage of the United Kingdom records of the Cabinet, the members of which at the very are charged with as great a responsibility as any previous Cabinet members in the history of the United Kingdom. The statement he alleges he possesses could Having be banded to the security service in Australia for transmission to the British Cabinet, and thus provide them with a lead as to how tbe leak may be discovered. They could then take more effective steps than otherwise might be taken to prevent further information becoming available to ipeople throughout the world who are potential enemies of thc British Empire. That is. if the document is genuine. If it is only a forgery, and the fact is not revealed, the United Kingdom Cabinet Ministers who arc carrying overwhelming responsibility are left in the position of believing that it might be genuine, because a highly responsible member of the Australian Parliament has used it. Unless the matter is revealed tbere must remain a suspicion on the most highly placed officers of the British Parliament, and probably confined to the inner circle of Cabinet Ministers and a few trusted servants. It is of the utmost importance that the Commonwealth Investigation Service should receive from the right honourable gentleman information' about this document, not that he may be persecuted further, for all of us bave kindly feelings towards liim but that we may be assured If honourable members are that he has not, as be said himself, been led into a trap on this matter. Neither tbe security service nor tbe Government seek this document or information about it to persecute him. We do not intend to harm him in any way, either personally or politically.

It would be a poor recognition of the suffering of our ancestors, ancl of their service not only to us but to all mankind, if we were not to acknowledge readily our responsibility to protect this right that we have inherited, which we hold temporarily, and which we have the responsibility of passing on to future generations. If we lose that right, democracy will be lost. If an opposition in a parliament can be intimidatedI do not think it is apropos of this resolution to argue even the issue of intimidation-democrac y has gone. Surely, those who occupy the treasury bench now recognize that. This freedom to criticize on behalf of the minority is, I repeat, the one thing that distinguishes us from a dictatorship. The rights of honourable members are set down clearly. I do not propose to quote at length, but I direct attention to the following words from the Bill of Rights:The freedom of speech and debate or proceedings iu Parliament, ought not to be im|H!:ichud or questioned in any court or place outside the Parliament. That single sentence is the very essence of our democracy. Now, it is for the Parliament itself, from time to time, to decide whether there has been a breach of privilege. The Standing Orders provide, in most explicit terms, that there shall he opportunities for lionorable members to raise the question of privilege. Standing Order 111 providesAn urgent motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of other Motions, as well as Orders of the Day. That is a clear recognition of the importance of the issue of privilege, and indicates that motions of privilege shall take precedence over other motions, including motions appe'aring on the notice-paper at the instigation of the Government. Questions of privilege shall also take precedence over orders of the day. the utmost importance of this matter. The next standing order to which 1"" shall refer is Standing Order 2S0. which specifies the circumstances in which an lionorable member may interrupt another honourable member's speech. There are only three such circumstances Afr. UoEtoen. and one is "" to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising"". Then, according to Standing Order 283Any member may rise to speak "" to order "", or upon a matter of Privilege suddenly arising. Again, emphasis is laid on the importance and urgency of this issue. Thc fourth standing order touching upon the subject is Standing Order 2S4, which provides thatAll questions of order and matters of Privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every othor Question. i\ o words in the English language could r be more calculated to emphasize the importance of this issue. It is true thai an honourable member may rise and claim that there is an issue of privilege when, to all reasonable men, it is apparent that no such issue is involved. In such circumstances, by common consent, as well as by precedent, Mr Speaker is accepted as the judge, not of whether there is a question of privilege, but of whether there is a prima facie case for a question of privilege. Let us reduce the matter to utter simplicity. If a member carne into this chaniber and said, "" I rise to a question of privilege. My overcoat has been stolen from my room"", obviously, Mr Speaker would not permit the proceedings of the Parliament to be interrupted for a debate on a matter of that kind, and he a wpuld rule, quite properly, that no question of privilege had arisen, and that would dispose of the mutter. On the otlier hand, if an honourable meniber came into the House and said, "" I rise to a question of privilege. In tbe King's HallI was intercepted by a gentleman who threatened me if I took a certain course of action in respect of certain legislation "", I should say immediately that there was a prima facie case that a question of privilege suddenly hacl arisen. It woulcl then remain for the honourable member to establish the facts on which the House would be the judge. Surely that emphasizes There is no provision in the Standing Orders for Mr Speaker to say, "" I have decided that there is no urgent matter of privilege. Put a motion on the notice paper and we sliall debate it at a later date "". I challenge any lionorable member to point to anything in the Standing Orders that would enable Mr Speaker to make sucb a decision. saying that there is no precedent. our Standing Orders, which guide the conduct of this chamber. I submit that Air. Deputy Speaker was not entitled to rule that there was no question of privilege warranting an immediate discussion, but that there was an issue of privilege warranting discussion at a later date. In most explicit terms the Standing Orders deny the right to give such a ruling. In my opinion, Mr Deputy Speaker should only have said, "" There is uo prima facie case for a question of privilege"" and that would have been the end of it. He should have ruled that, a prima facie case having been established, the. issue should be resolved forthwith, in the terms of the Standing Orders. Therefore, I claim that the ruling was bad in that it cannot be substantiated by any standing order. Having made that point, I turn now to the essence of the motion that we are discussing. The motion invites dissent from the ruling that no prima facie case was established. The words of the Leader of tbe Australian Country party must be considered in the light of the fact that he is an experienced and responsible parliamentarian. He is not M newcomer to this Parliament. He is a former Prime Minister, the leader of a party, and a member of His Majesty's Privy Council. He is not tbe kind of person who would be likely to get up and make an unwarranted statement incapable of substantiation. Therefore, I submit that what was declared to be a fact by a gentleman of such antecedents and status ought to be accepted by Mr that certainly brings the matter within Deputy Speaker as having been established, prima facie. His statement should warrant, examination forthwith by the House in order to discover whether it could he substantiated. It is within the knowledge of Mr Deputy Speaker, as of every other honourable member, that a few days before, the Priine Minister, speaking as Prime Minister in this House, had said T have not. his exact words, bnt this is the effect of them-that it would be necessary to keep under observation or surveillance some members of the Opposition parties, particularly members of the Australian Country party. Tbat, I think, may fairly be described as a threat. It was certainly an intimation that he intended to act in a certain way. MrM c EWEK I do not want to quibble over words, but that statement was certainly made. Tbe Leader of the Australian Country party spoke with a knowledge of the ancient declaration of privilege which, I trust, all honourable members will not hold in contempt merely"" hpm>nse it is ancient. It is as follows:That the freedom of speech and debates of proceedings in Parliament should not he impeached in any court, or place, out of Parliament. This is what the Leader of tbe Australian Country party saidJust before the House met this afternoon, I was seen in my official room by two detective inspectors of the Gommonwealth Investigation Service, whose names are, respectively. Wilks and McDermott, about matters which had been mentioned b}' me in the course of public debate in this Parliament. ThatI should have been interviewed by them in the precincts of the Parliament was itself a gross abuse of privilege. ThatI should have been interviewed by tliem at the direction of the Prime Minisquite clear from the speeches of the right honourable gentleman in this House that they were acting under his instructions, or under the instructions of his Government-make s the offence a graver one. But the supreme gravity of the incident lies iii the fact that by this method it is sought to intimidate, not only myself, but also all other menruers of the Opposition, and to stifle criticism by honourable members in the discharge of their public duties. That is a straight-forward declaration in simple, unequivocal language that a member of this Parliament had been interviewed by two detectives about something which he had said in this House, and the scope of tbe declaration in the Bill of Rights upon which the privileges of the members of this Parliament still rest. It is not an issue at the moment whether the right honourable gentleman could substantiate what he said. Since he declared that be had been accosted by two detectives, who questioned him about something be had said in the House, I submit that it was utterly improper ancl indefensible for Mr Deputy Speaker to rule that no prima facie case had been made out.

221,Ter Of This Country ( Mr Chifley),"becaus e it iscontempt and hatred of those who come after us and find that there no longer exists freedom in the country. I am not now attacking the Labour party 'as such. I am directing my attention to what I conceive to be, perhaps, the prime responsibility of all members of the Parliament, which is to sustain our democracy. We may differ about matters of policy, or the conduct of administration. .Such differences may be important, but they recede into insignificance if the rights and privileges of members of Parliament are successfully and such action as is here complained of becomes a regular practice, because the very opportunity to differ in such a way would cease to exist. Our democracy is uot static; it is evolving and its form from time to time is determined by precedent. If to-night the House, dividing on party lines, decides that' Mr Deputy Speaker was justified in saying that no prima facie case of privilege had been made out, although the Leader of tbe Australian Country party, a Privy Councillor and former Prime Minister, bad just declared from his place in the House that he had been accosted outside the chamber, and questioned about something wbich he had said in tbe House, then tbe very foundations of our democracy are threatened. We shall have sold the birth right handed down to us. Members of the Government and tbeir supporters bear a grave responsibility in this matter. It is human for human beings to differ, and for responsible men in public life to differ vigorously. History is packed with incidents which have shown that wherever the opportunity to express differences of opinion is suppressed, violence supervenes. If by suppressing .the opportunity to criticize, violence is provoked, there is only one known way of keeping that violence within control, and that is by the establishment of a police state or the use of armed forces, and I predict that if by decisions of this nature the Government establishes a practice and a precedent of the kind we fear, it will have done a dangerous thing. at this point where tbe Opposition has been gagged and a debate has been curtailed. A responsible former Prime Minister has claimed that he was accosted, but the Government has stated that the ilr. ilcEwen. matter does not even warrant a debate. It is a terrible responsibility to risk establishing a precedent by taking such a stand. I claim, and it is no exaggeration on my part, that the Government's action is identical with-tbe initial stages of tbe elimination of the democratic form of government in otber countries and tbe ultimate and certain replacement of that form of government by not merely one-party government but by oneparty government achieved by the aid of force, sustained by tbe aid of the police attacked, and accompanied by concentration camps. I ask tbe Government not to put on record a decision in this House which will enable the claim to be made on future occasions that this House has resolved that all these issues of privilege for which our forefathers fought and which our Standing Orders declare should be immediately resolved sball not be so resolved. Leti t not become an historical fact that a claim by a right honourable member that be was intimidated has been brushed to one side. I say that liberty to criticize, constantly exercised, is the badge of democracy. That liberty can be suppressed by an Executive using intimidation. Our claim is that Mr Deputy Speaker had no right either by precedent or by law, or under tbe Standing Orders, to deny the right of tbe Parliament to deliberate immediately on this issue. I trust that the Government will not resolve, by force of numbers, that .that ruling is correct, and so establish a precedent and a pattern for the future. -iTh e honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) began by. deploring tbe fact that the previous speaker had not discussed the motion before tbe House. He himself departed from the subject under discussion by giving the House entirely erroneous historical evidence on why CharlesI . was beheaded. He said it was because that king had breached the privileges of Parliament. The gentleman who ordered his execution abolished Parliament after invading it witb armed force, Such a practice could start so I think it rather unlikely that CharlesI . was beheaded for the reason given by the honourable member. member for Fremantle attribute those remarks to me?",68,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling
222,Mr Beazley (Eremantle) [10.50].,,69,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling
223,Mr Hakbison,"Does the honorablethem to me. I claim tbe error. Acting Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Harrison) is so egocentric that be imagines that all remarks are directed to him. It is tbe duty of Mr Speaker to determine whether a prima facie case has been made out for a breach of privilege. Here is what May has to say on this subjectUnder usage when a complaint of breach of privilege is raised he has to decide wliether a prima facie case has been made out which would justify such proceedings taking precedence over the other business of the House. It is not contested that it is the duty of Mr Speaker to determine whether a breach of privilege bas occurred. The Acting Leader of the Opposition, wbo is the only begetter of this motion, had one complaint to make. He did not base bis claim that a breach of privilege bad occurred on the ground that the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) had been haled before a court, but, to use his own words, on the ground that he had been molested, and that that molestation was a breach of privilege. It was therefore the duty of Mr Deputy Speaker to determine whether the Leader of the Australian Country party bad been molested or not. But tbe motion of tbe Acting Leader of the Opposition does not only raise the question whether Mr Deputy Speaker was correct in saying that no prima facie case had been made out for a breach of privilege, but it also inises the question whether the .business raised by tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party should immediately have been proceeded with. His motion readsThat the ruling of the Deputy Speaker-that no claim of broach of privilege could be sustained and that a prima facie case had not been made out in respect of the proposed motion of privilege submitted by the right honourable the Leader of tlie Country party which would justify the matter taking precedence over other business-be disagreed with. The question now is whether a prima facie case was made out and whether tbe business should have immediately been proceeded with. on the question of the establishment of ;i prima facie cape. May states quite clearly that that determination is to be made by Mr Speaker. On the question' of whether it is ever justifiable to proceed he attributes with other business when a claim for precedence has been made, May statesAs precedence is naturally desired by MemI am sorry that tbe bers, care has been taken, by rulings from the chair, not to extend that claim to any motion which does not strictly relate to an urgent matter of privilege properly so called (a) ; and many motions, more or less affecting privilege, have been brought on in their turn, with other notices of motion. The honourable member for In d i said that there was no precedent for proceeding, witb other business in sucb circumstances. I sball quote some interesting precedents. On tbe 27th October, 1933, tbe present Ministerf or Transport ( Mr. Ward) , who was then in opposition, raised a question of privilege which was not proceeded witb until the 16th November. On tbe 12th December, 1927, an honourable member named McGrath raised a motion witb wbich he was not permitted to proceed. On the 28th November, 1934, the bonorable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron), who bas bad many adventures in this matter, was prevented by Mr Speakerf r o m proceeding with a motion which, be claimed, was a motion of privilege. Quite clearly, we are not debating whether Mr Deputy Speaker has, or has not, the power to determine a motion of privilege. He bas that power. What we are debating is this particular exercise of bis power and whether a good prima facie case had been made out by the Leader of the Australian Country party. In order to sustain that a good prima facie case had been made out, the honourable member for In d i stated that the Leader of the Australian Country party, as a P r i v y Councillor, a former Prime Minister and a member of this Parliament for many years sbould bave his words accepted prima facie because of his experience and dignity. That argument presumes that there are grades of members of Parliament. It is the very argument wbicb tbe bonorable member for Barker attacked when he said that, in this House, Ministers are merely members of the Parliament. There are no grades of members of tbe Parliament, and Mr Speaker is not bound to say, "" TbisI have quoted May is a prima facie question of privilege because an old and dignified member of the House has raised it "" . That argument cannot be sustained. SoI come back to the only "" begetter of the motion the x\cting Leader of thp",69,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling

225,Mr Beazley,"Opposition, who has claimed that the Leader of the Australian Country party has been molested. The Oxford English Dictionary follows:tn interfere or meddle with a person injuriously or with hostile intent; to harass, to trouble, to eause trouble, grief, or vexation. If the Leader of the Australian Country party has been molested, he has been handled injuriously and with hostile intent. I do not consider that, because a detective asked the right honourable gentleman where he had obtained a document, it can be said that the right honourable gentleman was handled injuriously, or with hostile intent, or was harassed, troubled or caused grief or vexation. It is true that the Leader of the Australian Country party gave a fair performance of a person suffering from grief or vexation subsequently, but when he raised tbe matter in tbe House, be stated that be had been questioned hy detectives and that that constituted a breach of privilege. The honourable member for Indi said that the right honourable gentleman had been accosted by detectives about a statement which he had made in the House. l'.f the honourable member will read the speecli by the Leader of tbe Australian Country party, he will see that tbe detectives questioned the right honourable gentleman, not about-what he had said in thc House, but about the possession of documents. The right bonorable gentleman had made a statement in the House about the possession of documents. Before the detectives questioned him, he made several statements to the press outside the House about the possession of documents. Is it contended that if a citizen informs newspapermen that be possesses confidential documents which originally belonged to the British Cabinet, the detectives have not the right to question him ? ""Will any member of the Opposition say that the only time that the Leader of the Australian Country party referred to the documents was the occasion when he spoke in the chamber? Wil] the Leader of the Australian Country party inform us that the detectives said to bim, "" We want to raise the question of documents to which you referred in the chamber""? his speech in the chamber, the Leader of Hr. Beazley. the Australian Country party claimed the possession of those documents in several interviews witb tbe press. Condefines "" molest"" as sequently, nothing in his statement constituted a claim that he bad been intimidated, accosted or molested in respect of any statement wbicb be had made in the Parliament. He was questioned about the possession of documents, which, he had claimed publicly, were in his possession. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker correctly ruled that the rigbt bonorable gentleman had not made out a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. Subsequently, the Leader of the Australian Country party used tbe Standing Orders to moveThati t is a breach of privilege that the right honourable the Leader of the Country party should be interrogated or sought to be interrogated by security police at the instigation of the Prime Minister and the Government in the precincts of Parliament and in his official room in respect of matters occurring iu and arising out of the discharge of his puhlic duties iu this National Parliament. I direct attention to the words "" matters occurring in and arising out of the discharge of his public duties in the National Parliament"". If the right honourable gentleman makes a speech in this House and then rushes around the country giving press interviews and defying people to interview him at his bome, in Canberra, or in Sydney, does he claim that every statement wbich be makes outside the House is privileged because he made the original statement in the House? He does express that view in the motion, but no argument that be or any other honourable member opposite bas advanced establishes the claim. Tbe detectives asked the rigbt honourable gentleman to give them certain information. The right honourable gentleman then put on an interesting performance. First, be summoned the press. He gave to the press, and not to the House, an account of bis conversation with the investigation officers. He said to them, "" The public are interested in this "". 1 do not know on what basis the rigbt honourable gentleman made that claim. I do not suppose that be had had time to conduct a gallup poll in order to gauge nublic opinion, or that tbere has since been much interest in the subject. According to the interview, his secretary, and also declared, as a faithful echo of",70,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling
226,"Following Mr Mccaffrey, Then Came Into The Room","his master's voice, "" The public will be interested in this"". Throughout tbe interview, there was a concentration upon the idea that the public would be interested in the matter. Then a legion of pressmen was invited in the hope that they would also be interested. The Leader of tbe Australian Country partu was asked whether he would say where he had obtained tbe document. He declined to give tbe information to the detectives, and they withdrew. That action cannot be, by any wrenching of words, brought under the definition ""molesting"". him ber should bear in mind what the Prime Minister had stated previously about, keeping members of tbe Australian Country party under supervision. That is apropos the interview. the honourable member for Indi, that matter may bc apropos the interview, but I do not accept his words as a fair interpretation of the Prime Minister's statement. I meant to refer to that matter, aud I am glad that the honourable member has reminded me of it. The withdrawal of the detectives after the Leader of the Australian Country party had refused to disclose the source of bis information clearly established that there Tbe right honourable gentleman made a was not a breach of privilege. He was not subsequently threatened, and his freea political dramatization of what bad dom in this House has not been subjected to interference. Deputy Speaker, in my opinion, correctly ruled that no prima facie case for a breach to co-operate witb them. Nothing other of privilege bad been made. The Leader of the Australian Country I-arty made certain statements outside the House which from a security standpoint were more interesting than the -Statements which he made inside the chamber. In the House, he claimed that he had not intended to quote from the document, but that he bad been proinked into doing so by tbe Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman). In otber words, he was aware that it was reprehensible to quote from tbe document, but that provocation had overcome his inhibitions about thc matter. He did not claim that his action in reading from the document was a moral one, but said that tbe act had been committed under provocation. Outside the House, be informed the press, not bow tbe document had come into his hands, but how it must have travelled halfway round the world before be received it. There are many interesting security implications in that statement which was not made under cover of parliamentary privilege. He claimed, in an interview outside the House, that a serious leakagf had taken place from the British Cabinet, and that tbe document had wandered half-way round tbe world. It was about that document, and that statement, that the detectives desired to interview claim that he was intimidated because of what he said in the House neither establishes that he was interviewed because of what he had said in the House, nor that what took place was anything more tban an interview. Certain pressmen certainly had an interesting time racing between tbe press gallery and the rigbt honourable gentleman's office at the excited request place was anything more than an interview. Indeed, tbe right honourable gentleman does not claim that the detectives threatened or intimidated him. Those allegations were made by bis supporters. statement to the press wbich was simply occurred in bis room. All that took place Consequently, Mr in his office was a conversation, in the course of which the detectives asked bim than that is alleged by the Leader of the Australian Country party to have taken place. Members of tbe Opposition did not call for a vote on tbe earlier motion which tbe Leader of tbe Australian Country party had submitted. Although tbey claimed that a gross breach of privilege had been committed, only the Leader of the Australian Country party, the honourable member for Barker, who is a ci-devant member of the Australian Country party, tbe honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), and tbe honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) spoke on this matter, and they did not ask for a vote. did not want a vote to be taken.",71,Objection To Deputy Speakeb S Buling

Although bonorable members opposite contended that this matter goes to the roots of our liberty, they did not call for a division on it. I suggest, therefore, that tbey did not regard the matter very seriously t think that the bonorable member is reflecting on a vote of the House. propose to review very briefly the main arguments which bave been advanced. It is tbe function of Mr Speaker to declare whether a prima facie case of breach of privilege has been made. I submit that the interpretation which Mr Deputy Speaker placed upon the word "" privilege "" was correct, when be held that the Leader of the Australian Country party had not made out a prima facie case. It is within the province of the Chair to determine whether an urgent matter should be permitted to take precedence of the normal business of the House. I bave quoted May's ParUamentary Practice on that point. Mr Fadden, A. W. Deputy Speaker, having held that no prima facie case had been made, was correct in refusing to allow the normal business of the House to be suspended. Therefore, tbe matter was placed on tbe notice-paper. Tbe motion of disagreement with the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker, wbich the Acting Leader of tbe Opposition moved, was based on the allegation that the Leader of the Australian Country party had been molested. However, tbe right honourable gentleman made no such allegation. The only complaint which he made was about the interview wbich had taken place witb the investigation oflieers.

239,. 8,"Sup Mr Dedman -On the 13th October,M in is t e r for S h i p p in g a n d F u e l has supplied the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i o n : The extent of the quotas mentioned by the honourable member for Kew England is largely correct, except in the case of lighting kerosene, where the quota is 13,1011 tons less tban the sales in the year.ended the Slst March, 1948. . This is a reduction of 13.5' per cent, and not 25.8 per cent. as° mentioned by the honourable member. It is ' not true that there are no restrictions On the sale of diesel oil and fuel oil. Quotas have also been established, for these products for sale within the Commonwealth, and' for bunker purposes imports are only permitted to the extent of the sales made by the companies engaged in this particular type of trade. There are also limitations, under the National Security (Liquid Fuel) Regulations, mi.the sale nf white spirit, with a view to ensuring thut this commodity is used only for essential purposes. The quota system has been imposed on oil companies only by reason of the restrictions considered necessary on account of dollar exchange difficulties and in an .endeavour to limi t the aggressive selling tactics which have been udopted by certain memhers of the industry since Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited was abandoned. The Commonwealth Government appreciates that the quotas arc somewhat lower than sales by the oil companies during the, year ended the 31st March, 1948. but in view of the dollar exchange position has asked the companies to meet the consumer demand within these quotas. The question of the adequacy nf the quotas is under constant examination by my department, and every endeavour will bc made to meet the demand within the'limits of our dollar resources and the supply position of these commodities.",74,Distillat Eand Power Bjebobenk
