The manifesto issued by the Labour party at the last election stated distinctly that we intended that the War-time Profits Tax should operate during the first twelve months of the war.

"" The Commissioner"" means the Commissioner administering this Act. [3.59] I notice that ""Australia"" is defined as including the Territory of Papua. I think it is a very grave mistake that this Bill should be made applicable to Papua, which is the first of the Territories acquired by the Commonwealth. Its people already suffer from serious disadvantages and handicaps as compared with those of other communities. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, Papua, for some purposes, is regarded as a foreign country. Exports from the Territory, for instance, have to pay duty upon entry into the Commonwealth in the same way as exports from Java or any other foreign country. In addition to that, the inhabitants of Papua have to purchase all their stores in Australia. They are not in a position to procure The honourable them on equal terms with the people of other States, such as Java, for example. Our anxiety at all times will be to advance the interests of Pap""ua. But under this Bill we shall be going a strange way about that task.' Ostensibly we wish to encourage Papua in the development of its splendid resources. The Possession occupies a gravely difficult position inasmuch as it has practically to pay between 50 per cent, and 100 per cent, more for its labour than has a parallel island like that of Java. These are a few of the actual disabilities which are suffered by this first colony of ours. ThenI may mention that a number of enterprising men have been induced to invest a considerable amount of capital there. I am given to understand that eight companies have invested something like £1,000,000 in plantations of rubber, hemp, and copra. Under the terms of this Bill, these Subsequent amendments to companies will be very adversely affected. There is not one of them which has yet paid a dividend. They are practically just reaching a producing stage, and the prospects are that, either this year, or next, they will be able to pay a dividend. It may be argued that they will be enI think titled to an exemption of 10 per cent, on the capital which they have invested.

I think there are much graver objections to this clause than those which have been urged by the honourable member for Kooyong. of the equity of the method of taxation regarding Papua, but I should like the Treasurer to consider this position: this is almost a pioneering attempt to do with Papua what England attempted to do with America more than a century ago. The ultimate decision of that trouble was. that, without representation, an outlying dependency pf the Crown ought not to be taxed. Papua has no representation in this Parliament, and her case cannot be put here. She also has a method of taxation of her own. We are attempting to impose on top of that a system of taxation without any member of the Committee knowing very much about Papuan conditions. . It is only a few years since Papua was made a Territory of the Commonwealth. The whole of her industries are in a pioneering stage. Her resources are only now being opened up, and huge sums of money may have to be spent before her cittzens realize the wealth' which we anticipate will be obtained by their efforts. If we were to attempt at this stage to apply to Papua, with its infantile industries, this tax, which is conceived entirely on the supposition that we are dealing with established businesses, we should simply show that we altogether misconceived the nature of her industrial and commercial efforts. We are taking a pioneering step which recalls the whole of the American difficulties. been taken in connection with the income tax. think that was wrong, also. The circumstances of America, although on an infinitely larger scale, were not properly considered on that occasion either. automatically under this B ill , even if she were not specifically included? other question. It may be so; but the point is brought very prominently before us by the inclusion of PaiDuai n this marked manner. My argument is that Papua at present has powers of taxation through the Legislative Council we have given her, and we are attempting to overlay those powers from this Housei n which she has no representation. Council have to bow to the decision of the Minister on all sorts of questions? in this early stage of Papua's self-government, we propose a great overriding taxa-^_ tion which the people of Papua have no opportunity of criticising in this Parliament. I shall not follow my honourable friend in his detailed criticism of the unfairness of the tax, because the question whether Papua should be included at all is distinctly preliminary to the question of the form of taxing her on the supposition that it is desirable to do so. omit all reference to Papua, as advocated by the last speaker, because she has no representation in this House, we shall also have to exclude the Federal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, because neither of those places is represented here. I see no reason why Papua should be exempted. She has received a fair amount of consideratiou from this Parliament, and ought not to be released on the ground given by the last speaker, unless Parliament wishes to release other portions of the Commonwealth which also have no representation here. We surely cannot make fish of one and flesh of another. tralia has representation here. Federal Capital nor the Northern Territory has representation in this Parliament, yet they are subject to taxation. Unless some better reasons are advanced than I have yet heard I shall object to any I know, and I such amendment. agree with the honourable member f b r Grey( Mr Poynton) that even the peril of a popular rising in Papua should hardly sway our judgment on this issue; but I would point out that sub-clause 11 of clause 14, which the Minister imagines T h a t is anmeets the position of the planters in Papua, hardly applies to their particular case.

It was presented then in this form, so far as the particular matter under discussion was. concerned. I would suggest that the planters of Papua should be put in identically the same position as planters all over Australia, such as orchardists, who have to wait seven' years for their trees to come into bearing. Most of our orchardists are on exactly the same basis as the rubber planters of Papua. Papua, if they were called orchardists, would also be exempt. I am not urging that Papua should be entirely exempt. the price of rubber f think that has affected these people up to the present. clined to doubt whether rubber, even now, is as high as it was when the plantations were first put down. Practically no rubber has been produced from them yet, and all the fear is for the future. The plantations are just now beginning to bear. I am not in favour of excluding Papua from the Act, because if that were done, traders and others would become exempt merely on the ground that, although getting Australian and British protection, they were off the mainland of Australia, which would . be manifestly ridiculous. be put on the same basis as orchardists, and the capital expended during the period before the trees begin to bear ought to be taken into accounb as if it was money actually lost? on income account.

Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I take no exception to taxation of that nature. I intimated during my second-reading speech what was my attitude on this subject, and in assenting to the second reading of the measure I d i d ' not for a moment deprive myself of my right to object to its fundamental principles. I supported the second reading to afford the Government an opportunity of recasting it and making it more nearly a I had hoped, tax on war profits, but the amendments that have been introduced by the Government have not carried the measure very much further. The Minister has added a patch here and there, but patches in this kind of legislation only tend to open new leaks in other directions.

I have taken the trouble to ascertain that my facts are correct. The instances I am about to give affect the junior Bar, and not the men who are established. One of the grave injustices of this Bill, I should think, is that it is going to impose an enormously heavy burden of taxation upon the struggling members of the junior Bar, who have just got into positions which for years they have been striving to attain, and to let off those members who have for many years been earning a large income, but who, like most of such men, have not increased their income, but rather the opposite, during the war, who have also managed to save some capital, and could afford to pay, and have to pay, a heavy income tax. favour of a super-income tax. will not have to pay anything.

He finds that if the Bill is passed he will have to pay in respect to the last two years, a tax I intend to of £700. He is not in possession of that amount of money or anything like it.

However unjust it may be in other respects, at all events in this respect the Bill will work a grave injustice. This second man has been ab the Bar. for some seven or eight years. He had very little practice before the war started. He was making about £600 a year. He was getting a small junior practice. Since the war broke out he has risen, but not because some members of the Bar have gone to tbe war. A good many barristers have gone, but the number who have gone, and the practice which they have released, haa not, been sufficient to account for or make any practical difference in this case. This young' man is now getting into a good junior practice. He finds that the amount he will have to pay in respect to the two years will be £600. Not only is has a house which is heavily mortgaged.

Shortly, the proposal is to levy a war tax on all war-time profits from, any business to which the measure applies. War-time profits are those which arise after the SOth June, 1915, and the tax w ill be at such rates as art) declared by Parliament. We take tlie war profits for the financial year, and the tax is levied on the profits of that year. Then the question is-Ho w are we to ascertain the war-time profits earned during the year? is to work on the ordinary accounting periods of the business concerned. for instance, the 30th September is the end of the accounting period of a business, tbe wny of assessing is to take the financial year beginning the 1st July, 1915, and ending the 30th June, 1916. We, first of all, assess the profits made during the period ending the 30th September, 1915, and thus we see that there are three months of those twelve months in the financial year. We take the period beginning the 1st October, 1914, up to the 30th September, 1915, and,, dividing that by twelve, ascertain the monthly averages for the accounting period.

I forgot to mention that when there happens to be profits in one period, and not in another, provision is made for an adjustment. As pointed out by the honourable member for Flinders( SirW ill i am I r v in e ) , clause ' 7 involves the whole principle of this proposed method of taxation. 1 think that the Treasurer, after the discussions in this House, and in the public press, w ill be quite satisfied that to pass the measure in its present for m w ill mean grave hardship; even in cases where it would be possible to get at the true war profits, much injustice mighb be inflicted on The procedure many people, who ought really bo be taxed by means of an ordinary income tax and If, not by a measure of this kind. I understand there are two ways in which it might be possible to get at war profits. My own opinion is that in Australia income taxation presents absolutely the fairest for m of taxation of any in operation, for either war or ordinary revenue purposes. That, I 'think, will be admitted. it disputed before, and the honourable member, if he consulted authorities in almost any country where there is taxation under constitutional government, he . would find that thab principle is admitted. If honourable members are satisfied that an income tax is the fairest form of taxation, and having imposed income taxation already, it is the duty of the Committee to limi t the taxation under this B ill , as f a r as possible, to purely war profits. That is the spirit in which I think we should approach The the consideration of this important measure. If it is possible to devise some means by which profits earned as a direct All businesses result of war operations, and those only, should be liable to taxation under this measure, that is the course which should financial be adopted. I admit that it is a very difficult problem to solve.

Statements have appeared in the press that the base metal industries of the Commonwealth have not made greater profits since war was declared than they made in the pre-war period, although we know that the prices of metals have very considerably increased. market them. base metal industry is one which we expected to be able to get at under this measure. If we are to tax war profits i we can do so only in two ways. I give the Treasurer and the Commissioner of Taxation credit for having tried, in this B ill , to frame a measure which will bear as lightly as possible upon incomes that would be more equitably levied upon by an income tax, and to deal chiefly with industries the profits from which can be directly traced to the war. I give the Treasurer credit for endeavouring to do justice under this measure by providing for the taxation of war-time profits, and, at the same time, providing liberal exemptions to limi t the taxation as f a r as possible to profits directly the result of the war. We have to consider whether the B ill will really accomplish its object. It will do so more nearly than as at first introduced by the exclusion pf the professional section of the community, whose incomes, for the most part, are earned by personal exertion. mission agent and the small storekeeper?

I know of men in my own district who started only three or four years ago, and, as a result of their skill, have developed a considerable practice. that this is taxation on income due to the war, but that it is war-time profits taxation. the justice of that.

Whilst levying taxation on war-time profits we might lay down the principle that the measure should exclude all profits that are not properly the subject of income taxation. Take, for example, the pastoral industry. In my own district the term "" pastoral "" is very much misapplied. there a number of large pioneer graziers -me n who by their enterprise have assisted to make the country productivepeople are' inclined to regard them as pastoralists. The idea is commonly held that every person who grows stock is a pastoralist or squatter. But in the dis-. trict whicli I have the honour to represent-, almost every man is both a grazier and an agriculturist, and his agricultural operations are made very much more productive than they would wise thafc he grazes' stock upon his land. He is thus a greater asset from a national stand-point than he would be if his activities were confined to agriculture alone. Everybody is agreed, I think, that at the termination of the war we shall have to face very heavy taxation. It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to create new wealth, and tliat wealth can only be extracted from the soil. It must come from our primary industries, and consequently those industries should be excluded from the operation of this B ill . Why should not the pastoral industry be also excluded ? In Canada and other countries, all primary industries are exempt from the operation of the war-time profits legislation. Mr ""POYNTON -Why tax anybody? We would make the B ill acceptable to I could give all if we exempted everybody. make it acceptable only to those who would otherwise be called upon to pay uuder it . I submit that it is the duty of this Committee to confine the operation of the Bill as far as possible to the taxation of profits earned as the direct result I should like to hear the honorof the war. There is no other way in which such taxation can be equitably imposed. We need to make liberal exemptions in I do not know the case of particular industries; we certainly should exempt all primary industries, and if we wish to save new busiH o w can we say in nesses we should grant them a large exemption. ber mean an exemption in regard to the profits which they earn ? lutely exempt all primary industries, because we wish to encourage them. ber include the pastoral industry? press that point at the present time.

Principals will get an exemption of £200, and if they devote the whole of their time to their businesses, they will get another £300 exemption. I am not prepared to face the constituencies again on this question, because we have already been to the country, and have talked all round this subject of war-time profits. This is the Bill, and not one suggestion that has been made so far, will get us out of our difficulty with regard to distinguishing between war profits and war-time profits, though many suggestions have been made to exempt certain businesses. able member. for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) was the very first to suggest, in this House, that professional men should be included in the measure. I remember quite well, when the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) introduced the original Bill, the honourable member for Flinders, who was then sitting on the other side of the House, asked, ""Why exempt professional men V Evidently the professional men have been on the job -ince then, and have been ipulling the firings, because now, according to Sir William Irvine, they ought to be exempted. We are pledged to this form of taxation. Honourable members may try to make taxation as free as they can from the possibility of inflicting injustice, but they will not attain that object by passing a mere war-profits tax. It is impossible to work such a tax. The cost of administration will be nearly as much as the amount derived from the tax. But the legislation ean be so framed that the possibility of doing any injustice can be removed. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr that purpose. That is undoubtedly the Sampson) has referred to the loss of stock in the pre-war period. Why cannot the Bill be so amended that such a loss should not be considered as the withdrawal of stock? t sions are .made to pastoralists. prevent the measure from being altered to meet the case of the pastoralists. WhatI fear is that some persons wish to get clear of this taxation. We had better settle the point on this clause. While I do not bind myself to support the Bill in detail, I intend to adhere to the principle of the Bill so far as the taxation of war-time profits is concerned. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE (Flinders) [6.12] I wish to take exception in as strong terms as I can to the statement of the honorahle member for Grey( Mr Poynton) . that the National party is bound or pledged to the War-time Profits Bill introduced by the Labour party in the last Parliament. I can say that on any occasion on which that matter was discussed at the recent elections I took a good deal of trouble to draw a distinction between a War-time Profits Tax Bill and a War Profits Tax Bill. I urged that the The honorWar-time Profits Bill would work extremely unjustly, and said that what people wanted to tax were the profits made by reason of the war. look at the policy announced by the Government, you will find a distinct statement. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE I speak'as far as my policy is concerned. .Each honourable member is only responsible for himself. All I can say is that, if in a matter of this sort honourable members did not take the trouble to explain their doubts, but said that they were for the Bill right or wrong, then they will have to vote for this Bill. But I am not in that position. I am not going to vote for a flagrant injustice because of an imaginary speech given by some member of the House. Let us for a few moments discuss this subject without any kind of. feeling. Every one wants to tax the profits caused by the existence of a state of war. That must be the object whether honourable members pledged themselves to the former Bill or not, whether it was perfect or imperfect for object which every one has in mind in dealing with a measure'of this kind. It seems to me that there are three courses open tq us in this case.

276,Mr Poynton,"I think that if you will the incomes made by the war and pre-war incomes. In passing, 1 may tell the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton) that when he talks about the administration of this Bill costing £35,000 to raise the sum estimated-eve n assuming that that will be, the cost to the Government, although it will probably be much exceeded-h e leaves' out of account the enormous loss of time, as well as of money, which the community will suffer from attempting to comply with its provisions. ' Every one knows what trouble is caused to taxpayers when a new form of tax is introduced. Even yet honourable members require a great deal of assistance to help them to make up their income-tax returns, unless, of course, their business is very simple indeed. This tax will be to . an income tax as a Goliath is to a dwarf. Not only will a man have to do all that he now does under the Income Tax Act, but he must take his mind back three or four years and investigate his accounts, and he will have to apply for it if he wishes to get the ber from twelve to twenty lines in which real benefit of an exemption. He cannot do this work without an accountant and a lawyer at his elbow all the time. There is the plain, simple position. If the honourable member for Grey talks about the cost of administering this measure, I point out that the irritation and the cost to those who try to prosecute their claim to the exemption will be infinitely greater. That arises from its necessarily complicated provisions. It is like an attempt to patch up a leaky house by putting a shingle here and a piece of. galvanized iron there. A man will get no nearer to his end. When the Bill is finally constructed so as to be a habitable house, so to speak, it will be very much like that jerry-built house which fell down before it was completely constructed. builder came and told the owner that, unfortunately, one of the beautiful houses he was building for him had fallen-down. The owner asked how it happened, and the builder said, "" We unfortunately took the scaffolding away before the walls were finished."" This really is a measure of such a kind that it will fall to. pieces of its own weight and complexity before we are finished with it 'here. it is jerry-built? is all scaffolding and no house. Sir WILLIAMIEVINE I advise the Treasurer not to take the scaffolding away before he has the house erected. WhatI was pointing out just now was that two other methods are open to me, one of which is to tax war-time profits. Honourable members say that that is practically impossible. It is quite true that' it has been found difficult in England, and no doubt it will be found difficult here. It certainly could not be done with scientific accuracy. No measure of this kind can be carried out with scientific accuracy. There must be a rough-and-ready method for a temporary measure of this kind. The question is whether, if you try to get at the war profits by some such means v as 1 shall suggest, the complications or the difficulties will be so great as in working out this system.. A method of arriving at war profits I suggested in my second-reading speech. What is in the mind of people generally are certain classes of businesses which it is rather difficult to define, but which might numwar profits have been made. We might take, for instance, the' base metals. It is disputed that the profits have been anything like so great as has been suggested. Certainly the 'value of base metals has gone up immensely since the war began. Whether profits have been made is a matter which could easily be shown. Then you might take things out of which very large profits have been made directly out of the war. Softgoods and other stores of that kind have been sold retail at, perhaps, very much more than their value at the commencement of the war. generally. take ironmongery generally. Then chemical stores have gone up; perhaps more than anything else. ment. Sir WILLIAM_ IRVINE -No enumeration of this kindwill be scientific or exhaustive.

Under these circumstances, it should not be beyond the capacity of a Board of Referees, under the Commissioner-if you choose the right men-to indicate, first of all-and this need not be conclusivea schedule or classification of goods and services, the returns from which have, by reason of the war, increased by 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 60 per cent., or whatever other percentage you like to fix. That might be the, basis of the taxation of those who had made war profits, every one else in the community being compelled to contribute to the revenue by payment of the ordinary income tax. Then let business men send in their returns. If you are going to keep a pre-war standard, let it be assumed that the excess of income over it is war profits, unless the Commissioner or Board of Referees is satisfied that it is not. I do not say that any scheme that rests upon a comparison between a pre-war standard and present income will avoid causing the gravest difficulties and embarrassments to the corrmunity that has to make returns; no system of the kind would be ' free from that objection. But if you adopt a pre-war standard, and give to those who show increases of income the opportunity of satisfying the Commissioner, or, on appeal, -a Board -of Referees, that these increases are not due to the war, that should meet the case. crude, rough-and-ready method of doing what has to be done, but it would create fewer difficulties than will be created by the B ill as it stands. The third alternative,-if you have, not a war profits tax, but a war-time profits tax, is the adoption of the Canadian system, which, perhaps, under all circumstances, might be the most practicable. This system is very simple, and was described by Sir Thomas Whitei n his last Budget speech, after it had been in operation for a year, as having worked extremely well. He increased the higher rates, and those increases were accepted without demur. Sir JO HN FORREST -He pointed that the profits came mostly from munitions As we have not been making munitions here, we cannot expect the same return of war"" profits. avoids the irritating and exasperating necessity of having a pre-war standard, and a comparison between the incomes of to-day and those of three or four years ago. It deals only with businesses the profits of which are derived from capital. If , during the war, a company has made a profit of more than 7 per cent., or if an individual has. made a profit of more than 10 per cent, on the capital employed in the business, taxation to the amount of 25 per cent, of the excess must be paid. If an individual has earned 15 per cent, on his capital he must pay taxation at the rate of 50 per cent, on the excess, and if he has made 20 per cent., he must pay at the rate of 75 per cent., on the excess. All small businesses are exempt. defined ?

Wei n Australia have no war businesses. I do not plead for any particular exemption. The exemption could be made low, or omitted altogether. The demand for this taxation is addressed more to the large companies and firms that have been This is only a making big profits during war time than to the smaller concerns, and what the exemption shall be is not now essential.

293,Honourable Mr Rodgers,"If we were honest wedo not wish to be the keeper of any man's conscience except my own, but if honourable members will take their minds back to what was really the substantial question put before the electors, I think they will see that the substance of the pledge was that the people being anxious to get at the profits made out of the war, an effort would be made to do that. The Canadian Bill became law on the 18th May, 1916, and Sir Thomas White, in delivering his Budget speech on the 4th April of this year, saidThe question of further revenue then narrows down to abnormal profits made by business firms during the period of the war, and this, in my view, is the proper and legitimate source from which to look for increased revenue to meet the increased cost 'of the war. If a business is making, in war time, profits above the normal, they must be due to the abnormal conditions created by the war, that is to say, such a business is deriving advantage from the war. It will be observed that he speaks about abnormal profits. He does not refer to a man making more profits out of his business than in the year before, because they may have been made from a hundred circumstances, just as he may have made less profits. He went on to sayI t follows that it may properly be required to contribute a share of such profits to the Government for the purposes of the war. I do not see, Mr Speaker, that it makes much difference whether the business in question is the making of munitions or any other class. Munitions are needed, and no discredit attaches to the enterprise which provides them. The steel company which engages in the production of munitions could, in most cases, make as much, if not more, money by selling its steel products in world markets. Moreover, it would be inequitable to discriminate against the firm which makes a profit upon the finished article, known as munitions, and leave untaxed the profits (it may be equally large) of those firms which manufacture and supply the raw material or partly manufactured products from which they arc 'made, or the businesses throughout the country which make abnormal profits from the distribution of money expended by Governments in payment of such munitions. If higher profits are made in the manufacture of munitions, the higher the tax taken under business-profits legislation. This is a complete answer to the Treasurer, who, when I mentioned that the Canadian system would be more just than this Bill if we are going to tax war-time profits, interjected, "" The difference is that in Canada they are making munitions of war."" That is quite true, but, as I pointed out, has no reference to the point I am making, viz:, that under an Sir William Irvine. equitable system of taxation in time of war, it does not matter whether the abnormal profits are made from munitions or from anything else. If they are abnormal, they are a fair subject for taxation. Sir Thomas White continuedIn accordance with the principle which I have enunciated, the Government last year imposed the Business Profits War Tax. Under that legislation, profits in excess of a certain percentage upon capital invested were taxed to the extent of 25 per cent, of such excess. This measure has proved quite successful, not the least of its merits being the small cost of its administration, which will probably not exceed one-half of 1 per cent, upon the amount collected. orable member's time has expired. did not contribute any reflections on the Bill at the second-reading stage; therefore, I take this opportunity in Committee to say a very few words. WhatI did say before was out of order, because it was a sentence uttered on the motion for the adjournment of the House, to the effect that some of us regarded the Bill as being entirely too contemptible for any 1 measure of support at all, whilst others of us, on the other hand, thought that, as it is at least a pretence , at taxation of wartime profits, we were justified in supporting the second reading of the Bill. When I said that the Bill was too contemptible for any measure of support at all, I thought I had denounced it in language sufficiently strong to meet the case; but I am bound to confess that, in the interval, the Government have succeeded in making the Bill a good deal worse than it was at that time. view ? discussion on the Government side of the House, it is worse, mainly from the point of view of the honourable members who, in such large numbers, have occupied the Government benches to-day. In fact, the discussion has been so animated, and so interesting, as tosatisfy me that the Bill is exciting a good deal of interest in the electorates, and that honourable members on the Government benches have a definite commission to ameliorate the lot of their constituents, a small and select number of whom were touched by the Bill as"" it was originally submitted to the House.

My reflections only began to mature this afternoon when I saw the Government benches crowded, and honourable members one after the other jumping up to say a word or two on behalf of their class. The honourable member for Kooyong was not quite speechless with indignation, but was palpably indignant at what he called the cruel and relentless operation of this B ill ; and the Committee listened w i th solemn silence, and naturally sympathetic silence, to tlie honourable member for Flinders, who, as the arch-protagonist of the "" a l l in "" policy in this waT, was soliciting our sympathy for some person who was to be taxed over and above his salary of £700 per year, and was only making, as a young man, £1,500 per annum. these processions in the street of unemployed persons who are looking for bread, in the presence of such real hardship ? ably right in bringing me back more -losely to the clause. Having said so much by way of a reminder to honourable members of the utter inconsistency of their position, let me say .that I quite agree with a number of honourable members in the contentions they have raised in regard to this clause. concur in the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders. In response to an interjection, the Treasurer said, "" This is not a War ProfitsB ill ; it has nothing to [ 5 7 ] -2 do w it h war profits; it is a War-time ProfitsB ill . "" May I ask what on earth we have to do w i th the taxation of war-time profits as such ? What is wrong w it h wartime profits that they should be the subject of our special concern?

If the position in regard to the war is what we are told it is, let us by a l l means have taxation to the bone, and I would commence by asking Ministers themselves to submit their salaries, which have arisen directly out of the war, to taxation to the bone.

My sole contention is that they are h it too hard in comparison with other men, and that the proposal is inequitable. views as to where taxation should be placed, and as to the measure of it ; but I venture to say that no member of this Committee will support a tax which musb be palpably inequitable in its operation. I hope, therefore, tliat this part of the measure will be rejected. I should, in deed, very much like to see the B ill , which I referred to on a previous occasion as being contemptible, and which I conceive to have become more contemptible, withdrawn altogether. Let us, by -the direct method, get to the people with' bhe money. I do not think we have ever had before this Chamber a taxation measure in regard to which there has been such diversity of opinion, and in discussing which we have found honourable members rising to advocate one form of amendment, and, before sitting down, suggesting another,"" altogether different. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) displayed much contempt for those who have launched this measure. self. ber had the lash in his hand, and gave it , hip and thigh, to those responsible for the B ill , and he, after urging that it should not be a War-time ProfitsB ill , but a War ProfitsB ill , resumed his seat with the suggestion that it should be transformed into an Income TaxB ill . A distant part of the Empire, like Australia, is playing a very insignificant part, so f a r as war industries are concerned; every industry here, in my judgment, stands almost equal in this respect. ThisB ill , in its taxation measures, has failed to take into the taxpayer to pay. of the kind have started off with a well defined exemption, and then proceeded in gradations until everybody's capacity to pay has been reached. This measure starts off by saying that every man, although he may be carrying on a young business, must yield 50 per cent., and finally 75 per cent., of his war-time profits, while the most successful contractor for war equipment w ill be called upon to pay no more. There is, in this respect, an absolute failure to discriminate as to capacity to pay. When I spoke on We have varied the second reading, I said that I regarded the B ill as a misfit-as an attempt to graf t commercial principles on a political measure that w ill not"" work. It would be much better, in my opinion, if the Government, as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has suggested, would make this an Income TaxB ill . That honourable member may be regarded as a f.a.q. sample of the opponents of the B ill , though the Leader of the Opposition, when he spoke on the second reading, counselled the Government to take all war-time profits. gentleman to cast his mind back a little to the time when he, along with others, helped to formulate a policy which was called the "" Conscription of wealth."" That policy the honourable member yelled from every platform in Australia, and his supporters followed his example. However, immediately after the New South Wales election, and just before the Federal election campaign, the honourable member, in a manifesto, climbed down, and said that experience had proved the principle to be wrong. imagination! me well, and the exact words of the honourable gentleman are indelibly written on my mind. anything but what was written in that manifesto.

If we curtail the resources of individuals to the extent of 75 per cent, we must take over the obligations of those individuals, and one of those obligations is to our soldiers. ThereA man who has for long years has been quite enough of encouraging individuals not to bother about developing in their own particular sphere, but rather to follow the State as if it were a circus. If we are to face the problem, we must create new wealth, and open up fresh avenues for the development of our resources. The Government would be well advised to reconsider the proposed wartime profits taxation on the lines I have suggested. . We should start w it h a * minimum of £1,000, below which no .one should be liable for this taxation, and we should work up then by gradations according to the capacity of the taxpayers to meet the tax. That is the basis of taxation which we have previously laid down, and I see no reason for departing from it for the taxation of war profits. To tell men newly starting in business that from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, of their incomes may be taken from them under this measure, whilst others engaged in similar industries for years may carry I had in my on without the tax affecting them, w ill create such a feeling that the' present Go£1,000; vernment, and the .party supporting them, w ill have reason to rue the day that they ever touched a measure of this description.

The suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) as an easily workable way out of an absolutely hopeless quagmire of possible legal difficulties, was tried in the first place in England and discarded, because it was found that it would give rise to those very difficulties which the honourable member anticipates from this B ill .

When people have expected it , when they have realized what they will have to do, when they have made provision for it , and put aside the money, there is no hardship in retrospection as we see it in this measure, but to put it on to new classes, such as doctors and professional men of all kinds, and date it back, with practically a promise of exemption standing before .them for years one year. now, even for one year, would be a grave act of injustice to those two professions. it retrospective in the one case and not in the other? retrospective where notice was given, and notice was given in .the previous Bill and in the platform pledges of the party on this side.

If such a case has happened, it is certainly one for the imposition of a war-profits tax, because the increased income is as much due to the existence of the war as, are the enhanced profits of some warehousemen, who have been able to dispose of certain stocks. Why should not these persons pay the tax ? If an injustice is going to be done by including professional men within the scope of the measure, I am If my memory not here to press the amendment.

Moreover, the Commissioner is given a very wide discretion in dealing with special cases. If , however, the provision is not sufficiently elastic in that respect, we can easily amend it .

There is a better chance of' escaping hardship and unf airness under this B ill than under the earlier measure. I do not see how the B ill can be much improved, but, surely, it is a non-party measure. Both parties are agreed as to the principle, but differ as to the rate of the tax. The Opposition would take 100 per cent, of the excess profits, which would make it not worth the while of any person to trouble to earn them, and would go back over a H o w are we going period of three years.

It would be a good. ter) -The honourable member is not n o w discussing the question before the Chair. criticism can be advanced, the Government ought to proceed with its proposals, with such amendments as may be thought to improve the measure. I find it a little difficult, after the rambling speech that we have just heard, to criticise the measure on first principles. The honourable member for W i l mot ( Mr Atkinson) indulged in a sort of lament because this party has ventured to criticise the B ill , and even went so far as to invite the other side to j o in us in a meeting to evolve a measure which would be intelligible. I hope that neither the Ministerial party nor the Government w ill be held responsible for the honourable member's hopeless attitude, or for the invitation which he has given to the other side. I have not given any pledge to my constituents, and feel quite free to criti cise the B ill . and learned member did not even stand as a Nationalist candidate? did not talk about war profits, nor did I offer any political inducement to put me into Parliament. I propose to criticise the measure on its merits. In the first place, it is an inherited measure-w e took it over from the other party. It was announced by the PrimeM in is t e r ^ Bendigo, almost in the terms in which the first B ill was in troduced 'by the other party, but has been modified in a manner which, I think, makes for its improvement. I have neveT before heard of a measure being condemned stock, lock, and barrel, by those who ' introduced it , because members ha.ve now voiced the complaints of individuals and classes likely to be hurt by it in its unamended form. We are in Committee to frame a better measure; to do our best to get rid of alleged injustices and inequalities, and, generally, to meet the objections raised by those who fear that they may be treated unjustly. I am prepared to help to make this B ill both just and useful. It has ibeen brought forward If so, well and because we are at war, and there is the' general impression that some of the profits-whether war profits or not-whic h have been made during the war period should contribute towards the revenue of the country. That is its primary purI f no constructive pose. The measure has been discussed very freely this afternoon, and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr. West), who seems to have forgotten that for years the measures introduced into this House had been already criticised and settled before they reached us, thinks that because the discussion has been absolutely free, open, and above-board, we are, therefore, like sheep that have gone astray, and that we do not know what we want. The measure was introduced by the Labour party, and has been taken up by the National party, to increase the revenue by taking some of the profits that aTe being made during the war. That has given rise to the terms, "" War ProfitsB ill "" a n d "" War-time ProfitsB ill . "" Some people seem to think that these terms are totally different, and that no one can mistake one for the other, but if we begin a War Profits Bill with a basis of 10 per cent., there is no difference between it and a War-time ProfitsB ill . The one is a tax upon the period during which the war lasts, and so is the other; 1 d i d ; but I the other difference is tyhat in a war-time profits tax we find, necessarily, a pre-war basis to go upon, whereas, in the case of a war profits tax, we need not have that. It is quite immaterial what we call the measure so long as we start by admitting a man's right to earn profits up to a certain percentage which are untaxed, and then say that we shall treat them as his normal profits and treat everything above that standard as profits made on account of the war. graduated scale. the details. No doubt there are many inequalities in the B ill . A wide distinction will have to be drawn between profit earned from capital which is, in a measure, dead, and profit made from personal exertion which comes from a live man who is moving forward in his business or profession.

It would be obviously unfair to say that my first year's earnings were my normal earnings, and that everything I made above that standard was the result of some war or other circumstances which operated at the time. It was simply that I , like other young men who worked hard to get on, exerted myself more and more to get an increased income, and so increased my practice. There should be some recognition of the fact that, apart from the war, a man may be increasing' his normal income or earnings, and the failure to recognise this principle is one of the in equalities of the B ill before us. able member propose to overcome that inequality 1 to the clauses that deal with that matter, I shall move an amendment.

They may have no political responsibility, but they are under an obligation to help us to put into final form the measure , which they introduced into this Parliament. Fortunately, we are not depending on honourable members opposite. There is no need to have any joint meeting to consider the B ill . The measure is before us as the result of the matured consideration of the Government. The Treasurer has set out proposed amendments, and has put before us, in black and white, reasons for every amendment that he we shall have the benefit of considering his reasons. In the meantime, I am perfectly willing and anxious to support the B ill , subject to whatever amendments the Committee thinks fit to make in order to prevent the injustices to which honourable members have alluded. There is no provision for what I profits. one industry may lead to great profits in another. I happen to know that in some businesses in which metals are largely used the freights between America and Australia have gone up from 12s. to £12 per ton. There are industries in Australia which would be highly profitable today, but which are actually running at a loss, because contracts have had to be carried out, though these extraordinary freights have had to be paid. There will be great losses in businesses in consequence of the war as well as great profits. TheB ill provides for this. I do not take the hopeless view that many lionorable members on this side of the House seem to take. The very free discussion which has taken does the honorplace between honourable members of the National party is regarded by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) as evidence of want of cohesion on this side. All his political life the honourable member has been accustomed to see measures brought here by his party cut and dried, and no discussion taking place on them; not only was there no discussion, but there was also no opportunity for discussion by the Opposition. knows the reason for that.

It is all very well for honourable members to say that they inherited this Bill from the party now sitting in opposition, but there was nothing mandatory in this regard upon those who "" ratted "" from the Labour party. They could have been out-and-out Liberalsi f they had chosen. Some of those now sitting behind the Government advocated the taking of 100 per cent, of war profits, but to-day they are silent. There seems to be so much diversity of opinion amongst the supporters of the Government that nobody knows where the war profits are, or where they are made. I have pointed out before that the. bank deposits increased between 1913-14 to 31st March, 1917, by no less a sum than £49,249,149. I understand the banks to be the repositories of money that is l e f t after all liabilities, including income tax, have been paid.

When I rise and speak on behalf of the fellows who returned me, those on a daily or weekly wage, I am. accused of assisting strikers and of backing up men who would bring about industrial turmoil in this time of war, but honourable members are doing for their masters what I am doing for those who sent me here. I wish to quote a parallel case to show whether the Government are' serious in this matter. A few days ago the Treasurer promulgated another taxation measure, which singled out eligible unmarried men for special taxation, with a minimum of £ 1 0 , regardless of whether or not those men have got the money, whether they I have no deare in work, or whether they have responsibilities to parents and relatives. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! That tax is not dealt with in this B ill . parallel between the methods proposed to be adopted in collecting the special tax on eligibles and those. to be adopted in connection with this war-time profits tax. If the Government are sincere, and believe nob only in winning the war, but also in paying for it , they will find --those profit's. The bank balances-1 have quoted clearly reflecb the. profits which have been made during the war. It is the clear duty of the Government to get that money, and nob to be so mealy-mouthed aboub their methods. If the Government cannot find the profits, why tinker with the tax as they are doing ? I believe in a tax on war profits, although it may be that the filtration process referred to by the honourable member for Balaclava, by which all extra imposts ultimately fall upon the wage earner, who cannot dodge taxation, may assert' itself in connection with this tax as with others. I do not anticipate the receipts from this tax being more than a drop in the ocean of expense incurred in connection with the war, but when the time comes for raising the next instalment of money for war purposes, there w ill be no hesitation on the part of the Governmenb in going again to the kingdom of Shylock, and paying 4£ to .6 per cent., or whatever price is demanded, for this class of patriotism. A responsibility rests upon the Government to lay hands upon that £50,000,000 of extra bank deposits. Those deposits represent war profits, and the Treasurer, who has been more years in political life than I have been on this mundane sphere, ought to be able to get that money for the Commonwealth. The Governmenb would go",44,William Ibvine T O Carry Out Gob Before War Profits Are Not Neces

Let them be honest. Let them give up talking the flap-doodle that we hear as to a business being worth so much in one year, and so much less in the next, with the result that when the two years are put together, hey, presto! the taxable margin disappears altogether. The Government propose now to fasten this tax on professional men. I do not think the additional bank deposits, amounting to £50,000,000 represent the increased earnings of professional men. consists of Government deposits. cently in this House a question was put to a Minister as to the amount which the Australian Mutual Provident Society had invested in war loans, and as to what proportion of that amount was subscribed through agents. We found that more than one-half of it was subscribed through the medium of brokers. Instead of dealing directly with the Commonwealth, and so relieving the Government of the payment of any commission, these patriots f e lt it necessary to compel the Government to pay to their friends a little blood money. Men whose incomes have increased in that way cannot say that their increased returns are not due to the war.

I have no doubt that the Treasurer will have to come down to the House again with a proposal for a super-income tax. A super-income tax on a graduated scale will reach those who do not show any war-time profits, but who have made large profits since the war, just as they were making them before the war broke out. In proposing to reach in this way those who have made profits which they would not have secured but for the war, we are merely fulfillin g a pledge that we gave to the people. It is idle for any one to say that no such profits have been made. They have been made in every State.

We have to do the best we can to raise, as equitably as possible, the revenue we require; and I contend that we should be able so to amend the Bill as to avoid the perpetration of any great injustice. The plea that this Bill may work an injustice here and there is no justification for allowing men who have made large war-time profits to escape this tax, and for taxing them under a graduated income tax in the same way as men who have made no war-time profits. profits, they will not pay a super-income tax. ber and others who oppose this proposal wish to put those who have made large profits out of the war on the same level as we shall probably put, next year, men who have made nothing out of the war itself, but who at the same time have derived some profit from their business. Our endeavour should be to get at those who because of the war have reaped profits which others in Australia have not. I hope that this Bill will be passed. It will certainly be necessary to make a good many amendments in order that we may avoid injustice, while at the same time reaching the men that we were out to reach when the measure was framed. two speeches to which we have listened have come rather as a surprise to me. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) began by practically abusing those of us who have been criticising the measure, and concluded'by expressing the hope that the Bill would be carried with a good many amendments. All that we ask is that it shall be amended. who have said, "" Wipe out the Bill."" such suggestion during this debate. the kind was made by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). on this side are unanimously in favour of reaching the war profits-that is, profits due to the war-bu t the difficulty is that, have got it on overdraft, with new machinery such as we are now establishing,. and of which we have haA no previous experience, we are going to do irrevocable harm to a considerable number of people who have not yet found their footing in business. The case put by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) illustrates the position. N/umbers of young men who are beginning in business, or in the professions, are going to be unduly taxed because, prior to the war, they had not developed .their business so far as had some of their older competitors. Similar illustrations were given by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), who, if we eliminate the first part of his speech, made a very sensible contribution to the debate. The remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) are the most original that we have yet heard. He says truly that he has no knowledge of finance, but he points to the fact that there is something like £50,000,000 in the banks, and says that we ought to get this money. the deposits. honourable member is what one burglar says to another"" There is a ' crib,' ' crack' it."" May I point out, in the most friendly manner, that money in the banks is no guarantee of profits made? When things are beginning to look bad is the time the bank assets and deposits swell, because men cease to speculate and deposit their money. I can say, personally, that I am never more uncomfortable than when I have money lying in the bank; and I am only typical of hundreds and thousands of business men. When such men have an overdraft 'they are utilizing their brains with the money of other people, who have deposited it in the banks, and this is all to the benefit of the community. The fact that deposits have so grown that there is now something like £50,000,000 more in the banks than at the outbreak of the war does not mean that this is extra profits. On a previous occasion I said that a man who had sold a house might have no other investment for the proceeds, and put them in the bank. money out of the bank to buy the house?, Another suggestion has been made that honourable members on this side, in arguing against the Bill, are trying to give a quid -pro quo to the electors who senb them here.",46,William Ibvine T O Carry Out Gob Before War Profits Are Not Neces

495,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [10.28],"in Sydney under the provisions of the Act. An endeavour was made in Sydney to in spect the list, but it was not there. Under the companies law of New South Wales the list of shareholders must be registered, and can be inspected. If the list is not registered the company is liable to a fine of £ 5 for every day of default. The list of the shareholders of this company is not in the Registrar's office in Sydney, or was not there two or three days ago. All this difficulty in getting the information from the Government would appear to support the view of those who consider that the transaction is irregular. It is said'that a member of the Wool Committee is inter .ested financially in this concern. The list of shareholders would show us whether that is so. I wrote to MrJ . M . Higgins, Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, about the matter, and he sent me a letter couched in such heated terms that I do not feel like replying to it I have the very highest opinion of Mr Higgins, and my relations with him at the Treasury/ were most satisfactory. I stated in at least one Budget speech that the Government were grateful to him for the work he had done. A t that time he was assisting us in the matter of considering fresh issues of capital. He has taken exception to my asking these questions about the company and the Committee. The Government ought to lay the list of shareholders on the table of the House. Surely there is nothing to conceal. I asked the Prime Minister to-day whether he was aware that the list was not available in Sydney. He said he was not. I then asked him whether he had carried out the clause in the agreement providing that the company must lodge with the Government a list of its shareholders. He then in formed me that the Government had the list, but it was regarded as confidential. This apparent objection to give information would lend colour. to the belief that there is something irregular about this new Government partnership with 'the'' Colonial Combing. and Weaving Company to share the profits made out of the manufacture, sale, and exportof wool tops W i ll the Acting Prime Minister inquire into the matter and ascertain the reason for the objection to placing on the table a list of the shareholders in the company who are in a business partnership with the Government ? I should like to suggest to the Treasurer of proving the invention, because the that in connection with his power to withhold the right to issue capital his Department might bestir itself in cases where the industry sought to be established is of value to the country. A . syndicate in Sydney recently discovered what they claim to be a complete and satisfactory substitute for petrol. The price of petrol has gone up about 300 per cent, since the war started, and any substitute for it would be of great value, not only to its owners, but to the people generally-of such value, in fact, that the country might well consider fche advisableness of taking over, pushing, and extending the industry. I am not saying that this is a bad or good substitute, but the promoters claimed to have made a substitute and applied for a patent, but an embargo under the War Precautions Act was placed on their application, on the ground, I presume, that the invention was of such importance that publicity should not be given to its details at this time. When the embargo was placed on their patent they sought to offer the invention, through the Defence Department, to the British Government. In due course, they were informed that the invention would not be offered to the British Government because it was utterly useless. They then came to fche Attorney-General's Department again, and pointed out that there was now no objection to patent rights being issued to them. A t this stage, there appeared to be no further trouble; but when they went to the Treasurer for permission to float the invention into a company, and asked for a large proportion of the shares in the proposed company, the Treasury replied that it was prepared to grant a much smaller sum to prove the scheme before authorizingthe formation of a company to develop it on a large scale. I looked through the papers, and found that a prima facie case for the success of the in vention had been made out. Two persons had used the substitute for petrol, one in a special carburetter, and the other in an ordinary carburetter. Both had taken records of the engine revolutions with Vwo fuels, and, according to their statement, the substitute for petrol gave very satisfactory results. One would imagine that, with this evidence before the Department, the officials would be keen, in the public interest, to facilitate any action in the direction",50,Delivery Of Telegrams
496,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [10.33],"matter is of tlie greatest public importance, especially in view of the fact that the material from which this spirit may be generated is now running to waste in Australia. It was suggested to me that this syndicate was being well treated by the Department, and I will endorse that statement if the Department will tell me what proof it requires. may be pardoned for suggesting to the Treasurer that to proceed by this method in a matter of such importance is to travel with much energy, but no progress, in a vicious circle. I am not concerned with the syndicateI do not know them, and I am nofc sure if I have seen any of the men-bu t I think that if the results, claimed for this invention can be obtained we shall, by developing ifc, ,be doing more towards winning the war than by talking from now onwards t ill the conclusion of the war. thinks the invention w ill be an advantage to the country, but that tihe persons concerned are grasping, and are pushing the invention for their personal benefit, the Government should step in , take it over, and pay the inventors such a sum as an arbitrator may determine. weal should not be prejudiced either by departmental procrastinationI am not blaming the Treasury, because that Department is the least offender in this business-o r by this interlocking of departmental energy, which always results in an enormous waste of departmental paper. May I suggest to the Treasurer, that, in cases where money is required for the development of a venture which means so much for the welfare of Australia, the Department should state definitely what proof is required, and the method by which it may be obtained ? If this is done, Ministers will short-circuit much of this departmental correspondence, and we shall remove the stigma which rests upon Australian administration that after three years of war it has not been responsible for one new thought for the benefit of our common cause. I anticipated, when I interrogated the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen), and. the Prime Minister( Mr land has been released, and the GovernHughes) to-day, that the Prime Minister would have made a f u l l statement with regard to foodstuffs in cool store. It telling months' sugar supplies on hand, as well as enough wheat for five years, and that our mutton supply is assured for ""a number of years. The object of the Governmeut, should be to bring these commodities within reach of the great bulk of the people. I think I about the cheapest food in the world today J ber can put it that way if he likes; but I am making a complaint, and I think he w ill find, when I am finished, that I am right in requiring that certain information should be made available' to this House. The Prime Minister made a paltry excuse to-day when he said that the monthly returns which had been made regularly to the order of the previous Government had been discontinued because, , If the Department so he said, they came to hand too late to be of any value. That is either a very serious reflection upon the officers, or else it suggests inefficient Ministerial control. The Government should know exactly where we stand every day with regard to our food supply. I asked the Prime MinThe public ister last week whether he was prepared to do with foodstuffs in cool stores on order to the British Government, for which freight was not obtainable, what the New Zealand Government are doing in similar circumstances, and that is that meat and other , produce in cool stores is being let out and made saleable to the public. I find that in reply to a question asked in the New Zealand House of Representatives by Mr C. J. Parr last week as to whether the Government meat shops at Auckland.had ceased to do their own killing, MrF . W . Massey, the Prime Minister, stated that for the coming season the manager of these shops had been instructed 'by the Board of Trade to obtain the whole of his supplies of either chilled or frozen meat from the Imperial stores, and in his discretion to make the best terms possible so as to insure selling the meat at rates agreed upon between him and the Board of Trade. In other words, meat and other produce in store for the British Government in New Zeament meat shops there are being supplied with chilled meat, and it is being dispensed to the public, relieving much of is no use the Prime Minister the distress and some of the high prices us that we have fifteen existing there.

499,Mr Fenton,"The honourable memthe returns are which were presented today by the Minister for Trade and Customs, I will take one item alone. We are told in a return that there are only 542 cases of f r u it in cool store for export, whereas the Minister for Trade and. Customs stated last week that in apples alone there, were 400,000 cases in Australia. There is a great disparity between the figures. for export. not say that the intention is to t r y to make us believe that that is the quantity held in cool store. Eveni n the return given to-day, the meat stored in Queensland is not included, nor is some of the meat stored in New South Wales. I am glad to know that some of the rabbits have been released for public consumption, that is, rabbits which have been on order to the British Government. People are very glad to get hold of any food now because the price of meat is so high. It is the duty of the Prime Minister, as well as of other Ministers, to give us the latest possible information in regard to 'the foodstuffs held in store. When an honourable member asks a Minister a question on a subject, he is entitled to correct information, and not to be laughed at by the Minister saying, "" I , as Prime Minister, guarantee a fifteen months' supply of sugar in sight, a five years' supply of wheat in sight, and quite sufficient sheep and lambs to supply Australia for years.""

In some cases, it has been ten days before a man has gone near the post-office, because he was not expecting to receive mail matter. It was ten days before one soldier received a telegram which arrived for him at Maribyrnong.
