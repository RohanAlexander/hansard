A bill has teen prepared to carry one stage further the effort to recover from the State of New South Wales the interest which the Commonwealth Government has paid on behalf of that State. see no necessity for the rush methods proposed by the Government, I intend to oppose the motion. Presumably the Government desiires to take a further step along the line of enforcement adopted by this Parliament a few weeks ago. proposed further step may prove to be a blunder. The Government is certainly making a number of very serious moves, and the least this Parliament has a right to expect is sufficient time to consider what the Government now proposes to do. Oi' course the Government is disappointed because it has not been able to do in two or three weeks -what it boasted it would do to bring Mr Lang to account; but as months have passed since the default on the part of New South Wales, a further day will not make much difference. Por that reason I oppose the suspension of the Standing Orders, their purpose being to assure to honourable members n» opportunity to do their duty in a deliberate and considered way. As a resident of New South WalesI am acutely aware of the anarchy prevailing in that State. The present state of affairs should not be allowed to continue for a day longer than can be avoided. Therefore, I shall .support the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. against any suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose of introducing amending legislation to inflict further suffering upon the people of New South Wales. The Government is affected more by "" Langitis"" than by any desire to promote the welfare of the people of that State. I am well aware of the hardship already suffered by them because of the enforcement legislation enacted by this Parliament. By seizing the revenues of the State, regardless of the suffering entailed, the Commonwealth Government children the necessaries of life. may laugh, but innocent children have suffered through the refusal of the banks to honour cheques drawn for motherhood endowment, allow the honourable member to proceed as he is doing.

It subsequently took action to prevent the trading banks from complying with section 15 of the act. Againi t met with failure. The validity of the act has been exhaustively tested, and the legislation of this Parliament has been upheld by the highest tribunal in the land, notwithstanding the fears expressed by some honourable members of this and another place that it might be held to be unconstitutional. On the 15th March last, the Auditor General furnished a certificate which disclosed that the amount in respect of which the Government, of New South Wales had defaulted at that date was £1,172,427, and that, after allowing for set-offs on account of moneys due by the Commonwealth to the State of New South Wales the not amount of the default of that State was then £924,082. that to be the amount in default? that has been certified to by the Auditor General, and the law has been complied with by the issuing of his certificate. On the 7th April a proclamation was issued prescribing that income tax, not including unemployment relief tax, whicli was definitely excluded, should be payable to the Commonwealth Treasurer. On the same date public notices were issued explaining how these payments were to be made. On the 9th April a second certificate was given by the Auditor-General which, taken in conjunction with the first, showed that, after allowing,for all set-offs, the net amount due to the Commonwealth by New South Wales in respect of its default was approximately £2,000,000. On the 11th April a proclamation was issued prescribing that certain other State taxation should be paid to the Commonwealth Treasurer. included betting, race-course admission, totalisator and entertainment taxes. Demands were also made on the banks under section 15 of the act to furnish information as to the moneys standing to the credit of the New South Wales Government, and to pay such moneys to The Governmeut the Commonwealth Bank. moneys! -bank, was the only money that Mr Lang had available for motherhood endowment payments, he had not enough to meet those payments for half an hour. A demand was also made upon the trading banks to pay within two months to the Commonwealtli Bank any moneys that they might subsequently receive on account of the New South Wales Government. When the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill was under consideration in this House the New South Wales Government had defaulted only in respect of external interest payments; but since then it has defaulted also in regard to internal interest payments. vernment is forcing it to do so. do so; it is merely endeavouring to recover amounts which the Commonwealth has already paid on behalf of New South Wales. The latest default by New South Wales occurred in respect of a payment due on the loth April. At present New South Wales is in default in interest and exchange by £2,730,541. Against this amount is to be set £505,341, a sum made up mainly of contributions towards interest -on the debts of New South Wales due by the Commonwealth under the Financial. Agreement. The net amount of the State's default is therefore £2,225,200. Regulations have been made recently to give the Commonwealth Government power to obtain taxation documents relating to Commonwealth and State assessments in New South Wales which had been impounded. The impounding of these documents has made it impossible, for the time being, to issue assessment notices, and this is creating additional difficulties for the Commonwealth. Since This taxation ""those regulations were drawn up no further action has heen taken in pursuance of the regulations. Although the validitj of the Financial r Agreements Enforcement Act has been upheld, the Premier of New South Wales and his Government have continued to",10,Speakeb Hon.

22,Mr Lyons,"It is not forcing it to<lefnu.lt, and to resist the efforts of the Commonwealth Government to recover fro m Stale revenues the amount which the Commonwealth has paid on behalf of New South Walesi n respect of its default. If the State continues to default in its internal and external interest payments until the 30th June, the gross amount of its default will be £7,200,000. Against this amount the Commonwealth Government will be able to offset about £1,500,000, being moneys clue by the Commonwealth to New South Wales. This w ill leave the net amount of the default by New South Wales at the 30th June at £5,700,000 which must be recovered under the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act from the State revenues. The action of the New South Wales Government in continuing to default is a definite menace to the financial stability and solvency, not only of New South Wales, but of every State in the Commonwealth, and is tending unceasingly to damage the reputation ancl credit not only of the States, but also of the Commonwealth. If the State Government is allowed to continue its present course, very grave difficulties lie ahead of the Commonwealth Government, and of all the State Governments. The actions of Mr Lang and his Government are also destroying the credit of this country overseas at a time when it is essential that we should maintain our credit. In the immediate future we have to meet a conversion loan of £13,000,000 on account of the New South Wales Government, but its conduct is making an already difficult task infinitely more difficult. The steps which the Commonwealth Government have taken in this matter have been rendered necessary by the sheer dishonesty of the New South Wales Government. The Commonwealth Government has not sought to recover one penny which does not belong to it , and which it has not already paid on account of New South Wales. Eveni f the New South Wales Government insists on continuing its dishonest conduct it is essentialthat the Commonwealth Government shall do its best tt> save the reputation of Australia in the eyes of the world. We are not seeking to make a farthing of profit out of these transactions; we are simply seeking to protect the good name of the Commonwealth. That has been the impelling force behind every move which we have taken. If the. New South Wales Government is allowed to continue to default up to and beyond the end of June the Commonwealth Government will only be able to meet its indebtedness-with the help of the Commonwealth Bank. But the position is worse than that. If the New South Wales Government continues on its present course, the time is not f a r distant when all the other State Governments and the Commonwealth Government will also have to default. It is because we are concerned about the position of. the otlier States and also about the position of the people of New South Wales-becaus e the citizens of New South Wales are also citizens of Australia, and Commonwealth electors and taxpayers-that we are so much concerned about maintaining our good name and reputation in Australia, and in other parts of the world. If , as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has said, the people of New South Wales are satisfied with the conduct of Mr Lang and his Government, why are not that gentleman and his followers prepared to face the issue immediately on the platforms of this country? The Commonwealth Government firmly believes that the people of New South Wales are overwhelmingly behind the action it has taken. If honourable members who support the Lang Government feel that the people of New South Wales are behind its policy, why all this delay in seeking the verdict' of the electors? Every month that that verdict is delayed w i ll increase the difficulties of the people of New South Wales, aud, indeed, of the people of the whole Commonwealth. It is for that reason that the Commonwealth Government has made these payments on behalf of the Government of New South Wales; but Ministers feel that they owe it to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to recover those moneys from the State. The Commonwealth Government has become liable to the banks from which it has obtained the money to make these payments; it has accepted that liability in the name of the taxpayers of Australia. In this matter, the Commonwealth Government represents the taxpayers. A sense of duty to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth has actuated the Governmeut in proceeding to recover for them the money that it has expended on behalf of the taxpayers of one State. Having taken the first step, the Government, in this measure, now proceeds to take another step; and I say, advisedly, after a ful l consideration of every aspect of the question, that it will see this matter through until finality has been reached. This legislation will make it possible for the Commonwealth Government to do certain things which it has set out to do; it will also remove certain doubts which have arisen regarding the existing legislation. Under section 8 of the principal act, no action can be commenced by a State against persons who make payments to the Commonwealth in accordance with the terms of that act; but it is possible that the State may impose fines or other j>enalties upon them. Clause 2, therefore, inserts a provision prohibiting penalty, forfeiture, or other disability upon any person by reason of his having made payments to the Commonwealth of moneys which, but for the Commonwealth legislation, would have been payable t'o -the State, or by reason of the fact that he has not. paid the amount in question to the State. Clause3 inserts a new section 8A relat1 ing to cases i u which the amounts payable under a State law for the issue of a'licence, certificate, or other document are paid to the Oommonwealth in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth act. In such cases, provided that all the other conditions imposed by the State law have been complied with, the State officer or employee whose duty it would be in the ordinary course of business to issue any such document, is required to issue it to the person concerned, upon production of a receipt showing that the correct amount has been paid to the Commonwealth. So far, no attempt has been made to collect revenue of this kind, because it has been feared that the State might refuse to issue a licence unless it received the money. The clause further provides that failure on the part of a State oflicer or employee t'o comply with the provisions of this it alters the form of notice to be given to section will render him liable to prosecuthe banks under section 15 of the prinMr Lyons. tion in terms of section 21 of the principal act. Section 10 of the principal act provides that moneys which, but for the Commonwealth act, would be payable to the State, must not be paid to any person other than the Treasurer or an authorized person. Some classes of State revenue which are, or may be, subject to attachment under the act, are of such a nature that it may be deemed advisable to allow State officers to continue to collect them and to deal with them as directed by the Treasurer, with the object of such revenues ultimately reaching the Commonwealth. Clause4 amends section 10 to provide that the Governor General may issue a proclamation declaring that a particular class of specified revenue is of such a nature that the payment of any moneys included in that class shall be made to an officer or an employee of the State, and that the officer or employee shall deal with such money as directed by the Treasurer. Upon the issue of such a prothe imposition of any fine, clamation, any officer or employee of the State who receives payments of the kind mentioned will be required to deal with them as directed by the Treasurer, and . any failure on his part to do so will be a contravention of section 21 of the principal act. A new section 13A, which will be ins serted in the principal act by clause 5, provides that after a resolution has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament, each House may, a't any time, and from time to time, pass a further resolution specifying additional classes of State revenue to which sections 7 to 13 of the Commonwealth act shall apply. When such further resolution has been passed, the classes of revenue specified therein will be deemed to have been specified in the earlier resolution. At present, it is doubtful whether Parliament could, by resolution, specify any new class of revenue to be attached, even though the certificate of the Auditor-General was for an amount sufficient to cover the additional revenue sought to be attached, unless a further certificate were given by the Auditor-General. The new section will remove that doubt. The object of clause 6 is twofold; first, cipal act; and, secondly, it empowers tlie Treasurer to release moneys which have heen paid to him under that section hut which are, in substance, trust moneys, not moneys the property of the State. Further informatior.. about this can be given in committee. In conclusion, I repeat that the Commonwealth Government is determined to follow the course which it proposed when introducing the Financial Agreements Enforcement Bill. We are not influenced by political or party motives; but are acting in the interests of all sections of the Australian aomanunity. We are resolved to uphold the good name of Australia, and its reputation for integrity. This nation has been tried by difficulties and depressions in the past, and it has always held its head high in the severest tests. Only to-day, for the first time in our history, do our people feel tempted to hang their heads in shame, because of the action, not of a State, but of one particular Government; the action of one man, who has dominated the politics of his State and the government over which he presides. This Commonwealth Government is determined to uphold the reputation of Australia. Minister does not display as much interest in the welfare of the people of the .Commonwealth as Mr Lang has shown in the weill-being of the citizens of New South Wales. The Prime Minister's interest lies in people overseas. South WalesI mean the Government of New South Wales, and I apologize to the people of that State for associating them with its present Government-is permitted to continue its present dishonest Qourse, .eyen greater -injury will befall the anxious as any other Ministry to mainworkers-for whom I know the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) to be eonoorned-tha n has come to them in recent years, and that is saying a great deal. Injury will come, not only to the workers of New South Wales, but also, unfortunately, .to those in remote parts of Australia who assisted in no .degree in the return to power of the present G.Or v.ci-nment of New South Wales. country which loses its reputation for integrity and honesty .can expect to avoid the evils which follow repudiation of the kind for which the New South Wales Government stands. Therefore, my Government is determined to proceed on its present course, in order that it may eventually recover the amount due to"" the Commonwealth, and convince the Government of New South Wales that continuance along the path which it has followed up to the present time would inevitably bring destruction upon the people of New South Wales and of the Commonwealth as a whole. I appeal to honourable members generally to assist the Government. We have passed legislation which the High Court has declared to be valid, and since we are operating under the law of the land, any government that obstructs the efforts of the Commonwealth Government to operate under that legislation is acting in contravention of the law. I urge honourable members to forget party interests, and to act in this matter with a view to promoting the interests of the people of Australia generally, by assisting the Government to carry out the declared policy of this Parliament. Government has not given honourable members a reasonable opportunity to appreciate what its next step really means. I have listened attentively to the Prime Minister's speech, and I have tried to realize the full significance of. the proposed amending legislation; but I confess that I have been unable to do that. Probably the Parliament does no.t know the true significance of the whole of these proceedings. I shall not repeat what I said ou a former occasion, nor do I consider it necessary to"" refer in detail to the record of the Government that I led, a record which shows that we were as tain the credit of this country. But I cannot regard what has takeu place in. New South Wales without feelings of grave apprehension. I . again utter the warning that I gave on a previous occasion. I believe that this matter has been badly handled from the beginning. I know that many sneers have been cast at my action as Prime Minister in dealNo ing with the difficult situation that had' arisen in New South Wales last year. It must *be recognized that a tremendously difficult problem is presented when a",11,Speakeb Hon. G H Mackay From The Government Of New South

25,. Mr Scullin (Yarra) [8.46],"Th eGovernment with powers practically equal to those of any other government in Australia strikes out on a course of its own, and gets otit of step with those other governments. When this took place early in 1931, the Government and the party that I led, with one or two exceptions, Lang, and we have never swerved from the attitude we then took up. My party is in the same position now as it was then. honoured. It is not a question of what our views are regarding a certain alleged plan. It is not now a question of our antipathy to a declared policy of repudiation. That is not the issue between the Opposition ancl the Government. That matter may be raised by another section in this House, but not by my party. The issue is one as to methods, and I still disporting the present Government, who said approve of the methods adopted by the present Government. The feeling has been created in this country that two governments with great and equal powers, each commanding powers of force, if necessary, are at loggerheads, and there is sound reason for the belief that the feud is actuated on both sides by bitter political hatred. It is a great pity that a clash in administration between two governments should be caused in this way. Both governments have been flamboyant iu utterance and precipitate in their actions. I look with apprehension on what is taking place in New South Wales. Money is not everything. That financial obligations should be met and that interest which is due should be paid by the Government of a State is not our sole concern at this moment. I do not excuse that Government for failiug to meet its obligations, and passing on its responsibilities to other Australian governments. But over 400,000 men in this community are out of work, and many of them on the verge of starvation. We are living in an age when the governments of practically every country regard it as their first responsibility to refrain from doing anything that may create disturbances and precipitate disaster. We have been, particularly fortunate in Australia in avoiding trouble of this kind, and I pay tribute to Australia's manhood, aye, and to Australia's womanhood, for the fact that we have not had iu Australia disturbances such as have occurred in New Zealand, and in other parts of the world. drifting towards trouble for a long time. do not wish to utter a word to cause needless alarm or to create or accentuate any feeling of disquiet. I have unbounded faith in the good sense of the Australian people. But I do not like what is happening in New South Wales. The responsibility rests upon all our Australian governments, and particularly upon the members of this Government and of this Parliament to prevent'precipitate action. I know that Ministers, having taken one step, think that they must take another, and I cannot help feeling that their action iu this matter arises very largely from the wild promises made by candidates supthat if returned they would get rid of the Lang Government in a few weeks after the election. Had it not been for such utterances, this matter, I feel confident, would have been approached in a better way, and had the Commonwealth Government iu the early stages adopted a more reasonable attitude, it would probably have obtained more money to meet the obligations which it has incurred on behalf of the States than it is likely to get by proceeding along the lines proposed. The Prime Minister has told us that his government has not obtained sufficient from the banks in New South Wales to pay child endowment in that State for one hour. . the Government has received in the form of income taxation; but I suggest that the amount has been small. The Prime Minister will remember that some time ago I warned him that in endeavouring to collect an insignificant amount in the form of State income taxation he might be unable to collect Commonwealth taxation in New South Wales. That position has now arisen. I have not the slightest doubt that, ultimately the State of New South Wales will honour its obligations to the Commonwealth.",14,Speakeb Hon.

31,Mr Scullin,"I do not know whatin New South Wales. but ultimately the Government of New South Wales will honour its obligations. I have, however, very grave doubt whether the Commonwealth, will collect revenue from New South Wales as speedily as has been suggested. A good deal of political capital was made of the fact that five months elapsed between the Lang Government's first default last year, and the time when it agreed to honour its obligations as other governments were doing. As I pointed out at the time, for two months of that period the representatives of the Oommonwealth and the States were sitting in conference, trying to evolve a scheme to rehabilitate Australia's finances, and during which lime no definite action could be taken. The alleged delay by the previous Government, which covered a period of only three months, does not now seem so big, because the people see that three months have elapsed since the last default occurred, while this Government has been in office, and that the present drastic methods have not proved so expeditious as we were led to believe they would be, although they certainly have been very provocative. The Commonwealth Government has notified the State Government of New South Wales that on Monday next it will approach the High Court for'a ruling that this money is owing. Up to the present, the Commonwealth Government has no declaration from a court of law that the money is owing. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in reciting the legal position, said that the High Court has upheld the validity of the law, which this measure is to amend. That is true. Yet there is some justification for the attitude of those honourable members who doubted the validity of the legislation in that two eminent judges of the High Court held that the law is invalid. ing between the qualifications of the members of the High Court bench. I believe that those who dissented from the majority decision of the High Court possess qualifications equal to the others; but it is not for us to canvass those qualithat I yielded to the arguments of thos*' fications. The fact that a unanimous decision was not given supports the contention of those who expressed doubt, and shows that their opinions were not Avithout foundation. With other honourable members on this side of the chamber, I endeavoured, on a previous occasion, to set out the position. I said that before iiny action was taken the Government should have had a judgment of the High Court declaring that the money was owing. It is insufficient for any officer to declare that in his opinion, a ? certain sum of money is due and payable; a properly constituted legal tribunal should declare that such a sum is owing. Action has only recently been taken to obtain a judgment of the High Court, and in the meantime attempts have been made to attach the revenue of New South Wales. It is only six weeks ago-abou t the middle of March-sinc e the Government brought down legislation under which it proposed to attach certain revenues of New South Wales aggregating £G,000,000. To date, New South Wales has defaulted to the extent of something over £2,000,000. Already the Government has found it necessary to submit this amending measure in order to remove certain doubts, and to take further steps, although we were previously told that everything necessary had been done. We have been informed that the legislation previously passed has been held by the High Court to be valid; but before anything practical has been done in the direction of collecting revenues, new legislation is being introduced. The methods of this Government are supposed to be superior to those of the Government of which I was the leader. We were told that under its policy it would recover, in a few weeks, money which the previous Government could not obtain. Three months have elapsed since the New South Wales Government last defaulted, and how much has this Government recovered ? Very little. hdnorable member suggest? vious occasions the policy which I think the Government should have adopted. My suggestions met with sneers from honourable members opposite.

Last June, the Loan Council agreed to the payment of £500,000 to New South Wales, but that council did not agree to treasury-bills covering that amount being issued until the Premier of that State agreed to recognize his responsibilities, and to honour his obligations for interest and other commitments in common with other State Governments. When the Premier of New South Wales, as a member of .the Loan Council, agreed with the representatives of the other States to assist in the financial rehabilioccasioning concern to many public sertation of Australia, we accepted his undervants and .others in New South Wales. taking as bona fide. We were, however, criticized for treating the proposal with kid gloves, merely because we had some regard for those who were on the verge of starvation. Here is a Government that talks about using the iron hand; yet it was itself forced-and I .am not complaining of its action-notwithstandin g the default of New South Wales, and the fact that Commonwealth laws were defied by the Government of that State, to recognize the needs of the unemployed in New South Wales, and to .provide for their sustenance £600,000 out of money which will shortly be raised. It was easy for honourable members opposite to sneer at my .Government, and to say that we were supporting the Lang plan* hecause we looked beyond the plan, and the framers of the plan, to the needs of the people of New South Wales who were suffering. The present Commonwealth Governmeut has now been forced into tbe same position as any other government would be iu.. It is necessary to look ismerely seeking to recover the money beyond whatever .government is in power in New South Wales for the moment, and as a Parliament we must seek to do what is best in the interests of the people owed tliis money when, in February last, of Australia as a whole, uo matter in what State they happen to live. I believe that the action of the present Eederal Government, together with the deplorable stand taken by the Now South Wales Government, will inflict grave injury on the credit of the country, and great suffering on the people of New South Wales. I do not intend to make any excuses for supporting the bill now before tis. The bill contains three main provisions, with all of which I am in agreement. Clause2 statesNo fine, penalties, forfeiture or other disability shall be imposed upon the person by reason of the payment to tlie Treasurer or authorized person iu accordance witli this act or of the non-payment of the amount in question to the Statu. A further necessary amendment is designed to exempt from attachment trust funds that happen to be in the possession of banks, and standing in the name of the State Government. I am pleased that -this amendment is being made Avithout delay, because the act as it stood was Everybody will now know that there is nothing to fear in respect of such funds. The third principal amendment provides that the CommonAvealth Government shall have power to attach any State funds or -revenues Avhich may be required to meet the just claims of the Commonwealth against NeAv South Wales. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr -Scullin) said that on Monday next the CommonAvealth would proceed to the High Court for a declaration as to whether this money claimed is really OAving by New South Wales. Surely, hoAvever, everybody in Australia knows what the position is in regard to tliis money. They know that the Commonwealth bus -already paid the money in satisfaction of debts owed by New South Wales. There is not the slightest doubt as to the verdict Avhich the iffigh Court will give, and that is why Parliament gave the Government permission to go forward on the certificate of the Auditor-General. The Commonwealth which Avas paid to overseas bondholders on behalf of NeAv South Wales. Mr Lang himself admitted that New South Wales he said that he Avas prepared to pay a portion of it. He did not at that time dispute that the whole amount Avas OAving. If the Commonwealth Government now finds it necessary to attach further revenues in order to recoup itself for Avhati t has already paid aAvay, Parliament .should give it that power as soon as possible. Next year New South Wales will be called upon to pay £6,500,000 in Australia, and £8,500,000",16,Speakeb Hon. G H Mackay From The Government Of New South
38,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [4.2],"overseas. If she defaults in respect to the whole of that amount, and the Commonwealth takes no measures to secure the money from New South Wales, there will be a general default throughout the whole of Australia, beca.use the Commonwealth will not otherwise be able to find £15,000,000 outside of New South Wales revenues. Mr Lang has said that such a default is inevitable, and he is certainly doing his best to bring it about. He has already befouled the good name of New South Wales, and he is now trying to drag down with it the credit of Australia. The Country party will stand behind the Government in any action it takes to keep the credit of Australia high, and its reputation clean. It will be remembered that, when the original enforcement bill was before the House, I suggested that the schedule should enumerate all New South Wales revenues, so that there might be no delay in recovering tlie money due if obstacles should be placed in the way by the Government of New South Wales. An attempt is now being made by the Government of New South Wales to make it appear that ail the evils and misfortunes which have fallen upon the people of that State are due to the action of the Commonwealth Government in trying to collect the money due to it. Such a claim is absurd. Most of the misfortunes of New South Wales may be attributed to the fact that the Government of that State will not march in step with the other governments of the Commonwealth, which are endeavouring to honour their just obligations. It is necessary to live in New South Wales to understand the position which has developed there. A condition amounting almost to anarchy obtains. The banking institutions, which were established under State law, cannot now carry on ordinary financial activities for the Government. We find ourselves back under primitive conditions. The State Government is sending out men with leather bags full of money, accompanied by armed escorts, to pay the ordinary services in various parts of the State. Many public servants are not receiving payment at all. Surely there is no reason why the Government should not be able to pay for all ordinary services, including child endowment, when it has defaulted in respect of millions of pounds of overseas interest and is now defaulting in respect of millions of pounds of interest due to Australian investors. The New South Wales Government ought to be able to act most generously in regard to all the activities it ordinarily sustains, seeing that it has ceased to pay interest on the money it owes. It cannot blame the Commonwealth Government for its financial embarrassment; the blame rests entirely on its own head. Not only is the action of the Government of New South Wales bringing about a condition of anarchya sort of creeping paralysis of industrial and economic life in that State-bu t it is delaying the rehabilitation of Australia. Anything which the Commonwealth Government can do to bring to a speedy end the present regime in New South Wales will have the support of the Country party. Mr Lang has said that he desires to bring about a reduction of interest, especially on debts owed overseas. What, I ask, is the main obstacle in the way of securing a reduction of overseas interest? It is the repudiation by Mr Lang himself of his overseas interest obligations, his defiance of the policy of the Loan Council, and his departure from the standards of honesty that have been observed in this country for so many years. How can we place our New York and London stocks on anything like a decent basis that would permit a consolidation or conversion at cheaper rates while one State, which represents two-fifths of the population of the Commonwealth, and owes nearly half of the total State indebtedness, refuses to pay interest on -the money that it has borrowed to build what were described in the loan prospectuses as reproductive works? How can we fund our short-term indebtedness and get rid of that nightmare of the various governments of Australia, if the policy and the actions of Mr Lang and his government render impossible any improvement of the position of our stocks in the money markets of the world? I am satisfied that Mr Lang, by his actions, is preventing that restoration of confidence which is absolutely necessary if we are to effect a big consolidation of our overseas debts that carry a bigb rate of interest. for us even to initiate negotiations to that end. I am confident that, had theri been no talk of repudiation by the Government of New South Wales, had it stood up to its obligations and faced the crisis in a courageous and manly fashion, as other governments did, by now our interest rate would have been reduced by 1 per cent, or 1$ per cent on that portion of our debt which carries a high rate of interest. of such a reduction, and advocated it in this House long before Mr Lang raised the question. He and his party wish to take all the credit for whatever reduction of interest has been brought about within Australia. All that he did was to give effect to-the decision of the Premiers of the States, in conference assembled, last year Now he says, ""It is our policy; we thought of it first."" What he and his party thought of first was a refusal to pay anything. All. other governments in Australia were honestly prepared to deal with the matter on the basis of negotiation, and have done so. By its alliance with them, Mr regime to an end, and so enable the whole Lang's i Government from that policy. I am confident that our overseas indebtedness can be handled in a similar way if we can get rid of this cancer in New South Wales which at the present time is sucking the lifeblood of Australia. The policy and the action's of Mr Lang are definitely preventing the rehabilitation of Australia, and particularly the absorption of the unemployed. The first essential to that absorption is, not a governmental loan for the carrying out of some temporary work, but the restoration of confidence in the minds of private investors ancl private industry generally. At the present time there is operating in New South Wales the policy of terrorizing private industry by confiscatory taxation. made that there will be a capital levy, a tax of 5s. in the £l for the relief of unemployment, and other measures of a similar character. Already those threats have resulted in the transfer of capital from New South Wales to Victoria to the extent of many' millions of pounds, Dr. Earle Page. and the withdrawal of many more millions from active participation in He is making it impossible business ancl industry because investors dare not use the money for outside enterprises. Any action that may brine' to an early end this condition of affairs deserves well of Australia, and should receive the support of every member of this Parliament. I feel sure that it will have the support of every rightthinking man ancl woman in Australia, irrespective of their political opinions. The question arises, how can we bring I was in favour this matter to an end; what means are at our disposal ? Eor almost a year, in New South Wales, there has been the expectation that Mr Lang would go so far beyond the bounds of decency and so transgress the law, that the representative of His Majesty in that State would be forced to send him to the country. Nearly a year ago a petition containing 400,000 signatures made that request. At the present time, the people of .New South. Wales are hoping that he will overstep the mark in such a way that cognizance of his action must be taken by the Governor,, and that they will thus be given an opportunity to bring his has benefited of Australia to get on with its job. I hope that there will be an early election in New South Wales. I have not the slightest doubt what the result will be. I realize that all sorts of red herrings will be drawn across the trail. The Federal and other governments will be charged with cruelty and many other crimes against this particular State. But what is the use of talking about a lowering of the standard of living by the reduction of wages when hundreds of thousands of our people are receiving no wages at all! Surely our first concern is to restore our people to employment! That can be clone if all parties in this country will combine, as they did during the war, and say "" We are willing to suffer a certain degree of hardship The threat has been for a year or two if we can win to a future that will be worthwhile. We have had our spree; we have been extravagant; now we must pay the price."" We shall never regain prosperity by resorting to the monetary tricks or the criminal devices that have been suggested; that is generally recognized. If a general election in New South Wales is to be indefinitely postponed, the Commonwealth Government should take every step that is open to it to end the existing regime. Various country movements have made known their views; they have pointed out that, if eighteen Or 21 months are to elapse before Mr Lang faces the constituencies, they cannot see how New South ""Wales can. continue to exist. This Government has been asked by the country movements to endeavour to bring about a change in the Constitution that w ill permit the people themselves to have some say immediately in the division of that State; to pull the horse fro m under the Government if they cannot pull the Government off the horse. 1 am assured by the Government that earnest consideration is being given to tlie question of endeavouring to have incorporated in the Constitution those provisions to facilitate the division of existing States without reference to the State Parliaments but on the initiative of the people alone, which the Commission on the Constitution, over which Sir John Peden presided, suggested would be supported by every party i u Australia. These provisions received the unanimous support of the National party, Country party, and Labour party members of that commission. If that were done, the people of New South Wales would be in n position to deal with the Parliament of that State at the earliest possible moment and end this present r6gime. Last year, when the question of retude, but has also repudiated all its debts. pudiation was first raised in this HouseI t has no real money, nor facilities for by the action of the Lang Government, handling money, with, which to 'finance it will be remembered that I moved the the ordinary activities of New South adjournment of the House. I then urged Wales, and it is only a matter of that, the sooner we removed Mr Lang time"" when the Commonwealth w ill have from the position of being the only rcto take action to carry out the social, pudiator in Australia, the better it would and, possibly, the essential services of that be for Australia as a whole, and the State, otherwise the people w ill starve quicker we would get on with Australia's, because of the failure of the Lang Governreconstruction.

How and thus place ;:he honest portions of the is this National Parliament to deal with State in a position to stand up to their the position % We have a tremendous obligations. If New South Wales still responsibility placed upon us. refuses to pull its weight with the other Statesi t w ill not be possible for Australia to carry on for another eighteen months. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham), then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, saidSuppose a particular area of New South Wales, containing a population greater than that of some of the existing States, to be practically unanimous in its desire to form itself into a new State, and suppose that practically unanimous desire to arise from a definite infringement of tbe law by the Government of the State; and suppose tlie Parliament representing the whole of Australia to be also practically unanimous in its wish to give effect to the desire of the area concerned, then under those extraordinary aud exceptional circumstances, it would be certainly proper to consider the advisability of applying to the Imperial Government to exorcise its supreme legislative autliority. At the 1930 Imperial Conference it was expressly agreed by the governments of nil the dominions and the Government of Britain that Imperial legislation might properly be passed relating to any dominion at the request and with the consent of that dominion. That is a useful reserve power, and should, I believe, continue to exist, in normal circumstances no one would dream of suggesting the utilization of such a power, and it is only because of the present very exceptional circumstances that I suggest that the Government should at least consider the desirability of taking what I admit to be an extraordinary action to deal with an extraordinary situation. . . . I suggest that the Government should seriously consider tliis proposal. Those remarks have infinitely more weight now, because the position in New South Wales has since become indescribably worse. The Government of that State has not only adopted a defiant attiThe Lang GovernThe Government of New South Wales is absolutely blocking, any attempt to commence at an early date the rehabilitation of Australia. I am prepared to support-and I am speaking for the members of the party in this corner-an y action that the Commonwealth Government takes to bring to an end this dreadful position, which no one ever contemplated would exist between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales. opposed to this measure, which, I claim, has been introduced by the Government at the behest of the capitalists, regardless altogether of the suffering that will be brought about as a result of its passage. This legislation is not likely to relieve the did not participate in the rake-off. people of this country. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has stated that New South Wales will have defaulted by the end of June to the extent of approximately £5,000,000 in respect of its interest obligations to overseas bondholders. both internal and external obligations. amount includes exchange at the rate of approximately 25 per cent., although the Prime Minister did not make that clear in his statement. If the amount owing by New South Wales were recovered tomorrow, no relief would he. afforded this country, because it rertresents interest on our overseas debt incurred directly and indirectly on account of the war. theso interest obligations relates to the war. sions from Great Britain for the services which we rendered to that country when it engaged in a war in the making of which Australia had no voice. During the war this country sent overseas 300,000 men of whom' 62,000 paid the supreme sacrifice, and 72,000 were crippled. Our participation in the war cost us £744,000,000. Great Britain gave concessions to Italy and Erance by writing down their debts by approximately 62 per cent., and received concessions from the TJnited States of America in respect of her indebtedness to that country during the war. Great Britain received from the TJnited States of America money at 3^ per cent., a portion of which was re-loaned to Australia at 5 per cent. Britain charged us in respect of our war loan, a rate of interest lower than that at which money was borrowed from the United States of America. At present we are being charged no interest at all. the operation of the Hoover moratorium. In addition, Australia during the war sold its wool and wheat to Great Britain at a price considerably less than the prevailing rate. I believe that wheat which we sold to Great Britain at 4s. 6d. a bushel was resold to allied nations at 9s. a bushel. Australia pounds. ber for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has said, we lost millions of pounds in respect of the sale of our wheat during the war. To-day, although we are staggering under a colossal debt, Great Britain will not assist us to the extent to which it assisted some of its allies, and to the extent to which it was assisted by the United States of America. We have liad no concessions whatever from the Motherland. To-day there are in this country many people who are demanding that the Oommonwealth Government stand up for Australia by putting its case clearly and forcibly before the overseas bondholders. The claim, one penny of by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that he was one of the first to advocate negotiation with the bondholders overseas for a reduction of the interest rate, is most humorous. It is Mr Lang who has that distinction. Undoubtedly many people have been converted to his view, and I am pleased that the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) is now supporting at least a portion of the Lang plan. The right honourable member declared also that a state of anarchy exists in New South Wales. Such a condition does not exist yet, but apparently the Commonwealth Government desires to create it. The warning against the danger of anarchy and revolution comes strangely from the right honourable member for Cowper. He is an advocate of economy by the subdivision",17,Speakeb Hon.

Behind those remarks was a veiled threat of revolution if the Commonwealth Government did not pay heed to the demands of the new-staters. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) characterized Mr Lang as a dictator. He is not a dictator. He is merely expressing the will of the people of New South Wales, and, indeed, of Australia, and conare in need of sustenance, because they serving their interests, when he declares that those who through no fault of their own are unemployed and in need of the necessaries of life should be fed before interest is paid to overseas bondholders.

Mr Bavin, formerly Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, said that Mr Lang had no right to propose a negotiation for a reduction of the overseas interest debt"", because nothing would absolve him from that liability but a direct resolution of the Loan Council. We have to take a sane view of this matter. The people of Australia are honest, and desire to pay their way; so does Mr Lang. But our first obligation is to those who cannot get work or the wherewithal to buy the necesI saries of life for their women and children. The Commonwealth Government, however, has determined to seize the revenues of the State, and send them overseas for the benefit of wealthy bondfrankly tell him that I could not pay. holders. The interest of the money lenders -the modern representatives of the usurers whom the lowly Nazarene banished from the temple-mus t be paid though the poor starve! This is nothing more nor less than tlie worship of Mammon; it is not Christianity. The Commonwealth Government is prepared callously to take from little children and from women in delicate health-prospec tive mothers of Australian citizens-the wherewithal to buy food and clothing. Yet some honourable members who support that policy have the audacity to attend church services, and pretend to be Christians. There is no Christianity in giving to the wealthy at the expense of the poor. With much that was said by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) against this bill, I agree. He referred, to Mr Lang as being out of step with the other Australian Governments. That may be true, but Mr Lang is not out of harmony with the policy of the Australian Labour party, nor with the desires .of those who are denied the right to work. The present Commonwealth Government was elected on a promise to find employment. I have referred on previous occasions to the election placards, ""Vote for the United Australia party and secure for yourself a job at decent wages "". coming in time. is a post in London for the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) at £5,000 a year.

This amending bill is designed to tighten up the law and give assurances to those who are reluctant to pay State income tax into the Commonwealth Treasury.

Apparently, under the principal act, a State could take action against any person paying his State dues to the Federal Government, and, indeed, certain newspapers declared that such action would be taken. This clause is a counter move in the game of chess now in progress between the New South Wales Government and tlie Federal Government backed by all the other State governments, and, in all probability, it w ill be followed by another move by New South Wales. The position is humorous, although so tragic to the people of the State. Despite the laughter which is evoked on the Government benches whenever the people of that State are said to be content with the leadership of Mr Lang, I can say that I have never seen a more remarkable demonstration of appreciation to any State Premier or Federal Prime Minister, or overseas visitor, including members of the royal family, than was shown to Mr Lang on Thursday night last. fines. course blocked the whole of the traffic from Bathurst-street practically to Park-street, and down the side streets.

It is regrettable that, in this period of depression, the country is not united.

66,Mr Paterson,"I hope that it willNow let me deal with the way in which the State of New South ""Wales has incurred its debts. Only recently the magnificent Sydney Harbour Bridge was completed. It cost approximately £10,000,000. On the underground and suburban railways and their electrification, New South Wales has expended no less a sum than £33,000,000, making a total of £43,000,000 for those three items alone. lines similar to that of our internal debt. The pretentious building which housed the State Government Savings Bank of New South Wales cost over £1,000,000. Unfortunately, that institution was compelled to close its doors during the regime of Mr Lang, of whom the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) appears to be so ardent an admirer. Various governments of New South Wales have expended money in many d'irections, in some instances prodigally, in others on railways, water conservation, and like schemes which tend to increase the possibilities of production holders, many of whom are minor in the State. Money has been borrowed -from the people in the Motherland in order that the State might be enriched. Now the representative Government of New South Wales refuses to pay its interest commitments in respect of that money. The honourable member for Hunter described the overseas people from whom New South Wales has borrowed as wealthy foreign money Jews. I remind honourable members that, because for so long Australia has preserved its financial integrity by meeting its obligations, the British Government conferred upon this country the incomparable advantage of having its bonds placed upon the trustee stocks list. Because of that, trustee companies, friendly societies, tralian bondholders are of mature years, and other similar organizations, which will not put moneys entrusted to their care into an ordinary investment, have been encouraged to invest in Australian securities, regarding them as gilt-edged. An investigation reveals that the average amount of interest that has been paid to the average bondholder in Great Britain from Australian securities is less than £50 per annum. Will any one suggest that such persons are wealthy individuals, whose income from this source could be written off without harm to them? Mr Paterson. ber in favour of reducing the rate of interest paid to those people? may be possible, as the result of action which may be taken iu Great Britain, to bring about at a lower rate of interest a consolidation of our overseas debts on At the same time. I point out that it is not within the competence of this or any other Parliament in ' Australia to pass legislation reducing the rate of interestto be paid on'overseas commitments; the consent of the investors concerned must be obtained for any alteration of the conditions of the loans. The borrowing of the money was not a transaction between the Government of this country and the Government of Great Britain. In the main our overseas commitments are to individual bondinvestors who supplement their small earnings by this average income of £50 per annum from Australian bonds. Further, a number of them are aged, with no other income than that received from this source. It is the commitments due to such people that the Government of New South Wales desires to repudiate. That State has also defaulted in respect of its internal bondholders, notwithstanding the fact, that within the past twelve mouths, the Commonwealth Parliament lenders-rich has enacted legislation which reduced the rate of interest on internal bonds by over 22$ per cent., to an average of approximately 4 per cent. method, that was the result. Many Auswith incomes amounting to less than £.100 per annum, sometimes below that enjoyed by a man and his wife who draw the old-age pension. Those are some of the people whom the Commonwealth Government is stepping in to protect, as it is in honour bound to do, and on whose. behalf it has met the commitments of the Government of New South Wales.

We should attempt to l if t our credit to a point which will re-establish our financial integrity, and thus encourage overseas investors to put their money into private enterprises m the Commonwealth. A young country like Australia can develop only hy additions to its capital, and the best additions are those which go into private enterprises. I should like to ask the honourable member for Hunter and his colleagues what prospects there are of encouraging the flow of money from overseas to develop this young country if we refuse to pay investors abroad the interest that is their duel If the Commonwealth Government did not step in and meet the commitments which the Premier of New South Wales refuses to meet, we could not expect one additional halfpenny to our national capital from overseas. Instead, we could be certain of the total destruction of our credit, with the result that our unemployment problem would be infinitely greater than it now is, Dur financial rehabilitation would be alarmingly delayed, and the future generally would indeed be black. If we desire to place the reputation of Australia on a higher plane, we must pay our debts. That is why the Commonwealth Government is accepting the responsibility of paying on behalf of the Government of New South Wales what that Administration is in honour bound to pay. However, this Government indefinitely. This afternoon the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) reminded us that while the default of the Government of New South Wales was a little over £900,000 in February of this year, it will be approximately £5,700,000 by the 30th June next, the end of the financial year; that is after deducting the sum of £250,000 a month, which the Commonwealth Government has to pay the Government of New South Wales under the terms of the Financial Agreement. One can visualize what would be the result in another twelve or eighteen months if the default were allowed to continue, while we waited for the ordinary processes of the law to take their course. able member mean by the "" ordinary processes of the law "" ?

Commonwealth collected by enforcing the act? sure, but I hope that by means of this amending legislation it will collect a good deal more, and with much greater rapidity than has been the case in the past. This is not merely a fight between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales, it is an attempt to obtain justice on behalf of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the other five States, against the defaulting State of New South Wales, which is endeavouring to drag everybody into the abyss into which it has deliberately slipped. I shall support this legislation, and I hope that it will have the effect which the Government desires. propose to vote against the second reading of this bill, and also against the other stages of the measure. I shall do so because I consider that the position as between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales has degenerated into a political dogfight. Ever since the assumption of office by the present Commonwealth Government this business has cannot continue doing so been permeated with the taint of politics. There could be no misconception, in the minds of the people of New South Wales, or of the members of this Parliament, concerning the intention of the Scullin Government. Its proposals to deal with the situation as it then existed were definite and well understood, but because they were not sufficiently bloodthirsty or spectacular, they were condemned, not only by members supporting the present Government, but also by every anti-labour newspaper, and by every nationalist and country party organization throughout the Commonwealth.

With them the paramount consideration was not so much the payment of its debts by the State as the extinction of the Lang Government. Now, in pursuance of that intention, we have this political ramp in the form of the bill under consideration. I believe that the measure is essentially political; that the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and his followers have not the slightest compunction as to its consequences, or whom it may hurt so long as they ""get"" the Premier of New South Wales. To this end they Eave been working since before the last federal election with Mr Stevens, the present Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, and earlier with Mr Ravin and the Nationalist and Country parties throughout New South Wales.

That legislation was passed in such a haphazard manner that almost before the ink was dry, further amendments were found to be necessary. Yet, as I have said, notwithstanding all these excursions and alarms nothing much has yet resulted. Equally hysterical in this matter is the right honourable member for Cowper (.Dr. Earle Page) who has been inciting those people of New South Wales whose views are in accord with his own to take certain action. After venting his political spleen on a certain section of the people in that State, the right honourable gentleman introduces his King Charles's head, in the shape of the subdivision of the State of New South Wales, and offers that as a cure for the present difficulty.

If the right honourable gentleman was really expressing the views of the Government, and let the ""cat out of the bag"" after conversations with members of the Cabinet, I think that honourable members and the people generally, are entitled to know just how far this Ministry is prepared to go in its political dog-fight with the Premier of New South Wales. orable member put words into my mouth?

The Premiers Conference a week or two ago discussed proposals to give political preference to one government and impose penalties on another. Ostensibly the purpose wa.s to compel the Premier of New South Wales to fall into line with the Commonwealth's proposals, but really the intention was to bring about the defeat of the State Government, with a view to securing control by political parties supporting the present Commonwealth Government.

At that time it was heralded as an effective measure to deal with the New South Wales Government, notwithstanding that the warning had been issued by honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber that no self-respecting State Government would stand aside and allow its revenues to be raided by the Commonwealth Government, or permit its functions to be usurped by another authority. Government has, in the interests of people of that State, successfully resisted i by every possible manoeuvre, and every force at its command, all the efforts of the Commonwealth Government to raid the State treasury. So successful has it been in this direction that the Commonwealth Government has now found it necessary to introduce this amending bill to tighten up the provisions of the original act. We were told when the original bill was introduced that time was of the essence of the contract, and that the ordinary legal procedure in this country for the recovery of debts was too slow for this Government; but the efforts which it has made to speed up the process of recovery have entirely failed. enforcement bill was before us the extent of the default by the New South Wales Government was £900,000, but so ineffective have been the measures adopted by the Commonwealth Government to recover this amount that the default has now grown to £2,000,000. The Prime Minister has failed in his duty to this House in not divulging the amount which the Commonwealth has recovered from the revenues of New South Wales. Dr. amount ? neither does the right honourable member, although such knowledge is necessary to enable us to take an intelligent part in this debate. We should have been told of the exact nnancial result of the efforts which the Government has already made to seize State revenues. The Prime Minister should have taken us fully into his confidence in this respect. The plain fact is that all the efforts which this Government has made to seize State revenue have been frustrated by the New South Wales Government, and, in sheer desperation, the Commonwealth Government has, in my opinion illegally, seized Government deposits lying in certain banks in New South Wales. We know very well that much of the money that has been so seized was obtained from revenues not prescribed in any proclamation at the time of its seizure. The Commonwealth Government has, therefore, exceeded its legal rights in this respect. It has been The New South Wales forced into such a desperate position that it has indiscriminately seized State moneys wherever and whenever it has been able to do so. We have to face the fact, even though it may be unpalatable for some honourable members opposite, that this country, like other countries in the world, must review its financial position. We know very well that Australia, like many other countries, has been placed in an unfortunate and utterly impossible financial position. I contend that this country is entitled to the same consideration from Great Britain as foreign countries have received from her in the adjustment of debts. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) made a plea for the When the original holders of Australian stocks who reside in Great Britain, but he had to admit that we were still paying 6 per cent, for money which we had borrowed from Britain for war purposes. of the kind. gentleman must know very well that the money which we are paying to Great Britain under a 6 per cent, contract is being paid to.

Yet, if a man dares to stand up in public and assert that Australia is entitled to the same consideration from Great Britain as she gives to foreign countries, he is howled down as a repudiator. The right honourable member for Gowper (Dr. Earle Page) told us that he has always been iu favour of a reduction in interest rates on overseas debts, but his statement to that effect this afternoon was the first of the kind that I or any member of any other political party had ever heard from him.

86,Mr Rosevear,"The honorablethe Premier of New South Wales fifteen months ago when he first enunciated what is now known as the Lang plan. Those opposed to Mr Lang at the Premiers Conference at that time adopted an alternative scheme, which they said would correct our ills. The Commonwealth and State Governments, apart from the New South Wales Government, have been experimenting with that alternative, which is known as the Premiers plan, for fifteen months, and only last week, at the Premiers Conference, they had to"" admit that, as it stood, it had been a failure. They said then that the only hope for recovery for Australia was for her people to make additional sacrifices of the kind which have already been demanded, principally from the people least able to make them. It is true that the Premiers plan has effected certain economies in regard to our internal national debt. logical action for the Government to take would be to call upon overseas bondholders to make a sacrifice similar to that which has been made by the Australian bondholders; but any one who dares to make such a suggestion is called a repudiationist. If a certain sacrifice can be required from our local bondholders, I can see no reason why a similar sacrifice cannot be required from those who hold Australian stocks to the value of £560,000,000 on the other side of the world. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) said that the Commonwealth Government could not call upon overseas bondholders to make such a sacrifice, because of the action taken by the New South Wales Government. He also observed that the New South Wales Government had made it impassible for the Commonwealth Government to negotiate with overseas bondholders. I challenge the Commonwealth Government to refute my statement that it has never been in favour of asking foreign bondholders to make a sacrifice similar to that made by local bondholders. It has always shelved this issue, and endeavoured to throw the blame hack on to Mr Lang. Yeti f the Lang Government were removed from office tomorrow, the position would remain as it is. If this Commonwealth Government had had its way, the recent Premiers Conference would have agreed to a further attempt towards the solution of our pi^esent difficulties, which would have made the position infinitely worse than it is to-day, for the Premiers were invited by the Commonwealth Government to agree to the enforcement in Australia of conditions which would have reduced our workers to the level of coolies, and this would have been done solely to satisfy the demands of foreign bondholders. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) is, I admit, good at figures; figures, it is said, do not lie; but sometimes the compilers of figures are not as careful in their work as they might be. The honourable gentleman, for instance, said that the average amount received by British holders of Australian stock was only £50 per annum. No doubt in arriving at that figure the honourable gentleman massed in one total That being so, the all the individual shareholders in life assurance companies which hold bonds, all the members of friendly societies who hold bonds, and all the individual bondholders. By this process, he was able to ' get such a huge number ofstock holders that the calculation showed that the average income of each from Australian sources was only £50. But such juggling with figures will not get us anywhere. The honourable member ought to have told us the exact means by which he arrived at his finding. While all this furore is going on, we are told that the credit of Australia and of all the States is being damaged. It has been said that as long as New South Wales fails to meet her interest commitments, we shall be unable to borrow money. One honourable gentleman asked how we could hope to borrow money abroad if we did not pay our debts. Let me remind the House that the capitalists of Great Britain and France are squabbling greedily among themselves for the right to invest their money in Russia, although Russia has repudiated her debts to the extent of £960,000,000, and owes to Great Britain alone on moneys borrowed from her both before and during the war no less a sum than £260,000,000. In spite of this fact, the British Government did not seize the Russian wheat which was shipped to Great Britain and sold there for Is. per bushel, while the wlieat of the Australian farmers was left rotting at our railway sidings. We know very well that machinery manufacturers of Great Britain were quite prepared to send their products to Russia in order to enable that country to adhere to her 5-year plan, notwithstanding that the avowed object of tliat plan was to wreck the social system of every other country of the world. It cannot be denied that whether a country has repudiated its debts or not, the investors of other countries are quite ready to lend it their money or trade with it if lucrative rates of interest are offered. What becomes of the argument, therefore, that because the New South Wales Government has repudiated its obligations to bondholders it is impossible to borrow money? South Wales has taken this action, the other States and the Commonwealth are not able to borrow, aud the financial position of the country has become chaotic, is only additional evidence that the other States and the Commonwealtli have been carried on the back of New South Wales for many years past. It has been said that unless the New actions of the Governments of France, South Wales Government is prepared to Italy; and Belgium? I remind him that join the Commonwealth Government and those countries had their international the other State Governments in their debts adjusted only when they said "" Thai financial rehabilitation plan, the financial is all we are prepared to pay; not a penny structure of Australia will collapse; but more"". It has been said that neither that argument cannot be substantiated. here nor in Great Britain can Ave This was shown by the happenings at the legislate to reduce the interest on recent Premiers Conference. trumpeted forth from that conference that do in that connection is to negotiate if all the States would accept a new with Premiers plan, or a second instalment countries. If they are not prepared to of the original plan, the Commonwealth negotiate, the only thing left for us to Government would be prepared to raise do is to follow the example of France, a loan of £10,000,000 for the relief of Italy and Belgium, in Avhich case Ave unemployment.

Honourable members opposite laugh, but they will find it difficult to give a different explanation. To say the least, it is significant that the amount proposed to be raised fell conadopting a policy of alleged repudiation, Mr Rosevear. siderably as soon as Mr Lang left the conference. Later, when the Victorian Government also refused to accept the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, it became doubtful whether even £3,000,000 could be obtained. The happenings at the Premiers Conference make it clear that the other States, even in these times of depressed finances, are living on the credit and assets of New South Wales. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) said this afternoon that Australia cannot emerge from its financial difficulties so long as the assets of New South Wales arc severed from those of the rest of the Commonwealth. Of what value aro the assets of New South Walesi f that State, as has The fact that because New been alleged, has no credit?

90,Mr Rosevear,"Should the timeCowper, be tbe first to claim to be tbe originators in Australia of tlie proposal to reduce international interest rates. Even the Prime Minister himself has admitted that the legislation which this bill seeks to amend has failed. The honourable geutleman said that, even were the Commonwealth to receive all the revenue that is covered by the various regulations which have been gazetted, the position would be that by the end of June next New South Wales would have repudiated to the extent of £5,000,000 more than that amount. The right honourable member for Cowperalso said that he was not in favour of financial juggling. It is well known that he was not a success as a juggler of finances. Even a fellowMinister in the Bruce-Page Government once described him as ""Australia's mo3t tragic Treasurer"". Although the right honourable gentleman does not favour juggling with the finances, he is not averse from increasing the exchange rate against Austrulia. It is strange that durNew South Wales will evolve some means ing this debate the exchange rate has not previously been mentioned, although of the sura of about £920,000 originally claimed by the Commonwealth from New South Wales, £240,000 exchange. The right honourable gentleman would further increase the exchange rate against Australia, and, as a consequence, the burden of debt as a means of enabling us to meet our obligations! Honourable members opposite say that the policy of the Lang Government, if persisted in, is likely to bring about, the downfall of Australia, and they urge that -an appeal to the electors of New South Wales should be made. In my opinion, an election in that State would not alter the existing position, notwithstanding that the opponents of Mr Lang claim that his removal from office would put everything right. But what would be the position if the Lang Government were returned with a majority? The silence on the Government side is most noticeable. that. able member for Barton( Mr Lane) agree that the endorsement by the people of New South Wales of the Lang policy hy a return of the Lang Government should automatically bring about the [21 resignation of the present Federal Government? Lang Government would brand the electors of New South Wales with the same mark of dishonesty that is now associated with the Government of that State. a problem which neither an election in New South Wales, nor legislation of thh character can solve; and, therefore, it seems logical that the Federal Government, instead of fighting the Government of New South Wales, should be prepared to meet that Government at least half way in an attempt to effect a settlement of the difficulties which now divide them. No good whatever can come of this legislation. Almost before the ink on this amending bill is dry, the Government of of defeating the Federal Government. That will probably mean the introduction of further legislation to overcome those difficulties; and so the fight will continue represented ad infinitum. Undoubtedly, New South Wales failed to meet its interest commitments abroad. of New South Wales has, it is true, been charged with repudiating its liabilities in Australia; but we' must remember that that Government faithfully carried out its obligations to the local bondholders until the Commonwealth Government so harassed it that that was no longer possible. The Federal Government aud its supporters must accept their share of the responsibility for New South Wales not meeting its obligations to the -local bondholders. Notwithstanding the present attempt to tighten-up the existing legislation directed against New South Wales, the Government of that State will find some loophole in it. It. is strange that honourable members oor>osite appear to have little or no knowledge of the amount of revenue which the coercive legislation of the CommonAvealth has diverted from the Treasury of New South Wales to that of the Commonwealth.

In considering tlie measure we have to decide whether or not it is necessary that the Commonwealth should recover from New South Wales the money paid hy it on behalf of that State. Before proceeding to discuss that question, I desire to say a word or two in reply to statements made during this debate. right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), speaking with one voice, made it clear that the attitude of the Opposition to this measure had been carefully considered. They were non-committal, and contributed nothing of value to the debate. course agreed upon between those honourable"" gentlemen, and, no doubt, by the whole of their party, is to endeavour to make this matter appear to be, to use the words of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), "" a political dogfight."" I suggest that this is unworthy of the official Opposition, having regard to the fact that we are now dealing with one of the gravest problems with which this Parliament has ever been confronted. I shall leave their remarks at that. The leader of the Country party (Dr. which there have been arrangements made Earle Page), and the honourable member between different countries. An absolute for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) both moratorium has been declared, during treated this subject with the seriousness which there is a cessation of all interest which it demands, and stated that they payments on war debts. By that, Great and their party are prepared to support the Government in its present action. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) made a bitter attack on me, attributing utter impropriety to all my actions and motives, but the only comment that of the honorable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), is that the opinions expressed by those honourable members on (Flinders-Assistant the issue before the House are tragically wrong, and their adoption by the people' of Australia would inevitably result in disaster to this country. The honourable member for Hunter defended the dishonourable and disgraceful actions of the Government of New South Wales. He tried to extenuate them by saying that they have been taken to benefit widows and orphans, and to relieve the poor and suffering in the State of New South Wales. Yet, if the facts are examined, it must be seen that the Government of New South Wales is bringing more and more trouble upon the very persons whom, I have no doubt, the honourable member sincerely desires to help and protect. The honourable member is gravely misinformed on many points. He and the honourable member for Dalley reiterated the opinion that, if Australia defaulted, The it would be doing merely what has been done already by other countries; that, indeed, it would be almost a courageous act for Australia to follow their lead. No doubt they draw their inspiration from the speeches of Mr Lang, who, notwithstanding the constant repetition of his statements, knows perfectly well that what The he is saying is absolutely untrue, and is deliberately attempting to deceive the people. The other day he told the public of Australia that the attitude of the New South Wales Government was analogous to that of Great Britain, and he said that, if he was to be condemned, so should Mr Ramsay MacDonald. That statement was absolutely false. Australia is in exactly the same position as Great Britain with regard to what relief from interest payments is now being experienced. That relief applies only to war debts, regarding",32,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore
99,Mr Bruce,"Britain has certainly benefited, and so has Australia. At the present time this country is not paying one penny of interest on the amount of its war debt due to the British Government. Let us consider the class of debts that are meet obligations totalling £2,730,000. As now being repudiated by the Lang Government. The arrangements for the suspension of interest payments and for the reduction of indebtedness to which I have referred have been made between governments; they apply to debts owed by one government to another. But in no case has Great Britain refused to meet her obligations to her own bondholders, to whom she is paying interest in full on the thousands of millions of pounds borrowed for war purposes. Not one farthing of the indebtedness due to her own people has been repudiated by Britain, nor has she taken any dishonourable action with regard to it. Government, on the other hand, has refused, to pay interest on money advanced for the purpose of carrying on public works in that State. That money is not owing to rich capitalists or persons of great means, but to the very class which the honourable member for Hunter desires to protect. Does the honourable member realize that the number of bondholders in Great Britain who hold Australian securities is about 500,000, and that the amount of interest drawn by them averages about £50 per annum? those are the persons who are described by honourable members opposite as "" bloodsucking Shylocks"" to whom we should refuse to pay interest! The charge was. made by the honourable member for Hunter that the brutal tyranny exercised by the Commonwealth Government in getting this legislation passed through this Parliament is forcing Mr Lang to cease from doing those things on which he has set much at heart; that we have made it impossible for Mr Langto continue the payments to widows and orphans and to maintain all the other social services that have been provided in the past in New South Wales. member truly believes' that the action of the Commonwealth Government has caused the present situation in New South Wales, but that is contrary to the facts. Mr Lang ought to be in a better position to meet the cost of those social services than he would have been in in ordinary circumstances, because the figures quoted by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) show that, since the end of January, when the default began, Mr Lang has failed to a set-off the Commonwealth Government has retained £505,000; therefore, Mr Lang is £2,225,000 better off than he would have been had he paid his debts, and should be in a position to meet those obligations which, he says, we ' are preventing him from paying. The fact is gradually being disclosed that he has beeu deceiving the people. He has been talking of building up a fund to pay child endowment in New South Wales, but it is now proved that that fund is bankrupt and rotten to the core. This is due, not to any action of the Commonwealth Government, but to the position into which The New South Wales Mr Lang has brought New South Wales. His difficulty in meeting his obligations with respect to social services is attributable solely to the condition into which New South Wales has drifted since he assumed office. The question to which we must address our minds is whether it is possible to obtain the reduction of our overseas interest by negotiation. Many people seem to be unaware that the difficulty of bringing this about by negotiation is inYet superable. It is suggested that we should, by negotiation, induce those persons overseas, who hold Australian securities, to agree to the reduction of interest in the same manner as the bondholders in Australia voluntarily, and with amazing patriotism, agreed to convert our internal debt to a lower rate of interest. I would remind the House that to enable effect to be given to the desire of those Australian bondholders who wished to 'help their country in its hour of need, it was necessary to pass through every State Parliament an act empowering trustees to convert such stock as they held, and it is, of course, impossible for us to pass such legislation with respect to the holders of No doubt the honourable bonds contracted for overseas. It is almost certain that the great majority of the stocks held overseas is trustee stock, held on behalf of beneficiaries, and the trustees of such stock have no power to agree to any alteration of the contracts concerning it. As for attempting to negotiate with overseas bondholders, I would say that there is nobody who represents them, or could speak for them. There is a committee of foreign bondholders, but it represents only the interests of stockholders as a whole, in sent pressing upon debtor countriesa cases of default, when it does its best to recover something for those whom it represents; there is no organization with whom negotiations could be carried on regarding the rate of interest on Australian overseas debts. Therefore, we would have to negotiate with the bondholders individually. We should then find that half of them are trustees, who could not, even if they wished to do so, make any concession. And all the time, Australia's credit would be getting lower and -lower. In the last-few clays, Australian stocks have slumped badly in London owing to Mr Lang's declaration at the recent Premiers Conference. Since the 21st March, our leading stocks have fallen more Hhan 10 per cent. Australian 5 per cents, have fallen from over £90 to about £80. The drop would be much greater if we tried to negotiate in London under impossible circumstances to bring about a reduction of our interest there. The idea is impracticable, and the public should know it. I turn now to the question how a reduction of our interest may be possible,. Everybody realizes that a reduction debts are in n class apart. hope that the present moratorium will be continued, and that if we do not have a final settlement at the Conference on Reparations and War Debts, which is to be held in June, at least the present arrangement will be continued. As to our ordinary debts, every thinking person realizes that the burden of debtor countries has become almost intolerable, owing to the terrific fall in commodity world prices. Fortunately, in many respects, Australia is not the only debtor country. The debtor countries are in the majority, and, owing to the world position, it is now a matter of concern to the creditor countries that something should be done to ease the position of tbe debtor countries the policy of reducing interest ratesand to assist them to prosperity. satisfactory conclusion can be reached only by a great international movement Mr Bruce. for the proper handling of war debts, and for putting the world's finances on an improved basis. Silting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. burden made heavier by the prevailing low level of commodity prices-coul d be eased by the general reduction of interest rates, it would benefit, not only the debtor countries, but the creditor countries as well. There are, however, difficulties in the. way of this. It has been suggested that a period of low interest rates might be brought about by international agreement. That would enable huge conversions of the debts owed by various coun-' tries to be made on the basis of reduced interest rates. It is evident that the benefit which could be derived by each debtor country from any such action would depend upon the level at which its credit stood in the eyes of the world. Australia's object to-day should be the improvement of her credit by every possible means; so that when a suitable opportunity occurs, our credits being good, we shall be able to convert some of our debts at a lower rate of interest. I use the word "" some "" advisedly, because there is considerable misunderstanding in many quarters about the rates of interest charged on Australia's indebtedness. Those who glibly discuss this matter talk as if Australia's chief aim is desirable. Our war should be to get the interest rate on all We her debts reduced, whereas Australia has in the past borrowed a great deal of money at cheap rates, that is to say, at rates lower than any at which we could reasonably hope to convert. It is the higher interest-bearing securities that we require to convert. Our total external indebtedness is just short of £600,000,000. Of that we have borrowed £97,000,000 at rates less than 4 per cent.; £166,000,000 at 4 per cent., or under 5 per cent.; £237,000,000 at 5 per cent.; and £98,000,000 at .over 5 per cent. It is only in respect of those securities bearing the higher rates of interest that we could expect to negotiate profitable conversions. Even Mr Lang, that apostle of A when in his more respectable moods, and not declaring straight out repudiationhas never suggested that interest rates",33,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore

102,Mr Bruce,"Government intends to press forward with its action under the Einancial Agreements Enforcement Act. We are now asking Parliament to amend the act so as to increase the power of the Government. The Prime Minister has said that he will take all requisite steps to make the State of New South Wales honour its obligations. Mr E. J. HARBISON -The Government of New South Wales. Government of New South Wales. If we examine the situation, we shall see that it is absolutely necessary that New South Wales shall pay the interest owing on its own debts, and honour its obligations, unless Australia as a whole is to fail to meet her obligations, and defaults on her interest payments. If New South Wales, the biggest and richest of the States, conployed. In such circumstances, it is certaining two-fifths of the population of the whole Commonwealth, persists in the attitude that she will not pay interest on her indebtedness will not, but that she cannot. member that, when his leader first defaulted, his declaration was "" I won't."" Only recently has he changed his cry to "" I can't."" If this powerful State of New South Wales will not bear its own burden, the rest of Australia must do so for her, or allow Australia to default. Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania will all have to carry heavier burdens because the biggest and richest of the States chooses not to pay what she has contracted to pay. Over any long period tliis burden would become too great for the rest of Australia to bear, and the Commonwealth would have no alternative'but to default. Some persons talk lightly of default, but have they ever considered what that would mean to Australia? To-day, the supporters of the Lang plan say that they intend to keep every social service at the existing level; but they have forgotten that les3 than twelve months ago Mr then be no funds from which to pay social Lang himself attended a conference in Melbourne, and subscribed to the Premiers plan, because he agreed with the other Australian Premiers, and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, that unless some such plan were given effect Australia could not pay more than 12s. in the £1 in respect of any of its commitments, including old-age pensions, child endowment, sustenance for the unemployed, and every otlier social activity in the community. Less than twelve months have passed since Mr Lang, who is blindly supported by the advocates of the Lang .plan, admitted that Australia had come to such a pass that unless drastic action were taken the inevitable result would be government payments on the basis of 12s. in the £1. Yet, to-day, these people are saying that we ought to default, and that we are at liberty to disregard osr financial obligations altogether so long as the people of New South Wales are allowed to enjoy their present social benefits, such as child endowment, widows pensions, and sustenance for the unemtain that within a limited period we would reach a pass when it would be a question of the payment of not 12s. in the £1, but a mere pittance to those who to-day are benefiting by the social services of this country. What would it mean to Australia if we were to default? There would be, in the first instance, an immediate flight of capital from this country. Those persons who could realize on their assets would send their money elsewhere to prevent a Avorse catastrophe befalling them. The supply of London funds of sterling to buy the Australian £1 would be dried up, and the immediate effect would be a tremendous raising of the exchange. The value of the Australian £1 would drop against sterling, and that would bring about the very result which has been objected to this afternoon, when it was pointed out that the raising of the exchange increases the burden on budgets. The exchange would be increased, not by 5 per cent, or 10 per cent., but by 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and even more, and the burden on budgets would become absolutely unbearable, so that we could not raise revenues to meet it. There would services. Our obligations would, have increased, and our revenues would have dropped because of diminished production.

105,Mr Bruce,"I remind the honorablerealize, notwithstanding the trials and tribulations' through which we are passing. happen if the Lang plan is given effect in Australia. It is time, therefore, that the Australian people rose up i u their wrath, and destroyed the advocates of the Lang plan, which if followed must force Australia along the path to dishonour and disaster. It is tragic that we should have in Australia persons who advocate such a plan, persons who aro misleading the people into thinking that they would be benefited by its operation.. Australia is probably the only country in the world which has an actual chance of returning to prosperity within a reasonable period of time. If , by means of an international effort, the general price levels of commodities were raised, and we in Australia had kept our currency upon a proper basis, holding the position as at present, no one could calculate the immediate benefit to Australia; tlie reaction would be probably the most marvellous experienced by any country in the world. We must remember that Australia to-day is better equipped than it has been at any other time in its histo'ry to take advantage of a revival in world prices. These hard times, if they have done nothing else, have caused us to be better equipped to take advantage of any benefit that may come in our direction. That opportunity will not long be postponed. The Prime Minister( Mr been made on behalf of those governments, Lyons) said this afternoon that if we can only hold this nation steady for another year or two there is not the slightest doubt that we shall emerge triumphantly from our difficulties. Surelyi t is worth the while of the people of Australia to make every conceivable effort to reach that goala goal which is not very far ahead. During the war, we showed that we were a people who when faced with adversity would stand fast and firm. At that time we had troubles to face similar to those which are operating to-da.y. As the war dragged on, and the pressure became greater, those of little heart in the community contended that we should refuse to send more troops, and should negotiate forthwith for peace; they were prepared to end tlie war at any price. But the more courageous stood fast. We saw the war through, and Australia emerged from it with its name, its prestige, and its reputation enhanced. ToThat is inevitably what must day, in a time of peace, we are experiencing a similar period of trial and tribulation, and' again there are among us timorous souls who advocate that we as a nation should follow the dishonourable course, so that some immediate relief may be given to the community generally. I believe that the people of this nation will again stand fast and firm, and will refuse to accept the opinions and doctrines of these counsellors of cowardice which would lead us to destruction. There is an obligation upon us all to do everything possible to hold the nation firm. For that reason, whatever it may mean, we must take action against the Government of New South Wales and the Premier of that State, to compel them to stand to their obligations, and to prevent them from bringing on. Australia ruin and chaos, which is what would inevitably be the effect of the adoption of the Lang plan. member, representing an electorate of New South Wales, I support this bill to amend the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act. I propose not to traverse the ground covered by previous speakers, but to refer to one or two matters of more than passing interest and importance. Certain accusations have been made in this chamber against various governments of New South Wales, and certain claims have particularly the present Government. When discussing the difficulties associated with the collection of revenues to meet the obligations of New South Wales, various speakers, including the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), have repeatedly stated that the present Premier of New South Wales was the originator of a scheme to bring about a reduction in interest rates to enable that State to meet its commitments. I say definitely that from the clay Mr Lang took office in New South Wales it became more and more difficult for him to arrange for financial accommodation; but, fortunately for his Government, the previous State Government had completed financial arrangements which enabled Mr Lang to carry on the government of that 'State for a period of five months.",37,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore

If a government cannot produce reasonable credentials it is useless for it to seek cheap money. When the Lang Government took office it could make no satisfactory financial arrangements with oversea money lenders. the Loan Council. vious State government was able to arrange for financial accommodation, yet so soon as the Lang Government took office no money was to be had at any price. It may be necessary for the people of New South Wales to make some small sacrifice to enable the Government of that State to meet its financial obligations. The people would raise no objection to that, knowing that by making a small sacrifice at this stage they will avoid a' greater sacrifice later. Some honourable members have made a special plea on behalf of the starving children, the widows and the sick, the destitute, and the unemployed; but while there is in New South Wales a large number of unemployed whose requirements have to be met, at the same time tliere is in that State a government which is encouraging imposition upon charity. person who was in receipt of a salary of £5 a week and expenses, but left his wife and children to depend on food relief from able member cares to contemplate. Not the Government. When the relief was discontinued, the police were definitely instructed to restore it. That happened in Cobar, and full details of the case can be had from the Mayor of the town. While I was addressing a public meeting at Wongarbon on Saturday night last, I referred to the abuse of food relief, and a member of the audience repeated almost verbatim the statement made to-day by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), that the farmers of New South Wales were asking that men should work for them without wages, or at starvation rates of pay.

I have mentioned the names of employer and employee, and the town in which the incident occurred. It is but an illustration of what is happening in New South Wales under the present regime. Unless the State Government realizes its responsibility, both to its people and its creditors, and demands of the citizens of New South Wales whatever sacrifice may be necessary to enable them to meet their obligations, the people will be led into a fool's paradise, for it is certain that, in the near I know of one future, they will be forced to make even greater sacrifices, and even be involved in disaster of a character which no honoronly is the Lang policy destroying the credit of New South Wales and the Commonwealth generally, but the neglect of that State to honour its obligations is",38,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore

Will they secure revenue from New South Wales? As a matter of fact, is it not simply a case of sparring for time until the 21st June? By then, two or three States will have got over their elections. Are these amendments to be made use of if certain State governments are not returned with majorities? The foundation of this legislation is the Financial Agreement, into which I feel confident no State would have entered if it had realized that by so doing it gave the Commonwealth power to step in and collect State revenue. Agreement not only gives the bondholder a mortgage over the revenue of every State, but also makes the Commonwealth the collector of that revenue on his behalf. We have reached a stage when the interest bill is too great, having regard to our decreased production. In New South Wales over 30 per cent, of the people are out of production. Throughout Australia an enormous proportion of the people are earning nothing to help to meet the interest on the debt of Australia. member's alternative? not permit me <;o mention at this stage the alternative I have to put forward; but I can assure the honourable member that it is not on the lines of the policy put forward by the Prime Minister. When I have an opportunity to tell the House what it is, the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) will be found supporting me, because it will mean getting people back into work and production, and creating real confidence. I object to the amendments proposed against the State of New South Wales. In a month or two they may be directed against the States of Queensland and Victoria should those States find themselves in a difficult position, out of which they cannot extricate themselves by direct negotiation. They must act through the Loan Council, and must also' secure the consent of the very people who, along with the Assistant Treasurer, have been responsible for getting Australia into the chaotic condition in which it finds itself to-day. I refer to the bankers. Listening to the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) to-night, one would imagine that somebody other than he was responsible for the present deplorable condition of affairs. Actually the right honourable gentleman and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) are the two who are mainly responsible for the existing position. able member make that assertion? gentlemen were in office during the most The Financial prosperous years of ""Australia, and they indulged in a mad orgy of borrowing, sinking millions of pounds into non-productive works.

139,Mr Gander (Reid) [9.2],"I desiremeasure that was designed to reduce the salaries of the Premier, Ministers of the Crown, the parliamentarians and public servants of that State to £500. The measure was passed by the Legislative Assembly, but rejected by the Legislative Council, the friends of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr whether it will pay the officers engaged Parkhill) throwing it out after scant consideration. That is .one of the reasons why Mr Lang has been unable to adhere to the letter of the Premiers plan. That gentleman made a solemn pledge to the people of his State that he would not reduce the basic wage, family endowment, widows' pensions, or interferewith benefits granted under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and I assure this Government that he will honour that promise while he remains in office, which will be for another eighteen months at least. The honourable member for Calare( Mr speak at the Parramatta Town Hall any Thorby) alleged that if a secret vote were taken among the 55 members of the Labour party in the New South Wales Assembly, Mr Lang would be deposed as leader. I do not know on what the honourable member bases his assumption, but I and others are aware that certain influences have offered every inducement to various members of the New South Wales Labour Parliament to break away from the party. It is almost unnecessary to add that those underhand efforts proved fruitless. I assure honourable members that the Labour party of New South Wales was never more solidly behind its leader than it is to-day. I was surprised to note that, after the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) had intimated that he had received no' advice from the Government that it in-tended to introduce this bill, the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) rose and read his speech from a typewritten statement, proving conclusively that he must have been in close consultation with the Government on this subject. The right honourable gentleman declared that the time is not far distant when the Federal Government will have to consider taking over the whole of the social services of New South Wales. I am aware that that is one of the desires of this Government, and that fact, associated with tlie prepared statement from which the right honourable gentleman read Afr. Gander. his speech, confirms the opinion that he has collaborated with the Government, with regard to this bill. Probably this Government will endeavour to take 'over the tramways, the railways, the hospitals, schools, police, and other services of New South Wales. But I should like to know in those services the Avages they are now receiving, or whether it proposes to pay them the rate approved at the recent Premiers Conference, £2 l is . Gd. a week? Despite what certain individuals in otlier States may say, the majority of the people of New South Wales are solidly behind J. T. Lang. the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Stewart) to laugh, and to say "" Nonsense "". Let the honourable member night next week, proclaiming his intention to deal with this measure, and then a few nights later let my leader, the lionorable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), or Mr Lang speak on the same subject, and I guarantee that the streets and the hall will be filled with three times as many people as assemble to hear the honourable member for Parramatta. Last night I attended a meeting at Granville, at which the honourable member for West.Sydney( Mr Beasley) spoke. I attended many meetings during the last general election, a time when the people were at fever heat, but never have I witnessed in that district such a tremendous and enthusiastic meeting as that which gathered last night to hear my leader; and I have lived in that area for 25 years. This Government is making a tragic mistake if it believes that it can ride roughshod over the people of New South Wales. We who belong to the Labour movement of that State say that Mr Lang is right, and know that the bulk of the people of New South Wales would do anything for him. If this Government attempts to put the bill into operation and sends bailiffs into the different State departments, it will find that its efforts will be opposed by a large section of the people of New South Wales, who will endeavour to prevent it from tramping on .their rights. I warn the Government not to go",42,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore

141,Mr Gander,"-It is all very well fortoo far. position ( Mr Scullin) very properly struck a warning' note, and reminded the Government that there are 400,000 unemployed in Australia. Honorahle members know what happened recently in Auckland. I urge the Government not to goad the people of New South Wales into taking action that will bring disaster upon the nation. I agree with the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that this measure should be thrown into the waste-paper basket, and I trust that the Government will take his advice. Let the Prime Minister and his colleagues immediately get into touch with the Premier of New South Wales and endeavour to bring about a reconciliation, which will avoid the suffering that must inevitably result if this bill becomes law. [9.10] -The honourable member for Reid( Mr Gander) made a great noise about the alleged indignation of the people of New South Wales over the action that this Government is taking to compel the Lang Government to stand up to its obligations to the Commonwealth and the people of that State. He had the sublime audacity to warn this Government in the name of the people of New South Wales, not to go too fa:;! I represent the people of that State just as much as he does. The honourable member represents one of the industrial electorates of Sydney, which contains a very large proportion of the population that is supporting the Lang Government, a section that was no doubt largely represented at the packed meeting that was hold in the Sydney Town Hall last week, and hailed by the Labour organizations as representative of the people of the Mother State. If the honourable member, the representative of an industrial centre, is so confident that he can speak here for the people of New South Wales generally, I am equally confident as the representative of a country electorate of that State when I warn the Government of New South Wales not to go to the country. If it docs, as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow it will sound its own deathknell. The honourable member, Mr Lang, and all bis satellites know very well that if they go to -the country they will simply be brushed aside as though they did not count-as they really do not in the estimaThe Leader of the Option of the people of New South Wales.

He ""sqnibbed"" it. ""squibbed "" anything. The tobacco issue has nothing to do with the default of New South Wales. I am prepared to submit the tobacco question to the people of the State.

152,Mr Thompson,"Yes, because Iwho, Government and its supporters in opposition to this policy of default by the Government of New South Wales, have changed their colours. When they were in power they gained a good deal of kudos from the action of the Scullin Government against Mr Lang. then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), who is now the Leader of the Opposition, made a number of impassioned speeches in which he assured the House that his Government would take every step necessary to uphold the rights of the Commonwealth. himself has made a number of impassioned speeches in defence of the tobacco industry. many more, when I get an opportunity to do so. The Leader of the Opposition, when in office, assured all parties in this House that the Labour party would never stand. for a policy of national default, aud that whatever steps might be necessary to compel Mr Lang and his Government to honour their obligations, would be taken by his Government. Now what do we find? Obviously, the federal Labour members have run away from the speeches delivered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Labour party, especially the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), to all intents and purposes they are now supporting the policy of Langism. In Victoria we see the Acting Premier, as the leader .of the Labour party in that State, facing the electors definitely in opposition to certain proposals contained in the Premiers plan. This means that he and his supporters are virtually endorsing the policy of the Premier of New South Wales. It should also be remembered that the Leader of the Opposition in this House was on the platform with the Acting Premier of Victoria when he opened bis election campaign in Melbourne last week, and gave absolute support to the policy which he put before the electors of that State. From all this we are quite justified in assuming that, however good were the intentions of Labour members last year, and however originally, were behind the loyal they may have declared themselves to be towards these definite issues of honesty and political straight-going in Australia, they have since changed their opinions and are now marching steadily, and perhaps much more rapidly than they realize, right into the camp of the The Langites-the very people who, a short time ago, they were denouncing from every platform in Australia. It is much to be regretted that recent events have revealed that the honest elements in the politics of Australia can no longer depend ou the Federal Labour party to back them in this fight. It was generally understood that, in this Parliament at all events, tbe conflict as between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales was of a non-party character. Nowi t appears to be definitely a party fight. Members representing the TJnited Australia and Country parties have to support the Commonwealth Government unaided, no matter where the issue may lead them. I know the country people in New South Wales pretty well. During the recess I was in close touch with them, and I can safely say that the great majority of them are totally opposed to the Lang Government. ThereforeI consider that the issue. Judging by country members in this House are perfectly justified in standing behind the Government on this issue, and in urging it to take whatever steps it thinks are necessary to settle this matter once and for all. It must be settled very soon. Things cannot be allowed to drift as they have been drifting during the last few weeks. However much we may differ from the Ministry upon tariff and other questions, the Country party to a man in this House is behind the Government in this matter. We regard this issue as paramount in the politics of Australia, and our earnest desire is-to see all necessary action taken to vindicate the honour of this country in the eyes of the world. We desire confidence to be restored and to banish, for all time, any suggestion of that rottenness which has been in evidence lately. Upon this issue the Country party will support the Government in any action which it may take. This measure authorizes the Commonwealth to take further steps to compel the Government of New South Wales to",44,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore
153,Mr Gander,The honourable member,45,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore
154,Mr Thompson,"And I may makerelax its opposition to federal pressure to honour its obligations. Up to tbe present, tbe opposition of tbe Lang Government has been more passive than active, but it is open to question whether thu State Government has not definitely violated the Federal Constitution, because the High Court has ruled that all steps taken by the Commonwealth Government have been strictly constitutional. Since it is now arguable that the Government of New South Wales, by its defiance of Commonwealth authority, has violated rhe Constitution, the National Parliament may be authorized to take extreme steps, even of an extra-constitutional nature, to vindicate its undoubted powers, and to save the Commonwealth from being wrecked. The attitude of the New South Wales Government and of its representatives in this House, suggests that a very provocative and, in fact, rebellious spirit is gradually being engendered in New South Wales against the CommonAvealth, and I fear that if this Government alloAvs the position to drift too far, Mr Lang, in his fanatic assumption that the people of his State are behind him, may commit some overt or revolutionary act; that he may, in fact, attempt forcibly to resist the authority of the Commonwealth. I sincerely hope that such a stage will not be reached, but, from the nature of the speeches delivered this afternoon by the supporters in this House of the Lang Government, I am afraid Ave shall not have very long to wait before grave developments occur. For this reason, I repeat that the sooner the CommonAvealth joins issue Avith the State Government the betterr for all concerned, because the people in New South Wales are tired of Avaiting. The majority of them have faith in the OomnionAvealth Government. My only concern, at the moment, is that the honour of Australia shall be Abdicated. Everything else is subsidiary. I fear that if this Government does not promptly take drastic measures to assert its authority, the hot-heads in New South Wales who control thd government of that State may take the bit in their teeth and precipitate a crisis Avhich the Commonwealth may be unable to handle adequately and in a constitutional manner. As honourable members a're avpure. our constitutional poAvers are limited. The Commonwealth has not the right to take coercive steps against any State without first obtaining the authority of the High Court, and in the present circumstances it is doubtful that it would have a free hand in adopting coercive measures against the Government of NeAv South Wales. It has taken certain steps. It has affirmed its intention to compel any gOA'ernnient Avhich defaults to meet its obligations. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) mentioned this afternoon that possibly other States also Avould default in their interest payments, and asked if similar measures Avould be taken against them. I say without hesitation that if any State defaults in the same Avay tliat NeAv South Wales has defaulted, the CommonAvealth will be obliged to adopt the same measures against it. States might default. I said that other States might have to declare their inability to pay. same thing. The honourable member has merely used a more euphemistic term. Mr Lang has declared that he is not in a position to pay; Ave say that his is a case of straight out default. Therefore, if any other State defaults in the same circumstances the CommonAvealth Avill have to take similar action against them, otherwise its authority will disappear completely. Tliis issue involves the Avhole future of the CommonAvealth as well as of the States. If the CommonAvealth is"" beaten in this fight Avith NCAV South Wales, if it is unable to vindicate its legal right to collect money due to it through the default of a State, it will not be long before its financial strength will be destroyed, and this Parliament might as Avell cease to function. Then the States will revert to the condition that obtained in pre-federation days. I say in all seriousness that this bill definitely involves the AA'hole future of the CommonAvealth arid the States. The onus is UOAV upon us to vindicate our authority. This is the first occasion upon Avhich the Commonwealth has sought to impress its superior sovereignty upon sovereign States, and it is immediately challenged",45,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore
155,Mr Riordan,I did not say that other,46,Earle Page Wha T Is The Contract And That Britain Is Therefore
156,Mr Thompson,"It amounts to theby one of them. If the New South Government wins in this fight it will be clear proof that the Commonwealth's sovereignty is inferior to that of the States; and that will mean the end of the Commonwealth, because. Commonwealth sovereignty being inferior, the States will then assert their power over the central government, and will gradually strangle the whole future development of Australia as a nation. The present position cannot be allowed to drift. The Commonwealth is entitled to seize further State revenues to reimburse itself iu respect of payments made ""ii behalf of the defaulting State. It does not matter what further revenues arc attached so long as the necessary sum is obtained. That is the whole issue. All this talk about child endowment and State lotteries, and winning bets tickets is beside the point-so introduced as good material in the event of an appeal to the people. I repeat that the sooner this crisis is brought to a head the better, because the nerves of the people in New South Wales arc on edge. For some months now they have been living in a condition of nightmare, fearful of what may happen from day to day. This unhappy state of affairs is destroying the confidence of the people. They do not know what is going to happen next. . The taxpayers are in a condition of nervous prostration. They fear that if the Commonwealth Government is defeated in its fight with the State Government, Mr '.'-ommonwealth, and boast about its Lang will come down with smashing confiscatory taxes, amounting to a levy upon wealth, which will destroy business and industry in New South Wales. If the Commonwealth Government is beaten in this fight it will be quite possible for the State Government to crucify the unfortunate taxpayers of the State who have paid their taxes to the Commonwealth, and who will be helpless. obeying the law and paying their taxation to the Commonwealth they may be beavilburdened with additional taxation, amounting practically to confiscation. The Lang Government could take this action as an act of revenge. If the < 'ommonwealth Government does not bring matters to a head very soon a big sect ion of the people of New South Wales will take steps to do so. Ur. Thompson. interested in the New Guard, and know nothing about it. But the country people of New South Wales, whom I know best, and whom I represent, are in such a mood that if the Oommonwealth Government is beaten in this fight and the State Government subsequently carries out it."" vindictive and vengeful threats they will be prepared to take action to precipitate a crisis by seeking the intervention of the British Parliament. The Commonwealth Government cannot allow itself to be defied. If it has no constitutional power to use force against a State which is carrying out a policy like that which the New South Wales Government is now pursuing, it should force the issue. I u my opinion the Commonwealth Governmuch "" sob-stuff"" ment has no authority to use military power against a State. This is a great pity, for while I do not think that the Commonwealth Government would have to use force against the people of a State, it should certainly have power to use it against a government which misuses its power, and . prevents the Commonwealth Government from carrying out its legal obligations. Has the Commonwealtli Parliament no power at, all? Can a State, governed by an administration with the bush ranging instincts of the present New South Wales Government, smash the power to do so? Is the power of the Commonwealth limited to the obtaining of a High Court judgment which cannot be enforced ? It appears that under the Commonwealth Constitution as it stands, the Commonwealth Government has no redress whatever against a State which deliberately sets out with the object of smashing federation, and which has inFor simply dicated that it will use physical force to do so. Australia should be asked to grant additional power to the Commonwealth. This Government should be given absolute and unrestricted power to preserve the federation.

There should be power in tlie Constitution to preserve the federation, and to authorize the Commonwealth to use adequate physical force for that purpose. enthusiastic about the use of physical force. but in a position like that which now confronts us, we are forced to face the facts. It appears that there are many people in at least one State who are deliberately supporting a policy which is definitely aimed nt destroying the Commonwealth. It we cannot do anything to preserve the federation it will undoubtedly disappear. I contend that the Commonwealth Government should have power to protect itself. We are facing the first real crisis in i he history of the federation, and the Commonwealth Government should test iis power to the absolute limit. If it finds that a State can defy it, and intends to do so on a vival matter like that with whicli we are now dealing, it should take steps to correct the position. It should put a question to the people which would enable them to give it complete power to defend the Commonwealth. people of New South Wales. if a referendum were held the people of New South Wales would have just as much right as the people of other States to express their opinion. should be inserted in the Constitution to give this Parliament supreme power to take whatever steps it deems necessary to maintain the Commonwealth. If the Government thinks that the taking of a. referendum would be too troublesome or too lengthy a process, there is one other step it could take. But, in my opinion, a referendum could be held in a fortnight. I , and the members of the party which I represent, are prepared to support the Government if it submits a proposal to the people to provide for an alteration of the Constitution which would settle the issue of Langism for all time. If the Government thinks that a campaign for that purpose would be too much trouble or involve too great an expense, there is one other thing which it can do. If it finds that the State Government is too strongly entrenched behind.the State Constitution-and it. appears to me that the State Constitution is, in many respects, a more powerful instrument of government than the Commonwealth Constitution-it could approach the British Parliament. It may happen that it is not possible for this Government to implement a policy which will enable it to force the State of NewSou th Wales to meet its obligations. So far, the New South Wales Government has been able to thwart every effort which the Commonwealth has made to assert its authority. It appears to me that our constitutional limitations may be our undoing. The Constitution of New South Wales, which is similar to the constitutions of the other States, may prove to be a more potent instrument of government than the Commonwealth Constitution. Apparently only one man can bring this issue to a head,'and that is the Governor of New South Wales.

167,Mr Thompson,"If, after thefrom the British Parliament. Some honourable members who are sitting on my right may scoff at that statement; but the fact remains that our power of government is derived from the Imperial Parliament, which was the originator of the Aus; tralian Oommonwealth, and which can settle this issue for us if we cannot settle it for ourselves. If the"" Commonwealth Government thinks that the taking of a referendum is too lengthy and too uncertain a process, it can request the Imperial Parliament to act, for the default of New South Wales is a matter of grave importance to Great Britain. Unless something is done speedily to put an end to the present policy of the New South Wales Government, it is quite possible that our whole federation will 1 break down. There may be civil war, or some other form of violence, and the Commonwealth Government will' be powerless to enforce the laws which this Parliament has passed, and the validity of which has been upheld by the High Court!. It may happen that it will be possible for a lawless government, supported by an undisciplined mob which has been goaded and educated by the Premier of New South Wales, to forcibly resist the legislation of the Commonwealth. In these circumstances we should approach the Imperial Parliament, for, if the honour of one British dominion is besmirched, the honour of the whole Empire is involved. If this measure proves to be ineffective, we should ask the British Government to instruct the Governor of New South Wales, who is a servant of the British Crown, to bring about an electionin that State. If the Governor is too frightened to act, or if he thinks that there are constitutional obstacles to his doing so, the Imperial Parliament should take the initiative. to make a pun on the Governor's name, , but if he is not game to act on his own ; initiative, he should be instructed to act by the British Parliament. If this legislation proves to be abortive, the Commonwealth Government should, without delay, either seek complete power from the people of Australia by way of referendum, or request the British Government to remove fromoffice the present Government of New South Wales. If the present State Parliament were dissolved, and Mr Lang sent to the people, they could decide whether the charge of default was or was not to be fastened upon them. and Treasurer) [9.44] -As the Government desires that this bill shall be passed this evening, and as I do not think there is any need for me to add anything to what I have said, and what the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) said earlier this afternoon, I shall not detain honourable members by replying to the debate.

170,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime MinisterI n comnnittee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause2 (Effect of payment in accordance with direction of Treasurer). and Treasurer) [9.51] -This clause provides that a person who pays to the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the Financial Agreements Enforcement Act, moneys, which, hut for that act, would have been payable to the State, shall not suffer by way of fine or other penalty imposed by the State. The clause merely provides that a person who has complied with the law of the country shall not be punished for so doing. supreme ? a possibility of penalties being imposed by the State it hau been thought advisable to make the position perfectly clear. clause is the outcome of press propaganda based on an alleged threat by Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, to take action against persons who pay taxes to the Federal Treasurer in accordance with the principal act. I do not know that Mr Lang made any such threat; but probably some taxpayers have been led to fear that they will be penalized and forced to pay double taxation. Although the purpose of the clause may be merely to dispel their fears, I am so strongly opposed to the measure that I shall not allow any clause to pass without opposition, even if that opposition has no other effect than to retard the progress of the bill. made it clear that the Opposition is opposed to the whole of this legislation; nevertheless, I cannot place myself in the position of doing something with which I disagree merely to retard the passing of a bill. The principal act provides that if , in. certain circumstances, money is paid to the Commonwealth the State cannot sue for its recovery. This bill carries that principle a little further; the demands of. both the Commonwealth it provides that the State cannot fine such a person. The principal act is now law, and its provisions are enforceable against the taxpayers of New South Wales. It is not a question of whether the law be good or bad. is superfluous. protect the taxpayers of New South Wales against the imposition of penalties for complying with the law. Is the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), merely because he himself does not agree with the law, prepared to support the imposition of a penalty on a taxpayer who has been guilty of no other offence than that of obeying the law? That, in my opinion, is a strange attitude to adopt. ensures that they will pay their taxes; I do not want them to have to do that. ber has misinterpreted the position. The object of this clause is to prevent a person from being penalized for complying with the law. gentleman were a resident .of New South Wales, he would understand the position. not being a resident of that State, have a clearer conception of the meaning of this clause than has the honourable gentleman. I shall not, however', attempt to convert him. AlthoughI do not agree with the law, I do not hold that any one should be penalized for obeying it. oppose the clause. We were told to-day by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that the High Court of Australia held the Financial Agreement's Enforcement Act to be valid. In that case, the Common1 wealth law is supreme, and therefore I see no need for this further legislation. Should the Premier of New South Wales say to those persons -who appear to be anxious to pay their money to the Commonwealth that he proposes to double the amount payable by them, would that be regarded as imposing a penalty on them, or would it be deemed to prove only that the taxpayer has sufficient money to meet and the State? It is not clear whether the object of this, clause is to induce those taxpayers who, in the confusion caused by the struggle between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments, have evaded payment of their taxes to pay",49,Paiiir

We regret very much that so distinguished, so able, so fine a citizen should have passed away at what is a 1 comparatively early age. The Government extends to his relatives in their bereavement, and to the people of Australia as a whole, its profound regret at the death of so eminent a citizen. join with the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and other honourable members in expressing regret at the unexpected death of Sir Adrian Knox, who occupied a very He had a very thorough grasp of constitutional law and had built up for himself a reputation in that sphere that will always be remembered by those who have followed the constitutional history of this country.

220,Mr James (Hunter) [10.29],"I takemost valuable in the world, as the result of a subsidence in the old workings, is now on fire. An application has been made to the State Government of New South Wales by the Mayor of Greta aud the Miners Federation to safeguard the collieries adjacent to the old mine which has been closed for 30 years owing to an explosion, as the result of which the bodies of some of the men who lost their lives were never recovered. fire is in close proximity to the interstate railway, and is endangering transport between New South Wales and Queensland.. If it is not extinguished by filling in the cavity, and so ^smothering the flames, New South Wales and Australia will suffer a severe loss. There is in close proximity to this coal-mine another mine which has been burning for the past 40 years, and if something is not done to extinguish the fire at the Greta mine, it may continue for a number of years, and one of our greatest national assets may be destroyed. coal fuel has to some extent been superseded by oil fuel, the oil-fields will not last for all time and if this coal seam is saved from destructioni t may be of great value to Australia in years to come. I appeal to the Prime Minister to make available to the municipality of Greta the sum of £2,000 to enable it to carry out the work of filling in .the cavity and thus preserve this coal seam in ' the interests of the nation. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). The fire at the Greta coal mine can be extinguished by two methods; one by preventing the air from fanning it, and the other by flooding the mine. It would be difficult to flood the mine in view of the scarcity of waterat the mine. This is a highly bituminous seam. The Maitland coal-field throughout contains a high percentage of pyrites, and when a subsidence occurs, there is always the danger of an outbreak of fire. Steps should be taken to check the fire and to prevent it from spreading to Eotbbury and adjacent mines. to bring before the House a matteT which is of serious concern to the farmers generally, and which is very much akin to restraint of trade. Many of our producers depend upon tractors for the sowing of their crops. There has recently been placed upon the market a certain fuel which is available to the owners of a certain type of tractor at a price approximately 6d. per gallon below the price of ordinary engine fuel. The firm which has been selling the fuel has . refused absolutely to sell it to the owners This of other types of tractor on the ground that it is unsuitable. But the fact is that this fuel has been obtained indirectly by owners of other tractors and found to be quite satisfactory. I have received a complaint in this respect from the Wagga"" district, and I know that the fanners in my own district and the western parts of New South Wales are also affected. I suggest that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) should try to come to some arrangement with the oil companies to make available to farmers who use tractors fuel at Although a reasonable price, so that they can produce their wheat economically, and dispose of it profitably on the world's market. .Cheap fuel is absolutely necessary for the farmer in view of the low price that he receives for his product. It is impossible for the producers who use tractors to change over to horses. Horses are not obtainable and even if they were, the farmers could not afford to purchase them. It has been suggested to me that the distributors of tractors have had something to do with the arrangement to restrict the sale of this fuel. I have used the fuel in my own tractor which is not supposed to be suitable for it. My son after taking down the tractor has found the valves and other internal parts to be in quite as good order as when a higher grado and more expensive fuel was being used. This is a matter of great importance to the producers, and I ask the Minister to take some action in their interests. ter and Treasurer) [10.36] I shall bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs the matter raised by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock). I do not know whether anything can be done to help the producers in the direction indicated by him; but I am sure that the Minister will nso his best efforts in their interests.",57,Adjournment Death Of Sir Adrian Knox Fir E At Greta Colliery Chea P Fuel For Tractors
