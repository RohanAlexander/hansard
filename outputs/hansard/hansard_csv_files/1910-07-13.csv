0,"?L)Ous8 Of Fiepresentatfofs. Wednesday, P.m., And Read Prayers. To Make A Personal Explanation. Last Ses","sion, speaking in this Chamber upon the proposed redistribution of the electoral divisions of Western Australia, I identified the Commissioner appointed for that purpose with a previous redistribution, and made deductions uncomplimentary to him. On my return to Perth he wrote to me, pointing out that he was not responsible for the previous redistribution, and on going into the matter, I found that he was not. I therefore wrote him the following letter, which I shall read here, so that it may be recorded in Hansard as a reply to my former statement, which I regret:Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter and enclosures. I regret very much that this matter was not brought under my notice by you at an earlier date, as I find I have undoubtedly done you an injustice in ' identifying you with ""the proposed rearrangement of the. electorate in 1903. Had you called my attention to this mistake of mine while Parliament was sitting I would .have at once apologized in the House, so that Hansard would have shown the .correction If , however, I go back after this election I shall certainly take tbe earliest opportunity to withdraw my' erroneous statement. I exceedingly regret it, ns it has ever been my aim, as a public man. to be very careful not to do an injustice, in my speeches, to public officials who of course have not an equal opportunity of defending themselves. This is the first incident of this' kind, so far as I am aware, in the whole of my public career,^and I am particularly sorry that I should have made this blunder in connection with the work of a highly-respected official of my own .

If so, who advised the prosecution contrary to such advice? 3. Whether he noticed by the press report of the trial that the Crown Solicitor . practically apologized to the Court by saying, "" That the prosecution had not been instituted by the officers of the State, and had not been launched by the doctors who had diagnosed the disease as small-pox""? honourable member's questions are1. No. No advice was asked from or given by the Crown Law Department of Western Australia. 2. The prosecution was directed by the Department of Trade and Customs, and approved by my predecessor and myself. The evidence in the possession of the Department amply justified the prosecution; but the evidence called for the defence apparently satisfied the jury that the falsity of the medical report was not w i l f u l . tain cases; but Regulation 7c only applies 3. No; the language of the State Crown Solicitor cannot be construed as an apology, and I have no reason whatever to believe that he did not loyally perform his duty.

If ever they do, they will realize what bitter brutality can be associated with ;he Labour caucus, and so they will do well to stick to it, and get all they can out of it for themselves and for their movement. There is safety in the caucus for' them if not for others. The other day I came across a passage in Todd's Parliamentary Practice which shows very clearly how, from time immemorial, this has been recognised. The writer^ saysMr Hare in his work on representation gives the experience of the late Sidney Herbert of the effect of the decline of party control in the House of Commons. The extent to which the old system of subordination to party leaders was sometimes carried may be inferred from the humorous description of an old Scotch member (Ferguson, of Pitfour), who was a staunch supporter of Mr Pitt: Honourable members will see that this was some little while ago and who used to say, "" I was never present at any debate I could avoid, or absent at any divimains to be seen. For the sake of a comsion I could get at. I have heard many arguparison, say three years hence, let me state ments which convinced my judgment, but never what else is on the old page. one that influenced my vote.

The change to which he refers will come in good time, and Ministers will bring it about. LetI congratulate them, and, if they them not imagine that, because they now hold power and authority, everything is well with the world. Already they are beginning to make, on the average, as many mistakes as have been made by any set of predecessors. Indeed, they have already made more than the average number of blunders committed by any Ministry of which I have recollection. I would point out to the honourable member for Corio that activity and change do not necessarily mean progress. The drunken man who put his wooden leg into a hole, and walked round and round all night under the mistaken impression that he was going home, did not progress, although he was active enough. What is material is the whence and whither of the change. The honourable member for Brisbane has told us that a new page in the history of Australia has been opened. I hope that this new page will be filled with records typifying greater blessings and progress for the Commonwealth. If my honourable friends can accomplish that, there will be no word of complaint from me. But what is on the old page? err is human.

113,Mr Wise,"That was the only way in the honourable member believes in truth, though I hope that he will not be silly enough to think that he has a monopoly of the truth of the world. That would be a foolish position for any man to take. No doubt he, like us, had to contend against misrepresentation, though we suffered more than he did in that respect. The honourable member's unfortunate interjection emphasized my statement that scores of thousands of electors who do not believe in all the planks of the Labour party voted for Labour candidates-shal l I say, to please him, in order to defeat the Fusion party ? honourable member for that statement? member had better address himself to his quondam friend the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member might leave it to those who have been in the caucus much longer than, he has been to make these interjections. able member has not merely to please himself.

And over here, who, in the debate, already, have been trounced for their feebleness, ignorance, and inability to'conduct the affairs of the country-jus t as a new member is always ready to trounce and to sneer at those who happen to be opposed to him-wit h a little reasonableness. We may pass by these things for what they are worth. I wish to congratulate the Government on the way in which they have conducted themselves in some particulars since taking to themselves the responsibilities of office, but before doing so desire to say that I am unable to congratulate them upon some of their actions. The rule can be applied to them with certainty that what they denounced when in opposition a month or two ago, that do they now with alacrity and approval. think can very well be established from their own actions. For instance, who does not remember the trouncing which the present Prime Minister 'gave to our party because we dared to commit the crime of increasing the number of members of the Cabinet from nine to ten. I remember the trill of the Prime Minister's Scotch when he said to us, "" You are suborning Parliament by taking ten members into your Cabinet."" But what was wrong in connection with our Cabinet is perfectly right, it appears, in the composition of the Labour Administration. I should have thought, considering the strong statement of the the Prime Minister on that occasion, that it would be one of the actions that he would sedulously avoid; yet his very first act upon his accession to power was to compose his Cabinet of ten members. forgets that the Prime Minister did not compose it. rected. I was forgetting that the Prime Minister did not construct his Cabinet. Therein lies another story which, for want of time, I cannot open up at present. But I stand absolutely corrected; it was the confounded caucus that did it ! The Prime Minister himself would not have taken that action, and so his character for consistency is saved by the caucus. There are ten members of the present Cabinet, and the Prime Minister is absolved by the caucus from all that he denounced when on this side of the House a month or two ago. Then treat these humble individuals again, my honourable friend the Attorney General must have passing through his mind thoughts of the truculent denunciation which he measured out to us for daring to nominate one. of our party to the Speakership, without, if you please, consulting the then Opposition. He moved that there should be an open conference with respect to the matter-that the question should be determined on the floor of the House. I would remind honourable members that there was then a vacancy. Unlike the Labour party we did not bundle any one out of the Chair to put another man in his place. was too severe at that time in denunciation of the way in which we proceeded to the election of the honourable member for That is a rule which I Laanecoorie as Speaker of this House.",23,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

We find, however, that it is the same old smudgy page, and not a new one, that we have before us. WhatI desire to point out is the difference between their conduct when on this side of the Chamber, and their attitude when on the Treasury bench. The Government made a very bad beginning when they came into power, and actually before they met the House. I refer to their action in laying hands upon the Trust Funds of Australia to get them out of their difficulties. Is it too much to say that if a private individual outside did the same I would point out to him that thing with trust funds he would find himself in gaol ? No real excuse has been offered for their action. Many a man has made the same excuse as they have, but it has not saved him from gaol. I have in mind a postal official, now serving a term in gaol, whose family are hanging their heads in shame and who would have found the money readily, had they been permitted to do so. They were not permitted to put back the money, and I believe in my very heart that the man had no intention of stealing it. He happened, however, to be without it when the audit officer came along, and the result is that he is to-day in gaol. The position with the Government, however, seems to be quite different.

There was at that Conference, so far as I know, nothing that could not have taken place in this chamber. If it were possible to get every word uttered there recorded, I should not trouble to revise it before laying it upon the table of tlie House. At the election we were told that the banks were frauds upon, and were exploiting, the public. A State bank was to be introduced, and the extinction of the present banks was inevitably to follow. But, what has happened? All that I know is that one of the very first things that the Prime Minister does is to have a secret conference, not with his fellow representatives of the people from other Chambers in Australia, but with the hated bankers, pledged to secrecy. Not a word has yet escaped of the proceedings of that conference. stroyed the blotting paper also. did, and it was a secret conference, not with the Prime Minister's fellow governors of Australia, but with the bankers whom his party are never tired of denouncing.

We want to know how it comes about that, in spite ot all the fierce denunciations of bankers and their works, which formed the staple of the Labour party's propaganda at the elections, the Prime Minister sent them away very well satisfied after a secret conference. said that the Prime Minister sought the conference, but it was the other way about. so. It does not matter who sought the conference, or who did not. It was a secret conference, and I suppose they burned the blotting-pads, as was said of our conference. We were conferring in a private way, that is to say, in a secret way, with our own fellow governors of Australia; but the Prime Minister has conferred in secret with those who were alleged by the Labour party in their manifestoes at the election to be their enemies. conference which the honourable member's party had with Beale and Joshua. Joshua! I believe he has embraced my honourable friends and expressed his regret for ever having gone away from them.

Then, again, we were told, notably by the able honourable member for Werriwa, when he was returning thanks to his electors, that if , at the end of three years, we were not able to ride in Government steam-ships as we now ride on Government railways, we might consider that the Labour party had failed, and that they must be held to their account if in the meantime they did not nationalize the shipping of Australia. It makes me wonder whether this is going to come true, when I read in the newspaper that, at a banquet given by one of the great over-sea steam-ship companies, themanager of the German line of steamers rejoiced in the advent of my honourable friends to office.

Fusion party never did anything else for Australia, it absolutely justified its existence over and over again by securing Field Marshal Lord Kitchener to investigate our forces and by appointing General Kirkpatrick as Inspector-General. matter what the country may say in condemnation of what our Government did, I am sure that, looking to the most important question that can ever occupy the attention of this Parliament-the defence of Australia-ou r Government, will stand by what it did, and deserves and will yet receive the confidence and approbation of the people. I am glad that my successor has had the good sense to continue the administration which was in vogue when he took office. I hope that spirit will characterize all future Governments also. I tried to do the same when I succeeded him. I did my best to carry on the administration of the Department on reasonable lines, disturbing nothing that was good in all that my predecessor had done. the same example, and it must be followed in the future if we are ever to have an efficient defence force. Here are my honourable friends surrounded by all the trappings of office and conducting themselves in the most orthodox way. I see nothing to complain of, and in some of their actions I see everything to commend. For instance, the Postmaster-General, when upon the platform, said he believed in the communistic side of Socialism; but the other day, when in office, he said at a gathering that efficiency was to be the one test of proister of the day, whosaid that we were motion in the Postal Department. is an admirable sentiment, but it means simply that the fit are to go up and the weak ones are to stay down. There is no Socialism about that. of tooth and claw, applied in a political way. think it is a sound doctrine to lay down. I have yet to learn how it can be reconciled with the communism preached by the honourable member when before the electors. A word now regarding the proposed repeal of the Naval Loan Act. It has been said That is another of the things that we ought not to borrow for purposes of defence. I cordially agree with that, but there are some things which are of more importance than borrowing. Naval preparation is so urgent that the Government would be justified in borrowing to get ahead with it at the earliest possible moment. What reconciled me to the exi f the pedient of temporary borrowing was this : The loan proposed was not borrowing in the ordinary sense of the term. It was to be repaid to the extent of 5 per cent, per annum, and we intended to liquidate it, if possible, in about ten years, when, according to the No Admiralty estimate, there would still be a life of ten j^ears in the vessels which had been paid for. It might be called a timepayment arrangement. We should have financed the matter without asking the people of Australia to contribute a penny more in taxation. My idea was to secure the reserves of taxation to obtain more naval defence in the near future. Do not let it be imagined that the present unit is to be all our naval preparation for years to come. Having begun, we must go further if we are to do our share in defending Australia, and in contributing to the defence of the Empire, without which we should be in very poor case. My idea was to contribute further to a war chest, so that we might get more modern naval defence as the years went by. We were The present Minister is following justified in making a beginning at once, even though we might have to borrow temporarily for the purpose. Mr J. H .

Any one can tax the people if he has a majority behind him. There is no statesmanship in that. A baby could do it. It only requires the brute strength of a majority to increase the burdens of the taxpayers. But the problems of statesmanship concern themselves with the lightening of these burdens, and the increasing of the prosperity of the country. Every country in the world except Great Britain is borrowing right and left for purposes of defence, and even Great Britain borrows now and again for collateral purposes. Germany had £13,000,000 of extraordinary expenditure last year over and above the ordinary outlay on maintenance and upkeep, and .£8,000,000 or £9,000,000 of the borrowed money is being spent on Dreadnoughts. stand that very long. it now, and while it does so we must keep pace with Germany. Since the other nations are arming themselves to the teeth, we must arm for self-preservation. France borrowed £2,500,000 for defence last year, while the ordinary defence expenditure of Japan was £3,500,000, and li<=i extraordinary expenditure £4,500,000. There are many good Democrats in the Old Country-me n who love the people, who are urging the Government of Great Britain to spend £TOO.OOO,OOO on defence at once. in his bonnet on this subject. some honourable members, every one who wishes to have means taken for the defence of the country has a bee in his bonnet. The position of foreign affairs to-day is as grave as it could be, and urgent measures must be taken to keep up with the defence preparations of other countries. It will be useless spending money years hence. The critical time is now. It takes years to construct tlie modern implements of warfare. The only hopeful feature in the present international situation is the progress of matters at the Hague tribunal. There they have got nearer to the establishment of a universal High Court, where I hope that, ultimately, international disputes will be amicably settled. Until then we cannot relax our preparations to the extent of even foura farthing. If ever a Government was justified in taking a step forward in the interests of the safeguarding of the country, so. I dissent from the view of defence taken by the honourable member for Corio, who said last night-and the statement was current during the electoral campaignthat the object of defence is to prevent the confiscation of property. The .workman's hearth and home are infinitely more to him than is his castle to the rich man. If the latter be razed to the ground, the proprietor can build another. It is not so with the poor man. Defence, above all questions, should be broad-based on national considerations. every man shall contribute his share to the cost. the doctrine preached on the public platform. I preached. preached by the Labour candidates was that defence was purely for those who have property. Now, patriotism equal to any in the world is to be found in the poorest countries. Men love their native land, not for what they have invested in it, but because of the sentiment rooted there. They feel that they must defend it to the last shilling, and to the last man. Let me not be misunderstood. I do not wish the rich man to escape his proper share of the burden of defence. But it is a crime to make defence a class question. I have not time to deal adequately with the question of new Protection, but as my attitude towards it has been challenged several times during the debate, I may be allowed to say a word or two on the subject. The Minister of Trade and Customs has several times interjected that I have referred to new Protection as a mad-cap scheme, and from every platform in Victoria, during the last electoral campaign, I was denounced as having referred to new Protection in those terms. member do so?",31,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

252,Mr Thomas,"Did not the honorableno. Mi. JOSEPH COOK -The honourable member heard me say so before. If I can be shown a scheme which will increase prices and wages, and yet make goods cheaper, I shall heartily support it. know of no scheme which will do the trick. I have yet to learn that the cost of production can be increased and goods made cheaper. I admit that there are certain circumstances under which prices may be lowered. The trusts which are so heartily denounced by my honourable friends are doing it by the application of commercial methods in some instances. being done in any country of which I know by a simple Act of Parliament. never been against any proposal of a reasonable character that will insure for the worker his fair share of the benefits of impositions at the Customs House. waiting yet to be shown a way to secure it for him. I have seen none up-to-date except the plan that we proposed. That, I believe, is a workable scheme, but I am totally opposed to this Parliament at present annexing all the industrial powers of the States in order to begin to deal with this great intricate and complex problem. I hold the view that the States can, by dividing the problem, treat it very much better than we shall be able to do. I desire Federal intervention only for purely Federal purthese matters, to statements that have alposes. When these matters affect other States than those in which they occur, then, and then only, I say is the time for the Federal power to intervene, and in that way to help us over difficulties which otherwise would lead to anomalies and trouble. The industries of a particular State can deal with their own troubles better than a central authority thousands of miles away could do. I hope yet to see the Government institute a scheme that I can support which will give a real benefit to the workers of Australia. That the workers have not yet had, despite all our Tariff proposals, and notwithstanding the support which the Labour party have given Government after Government. In that matter, I am where I was. I abate nothing of my position; I am waiting still to see brought forward a scheme that will carry out that which we desire. If the Government can introduce a scheme that will give the workers more of the value of our protective duties, I do not believe that one member of the Opposition will, vote against it. Let that be distinctly understood. When, therefore, members of the Labour party mounted the public platforms at election time and declared that we denounced the new Protection, old members of that party in this House must have spoken I with their tongues in their cheeks, because they knew better. We denounced impossible schemes, and will continue to do so. We surely should be given credit for a genuine desire to help the great industries in this country in connection with any mat-, ter affecting the imposition of Customs duties. I find, by the way, that the Tariff question is no longer urgent. I used to read It is not in Victoria denunciations of my humble self in connection with Tariff matters.

258,Mr Joseph Cook,"The honorablehis manifesto, tliat the Labour part}' were out to kill land monopoly by means of this tax. conclusive enough. Why did the honourable member deny, then, that the main object of the tax was to burst up large estates ? ber is not comparing like with like. The two matters are distinct. we cannot half quibble with terms as these caucus men can. like the honourable member can. shall never attempt to quibble with terms as the Labour paity do. This is what the honourable member for Werriwa said after the electionI f the party came before the people in three years' time, and the big estates were not burst iip, the people should consider them unworthy of their confidence. That was a straightforward statement, and the Attorney-General, speaking at Glebe, said of his partyTheir purpose was to burst up these big estates and readily available to the poorer classes which sucked up the life blood of Australia. Their purpose was to do that by means of the proposed land tax. That being so, why all this quibbling on the part of the Prime Minister, who now says that they never said anything of the kind ? Does he dissociate himself from the caucus in these matters ? about quibbling, but surely that is a quibble. is not, but it was a quibble on the part of the Prime Minister to say that his party is not out to burst up big estates. worried about his big estate? already been told by my honourable friends of the caucus that they will let my 25 acres alone. There are many members of the caucus more concerned about tlieir estates than I am; I have nothing that the tax will touch, they have. The honourable member should not make these personal references, for I have no sympathy with large estates that interfere with the progress of land settlement. used to say that our proposal was unconstitutional. the inconsistency of such a statement? I still think that the objective of the tax will be found to be unconstitutional. I still think that the Labour party are wasting time in what they are doing in this connection. not induce any of his lawyer friends to say so. I put it to the people of Australia that if can quibble the Government were to burst up the large estates of the Commonwealth to-morrow they would not have an atom of power to give any man a title to an inch of land. On tliat I based the plea that the matter had better be left to those whose land policy it is to deal with estates and to settle people upon the land. I believe that my plan would be infinitely more effectual in making land available than the mere bursting-up policy which my honourable friends have in view. I do not quarrel with them as to their objective, which I take to be mainly the making of land easily of the community. I understand that they wish to make more land available to people with very small means;'but I hold that their proposed tax will not have that effect. Let me say why I object-to a tax of the kind proposed. I am repeating now what I have said before in this House, and would not need to repeat but for the number of new members. When1 interjected, during the course of a speech made by a Minister, that there was no principle underlying this land tax, I meant what I said. I hold that there is neither principle nor potency in it, and that any land taxer like the honourable member for Lang-wh o was being taunted when I interjected-wh o believes in the principle of land taxation, should fight tooth and nail against a proposition of this kind, which is not based upon principle and will not be effectual for the purpose in view. My objections to a graduated land tax of this kind are these: In the first place, we must remember that the question of land monopoly is not under consideration just now. I have said already that I do not believe that land monopoly ought to stand in the way of people obtaining the land which they need for settlement. It is one of the most urgent questions of the day, and I should like to",33,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

Further, it applies the principle of improper discrimination to the various lands of Australia, and in the end will defeat the purpose that the Labour party have in view. It will tax a large estate irrespective of its and-1 quality, suitability, and the facilities for working it.

But the moment that has been done, and the land comes into the category of land which pays no tax, it will immediately begin to increase in value. orable member sees that that is no consolation for the man who wants land and has no money to buy it with.

295,Mr Joseph Cook,"On e thing at aconcerned. been a steady increase in land value year by year, in spite of the imposition of graduated land 'taxes. In 1897, the land values of New Zealand averaged ^116 per head of the population, whereas to-day, eleven years later, the average is £168 per head. With an increase of 25 per cent, in population, there has been an increase in land values of over 100 per cent. Land is being brought out of the category of the bursting-up tax, and put into the category of land which pays no tax, and up, therefore, goes the value steadily year by year. Ioi New Zealand to-day the land is dearer to the man who has no money than it ever was before. What the Government are really doing is to minister to the middle section of landowners-to the men who have capital to buy land the moment it is available-and these will take good care, for the preservation of their own values, not to allow the land to remain on the market very long. The Commonwealth Government cannot touch land policy, and, therefore, cannot l if t a finger, with our present powers, to prevent the multiplication of middle-class estates. effective tax will, as I say, cancel the very object in view, and will not make land readily available to the poorer people of the community; that will still be a problem for the States. That is the position we on this side take up on the question; and I think it is a very different attitude from that with which we were credited during the election, namely, that we were behind the rich squatters of Australia. We believe in reform in the only reasonable and effective way in which it can be accomplished. We believe that, as the land administration has been left with the States, and as they have the facilities and machinery for doing what is sought to be done now by the Commonwealth Government, it ought to remain with the States to administer all matters of land policy-to make land available for the people of Australia. I believe that a wide and wise distribution of land is the best basis for any State or any community; and I know nobody on this side who discredits a theory of that kind, though we may disagree as to the methods by which it can be realized. And when the land problem has been settled, as proposed by the Government, we shall not have brought about the millennium. good enough for me.. &r. Josefh Cook. wrong inference will be drawn from what I am now about to say. Had we not better iri the supremest of our problems-thos e problems, I mean, which affect the industrial life of the community, and the prosperity, solidity, and stability of the country -giv e each other credit for a little common sense and a little patriotic feeling? Do not let honourable members run away with the notion that I am not in favour of making land available when I draw their attention to the condition of things in France. I am not quite clear, but I think that in that country there are about 7,000,000 small land-holders; and yet can it be said that France to-day is better off than England? In spite of the lapse of 100 years since the great French Revolution, with the holding of land broadening, deepening, and multiplying itself, so far as its facilities for the poor peasant of the country are concerned that there are 13,000,000 people in England who do not know where their breakfast is to come from. This isolated, inefficient, inheard that Mr Balfour said that. gued whether the figure was 8,000,000 or 13,000,000. tach importance to statistics, and all the statistics that I can get hold of show that England to-day is in a better position than France, Germany, or any similar country, so far as the working men are concerned. All policy should ultimately translate itself into good conditions for the workers, and that is the test I am applying. Although France has multiplied her small holdings a thing I am heartily in agreement with -le t no honourable member think that the millennium will be brought about when they have burst up the big estates, and particularly in the manner proposed by the Government. Germany has made singular progress in recent years; she is the wonder of the world in the way she has lifted her head industrially and socially. Yet. although Germany has rushed to the front industrially, and has created better conditions for her working men, the figures show that her rural lands are going rapidly out of cultivation. very bad thing, but even that does not prestep at a time is vent a nation from prospering.

He is one of those men who smile, but there are few men in this House more bitter in their hearts. I know him well. I had intended saying something on the question of immigration, because it is associated with the land question. I tell my honourable friends candidly and plainly that if they can secure a large influx of population, and so take the only adequate course for the defence of Australia, I , for one, shall be prepared to concede a great deal to them. I know no question to compare with this in its far-reaching importance. We must get more people into Australia somehow or other. I have yet to see how their proposals will work out in this direction, but come the people must, if we are to hold and develop this country, and prosper in it. I therefore hope my honourable friends will devote their energies to this question, than which I can conceive none more important to the ultimate destinies of Australia. In all these matters of national and Imperial concern, there ought surely to be a little room for differences of opinion as to the methods of application. That is all I am claiming and contending for. They say that they can solve all these troubles; but if I canso readily disposed of.

I am reminded by the prodigious length of his effort of an anecdote about that eminent historian Guicciardini, who wrote the history of Italy. The alternative being offered to a convict sentenced to life in the galleys, of reading that history, of which I think there were twenty volumes, or continuing his lifelong punishment, he read the first volume and came back with tears in his eyes, asking to be allowed to go back io the galleys. The honourable member has. in the Encyclopaedia Cookania to which he has treated us, touched upon all the matters contained in the Speech, which represents what the Opposition Leader declared to be the fit and proper way of setting forth the policy of the Government. We see now, for the first time, the realization of those admirable rhetorical aspirations that that honourable and learned gentleman put forward. There is nothing that I can recall with which the honourable member for Parramatta has not dealt. There is nothing that he has said that I have not heard him say before, and very much better than he has said it now. His remarks fall naturally under two heads-thos e that are relevant and those that are irrelevant. The first may be dismissed in a breath; the others, which call for some notice, are not my present disposition and in the temper of the House, already too sorely tried, to attempt to follow the honourable member through all the labyrinthine passages of his Let us apeffort, but I must crave the indulgence of the House while I say a word or two byLet us bring our way of reply. I cannot help congratulating the honourable member upon the perI say this advisedly. The honourable member has, in a long and chequered career, been converted to many things many times, but to none of them, so far as I know, has his conversion been more marked or more sincere than to the defence of Australia. A little while agoI mean before he was in office-hi s attitude towards the naval defence of Australia was that of the right honourable gentleman who was then the leader of his party-that the power of the British Fleet concentrated in the North Sea was sufiicient, not only for Australia, but for the rest of the Empire. They urged that all of us might sleep securely beneath her mighty wing, and that all that was necessary at the mostwas to increase the number of Dreadnoughts in the North Sea.",37,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

320,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"AttorAs for the military defence of the Commonwealth, no words of mine could depict the extremity of the honourable member's contempt for compulsory training, yet he is now amongst its most enthusiastic advocates,, and poses as a man whose slumbers have been disturbed by visions of Germany, ever on the alert, spending £13,000,000 a year, building feverishly night and day, and crowding with a new fleet the narrow waters about her own coast and those of Great Britain. He says he congratulates us on what we have done, and would have the country believe that we have given effect to some policy of his. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing that he has ever done in the way of defence is worthy of a moment's consideration or emulation, except in so far as he has followed blindly and without initiative in the tracks that we have made for him. The naval and military policies of the last Government were taken without acknowledgment, holusbolus, from the programme of the Labour Government that went before them. Nothing that they did or said added a solitary letter, a solitary man, or a solitary ship to them. They sent Home to the Naval Conference a man to represent the Government's views, but what were those views? So far as Ministerial unanimity was concerned, they had no views. They were a tabula rasa, and on their plastic surface a Naval Conference, or other powerful body, could write what message it pleased. The representative of the Government came back with certain views, which the Government adopted before they knew them. The result is their naval policy. As for their military policy, as I had the pleasure of telling the honourable member for Parramatta when he introduced his Bill, there was nothing good in it except the basic principle. The application resulted in nothing. It would not create an army to defend Australia. It would merely create the machinery by which an army could be created, and disband the men before they were fit to be called soldiers. I do not think there is any necessity to refer, except briefly, to the honourable member's remarks about the land tax. Apparently, the honourable member is in favour of land value taxation. We learn this fact with an amount of astonishment equal to that with which we received the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that he is not only in favour of a land [14] tax, but is surprised that no one has proposed before a remedy so easy of application, so effective, and so necessary. The honourable member for Parramatta approves of land value taxation, but disapproves of the proposed application of it. He says that our graduated land tax will Jse a penal tax, because it will apply to all land, irrespective of the use to which it is being put. In point of economic unwisdom, that is the utterance of a child. It is the peculiar feature of land value taxation that it is immaterial whether the land to which it is applied is, or is not, being used. By his criticism, the honourable member exposes his partisanship, or his complete ignorance of the subject with which he dealt. It is conceivable that an evening might be spent more distastefully than in listening to the honourable member's statistics regarding the condition of Germany, France, and England, of which he gave us a glimpse, but his remarks on that head were scarcely relevant. Like others of his party, he had a great deal to say about the caucus. No doubt, if one were to follow Satan into the lowest depths of Hades, the latter would have a great deal to say about Heaven as a place where he once spent many happy hours, and whence he was at length expelled for some harmless peccadillo. The honourable member for Parramatta was born and bred, politically, in a caucus, and gathered from his youthful associations what originality and virility he now possesses. Yet he poses as if his lily-white wings are not besmirched by the atmosphereof what, he would have it believed, is. a political pest house. I have been trying to understand the cause of these eternal references to the caucus, in connection with the occupancy of the Treasury bench by Labour Ministers. The Labour party has been meeting in caucus for the last sixteen years. During the five years that the party supported the Reid Government in New South Wales, when the honourable member for Parramatta was a Minister in it, our organization was the theme of perennial panegyric. It was an admirable institution then, because it kept him in office. For the seven years during which it kept his colleague, the present Leader of the Opposition, in office, we heard nothing against it. Its weaknesses, if observed, were not exposed. No man criticised them above his breath, while its virtues were spoken of with affectionate reverence from the housetops.

There has been elected t Honourable members opposite can be adopted than to discuss among be given to our principles ? opposite lean with such affectionate reverence, especially at election times-that is able to carry on without the unsparing use of the caucus. No man shall dare to go against the decisions of the lodge and yet live politically ! In the last Parliament an honourable member, now no longer in the House, told us of a man who was expelled from a lodge because he had dared to vote for him when his lodge said that he must vote for some one else. It is from the lips of gentlemen such as these that we are to hear criticisms of the. caucus ! It is from the lips of honourable members, many of whom were nurtured by and baptised in such institutions, that we are to hear denunciations and babble about the relation between responsible government and the caucus ! Are they speaking to a kindergarten? Is there anything that they say that has relation to fact ? If there is, what record of which any party might be proud, is it? The honourable member, in one of those rare attempts at humour with which he interspersed his speech, said that the caucus dealt with questions with which the best intellects are wrestling in vain. By best intellects here are we to understand a sly reference to the honourable gentleman? The honourable member has not hesitated to deal with every question and to settle it to his own satisfaction. I suppose that the unemployed problem is one of the greatest that concerns mankind to-day, but he had a solution of it. And what was it? The simplest and most pleasant proposal that one could imagine. It might be applied by a child, and would furnish amusement for a summer evening to people of both sexes without danger either to their morals or to their physical well-being. It was simply this : That the condition being that people were unemployed, there should, be established labour bureaux, so that those who were without work might go to where work called for them, and had hitherto called for them in vain. It was, politically, economically, and industrially, a kind of mono-rail along which unemployed men would be seen bowling their industrial way. 'A man unemployed in Tasmania would be sent to CapeYork or to Fremantle, where work would be found for him. There was really no such thing as unemployment. There was merely, as it were, a congestion of unemployed in one place, and a scarcity of workers in another. It was assumed that distribution was all that was really necessary. My honourable friend, after some twenty years in public life, put forth that proposal with all the assurance of one who had discovered some entirely novel [ I 4 J -2 principle which would solve this great problem. It was to such a scheme that the Leader of the Opposition alluded when he expressed regret that there had been omitted from the Governor General's Speech all reference to the establishment of an agricultural bureau and a labour bureau. The record of the last Government, indeed, was largely a record of bureaux. So far as anything original is concerned, I think they may be said to have gyrated around some three or four points. The Financial Agreement was to be embodied in the Constitution. That was the iate Government's own proposal, and no one wishes to rob them of it. The naval loan was also a proposition of their own, while the proposals for the establishment of an agricultural bureau and a labour bureau were made off their own bat. Such is a and it was upon that record, with some other measures which might properly be described as trimmings, that the Leader of the Opposition went to tlie country and asked the people to return him and his party. The honourable member made some observations very similar to those made last night by the honourable member for Parkes in regard to the caucus. The Governor General's Speech, he said, had been drafted by the caucus. Eveni f it had been, I do not know that it would be a very serious matter, because, after all, a caucus composed of sixty-five representatives of the people would be just as likely to make a good job of the work as would any individual or party. But when we contrast this state of things with the system that has prevailed, we are. thrown into a condition of melancholy. In the days that are gone independent and manly spirits abounded. There was then no reference to the caucus. Then a political leader stood resolute against all dominance and improper influence. He was his own man. Occasionally, however;he was some one else's man. By way of illustration of this, I propose to quote a few words from an introduction written by my versatile friend the honourable member for Ballarat to David Syme, the Father of Protection in Australia, by Ambrose Pratt-a n admirable work dealing with the life of a man who has left his mark on the history of Australia. At page xvii. of that introduction, the honourable member wroteIn yet another aspect the position of the Age in Victoria challenged comparison with that of other papers within or without Australia. The relations between its proprietor and public men were intimate to a surprising degree. He enjoyed their confidence in and out of office, shaping their programmes from time to time, governing their selection of colleagues as incoming Premiers, and enjoying afterwards a laiowledge of the inmost secrets of Cabinets often undisclosed to many of the Ministers within them. Directly or indirectly most of the active politicians in Victoria took care to keep in touch with the Age office; though the best -of them, even if they belonged to its own party, Ministers supposed to represent the were treated with no special consideration in its Crown.

I suppose the party were asked: was not the man who stood at the head of "" Do you accept this manifesto or agreethe Government, nor any one of those ment?"" and they had to either accept it or responsible to the people, not one of the reject it. I understand that four men did phalanx of obedient marionettes who stood reject it, namely, the honourable member behind their so-called leader, thinking Mr Hughes. that the elastic was not attached to their heads, but who danced, nevertheless, to the tune'lie set them-bu t a newspaper proprietor. The late Mr David Syme, the honourable member for Ballarat tells us, drafted their programmes, selected their Ministries, shaped their policy, and had revealed to him secrets that were not divulged to responsible in e.xcelsis, then I am glad that we have for Hume, the honourable member for Gippsland, the honourable member for Riverina, and the then honourable member for Bass. All the rest bowed their knee to Baal; and when I look around these benches, I see that Baal has done badly. In that manifesto it was declared, as to Protection, that, in the meantime, any anomember said that we should be justified in malies that might be "" discovered in the Customs Tariff Act then lately passed by Parliament, would be examined, classified, and dealt with in due course."" The honourable member for Parramatta had something to say about a paragraph in the Governor General's Speech which he ascribed to me, and characterized as ambiguous, and as betraying ""careful inexactitude""; but I venture to say that, for comprehensive vagueness, and for ""careful inexactitude,"" the quotation I have just made will hold its own. It will repay a little trouble to look at it when we consider what that party did in relation to it. Did they discover any anomalies during their term of office of eight months? If so, where and what are they? If they discovered any, they never made the discovery public. they classify anomalies? We do not know. Did they examine them? We are not told. Did they deal with them? We know that they did not. And yet these gentlemen denounce the Government because it does not at once proceed to deal with Tariff anomalies. come back to power, what would they have done? What would such a Government, recruited from such a source, and born under such conditions, have done? Nobody knows. have proceeded to deal with Tariff anomalies. The honourable member also referred to the honourable member for Darling having said that Protection was in danger by reason of the Fusion of parties, and to my having said that Free Trade was in danger by reason of the same event. But I hold that we were perfectly justified in giving expression to these opinions, however inconsistent they may appear. must be in danger when there is an alliance between men who believe not in either Free Trade or true Protection, but in Revenue Tariffism and so-called Protection; and, Free Trade must be in danger for precisely the same reason. party to which I belong the only fiscalism to which we are pledged is a direct fiscalism. We look to raising revenue by other means than recourse to the Customs House-to us Protective duties mean Protective duties, and not revenue duties. I pass by the statement of the honourable member that the land tax is only useful for revenue purposes, and so forth, and desire to call the attention of honourable members to the question of borrowing for naval defence. The honourable spending anything-h e did not say up to how much-in order to put our house in order. AllI have to say is that die policy which has sufficed the greatest naval power in the woild from time immemorial-the policy of paying for the construction of all war-ships out of revenue-is good enough for us. As to the little references to a bankers' conference, and to the manager of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, they remind us, when looking over them subsequently, of nothing so much as a room in which a number of rats or mice have left the nibbled remains of papers littered about. Does anybody seriously heed such statements? Is it said for a moment that there was a conference with bankers, and that something was discussed Did in secret which the Prime Minister has some reason for hiding from the public? Every one knows that there was nothing of the sort. Then it is said that the manager of the Norddeutscher Lloyd said that the Government did not propose to injure the company's business; and, of course, Had the late Government we do not. Why should we? We are here to legislate for the benefit of the country; and if , in doing so, we tread on the corns of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company, we cannot help it. We do not go out of the Certainly they would not way to tread on anybody's corns, but we shall not allow any one to stand between us and what we conceive to be for the benefit of the people. The honourable member's remark about unification may pass. Mr Wade, in New South Wales, during the Federal elections, did what he was able in the direction of stemming the tide, and failed miserably. These remarks about unification will not hurt us now, nor will Protection the attempt to frighten tlie people in regard to it. In speaking of appropriating the Trust Funds, the honourable member tried to convey the impression that this Government had been guilty of an act of a kind for which men are sent In the to gaol; that is to say, he suggested that the act was done innocently enough, but that it was in the nature of a criminal offence. But tlie people of Australia ought to be told that Trust Funds under tbe control of the Commonwealth are not Trust Funds in the sense that the term is and, therefore, I asked the people to vote used in connection with ordinary trustees, against it until there was a clearer underbut are Funds created by appropriations standing that one party should have confor certain uses, and that the Commontrol, and there should be such other amendwealth wrongs no person by using them. ment of the section of the ConstituWhat happened in this particular instance tion as would give the Commonwas that, in order to make that adjustwealth Treasurer an absolutely free hand. ment which is absolutely necessary _ in There is in that nothing inconsistent with these cases, an amount was debited against our present attitude. It was perfectly one of these Trust Funds. Theoretically justified by the circumstances, and I am or technically there was an invasion pleased to think that the people of New of that Trust Fund, but practically, South Wales adopted it. My honourable and in fact, the Trust Fund was not friend, when alluding to the rates of wages, touched. On the morning of the day folcompared things as they are now with things lowing, when the accounts were made up, as they will be. He said that wages were now the amount of revenue that had come in very high, and that people throughout Auswas sufficient to put the Trust Fund in tralia were most prosperous. If men are credit again. keeping adjustment, and nothing more. So due? To them? Not for one moment. much for the charge of our using Trust There is not a law on the statute-book of Funds.

For seven years the other Mr Hughes. It was, in short, a bookreceiving good wages now, to whom is it What has been done has been The Government which, assisted by the What ceded us? A White Australia, industrial Governments existed with the support of the Labour party. The honourable member for Parramatta has spoken about Governments bringing down their policy unshaped by external influences, but he knows perfectly well that he has, on the floor of the House, denounced the honourable and learned member for Ballarat for submitting his policy to the caucus for approval before he brought it down. He knows that the honourable and learned gentleman did so submit it, and that it was approved by the caucus. Wide Bay has often said that it is not correct that the policy of the Ministry was submitted to the caucus. occasion. on the formation of my first Government, a list of the measures that we intended to submit, but that was just for his information. gentleman puts in his categorical refutation, I shall be very glad to furnish proofs, nine billets, and there were more than which, I think, will be perfectly satisfactory to the House and the country, that the position is exactly as I say. Further, it is true that the honourable gentleman declined to carry on unless we did approve of his policy. I think he was perfectly right in so doing. of criticism of him, because no man could expect to carry on government here with the support of members unless those members had had an opportunity of seeing the policy and knowing what they were going to vote for. The Labour party demanded that, and the honourable member was not only willing that it should be done, but insisted upon its being done. We had a perfect right to know what he was going to bring in, and he to know what we were going to do in regard to it. So, when the honourable member for Parramatta speaks of Governments before the Flood bringing down mighty programmes unshaped and unseen by the hand of mortal man until they saw the light of day for the first time when read by His Excellency, I reply that, historically, those assertions are not correct. The honourable member for Parramatta said that, after denouncing the inclusion of ten men in the Cabinet, we ourselves put ten men in. So we did, but I say again that the circumstances are entirely different. One would imagine that the circumstances under which a thing is done matter nothing, but I say they matter everything. To give a man £ 5 because he saved your life is one thing, but to give him £ 5 to kill another man is quite another, although the amount is just the same. A man comes to your, own church, and kneels with you in your own pew. There is no necessity to give such a man place and power to induce him to worship at your altar and accept the tenets of your creed, for these things he accepts already. But it is an entirely different matter if you want to proselytize him, to make him a traitor and a renegade. On the formation of the last Government there were at least two, if not three, factions was on one that came together under circumstances which will, perhaps, not be entirely known in our time. They agreed on some sort of modus vivendi, the basis of which was a division of spoils. What they said was, "" It is true that you were elected to oppose me, and I to oppose you, but come with the honourable me and let us go, and, here-perhap s this will help you along."" There were only thirty-nine of those gentlemen. Indeed, there were more than forty of them, although forty seems an eminently appropriate number for such a band engaged in such a business. It was suggested that the number of billets should be increased, and I am not saying this by way they were increased. The gravamen of our charge was not that they elected the Speaker honourable member not to go into that question. that they had ten Ministers instead of nine, but that the principle of giving men rewards for breaking their faith with. the public was absolutely incompatible with representative government, and that if men might be induced to break their pledges for money or pomp, or place and power, it was impossible to regard the Parliament as representing the people in any proper sense of the term. But with us it is entirely different. There is not'a man sitting behind us, and belonging to our party, that is not pledged to the people to support the planks of the Labour platform-that is to say, of the policy of the Government. We have not to give them a billet before they",38,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

328,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [6.15],"IHume, with four other Protectionists, refused to agree to the Fusion to which the rest of our party lent itself. We felt that we must stand by our platform pledges. This sticking to principle we regarded as essential to representative government. During the electoral campaign, almost superhuman efforts were made to bring about the defeat of at least two of us. The honourable member for Hume may fairly express his pleasure at the manner in which our position was vindicated, not only by our constituents, but by most of the constituencies of the Commonwealth. It was said that my first election to this House was the result of apathy on the part of electors, that only a certain percentage of the electors had recorded their votes, and that if 1; or 2 per cent, more had voted, I should not have been elected. But at the last election, when 7 or 8 per cent, more voted, I was returned by a majority of as many thousands and hundreds as the Prime Minister of the day was returned by a majority of only hundreds and tens. Nor was there any apathy on the part of the Fusionists. I had a Senator stumping the whole of my electorate, and candidates for the Senate doing their utmost to defeat me. Two paid organizers of the Farmers' League, one of whom has since told a Court that he has been unable to pay his debts on a salary of £ 5 a week, spoke against me, in addition to a paid representative of the Women's League, and several private members of it, and five or six local political aspirants. The ex-Prime Minister also addressed two meetings in my constituency. The utmost efforts were made to punish me for standing by the principles which I had advocated at the previous election. Under these circumstances, we are entitled to exult at our success. HadI broken my election promises and put aside the principles which I had advocated, by associating with men to whose principles I have been always bitterly opposed, and who had opposed the Governments which I had supported, finding nothing too bad to say of them. I should not have been called upon to face this antagonism. But we must say good-bye to representative government if the people cannot trust their representatives to remain true to their election pledges. We are elected on the strength of our platform utterances. If , having been elected to support a certain policy, we -associate with men opposed to that policy, -we offend against representative government. I interjected, when the honourable member for Parramatta was saying that the people had not endorsed the programme of the Labour party, that they had voted against the Fusion. It is admitted by Labour members that the triumph of their party was due, not merely to the increase in the number of their direct supporters, but to the fact that thousands of Liberals and Protectionists who detested the Fusion voted for them. These Liberals and Protectionists had to vote for candidates who had fixed things up for their own safety at the elections, without regard to their hustings pledges, treating their constituents as mere pawns in the great game of politics; or to refrain from voting; or to vote for Labour candidates. In voting for Labour candidates they may not have voted for the Labour policy, but they knew what it was, and that the party, if returned to power, would carry it into effect. They preferred that to trusting the administration of the affairs of the country to the Fusionists. The Labour party cannot cherish bitter feelings towards the Liberal section of the Fusion party, because their action has enabled it to win a tremendous victory, which otherwise might not have been gained for many years. The people feel that the Labour party can be trusted. Knowing the leaders of the party-no t irresponsible members of it who advocate extreme ideas outside Parliament-the y feel sure that they will do nothing detrimental to the interests of Australia. As one who has known those leaders in Parliament for the last three years, I am certain that no harm will be done to the public interest, though I do not agree with the whole of the Labour programme, and shall vote against such parts of it as I disapprove of. The electors could not do other than they did, and I , for one, rejoice at what was done. I do not rejoice at the defeat of former colleagues. I am sorry that they committed political suicide.

330,Mr Wise,"I know that some peoplethe honourable member for Ballarat's criticism of the then Opposition policy during the recess of 1908-9, and also bore in mind what his old policy was, and what was the policy to which effect was given by the Fusion Government, they would not for one moment deny that the honourable member for Parramatta had emerged triumphant, and carried his policy right through. did.

That is the only compromise, so far as I am aware, of which he was guilty. that we did. many other things, but that was the only part of our policy that was carried out. for Kitchener to frame a policy. brought in their scheme before they sent for Lord Kitchener. They passed a Defence Bill providing for the compulsory training of youths up to the age of twenty years, and a member of the Labour party moved an amendment providing that the compulsory training age should be extended to twenty-six years. That was the essence of the Bill introduced by Sir Thomas Ewing as Minister of Defence in a previous Deakin Administration. Yet every member of the Fusion party, including Sir Thomas Ewing, voted against that amendment. in error in saying that Sir Thomas Ewing's original proposal for compulsory service up to the age of twenty-six years was the same as that afterwards submitted to the House. which the honourable member for Gippsland refers provided for practically what Lord Kitchener proposed in his report, so far as the age limit was concerned, yet the honourable member for Parramatta voted against it. Ewing's proposal was to make training compulsory up to the age of twenty-six years, whereas the Bill introduced by the late Government limited the application of the principle to youths not exceeding twenty years of age. available up to twenty-six years of age. available by one registration a year after they had reached the age of twenty years There was enough to swear by, but nothing more. There was nothing in the Bill providing that there should be regulation training up to the age of twenty-six years, as had been proposed by Sir Thomas Ewing, and that was the object of the amendment which was moved, I think, by the late Mr Hutchison. There was only one feature connected with the defeat of the late Government, and Lord Kitchener's recommendation that the age must be increased to twenty-five years, which grieved me, and that was that I had looked forward with a somewhat grim satisfaction to seeing the honourable member for Parramatta, as Minister of Defence, bringing in a Bill to provide for compulsory training up to that age. That, however, might have been too great a price to pay for the honourable member's retention on the Treasury Bench. Sitting suspended from 6.30 io 7.45 p.m. journed for dinner I referred to the result of the last general election, and pointed out that the majority that had been returned to this side of the House was a vindication of the true principle of representative government, that members should remain loyal to the pledges they give. Great as that majority is, it would have been much larger if there had been in operation a system of preferential voting, the second ballot or the contingent vote, so that every man returned to the House would represent the majority of those voting in his constituency. A promise to provide for such an electoral system was certainly a prominent feature of the speechmade in the -Town Hall, Melbourne, by amendment to the present Leader of the Opposition when the Fusion was launched. He said thenthat his Government would bring in a measure to provide for a member representing in every case an absolute majority of theelectors voting in his constituency. On three occasions last session I pressed the Fusion Government to say when they intended to deal with the matter, and was told emphatically on the last occasion, by the then Prime Minister, that a Bill would be -introduced that session. the last.",47,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

If we had had in force some such system as I have mentioned, there would probably have been returned to this side of the House a greater majority than we have, because, as has already been mentioned, six members of the Opposition represent a minority of the voters in their respective electorates. When referring to the question of who had surrendered their principles, I said that those of my old party who joined the Fusion had done so. As a party, I think that that section of the Fusion undoubtedly suffered the worse at the last general election. Five of them were rejected; two got back by comparatively small majorities; one represents a minority of the votes polled in his constituency; and only two were returned by fairly large majorities, showing that their constituents approved of their action.

It was used then after a five-hours' debate, and was applied to the first member of the then Opposition who spoke against the measure. Why it was used, no one knows. It was then not 11 p.m. Shortly afterwards, it was used again, the only reason for its application being, so far as one could judge, that honourable members wished to catch the last suburban trains. About half-an-hour after midnight, it was used for a third time. Even the last suburban trains had gone, so that it was impossible to say what was the reason for its application.

370,Mr Wise,"I am not surprised at theof a revolution to strike out the Financial Agreement once it had been embodied in the Constitution. There was nothing more gratifying at the last election than to find, on the first appeal made on the question of the States versus Nationalism-and on a subject not at all favorable to stirring up people in the National interests-the electors, and particularly the young Australians, were sufficiently impressed with the importance of the occasion to respond to the National call, as against the dominance and attempted dictation of the State Premiers and State politicians, who attempted, by their manifestoes, to influence the electors. It is right, when on this point, to pay a tribute of praise to the great work done by the Melbourne Age. This was the only big daily newspaper, so far as I am aware, in Australia that fought the National issue; and it must be gratifying to the conductors of that great journal that they came through victoriously, as it was gratifying to those who were fighting for the National cause to know that they had this newspaper with them. I do not intend to deal with the various points of the Government policy, as disclosed in the Governor General's Speech, seeing that we shall have an opportunity later to deal with the measures as they come before us; and to do so now would only mean repetition. I am still of the opinion which I uttered on my entrance to this House, when I moved the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, that the discussion on such a motion as tliat now before us might well be abolished; indeed, that opinion is more confirmed than ever. I do not know, except when the Government is challenged, that the discussion on the Address-in-Reply is of any use whatever. I cannot see that it clears the decks for action; because the discussion on the various subjects is practically ""lost. I had no intention of speaking, and would not have, risen, had it not been for the remarks made to-day by the honourable member for Parramatta in reference to my old colleague, the honourable member for Hume. Knowing what that honourable member went through during the strenuous work of last session, and how his health broke down, as did that of other honourable members, some of whom have passed away, I could not, as one who went through that fight with him, hear what was said in his absence to-day, without resenting, on the first possible occasion, the impuloyalty to one who was associated with me tation that in his speech he was gloating ever the defeat of his former colleagues. same. could expect, to get from the honourable member for Parramatta, the generous admission that what he had said in an ill tempered way was uttered in the heat of debate. tempered way. He singled the honourable members out by name, and gloated over their defeat. Hume did single out certain names; but I do not think there was any gloating; he was simply exulting that his policy and action had been vindicated, just as in the same way the Australian correspondent of The Times, expressed his gratification that his iprophecy in regard to the Fusion party had been fulfilled. When the Fusion party was formed, that correspondent, in his cablegram to The Times, saidMr Deakin seems to hope that the temporary association of the three sections will eventually cause an approximation of views and a consolidation into one party, but it is more probable that whenever a dissolution comes the whole of the present arrangement will be shattered at the polls. In the issue of 28th May last, the same correspondent rejoices that his prediction has come true, but it cannot be said that he is guilty of gloating. Nobody regrets more than I that the members mentioned by the honourable member for Hume-and the meremention of the names is no sign of gloating -were defeated. Some of them. I was associated with as personal friends for years, and I felt bitter regret when I saw them join the Fusion, knowing that they were, as I told them at the time, committing political suicide. I am sorry to think that their action has led to their political doom at the hands of the electors, who, doubtless, felt that they had been wronged; and I am satisfied that if the honourable members referred to had that time over again there would be no Fusion. I do not expect to get such an admission, but I do not think any one of my party who joined the Fusion can ever have said that they were glad at having done so, or that they would be prepared to do so again if they had the opportunity of staying out. I have to apologize to the House for taking up so.much time, but in a strenuous fight demanded an expression of my views in reply to the charge",50,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly his remarks as to the possible danger from an alteration of our system of government. I confess that it was with some anxiety I contemplated that alteration. Formerly, our caucus was composed of a minority, and there was every reason why that minority should work unitedly together to insure the ""strongest possible loyalty to one another. Owing to the mistakes of honourable members opposite we are now a very powerful party in both Houses, but we still maintain the caucus system. Personally, I must confess I had some anxiety when I saw that we had such a majority combined with a continuance of that system; but as time flies I am satisfied that the caucus, as we now have it, is an improvement on the system of government carried on by our friends of the Opposition. I see no reason why we should not accept responsibility for the fact tiiat the Government programme was submitted to the caucus. We will admit that 011 the items of the party programme the party is consulted, and that every member is bound by the majority vote. As to matters which are not on the party platform there is the utmost freedom of action; and during this debate honourable members had sufficient evidence of that in the speeches of the honourable' member for Gwydir and the honourable member for Cook. What is the difference between the two systems? The honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Ballarat have spoken, the latter possibly in bitter terms, of the ""iron rule"" of the caucus. But the ""iron rule"" of the caucus, so far as I understand it, simply means terms,"" say strong terms. honourable member for Ballarat made a very amiable address, I shall get over the difficulty. So far as I have observed the effects of the so-called "" iron rule "" of the caucus, it only means that the Labour party demand that a Labour representative shall cany out his pledges, and that if he fails to do so they will do their level best to keep him out of Parliament. We do not find a system of punishment pursued by the Labour party throughout Australia, such as is meted out to any one on the. other side who dares to offend against party principles. said is that the Labour party have succeeded in defeating candidates who formerly belonged to the party; indeed, I suppose there are fifteen or sixteen members whose names I need not mention, but who have been defeated because of disloyalty to the party which brought them into political life. All that can be pointed to is the decision of the people of the Commonwealth tiiat these candidates shall no longer be members of Parliament. Let us take the other side. Do honourable members not know of, or are they blind to, the treatment that the honourable member for Parkes received the moment he felt disposed to exercise a little of his liberty of action and thought? What was the sriticism which appeared in the Daily Telegraph, of Sydney, for example? That paper made the honourable member come to heel, so to speak; and Mr Henry Willis, the ex-member for Robertson, was also brought up to the bull-ring by the other side because he chose to differ from them. Other members on the other side who represent what may not unfairly be described as the capitalistic section, know the secret influences that can be brought to bear to prevent a man even getting a living. How many briefs would the honourable member for Parkes get in tbe Courts if he were to sign the Labour platform? The honourable member for Darling Downs will be able to tell us from his experience what treatment is meted out to barristers who dare to advocate any of t\n planks of the Labour platform, or any Labour principles. Honourable members know that if any man in business-and most men in business work on overdraftsdares to advocate the Labour programme, he will quickly get a notice from his bank that he must discontinue doing so, or clear off his overdraft. That is a common experience. In many business houses, if an employee associates himself with the Labour party so far as to mount the platform, he often receives notice to leave his employment. ber think the banks will give a man notice",51,Governor General S Speech Who Have Assisted Address In Reply

If the Addressin-Reply debate were done away with, honourable members would not have the opportunity which they now have, of emphasizing those reforms which do not happen to find a place in the Government programme. the retention of this standing order, as this appears to be the best time, that is, at the commencement of a session, for members to refer to matters which are not in the Governor General's Speech. One of those matters is the abrogation of the custom which formerly obtained in this Parliament, of the wearing of the wig and gown by the Speaker. I congratulate you, sir, upon having abandoned those habiliments, for if there is one thing which gives the public outside an idea of the extravagance of Parliament, it is the adoption of such forms and ceremonies. The mace, which finds a place on I am not at all the table when you are in the Chair, and is put under the table when you leave the Chair, is another piece of furniture which I hope to see removed from the House and placed in a museum"". There are one or two matters referred to in the Governor General's Speech upon which I wish to say a few words which may not find a ready response in the minds of honourable members. While every normal man must have sad bereavement which befell them in the death of King Edward the Seventh, those who are candid must admit tiiat there was a great deal of extravagance in the memorial services hehi to mark it. I do not like to use harsh terms, but it seems to me that there was a good deal of hypocrisy about the ceremony at Parliament House. Extravagant language was alsoused by the press. We were told that "" Melbourne was their "" deep sense of personal loss,"" though possibly they had never even seen the King. perfectly sincere. able member I must say that there was nothing extravagant in his remarks concerning tlie event, but there was a great deal of extravagance in the press comments thereon.

Britain could exercise the franchise as in Australia, the matter would not be so serious, but, knowing as I do that the British House of Commons is elected on the most unequal and unfair franchise, I say that it would be dangerous to allow the control of the Australian army and navy to pass into the hands of the British Government. This is a view which I expressed on the hustings,, and for the expression of which I was elected by a great majority. My position was supported by Mr Justice Higginbotham, the late Chief Justice of Victoria, who saidI do not know what advantage this (Victoria) allow the vessels of the 'Australian Fleet to or any of the neighbouring Colonies can gain by paying in time of peace for either a military or naval force which may be withdrawn' in in time of war, but at a time of threatened time of war.

I am pleased that the honourable member for Parkes is present, because I wish to make reference to some observations which he made last night. The honourable member, in extending a welcome to us, was a little personal. He said that we were very well dressed. honourable member for Werriwa; I did not say that the honourable member was. honourable member for Parkes is the very glass of fashion and the mould of form. I was somewhat surprised to find him so quietly dressed, having read on one occasion a newspaper description of his attire in this House. That -description set forth that Mr Bruce Smith, immaculately dressed, rose. He was attired in a brown velvet coat, a blue silk vest, and wore patent leather boots. Adjusting his golden fince-nez, he advanced to the table with the step of a dancing master, and commenced to speak from notes written on scented notepaper. 'Aee. gentleman read the paragraph in the Age, to which I refer; but what interested me most of all was the earnestness with which he quoted from an article on "" T h r if t "" in the Brisbane Worker, based upon a paragraph stating that in Edinburgh a society had been formed to encourage thrift amongst the working classes. The honourable member apparently does not recognise how ironical it is for one like himself to talk about thrift among the working classes. During his whole life probably he has never denied himself one solitary comfort. himself a position in a Ministry, but I do not suppose that he has ever denied himself a single comfort. Will the House bear with me while I quote from a speech made last year in the House of Commons by Mr Lloyd-George, in referring to the case of which I spoke a little while ago?A case has been brought to my notice of an old lady, seventy-five years of age, who said she was earning 7s. 6d. a week in mantle-making. She gave the name of her employer, from whom it was ascertained that her average earnings were only about 6s. 6d. a week. She was paying 3s. 6d. a week in rent, and, therefore, she had only 3s. a week on which to live. Very often she had to subsist on bread and tea, and her only chance of gettingmeat was by going to a butcher's shop on Saturday night when the shop was about lo close and buying scraps. Yet she had kept £11 in the Savings Bank in order to avoid having a pauper's funeral. one of many cases proving that many people in the Old Country are struggling most heroically against the direst poverty. He went on to sayWhat strikes one about such cases is how people have fought the hoTror of the Poor Law. There are 2^0,000 people over seventy years of age in receipt of Poor Law relief. This Act has disclosed the presence among us of over 600,000 people, the vast majority of whom were living under circumstances of great poverty, and yet disdained the charity of the Poor Law. It has revealed the heroic' struggle between pride and privation in scores of thousands of miserable little rooms and hovels which has gone on apparently unknown; and I am glad that succour has come at last. I have here a cable which appeared in the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin of 7 th A p r i l , 1910The number of persons who died from starvation in England and Wales last year was 125. Fifty-two of the number died in London, was all in the While this is so there are in London rich people who give dinners costing as much as £125 per guest.

I interjected while the honourable member was speaking that the abuse of thrift is .a mistake. member say that dinners costing £125 per head were given? quotation bearing on the point from the Pall Mall Gazette, of February, 1909. In an article by Susan Carpenter on The Bills of Lucullus, we have the statement in regard to one dinnerThis beautiful repast worked out at the rate of / 5 0 a head. This was but a trifle compared with the famous "" Night in Venice"" dinner. This was a record in the way of speedy and clever arrangement. The host gave Mr various courses, winding up with black Pruger only twenty-seven hours to prepare. Over a hundred men worked through the night, ccating the Savoy courtyard with concrete and filling it with water to simulate a lagoon. A special gondola, large enough to seat the twentymind the honourable member that, in comfour guests and allow room for the waiters, had to be built, with smaller ones lo carry the guests from the quay to the white gondola placed in the centre of the water. This was a mass of rare pink carnations, and there were arches of the same flowers over the landing steps and all about, the flowers alone coming to £900, and the entire entertainment to That works out at £ 1 2 5 for each person. The face of ihe honourable member for Parkes is covered with smiles at this recital; and yet he is the honourable member who lectures the Labour party because they say thrift can be carried to excess. member is the man who sees irony in everything; yet he misses it here. old lady, instead of saving her money to avoid a pauper's funeral, would have been better advised had she used it to obtain food, for she then might have lived a little longer. It is a mockery to talk to the working classes about thrift in cases of that kind. This old lady was able to subsist on bread and tea; but I ask the honourable member for Parkes, what good would it be to Australia if the whole of the working classes were to endeavour to subsist on such food? No doubt they could do so for a considerable time; but, just look at the mass of misery and destitution that would ensue if we all attempted to live as this poor old lady lived. The honourable member, of course, is able to smile at this kind of thing; and we might well imagine a leaf out of his diary, such as the following-7 o'clock, rang the bell for tea and a biscuit; half-past 7, read the Age. Brisbane Worker? -half-pas t 7 rang the bell for a bath, and instructed the girl to put a bottle of lavender water in it ; quarter to 8, read the Argus; 8 o'clock, had a very copious breakfast; 9 o'clock, wrote a chapter of my magnum opus, "" Bruce Smith, orator and statesman""; 11 o'clock, read the Brisbane Worker, and made a few extracts; 1 o'clock, had light lunch, consisting, of soup, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and apple pie; 2 o'clock, walked in the gardens for recreation purposes; 4 o'clock, afternoon tea; 6 o'clock-, had dinner of coffee and benedictine. ing from Albury, this week, the honourable member for Parkes had 6d. worth of food, whereas every Labour member had 2s. worth ! never hear of lectures on thrift from the working classes, because, as a rule, such lectures are delivered by orators like the honourable member for Parkes; and the irony of the thing appeals to the people. As to immigration, the party on this side have repeatedly said that they do not object to it, but, as the Government say, are in. favour of it, providing proper Australian people who, in my opinion, can be safely asked to come to Australia, are those engaged in farming and agricultural pursuits generally. I object strongly to the use of Government money to bring artisans, such as carpenters, blacksmiths, and engineers,, to Australia, unless there is work for them; and certainly there is no work at the present time. Honourable members opposite speak of the need for immigration, and are quite willing to spend millions of money in bringing people here; but not to compete with themselves.

Our opponents were entirely to blame for that. the action of the Fusion Government throughout Australia, and not merely in this National Parliament, which created such intense feeling at the recent elections in regard to the Labour policy and the way in which people had been deceived upon the fiscal question. in the Tasmanian Parliament we witnessed one of the most degrading scenes that has ever occurred there, and it occurred on the Fusionist side of the Chamber. perusal of the Federal HansardI learn that a similar scene was enacted here. Is it to be supposed that the people, upon reading their morning newspapers or upon perusing Hansard, were not disgusted when they learned of the state of things politically throughout Australia? It was the mistrust in the hearts of the people which was engendered by the action of politicians who had previously been held in high esteem which caused a revulsion of feeling on the part of the electors and induced them to say, "" We have been deceived.

488,Mr Joseph Cook,"I think the honorthe High Commissioner entering upon party politics in that way. It is very unbecoming of him, and he ought to know better. I was saying that I have not heard that any of our bankers, merchants, or landowners are selling up, in order to leave the country. Yet that is what our opponents from every platform told the people would happen. instil such statements into the minds of the electors, with a view to damaging the Labour party. As I said on the hustings, I believe in making the large landholder pay in the same proportion as the small land-holder; but that has not happened in the past. Tasmania has what is called a land tax, but is really a property tax. of the £60,000 per annum received from it is paid by holders of blocks ranging from CommonAcres alienated or in. process o£ alienation about 7 por cent. Acres under lease 787,211,483 129,000,000 16,000,000 273,000,000 102,000,000 160,000,000 1,500,000 41 per cent.

I am sorry that most of the land of the Commonwealth is still under lease, and, as Crown property, cannot be taxed. Most of these leases have twenty, thirty, and forty years to run. State Governments have the right to resume portions at will, not exceeding one-eighth, I believe. leasehold can be resumed on payment of compensation. ments of the States to see that the land of Australia is not locked up much longer.. They should insist on a fair rental for land under lease. At present many acres are held on a peppercorn rent. Railways which do not pay have been taken through leasehold land, and the poor of the community has to find interest on the capital cost. The railways of the Commonwealth have cost £143,000,000, 15,000 miles of line having cost, on the average, about £9,500 a mile. In parts of the back country lines run for £ acre to 5 acres. It is therefore a tax upon industry and thrift, the large landed proprietors practically going scot-free. The States generally have neglected to impose land taxation, although it would have benefited their people. No doubt on many occasions proposals for land taxation have been dropped by the Upper Houses, which Our opponents have tried to represent property, but not many attempts have been made to pass such legislation. The Labour members and the Labour leagues have discovered that the bursting up of the large estates is essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth, and that it can be done only by such a system of taxation as we propose. Furthermore, the proceeds from the tax will help us to build The greater part an Australian navy. The following figures will show how the land of the Commonwealth is held:New South South Western wealth. Wales. Victoria. Queensland. Australia. Australia. Tasmania. 130,302,000 50,000,000 28,000,000 21,000,OQO 9,500,000 14,000,000 6,000,000 20 or 30 miles through one man's land. The poor should not be taxed through the Customs to pay for railway communication to enable the rich land-holders to send their In some cases the live stock and wool to market, and, at the same time, have to provide for the defence of Australia. The land monopolists, who own this country and starve the community, should pay for the defence of their properties. Why should the people in the cities, the poorest of the poor, build railways for them, and protect their lands with rifles if need be? In support of what I said just now about the utterances of the High Commissioner, let me quote from a copy of the London Times which has been handed to me"" With respect to unification or Federation,"" Sir George said, "" the Australian Labour party seem, so far as I can judge, to be moving towards unification.

519,Mr Jensen,"Yes; eight-tenths of theof city population in the world. leaves us about one person for every square mile of country. my figure is good enough. Can we wonder that in the past Australia has had to borrow, borrow, borrow? What have we been borrowing for? We have been borrowing to enrich the rich at the expense of the poor. a fair amount of land, I consider that the man who has over £5,000 worth can well afford to pay a' substantial tax for the defence and upkeep of his country, thanking God that he is able to pay it. In Tasmania, in 1837, when the first settlement took place, can we suppose for a moment that those who purchased at 5s. an acre took the worse land? They took the best they could get. I know of Tasmanian estates on which the holders have done very little, and exercise so little supervision that they do not know what cattle they have, and in some cases have impounded their own in mistake. The land is left to go almost wild, and what were beautiful areas many years ago are now covered with gorse. Land that was under the plough in the old days when the gold-fields of Ballarat and Bendigo were in full swing, has rarely seen a plough since those tunes. At that time the owners were getting enormous prices for their wheat and oats, which were sold on the gold-fields. But they since discovered that they could earn a considerable revenue by allowing these rich lands to be used as sheep-walks. Consider the unfair system of taxation prevailing in this Commonwealth. If a man buys a quarter of an acre of land in the city, or a few acres in the country, or a small farm, up goes his assessment. If , however, he has a large estate, he is likely to make no improvements in comparison with those made by a man with a small property, and his assessment is not increased. What is worse, I am given to understand that throughout the Commonwealth there is a system of preferential railway rates for the benefit of the large landed proprietors. That should not be. I admit that it is the concern of the States; but how can any one blame the people for rising at the last election and saying: ""We will have no more of this kind of government; we have been deceived long enough; we will give the Labour party a chance, and see whether we cannot secure better conditions with their This aid."" With respect to defence, I remind the House tliat in July, 1908, at the Brisbane Labour Conference, it was decided that the time had come for the establishment of an Australian Navy. No soonei did that plank appear in the Labour platform than the late Prime Minister, now Leader of the Opposition, plucked up courage to bring the question before Parliament. With the assistance of the Labour members, a Bill was passed practically establishing an Australian Navy. The fact that this item of policy was agreed on at the Brisbane Conference shows that the Labour party recognise the necessity or providing adequately for the defence of the country. Surely to goodness, if the Labour party are game enough to adopt items of policy of that large character when out of office, and surely if the supporters of the Labour party are prepared to find the flesh and blood and bone and sinew to man our army and navy, it is time that this party took in hand the direction of the affairs of the country. The Labour party also adopted the policy of. establishing a compulsory citizen Defence. Force; whereupon the Leader of the Opposition again plucked up courage to bring the question before Parliament. Let it be remembered that the very people who, in case of need, will have to shed their blood in defence of Australia, do not own an inch of land in it. Many of them are paying rent to the large blood-sucking financial institutions. Thousands have no stake whatever in the Commonwealth, except through their wives and children. Those who own'the greater part of the land should be taxed to pay for the defence of the country. The proposed land tax is a double-barrelled gun. It will have a tendency to burst up the large estates, and also to pay for the defence of the Commonwealth. I certainly should strongly object to any money derived from taxing the poor through the Customs being used for the purposes of defence, while we have rich lands that can afford to bear this burden. There are many other subjects upon which I could talk, but I propose to reserve my remarks upon them until another occasion. I know that the Prime Minister desires that the debate shall close to-night, and in order that my chief may rest peacefully I shall resume my seat.
