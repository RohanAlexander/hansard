Point No.3, on pages 25 and 26 of Government loves to hide the truth from the the OECD report, is a mention of the OECD's Australian people about the extent of our concern about the state of Australia's indebproblems.

Point No.7, on page 51 through to page 55, the leadership. This is typical of the way in is an absolutely damning indictment of the which these people operate. They will do conduct of monetary policy. The OECD anything, say anything and jeopardise makes three points. The first is that monetary anything to advance their own personal cause. policy has been complicated by the fact that In point No. 12, to be found on page 79, we have too many objectives-in other words, the OECD says that corporatisation has some on monetary policy there are two stools and benefits, but that if we really want the full this Government always falls between them. benefits we ought to privatise. We have been Secondly, it notes that in respect of monetary saying that for years and years, yet these policy the Government always gets its people continue to refuse-because their readings on economic outlooks wrong, and union mates control the shots on this issuethat of course is a real problem. Thirdly, the to do the right thing by the very people they OECD makes the point that the monetary claim to represent, the employees who have authorities' intentions have often been conbeen losing their jobs as a result of their fused. policies. Point No.8, on page 57 of our scorecard, In point No. 13, on page 80, the OECD is that living standards have fallen. Again, notes that until recently we have had very this is not news to the average Australian; but little progress on waterfront reform. This is an it is a critical assessment from an indepeninteresting point because for years these dent, authoritative voice, the OECD, to ram people have been saying, 'We've got the home the point that in the last decade under problem fixed.

Of course seventeenth when it comes to productivity, Australia should reform its tax system. It and that the unions have had too much say in gives clear and unequivocal support, as the the running of electricity and railways. Again, OECD has now for years, for a reform of our country has fallen behind partly as a Australia's indirect and direct tax system. In result of the failure of this Government to particular, it notes that the existing tax system change economic policy. \ that we have now puts a lot of costs on our Point No. 10, to be found on page 74, businesses.

Between the lines, it refers to Point No. 16, on page 81, notes, 'after a the fact that our Prime Minister used the decade of slow progress'-and how slow it Special Premiers Conference as a lever to get has been.

So there is none of this, 'Blame the therefore, the living standards of most rest of the world. They have high interest Australians. This independent report says that rates as well'. That little myth was exploded this Government has fallen down on the job; again by the OECD. Point No. 18, on page it has failed to introduce, with that sense of 84, is a very interesting point to be found urgency, the sorts of micro-economic reforms near the end of the report. I quote: that Australia needs so desperately. . . . wages policy did not deliver inflation perforIn the remaining moments available to me, mance comparable to Australia's trading partners. I will refer to and remark upon the comments That is a very strong point because the of the OECD in respect of tax reform. This is reverse of that has been a claim of Labor an issue which the OECD was very strong since 1983 when it came to office. One hears about in the last survey it conducted on its members all the time saying, 'We have a Australia. It said that we must reform our tax special deal with the unions. We can control system.

It is It is exquisite timing. Last week he ran a one of the Government's favourite myths scare campaign on the question of jobs and exploded in front of its very face. It is on the GST, and yet the OECD has come out page 86.

Furthermore, I think it really abolish the payroll tax, which is a $6 billion puts the pressure on Labor to acknowledge disincentive to our businesses employing the fact that it does not have any plans for the people.

He referred to one editorial which was pace of reform, as I mentioned in Question somewhat despairing of the observations in Time, this report was written prior to the the OECD report. He could also have referred Government's bringing down the One Nation to a far more balanced editorial of the statement. I know that the Opposition, for Australian Financial Review which says, political purposes, has to try to ridicule the 'Praise-and a prod-from the OECD'. It One Nation statement, but what it cannot would. be entirely surprising if the OECD deny in its more candid moments is the fact brought out a report which was full of unthat the One Nation statement did in fact pick qualified praise for the efforts of any up most of the things which the OECD says government.
