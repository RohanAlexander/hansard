There had been many complaints that government rationing was an unjustifiable interference with the tobacco trade and was, indeed, responsible for . the current shortage of tobacco and inequitable distribution. Now the controls have heen lifted. The honourable member himself urged that this should be done at the earliest possible date, leaving the trade to look after its own business about which, he said, it knew more than did the Government. I shall look into the complaint that certain ex-servicemen are not receiving a fair quota of tobacco under the present system, and shall prepare a reply for the honourable member. the Customs authorities in Brisbane attempted to dispose of millions of confiscated cigarette's, but owing to the enormous demand and the rush of intending buyers the sale had to be stopped. Since then, some of the cigarettes have deteriorated, and have been destroyed. Will the Minister representing the' Minister for Trade arid Customs see that a proportion of the cigarettes is made available to the services, and that the remainder is disposed of through ordinary trade channels?

I am raising the matter by way of statement, because I cannot believe that the Prime Minister was aware of this advertisement. The advertisement, which purports to be a copy of a page of Speakers' Notes for the Liberal party, is a fraudulent document. It is not a copy of any page of any Liberal party speakers' notes.

If so, will the Minister inform the House whether the true position regarding these exports has been kept secret because it is realized that the Government cannot honour its obligations to Great Britain in particular, and because the production of meat in Queensland has declined by more than 35,000 tons as the result of strikes?

The countries which were invited to send observers to watch the experiments, of which Australia was ""one, will bear only the expense associated with the presence of its own observers. On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for some time. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) is representing Australia.

Its implications are not being debated with any regard to our international relations. In view of our international understandings, and especially our international misunderstandings, we should consider the matter very carefully. While I sat in the British War Cabinet as the representative of Australia the question arose as to whether there should be a broadcast of a speech that was to be made in the House of Commons, by Mr Churchill upon his return from a meeting with the late President Roosevelt, in which he was to deal exhaustively with the war situation. The British War Cabinet agreed unanimously, the Labour members of it being most emphatic, that such a broadcast would, be exceedingly unwise in view of possible repercussions. It was pointed out that even one interjection during the course of a speech might provoke an unconsidered retort that could imperil relations between nations for generations. We in this country have a White Australia policy' to which all parties subscribe. It was fought for in Parliament and outside it, and is now accepted by all Australians, but to some neighbouring nations it is a matter of concern. During a debate on this subject w in Parliament, statements could he made which, if broadcast, might, lead to serious difficulties with other nations. This is just one instance. One of the functions of Parliament is to provide an opportunity for honourable members to talk to their constituents, and to show them that the views of the people are being put before Parliament. This applies to Ministers no less than to private members. I cannot see that any good purpose would 1M served by broadcasting speeches of that kind to the world. For instance, the other day, we were invited to listen to a recording of the proceedings in Parliament, and I heard the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lazzarini) delivering a speech which, from the point of view of his constituents, was a very good one. He was dealing with conditions in the coal mines on the south coast, and some of the proposals he was making have since been put into. effect by the miners. His speech was unexceptionable so far as his own electorate is concerned or, indeed, so far as the people in other electorates in Australia are concerned, because they understood why he was making it, but it is important that a speech of that kind should not go out to the world as an indication of what Commonwealth Ministers are thinking. The English language is not spoken all over the world, and some of those who might listen to broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings will have but -an imperfect knowledge of the language, and so might misunderstand the true import of what was being said. This was brought home to me by a remark made by Philip Snowden after, an international conference in Paris during the depression. He said, "" although we used the same words, I found that we did not mean the same thing"". Every language has idioms of its own with which people speaking other languages are not familiar. I particularly urge that no short-wave broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings be made unless the greatest care is taken to prevent them from causing international misunderstanding. The Government . should not proceed immediately with this proposal. The technical processes are not available to give a complete broadcast of proceedings. Furthermore, the question of privilege , has not yet been cleared up; and, finally, the danger of creating international misunderstanding is such that the Government should defer the passage of the bill until it has had time to consider the matter further.. The bill has already been passed by the .Senate; but it is evident that the Government has had many second thoughts regarding it, judging by the sheaf of amendments whichhavealready been circulated in this House. For all these reasons, I urge that more hime be rtaken to consider -.the proposal :in all its aspects. In conclusion, I desire to express 'my regret to the honourable member for : Watson '( Mr 'Failstein') for anything -objectionable ""which I may have'-said of him in the heat of debate. : This bill has been prepared 'as a direct resiilt of the report 'furnished by the Standing Committee on IBroadcasting. The decision to broadcast 'the proceedings of this H'ouse and of the Senatei n part only was 'taken because of techn-icafl difficulties. political reasons at all? Labour party is running this country. the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) that .the broadcasting of only a part of the proceedings affects the matter of privilege is quite -erroneous. I may be permitted, as a lawyer, to say to the right honourable member, who is a member of another profession, that I sbould prefer him to confine his remarks on. technical matters to subjects of wbich he has some knowledge. In particular, I suggest that be should .refrain from discoursing on matters of law about which, to judge from the citations he has made, he, has no knowledge at all. 'The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) 'has foreshadowed an amendment that clause 14 of the bill be deleted, and in its place there be substituted another Glause consisting of two sub-clauses. I hope to convince honourable imembers that ithere is am substance in 'his .amendment-which would warrant serious consideration. I bope to show, also, & a t the poimts raised by the honourable member come strangely from one who, enjoying the absolute privilege of -a court t>f, law, made a most unwarranted attack upon the Minister'for Information ( Mr words spoken in Parliament. Does the Calwell) during the hearing of a case -in whid'h the Minister claimed damages fior libel against .a newspaper for the publication of certain matter which was highly defamatory. The honourable member's foreshadowed >amendment proposes, in subclause .2, that the privilege of .honourable members in Parliament shall be considered in relation to -statements of 'truth, and to .sta te.menits of luntruth,; .and he says that, in the 'case 'of statements of tnuth, no 'action shall lie. ' iEt -is trite .knowledge ithat, in common law, mo taction fshall lie in -respect -.of a true statement made in .the interest :otf public 'benefit, and, .of course, it would -naturally follow "".that any statement made in Piairliament ""would -be made in the interest of public benefit. It is obvious, .therefore, ifrhat -'there ""was no need for the amendment specifically to give privilege to statements of :trufeh. The honourable member for Warringah must know .fhat in England it is a sufficient defence against a charge of libel or slander to prove fhat the statement was true and made for the public all.

Whilst-it'may'be d;esir.able to make some pnovdsion regarding piavilege in such cases, .1 point tout that it is proposed -that -the proceedings of Parliament shall be bisoadeast, not 'in their entirety, but-in .part only.

114,Mr Guy (Wilmot) [4.57],"I am notprovide for the whole of the proceedings to he broadcast cannot be satisfactory. As far as I am aware, the only parliament in the British Empire whose proceedings are broadcast is the Parliament of New Zealand. The proceedings of the House of Representatives of that Dominion have been broadcast in full since. 1936. Indeed, for six hours every sitting day the proceedings are broadcast. is approximately 24 . hours a week, which covers all the proceedings. Broadcasting times are varied to suit the sitting times. The system has given general satisfaction, although many people have ceased to listen to the broadcast. ""When the novelty of listening to the parliamentary debates passed the number of listeners dropped considerably. The proceedings in the Legislative Council of New Zealand are not broadcast. I realize the difficulty of broadcasting both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament at the same time. That would involve the use of additional stations and considerable extra expense. It is for technicians to advise in this regard, and it has been suggested that perhaps the proceedings in one House could be recorded and broadcast at some other time. That would probably enable the proceedings in both Houses to be broadcast. Despite the assertions of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Ealstein), the Parliamentary Committee on Broadcastingj-ecommended unanimously the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings of the Parliament. The report statedWe suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the short-wave stations, except during the short periods when "" s t r a i g h t "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air. That language is unequivocal, and if the honourable member for Watson cannot understand it, he should obtain a legal opinion with which to fortify his mind. There was a minority report, which suggested that overall control should not rest with the President of the. Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [77] but that is not germane to this debate; The important fact is that the Parliamentary Committee, after having heard evidence and having deliberated for a considerable time, recommended the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings. The broadcasting of a portion of the proceedings would definitely be at variance with the committee's report. The attitude That of the committee itself, which I endorse, is that all or none of the proceedings should be broadcast. As the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) pointed out last week, a most unsatisfactory position will arise if only a part of the debate is put on the air. For example, one honourable member may attack another while the proceedings are being broadcast. The person so attacked may have a most effective reply to the charges, but when he rises to defend himself, the broadcasting of the debate may have ceased. Justice demands a fair and impartial presentation of the debates to the whole of the people, and that will not be achieved by broadcasting of portion of the proceedings. "" Jockeying"" for position, rushes to speak while the cham-' ber is on the air, and a dearth of speakers when the broadcast is not taking place will be experienced. That will bring about a most undesirable state of affairs. Clause 14 causes me grave concern. It providesNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Last week the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) discussed the dangers of this clause in a most informative manner. Every one agrees that in this chamber honourable members should have the right to express their views without fear of incurring legal proceedings, and the protection which is afforded to their remarks is quite satisfactory. But citizens also require protection from slanderous attacks made in this House. Clause 14 gives to honourable members absolute licence to makefalse and malicious statements, and defame citizens, whowill have no redress. That licence, if taken advantage of, would bring the Parliament into disrepute; no one would have respect for the parliamentary institution. The granting of licence to slander is quite unnecessary. The wording of the clause means that any person-that expression in itself^ is ver y wide-ca n take a small paragraph from an honourable member's speech, divorce it from the context, and broadcast' it , for the purpose of creating in the minds of the listeners amisleading and untrue impression, but he would be immune from proceedings, for libel.. Mr CA-LWEIX -That is not a facti Informatio n ( Mr Calwell)' replies to the debate-, he w ill have 'an opportunity to correct me. Does he pit his opinion against that! of the' former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth, Sir George Knowles?' results. Giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on this subj.ectj the then Solicitor-General saidI f the whole of the proceedings, not small selected portions, were broadcast, a qualified privilege would apply. This qualified privilege could only bo upsefc by proof of malice, and..it would be difficult to establish malice if the whole of the proceedings were broadcast. The former Solicitor-General definitely advocated the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings. To-day, a qualified privilege exists, and that should suffice. Clause 14 is unnecessary. Apartf r o m a few exceptions, this unqualified privilege, which honourable members enjoy to-day, has not been abused; but I cannot and w ill not support its extension into a licence to slander people. The proposal that under certain conditions the privilege shall he extended to the re-broadcasting of any of the proceedings of the Parliament w ill merely aggravate the danger. Approval for the re-broadcasting of a slander on a person w ill be established, and the.victim will have ,no redress. The proposal, for re-hroadcasting speeches envisages that a record of the parliamentary proceedings will be cut. A week, a month, or even a year after the speech was delivered in thischamber-, asi unscrupulous personcould divorce some of the honourable member's words from their context, and rebroadcast them without fear of legal proceedingsfor libel. opportunity later to-refute.my statements-. Some difficulty"" has arisen regarding the land-lines necessary to make it possible for person's in. all parts of Australia to listen to broadcasts of the proceedings of this Parliament',.and unless this problem, is adjusted, onlyNew South Wales and Victoria, w ill get satisfactory reception. Other States may not get any reception, or have an. inferior reception. The Minister should assure honourable. members that the whole of the people of 1 Australia w ill be> given an opportunity to listen to the debates of this-Parliament. As' the right honourable, member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) pointed out, the Seventeenth Parliament of the Commonweal th. w ill shortly cease to exist. Even if. the Senate and the. House of withsuccessful Representatives agree to the bill at this stage, the proceedings of both chambers can be broadcast for only a fortnight or three weeks-. The Parliament then w ill 'rise,, and honourable members w ill prepare for the election. In my opinion, honourable members should allow the Eighteenth Parliament to implement, if it so desires, this legislation.. Meanwhile, radio technicians w ill have an opportunity' to perfect transmission, to all parts of Australia, and the Government's legal officers may re-examine this obnoxious clause 14. If this clause is permitted to stand, in its present form,. I shall vote against the bill. support the bill, and welcome this proposal to broadcast proceedings of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and other legal-practitioners in this chamber gave honourable members most informative addresses on the possible legal consequences of broadcasting the debates. They also expressed grave coneern that only a portion of the proceedings would be on the air. It is true that the ideal would be the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings, but the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr. Chambers) has already explained the reasons why that is impracticable at this juncture. If my speeches are not broadcast, my position will be no worse, regarding publicity, thani t is to-day. Some time ago, I delivered in this chamber acarefully prepared speech on housing; and!

At this period of our history the Government should have been devoting all the resources at its disposal to the promotion, of ways of increasing the productivity of the country and improving our enconomic conditions. I am informed that an expenditure of £50,000 will be necessary to provide even the partial parliamentary broadcasts which the Government 1 envisages. I believe in a policy of "" first things first"". to-day is a reduction of governmental expenditure as the forerunner to a reduction of taxation. A reduction of taxation would stimulate production. With an increase of production revenue from taxation would increase even if the rates of tax were reduced, as they should be. I disapprove of the proposed expenditure of £50,000 on a partial proceedings at a time when country people find it impossible to obtain telephones because of the lack of cable and technical equipment. No doubt a great deal of the material that has been used for the broadcasting installations that are being made in this building would have been suitable for the installation of tele-, phone services. The installations here will serve mainly city dwellers or those in the more developed parts of the Commonwealth. Each capital city already has two national stations, and regional stations have been established in various parts of the country. For this reason people in these areas will reap the maximum benefit from the parliamentary broadcasts, but those living in the outlying areas, who should be given improved amenities, will reap no benefit whatever from these broadcasts. I received a letter yesterday from a resident of CliftonShire complaining of the lack of telephones. support requests made for additional Mr Fadden. telephone services on behalf of twenty to 25 farmers residing in the shire, at various distances from the township. In some cases deposits had been paid for over six months, but the hold-up was said to be due entirely to the lack of technical equipment. In the electorate of .the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), which is by no means remotely situated in relation to some parts of the Commonwealth, the people cannot obtain any satisfactory service from existing regional stations, and very few people in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) reap any advantage from them. I have .been informed that it is not the intention of the Government to broadcast parliamentary proceedings through Dalby, where one' of the most powerful regional The crying need of Australia stations in, Australia was constructed by the previous Government in order to give an improved broadcasting coverage to people residing in Western Queensland and central South Australia. gentleman has been misinformed. ber for Maranoa told me that he had broadcast of parliamentary made inquiries on this subject from the appropriate authority and had been informed that the Dalby station will not be used. I regard that as scandalous An honourable member has interjected that I have somersaulted on this subject. I have not done so. I informed the Broadcasting Committee that I believed in the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, but I did not consider that the' system should be instituted for the benefit of city dwellers, at the expense of the country people, nor did I consider that partial, indefinite, and incomplete broadcasts would be satisfactory. I am favorable to the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in accordance with the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee. In order that honourable members may be clear as to my views on the subject. I shall read the evif dence.that I gave before the committee. I saidI agree that it is desirable that the debates I was asked to of the Parliament should be broadcast. I have given some thought to the matter, and realize that there are debits as well as credits.",32,Calwell
124,Mr Calwell,The right honourable,33,Calwell
125,Mr Fadden,"The honourable memOn the debit side, there would be the tendency to stifle debate. I say that from my experience as the leader of a party. in order to obtain publicity, some members are not prepared to speak at a certain hour of the night, but prefer to postpone their contribution to the debate to the following day, when they can be reported by the press. In recent times, we have had the experience of debates collapsing long before they rightfull y should because some members were not prepared to proceed as the setting was not favorable to the gaining of publicity. That position would be aggravated by the broadcasting of debates, because only a limited number of hours would be favorable to the gaining of publicity and everybody would not be able to speak during that period. On the eredit side, the broadcasting of debates would induce members to engage in greater research and to pay more attention to the composition of their speeches. These would not be so spontaneous as are speeches made from a few notes. Nevertheless that is a very desirable aspect. On the other, hand, broadcasting of debates would probably prevent members from.making certain charges which to-day are made under privilege. They are informed by correspondence that certain things are going on, and in all conscientiousness put forward those views ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House. If they were to be subjected to an effective reply by n Ministerf u l ly informed of tbe facts, that practice would probably break down. Senator McKenna referred to the broadcasting of questions. Those who have sat in opposition know that very often a question is more effective than a speech from the "" parish pump "" point of view in an electorate. It is easy to obtain a reply from the secretary to a Minister, but from a political point of view that is not always desirable because the member must let his informant know that he is pressing the matter in the House. Questions without notice probably could be broadcast,but what about a question upon notice? A member places on the notice-paper a question relating to a matter that is probably of national importance, with respect to which he genuinely desires to obtain information, and the reply is furnished at a much later date. The mechanics of the matter rather condemn tlie practicability of the proposal. The experience in New Zealand has been cited. As Mr Speaker has said, the conditions in New Zealand are entirely different from those in Australia. In the first place, that dominion does not differentiate between national and regional stations. I approach the matter from the standpoint of the Australian Country party. In ail the capital cities there are two national stations. What would be the position of the people in the country, who have to depend on regional stations, if debates in the Senate and the House of Representatives were broadcast simultaneously? thought been given to the difference in times between the eastern States and Western Australia? How would that be overcome? I believe Mr Speaker stated that more legislation would be initiated in the Senate, in order to overcome the objection that that chamber does not deal with tlie matter when it is fresh. The most important debates we have had in recent Even to-day months have been those on the banking bills. These were originated in the House of Representatives and were debated for days, almost every member participating. Who would listen to a broadcast of a debate on them when they went to the Senate? Then we have the budget, the basis of the whole of our constitutional authority. Obviously, it must be initiated in the House of Representatives. It is debated for days, mid eventually finds its way to the Senate. Who would listen to a repetition in the Senate of all that had been said in tlie House of Representatives. Those are pertinent considerations in determining the desirability or otherwise of broadcasting parliamentary debates. It must be realized that, of necessity, most of our legislation must first pass through the House of Representatives, because the Senate is a house of review. There are only a few measures which could be initiated in the Senate with a view to obviating the repetition there of what had been said in the House of Representatives. Mr Speaker's political experience and knowledge of Standing Orders are much greater than mine, but I am sure that he will agree w i th me that there are only few measures which could be fresh news in the Senate. Could the proceedings of tbe Parliament be broadcast by the -Australian Broadcasting Commission with its existing facilities? It would be all right for the city-dweller, who has two national stations, but the countryside is entirely dependent on the regional stations. Licence-holders might listen for a while to political debates broadcast over regional stations, but would they consider it more important than listening to entertainment? The amenities of people who live in the country are few. How many additional stations would be needed to give a complete cover to both Houses continuously during the sittings of the Parliament? Whatever at&tioiis might be used, there would be a period of overloading and a period of unemployment, because the Parliament does not sit continuously throughout the year. Because of exceptional circumstances it has sat since February of this year. If stations are to be specially erected in order to overcome difficulties during peak periods, when both Houses are sitting and a f u l l cover is needed, what will be the cost of the unemployment of those stations while the Parliament is not sitting? Whilst agreeing that it is desirable to have Parliamentary debates broadcast, I am not so enthusiastic in regard to the practicability of the proposal, having regard particularly to the cost. I should be opposed to fixation of the order of debates; in that respect I agree entirely with Mr Speaker. If that suggestion were adopted, constituted authority would be infringed; because, as Mr Speaker has said in no uncertain terms, in his eyes Has any every member has an equal right to the call . whatever may be his oratorical qualifications or his ability to handle the subject. That right has to be preserved unimpaired. I also agree with Mr Speaker that if you were to pick out the "" high lights"", or choose the man best qualified to discuss them, you would break down the democratic feature of responsible government. You have to consider whether the debates are to be artificially planned or delivered in anatural atmosphere from a democratic centre. The solution is yours. I would be totally opposed to the broadcasting of debates in any sectional form. Unless everybody could have the same right to listen in, I would not favour the proposal. I -would also oppose the addition of one penny to the liabilities and responsibilities of tlie taxpayers. There is also another aspect of which we must not lose sight. The Commonwealth Parliament is not the only Parliament in Australia; there are also the six State legislatures. Any layman who has taken an interest be seized to defray the costs of an action in this debate must have been impressed at law. by the warnings and cautions of legal members of this House. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has stated in concise and understandable language of this experiment. The broadcasting of all the disadvantages, difficulties and parliamentary debates must come; but dangers, from the point of view of privi-when it comes it must he undertaken lege, that would attend partial broadcompletely. casts.

127,Mr Fadden,"I should like to knowis important that the people of Australia should be given every opportunity to become acquainted with parliamentary proceedings, particularly at this time when the country is faced with many difficult problems. .Some newspapers, unfortunately, do not devote to their reports of the parliamentary debates as much space as one would expect. It is important that the people should know how the Government and the Parliament are handling the many difficult problems with which the nation is confronted. If that U to be achieved by the broadcasting'of parliamentary debates, adoption of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, which investigated the matter, is essential. It recommended unanimously that the whole of the parliamentary debates should he broadcast. May I refresh the minds of some honourable gentlemen who may not have read the report? The committee took evidence from the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), the two other party leaders in this House, the High Commissioner for New Zealand, and other persons who could give information on this important subject. Its recommendation readsThe whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from tlie shortwave stations, except during the short periods when "" straight "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air; that no provision should be made for. any prearranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" s t r a i g h t "" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business, with the qualification that during divisions and such like intervals, an appropriate official (who should be an officer of the commission) should broadcast an impartial description of what is taking place. Needless to say, the facilities should not be used for other purposes when Parliament is in recess. Ft went on to sayWo are aware that in New Zealand doubts have been expressed in certain quarters as to the wisdom of broadcasting the whole of the proceedings, but we are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts of the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset. That was not a qualified recommendation, but was emphatic and was made unanimously. Instead of accepting it, the Government proposes to set up another committee, the constitution of which is provided for by clause 5, and its functions by clause 12. Those functions are(1.) The committee shall consider and specify in their report presented to each House of the Parliament, the general principles upon which there should bo determined the days upon which and the periods during which, the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives Shall be broadcast. (2.) The committee shall, in accordance with general principles, specified by the committee and adopted by each House of the Parliament, determine the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be broadcast. 1 There is already a Parliamentary Standing Committee to advise as to what should be done. It has unanimously recommended that the whole of the parliamentary debates should, be broadcast. The Government refused to accept that recommendation, and brought down a bill which provides for the appointment of a further committee. I venture the opinion that it will not accept the advice of that committee either. In New Zealand; broadcasts are made of the debates in the House of Representatives only, the Upper House being a nominee chamber. As it is proposed to broadcast the debates in both branches of this Parliament it would he a simple process to follow the course of a bill through one house, and to broadcast the debate on another bill in the other chamber. Difficulties will be experienced at the outset in providing the necessary technical services to enable the debates to be broadcast throughout Australia, but before the scheme is put into operation those services should be made available. Acceptance of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee would necessitate broadcasting the whole of the debates, and the necessary technical equipment must first be provided. The President of the Senate (Senator the Honourable Gordon Brown) and Mr Speaker (the Honourable J. S. Rosevear) gave valuable evidence to the committee. The President saidI n order to make the broadcasting of debates a success, and to achieve tlie greatest results from an informative and factual point of view, it is essential that the whole of the debates be broadcast. The broadcasts would fai l in their principal aim and object if there were any curtailment of debate or preferment to certain speakers.",35,Calwell

If the broadcasting occurred for limited periods only, honourable member's might be subjected to unfair attacks by their opponents and be prevented from having their replies broadcast. In view of the cunning tactics of some members of the Ministry, who might have inside information as to broadcasting times, supporters of the Government could conceivably make wild attacks upon the Opposition and prevent their opponents from being heard over the air in reply. If democracy is to survive, and there is to be f air play in this matter, it is essential that the debates be broadcast impartially. The Postmaster-General's Department should make adequate technical facilities available to enable the debates to be broadcast over the widest possible area. With the development of frequency modulation, it will soon be possible to give broadcasting services in country areas similar to those available in the large cities. That work should be undertaken with despatch. The Government is under an obligation to pay heed to the recommendations .of the Broadcasting Committee. By reading paragraphs 33 to 49 of the committee's eighth report, honourable members will be able to appreciate some of the technical problems associated with the broadcasting of the debates in this Parliament. The Government seems to have rushed into this proposal hopelessly unprepared for its adoption. If it were implemented without the amendments foreshadowed by the Opposition, the scheme would wreck completely the organization of the national broadcasting stations. For an hour before and an hour after the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, the services to Queensland, South Australia . and Western Australia-over the national network would be disrupted. That is the advice of the experts of the department. The Australian Broadcasting Commission would -then be blamed for having failed to provide the broadcasting programmes promised, and would be subjected to endless irritation. The Government should withdraw the bill, recast the whole proposal, and implement the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee on the lines of the system adopted in New Zealand up to the present. The Government has rejected all advice that has been tendered to it. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate on this bill, and to the reasons or excuses advanced against the acceptance of the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for ' Warringah ( Mr Spender). So far as the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament is concerned, the question, I am convinced, is not "" to be or not to be"". Definitely, it is ""to be"". The broadcasts will take place, and the only purpose in debating the measure lies in the remote possibility that we may be able to improve it. The bill is a simple one designed to give effect to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee. That committee recommended that the entire proceedings of Parliament be broadcast, and it is unfortunate that the recommendation cannot be given effect. It cannot be done because Parliament consists of two Houses with equal rights, and the time available must be divided between them. For that reason, it was inadvisable to proceed with the proposal until it was possible to give effect to the committee's recommendations in their entirety. .The committee was appointed to take -evidence and upon that basis to advise Parliament, but on this occasion the Government is departing from the committee's recommendations. The weight of the evidence heard by the committee was to the effect that the broadeasting of the proceedings of Parliament "" should not be done in such a way as to make for the aggrandisement of any member or party. It was interesting to hear the evidence tendered in support of the proposal to broadcast. Many seriousminded persons believed that broadcasting would tend to raise the tone of' debates. That is a worthy objective, and if the broadcasts have that effect the money which they cost will he well spent. . Quite a lot of people seem to have the idea that the public are awaiting with impatience zero hour so that they may turn the knobs of their receiving sets, and avail themselves of the great boonwhich it is proposed to confer upon them.",37,Calwell
135,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [8.0],"IThat idea seems to represent, in the words of Dr. Johnson, "" the triumph of hope over experience "". It was certainly not the intention of the Broadcasting Committee that the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings should confer upon unauthorized persons a licence to broadcast statements which, in ordinary circumstances, would be regarded as libellous, and therefore actionable at law. I support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Warringah to clause 14 of the bill. The clause readsNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. There is nothing ambiguous in that language. If the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lazzarini) were here he would agree with me that the words "" any person "" means 'any person. He has frequently said, when referring to the wording of a clause, that it means what it says. The purpose of the amendment is to limit strictly the number of persons who can claim what amounts to parliamentary privilege. In the ordinary course of events, this privilege is enjoyed by mem-, bers of Parliament only. As the clause stands it would be possible for any unauthorized person to . make a record for broadcasting, and to say that so and so said this or that, and then to broadcast it. I cannot see why any one should object to the amendment, and if the objection is persisted in, such persistence' will merely strengthen the belief that clause 14 is intended to have the effect which we suspect. The amendment, if accepted, would not detract in any way from the merits of the Government's proposal, and it would make the position perfectly clear. I do not like to use the term ""pig-headed""; but it is a very expressive one, especially when applied to opposition to an amendment which could not fail to improve the bill. This afternoon we listened to a lawyer on the Government side defending clause 14 as it stands. Are we to assume that, in the eyes of the legal profession, any provision that is fool-proof is not a good one? ber himself, as a member of the Broadpart of the subject. I have said that ifr.

In the event of a member of Parliament making an attack on the Government or on the Opposition, as the case may be, just before . broadcasting from the chamber concerned was due to cease, the all-party committee in control of broadcasts should be authorized to order the broadcast to continue until an effective reply to the attack could be made prevent that from happening. Committee agrees that provision should be made for that. If it is not done we are going to ask why. Clause 14 will not affect me because I am not likely to abuse the privilege, but I am afraid that the same cannot be truthfully said of every member of this Parliament. affect the privilege of members of Parliament, but only that of persons engaged in broadcasting. the clause to make it more specific. The proposed amendment meets with the approval of the Opposition, at any rate. I , as a member of the Broadcasting -Committee, do not want to be forced into the position of voting against something which the committee recommended. We certainly did not recommend anything corresponding to clause 14, and if it remains unaltered I shall have to vote against the measure because, in its present form, it represents an abuse of the committee's recommendation. I urge the Government and its supporters seriously to consider the advisability of amending the clause so that, while not withdrawing a privilege properly enjoyed by members of this House, the public may yet be sufficiently protected. agree that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast.

""Well, I have not found that they are a class apart at all. I have' always understood, as the result of long experience, that members of Parliament are drawn fro m common and ordinary people. Looking round this chamber, I would not conclude that its members, particularly those of the Opposition, belie that, impression. In any case, as I have said, broadcasting is the only way to assure tlie people of a complete record of the parliamentary proceedings. AndI have already said that the Parliament, however much some may despise it , does in fact, command swift obedience. Whatever is put into the statute-book generally commands respect. Indeed, is is remarkable how great a respect there is for law, and my experience is that people have a great respect for it . One has only to observe the respect that exists for the law of compulsory voting. I find that there is a very shrewd disposition to respect the law which makes for compulsory voting, although we have proof that it is easy enough to .make excuses for failure to vote. That is my experience, and I am quite sure that it is the experience of others.

Yet editors make these strident complaints in the columns of the daily press against members of Parliament, because they, it is said., slander other individuals to whom no opportunity to reply is vouchsafed. Members of Parliament, are subject to very strict rules as to their conduct, and those rules are often applied in a summary manner, A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can turn any honourable member out of this chamber. A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can suspend an honourable member and deprive him of the privileges which he has won at the ballot-box. In a number of ways, although apparently a member of the Queensland Parliament seems to have been .able to dodge such treatment, honourable members are subject to various forms of discipline. I have been long enough in this House to remember an honourable member being expelled, unjustly, It h in k ; but he was ejected nevertheless. And, although the requirements of democracy are that such an honourable member may still submit himself to the electors, it is historic that in many casesI mention, for instance, Wilkes and Bradlaugh-h e has been obliged to submit himself repeatedly for I I am not have sometimes succeeded professionally < to that in which the and he does attempt to make and, like members of Parliament, some of tbese men are scrupulous whilst some are utterly unscrupulous. speak as one who has had a long experience of the newspaper world, and I have found that newspapers are not always particular, but I hope that the time will never come, and I ask honourable members opposite to support me in the view that it should never come, when the ages-old and very important privilege of Parliament shall be destroyed. This privilege lies at the base of popular rights. It rests upon the rights of individuals to come to the Parliament, where alone they may utter the thing that is in them because of the right which they draw from the people. The individual is returned to the Parliament, and it is his proud privilege, but not so proud as it might appear, to say in the Parliament what he cannot under any circumstances say in any other place. As I said, that right is drawn from popular rights. Sometimes the individual says something that may be unjust, but, in all circumstances, it is much better that he should say the thing which is unjust than . that he should be prevented from saying it. He says the thing-in my opinion, very properly-that he thinks should be said. Sometimes, perhaps, the statement should not be made, but the fact remains that he, at that time, considered that it should be made, and it is better that he should say it in Parliament rather than that he should bottle it up and say it privately to individuals because that might do more harm than the original publication in the Parliament would do. The opposition to this bill has a political motive. The purpose of honourable gentlemen opposite is to stall off the' broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings with the true and certain knowledge that they will get consideration in the daily press. That seems to be the general view. The press of the metropolis and the country districts gives to them a much better deal than it habitually gives to members of the Labour party. The Opposition derives much more support electorally from the press than do honourable members on this side of the chamber. Wealth is on their side. I remember the extraordinary propaganda inflicted on the Mr Brennan. people which resulted in my never-to-beforgotten defeat. be-regretted ! member was himself so conspicuously near to defeat that I thought he was gone, and because of his genius for making quips on occasions I was almost ready to regret his political passing. honourable member to confine his remarks to the bill. honourable members opposite wish to stall the bill for the purpose of working up newspaper support for the elections.

The Parliament would do well to see that the privilege of its members in respect of the words spoken in the Parliament is retained. I say this because I have heard of 'some cases in which members of the Parliament have been denied the right to express their views. I support the bill!

No authority whatever has been given by this Parliament, either to the Government or to anybody else, to install this equipment. The next event happened in the Senate to-day. The matter that I want to canvass is the reliability of the news broadcasts of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-day.

I stand firmly in support of the contention of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), that, if the electorate is to be fully informed, or is to have the right fully to inform itself, either the whole of the proceedings, or none at all, should be broadcast. I see no half-way house. gentleman .mean that the proceedings of each House ought to be broadcast fully? alternative. Under the Australian Consituation, the two Houses rank as equal in all matters. man would have both broadcasts made simultaneously? ' reason why they should not be made simultaneously, the people having their choice as to whether they shall listen to the House of Representatives or the Senate. The debates in the two Houses are of equal importance. The members of the Senate, unlike the members of the Legislative Councils of the Australian States and New Zealand, the Senate in Canada, and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, are elected.by the same people as elect members to the House of Representatives. Consequently, the electorate is entitled to be fully informed in regard to the proceedings in both Houses. But under this bill it will not be. A committee is to be set up. Doubtless the members of at will go very carefully into the time that should be allotted to each House, and, in their wisdom, with the aid of that redoubtable "" Mr Majority "", who decides so many questions in this world, w ill determine when broadcasts shall he made of the debates in the House of Representatives, and when they shall be made of the debates in the Senate.

The Government is .not able to c'anva'ss the matter of expense, mercialstations'. I should say that the which does not scent to worry it in' the slightest degree. We have had before us other bills, one of which provided for the expenditure of ,a mere £S00;000 on a national university which I am quite sure is n6t needed and will never be used. If the Government is prepared to incure the expense of broadcasting the proceedings of this House little additional expense would be involved in broadcasting also tbe proceedings of the Senate, particularly as that chamber is known to sit on fewer days and for shorter periods than does the House of Representatives. In these modern times we hear a lot about democracy. Not a very good set of definitions of democracy is available. There was a time, when democracy, in other parts of the world,functioned in a way very different from that in which it functions here. In those days the free men of .the tribe met and decided, by argument if possible and, if not, by more forceful methods, what was to be done. practised by the honourable member. honourable member refer to forceful methods? The law does not permit them to be used; otherwise; many decisions might be made much more quickly than they are made by argument. Those days' are gone, perhaps never to return, at all events iii our time. We have reached the stage at which, with the spread of population, the great units of which democratic countries are composed to-day demand some form of representative government. It is only meet and just that the people who are governed from Canberra, for whom laws are made and in whose supposed interests they are administered by nineteen Ministers^ should know just how this Parliament and those Ministers approach the problems with which they are confronted. My desire is that the people should becomebetter acquainted with the doings of this Parliament, if that be possible. But, against that I -put thisi: The interests of the people, their : BroadcastingBiU 1946. tastes an'd their views, a're very diverse; 1 consequently,' the parliamentary broadcasts will have to compete with other broadcasts. Competition will be met from both the national stations and the comcommercial stations will be by far the raoTe formidable competitors, because they broadcast such items' as the ""QuizK i d s"" and radio plays-to whichi I seldom listen except under duress; I have not heard olle in which there was not a murder at least every half-hour, to. say nothing of a little gun-running, and other odds and ends of adventure. Musical people will, of Gourse, adhere to the programmes that cater for their tastes. Is it likely that a very large percentage of the electorate will desire to listen to parliamentary debates? That' is the first question we have to resolve The second is whether it is likely that a very large percentage of that small percentage will be able^ and willing if able} to listen to_ a debate to its conclusion; They will he in no different condition from others who pick up a volume of Hansard, or who happen to visit . this House, coming"" in and going out wbeii they like. I suspect that there will be occasions on which the elector will be Only too happy to turn the knob, cutting off his or her reception of the parliamentary broadcast and getting on to something that is more interesting and congenial. Furthermore, whatever may be their desires, a great part of the electorate will not be able to afford the time to listen for lengthy periods to'what the Parliament is doing in regard to any important matter. Much as we may desire to have our debates broadcast, the taxpayers have certain rights, but I doubt whether, under the present governmental set-up, they are considered at all. Therefore, we should be well advised to postpone this proposal until after the general elections. It would' not be a"" good thing if our debates were put over the air for the first time just as the present Parliament is about to expire. The scheme if acceptablej should commence when the new Parliament assembles. The closing days of the session will riot afford the electorate the best idea of h'ow Parliament functions. There is bound to be a rush of business",42,Calwell

163,Mr Archie Cameron,"Does thetowards the end. In some parliaments the 'end is rather sudden and, perhaps, undignified. It may be so on this occasion. There may be disappointment on the part of the people, if they regard this Parliament as a forum where ; only first-class Orators may find a place. ""Wlien our debates goon the air-, no doubt the electors will have their minds disabused of that idea. I agree with the honourable member for Batman( Mr honourable member for Ballarat has Brennan), that the Parliament cannot be much better than the people who elect it. I remember one member saying to me that in his view no 'Cabinet could function successfully if more than one-third of its members were -first-rate men. In the case of the present Ministry, nothing like one-third fall within that category, and the best seem to be going overseas at an unprecedented rate. The surprising thing to me is that the Ministry faces the contest ahead of it with equanimity. A good deal may be said in favour of postponing the adoption of the scheme until television is in operation. If to the benefits of broadcasting we could only add those of television, the electors would be perfectly informed of the proceedings in this Parliament. Now and again, under the stress of circumstances, I move about the country a little, and I suspect that with television in operation it might be thought by the electors that they were setting a vision of some animal munching hay. It has been said that Hansard' dresses up our .speeches in such a way that' we ourselves cannot recognize them. With the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) I was listening to one of -my friend's opposite during a trial broadcast. He has a weak voice, but I assure honourable members that Hansard has never done to any member's speech a better job than the microphone did to the voice of my friend opposite. It sounded like that of a first-class orator, so he has nothing whatever to fear from broadcasting. should not say such things. They are quite incorrect. honourable member had heard the voice as it came through the microphone, he would have a different opinion. We have to answer one or two questions about this matter. The first is: Will 'the -broadcasting of 'parliamentary proceedings improve the s'tandard of debates ? I have listened to debates in -this chamber for twelve, years, and one of the things I have noticed is the increasing tendency on the part of honourable members practically to read speeches rather than deliver thorn. a certain amount of brains. What he has to say is Usually said in committee, and he usually says it in a rather forthright, if somewhat challenging way. The whole subject of the standard of our debates is important. In many 'instances the debate here is spoiled because there is a tendency to deliver set speeches rather than for honourable members to deal with the statements cf the speakers preceding them. Mr 'CALWELL -What has the bill to do with the standard of debate? lot to do with it. What effect will this proposal have? If we do not consider that question, the electors will answer it for us. If the measure will lead to a better understanding of Parliament on the part of the electorate, and a hetter appreciation of democratic institutions, and if it will instil into the people a much-needed respect for the rule of law, which is often discarded to-day, then the broadcasting of our debates will prove a great blessing to the community. ber is begging the question. would be begging an answer from the honourable member for Batman, but I am afraid that if I did I should not get one. The matters to which I have referred ought to be considered before the measure is approved. I doubt whether the Government had given to the bill, before its introduction, the consideration which the issues at stake demand. No sooner had the bill reached this chamber from the Senate than the Minister in charge of it forecast certain vital amendments relating to privilege.

179,Mr White (Balaclava) [9.13],"I appointed by the most powerful party.25 years, has there been democratic government. In the eyes of the Russians, their government is democratic, but there .because no political opposition is tolerated, and in elections the people may vote for the candidates of only one party. In a democracy, on the other hand, the people may vote for whom they like, and their representatives in Parliament are free to say what they choose. Therefore, * it is important that the people should be provided with an opportunity to hear their representatives in Parliament. That is what will be achieved by the broadcasting of proceedings. In this instance it will 'represent the application of science for a beneficial purpose instead of, as so often happens, for destructive purposes. Judging by the experience in connection with broadcasting parliamentary debates in New Zealand, nothing but good can come of the innovation. Broadcasting should have the effect of raising the tone of debates in Parliament. A member will think twice before behaving in a disorderly manner when he knows that he can be heard by listeners all over Australia. The broadcasts should also have tbe effect of improving the diction of honourable members. There are so many other things' for the radio listener to hear that he will not give his attention to members of Parliament who talk twaddle, or whose manner of speech he regards, as unbearable. I believe that, on balance, good will result from broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. Our national and commercial broadcasting stations are of good standing, as anybody knows who can compare them with overseas broadcasting services. It is the limitation that the Government is proposing to which I object. I do not see how the Government can possibly provide that only parts of debates shall be broadcast. AlthoughI have a motion on the notice paper for to-morrow, I shall not be able to debate it then, because the House has resolved at the instance of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), that Government business . shall take precedence. Under the system that is developing in this chamber, as private members on both sides know, Ministers make long, wearying statements at the table. And it may be that their statements will take up most of the broadcasting time, with the result that the listening public will not hear the ebb and flow of debate, there is no political liberty and will thus not be able to form their own conclusions. A thorough inquiry m was made into the proposal that the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and the recommendation of the committee was that all the debates should be broadcast. For ten years all the debates in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been broadcast. The proceedings of the Upper House in N.ew Zealand are not, I concede, broadcast, but the set-up there is different from that of the Australian Senate, which is elected on the same. franchise as is the House of Representatives. You, Mr Speaker, suggested to the Broadcasting Committee that it recommend that the. proceedings in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and to enable that to be done you proposed a simple arrangement of the programmes of both Houses in respect of the origination of legislation. Yet the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) declares that the proceedings in both Houses cannot be broadcast. , Committee recommended against the simultaneous broadcasting of the proceedings in the two Houses. is wrong. that the Broadcasting Committee recommended against the broadcasting of the proceedings in both Houses, it is evident that he has not read the report. it to the House later. casting Committee did recommend that the whole debate be broadcast, not just bits and pieces, as may be decided by the committee proposed to be set up under this bill. for Moreton( Mr Francis), who is a member of the Broadcasting Committee, tells me that it made that recommenda; tion, but the Minister says that it did",45,Calwell

They subscribed to the recommendation that the whole .debate be broadcast. Yet the ..Government brings down this bill, which runs counter to the recommendations of its own supporters on the ""Broadcasting Committee, Mr 'Speaker and the President of the Senate, and to the practice followed successfully for ten years in New Zealand. This' is an emasculated, inadequate proposal.

I concede that many of them work in earnest and produce good results, but if the proposed committee should decide that certain groups !of Ministers should monopolize the air at the expense-of other honourable not parochial, but national, to say to the electorate through the broadcas'.ing system, that would be most inappropriate. I appeal to the good sense of the Government to realize that the scheme put forward in this ibill is not . workable. Members of the proposed committee will not be able to agree on the subjects that should be broadcast or as to who should broadcast. Now is 'the time 'to put the service on a proper basis.

That is robbing the people of The people have a a part of their heritage. At the cost of, I believe, £10,000 a forest of microphones was installed in this chamber during the recess, indicating to honourable members that the Government intended to carry providing for the broadcasting of all the proceedings'; but this inadequate, bill, under which a committee will decide how the honourable little of the proceedings shall be broadcast, will cause the people to say that the money has been ill spent.

Butin addressing' myself to the bill 1 am fortified by the 1 knowledge that, although my electors will be delighted to. listen in to the debates, the people generally are not §o interested in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings as honourable members imagine. I have very good reason to believe that they are not. That does not refer to my electorate, because the people""there are.politically minded. They have no legislature, no legislative council, not even a town council. They must be federally and politically minded, because they look to me, as their representative, to solve or try to solve, all their problems, whereas people in the -States have their State legislatures, municipal . councils, roads boards and so on to occupy their attention, and they will not be greatly interested in 90 per cent, of the purely domestic matters that are debated in this House. I admit that the "" hill-billys "" of Kings Cross, the Yarra Bank, the Sydney Domain and such places will be almost diving into their radio, sets to listen to the riotous matter that so often emanates from honourable gentlemen, but they will not be interested in the really sensible speeches that are never even reported in the press. I am delighted when my speeches are not reported, because I know that that indicates their excellence. I remember clearly that when the late Sir Littleton Groom was with me as an independent member of this Parliament he made, one morning, an excellent speech, one that was full of oratory and common sense, but not one word of it was reported in the press. He was disgusted. I mention this for the benefit of new members, and I advise tljem not to be surprised if the press does not report their speeches. Usually, that is a sign that an honourable member"" has made a good speech. If I had the oratory of Lord Rosebery, I should never be in difficulties. I could indulge in his mixed metaphor of which I call to mind the following example: "" I smell a rat. I see it floating in the air. I shall nip it in the bud "". AndI am not ,able to emulate Charles Lamb in the use of the long sentence. If I . were, I should be worth listening to. Tbat master of para dox-, G. K. Chesterton, says, "" There are some people who look upon the big things as little things, but men mistake little things for big things "". That observation Gan. be applied in many respects to the Government. AndI could quote that great lexicographer, Dr. Johnson member to connect his remarks with the bill. privilege, and the reception of honourable members' voices over the air. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has said, the Government members will be able to dominate the times of broadcasting. They believe that this advantage will enable the Government to win the forthcoming elections. But Dr. Johnson said, "" It is a great disadvantage when self-interest coincides with an exact proposition by no means proved "". I give that advice to the Government. Its proposition in this matter is not proved,"" nor is it likely to be proved. Much has been said about privilege, particularly by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I recall that when I exercised my right of privilege in this chamber in December, 1934, to expose crookedness in the mining industry in the Northern Territory, the honourable member was the very one to criticize me and my exercise of that very privilege he now professes to admire. On that occasion the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) came to my rescue, and saved the situation on my behalf. member to connect his remarks with the bill. regard to our privilege as members of the Parliament. We should refrain from abusing.it to the detriment of people outside who cannot speak for themselves. However, an honourable member fails in his duty if he does not exercise his privilege to expose some evil which he knows to exist. Any honourable member who fails in that respect does so because he, is not gifted with intestinal fortitude, hut has the -physiology of a snipe.

I should like to see that number increased even to 3,600. I do not believe that any honourable member would have any difficulty in distributing that number. Already, my list is full, and in addition I subscribe for copies which I make available to various people. If the Government, wished to induce seriousminded people to read Hansard, it would instead of broadcasting proceedings in this chamber in some hill-billy fashion, advertise the fact that -the yearly subscription to Hansard is 4s., and that Hansard may be obtained from the Government Printer, Canberra. I know of very many people who are hardly aware that Hansard exists. certainly do . not know where to obtain it, and they do not know its price. If this Government were anxious to serve the needs of seriousminded people in this matter it would advertise Hansard and encourage the public generally to read it. The printed report of speeches in Parliament will always he more serviceable than the broadcasting of speeches, because radio listeners will receive muddled impressions of what happens in this chamber. Honourable member's opposite seem to be very anxious to confine the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament to stations which serve the capital cities and more densely populated astonished at the Government's objection to the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr positions in a sentence of commas, semiFadden) that the regional station at Dalby should be used for this purpose. Apparently, no provision is to be made to enable residents of Moresby, Darwin, Alice Springs and the sparsely populated areas to the north of Australia to listen to these debates. I understand that the military authorities are about to relinquish control of eight stations at Darwin, Moresby and other northern centres, which they took over during the war. if the privilege of listening to proceedings in Parliament over the air is to be given to people in the more Mr Blain. densely populated areas, it is incumSerious-minded people, who bent upon the Government to make similar facilities available to people in the outlying areas which I have menHonorable members are tioned The Government, if necessary, should allow the people of Darwin to purchase the local station and operate it on a community basis as a regional station. The residents of New Guinea have no representative in this Parliament. They look to me to represent them, and to voice their needs in the difficult task of rehabilitating themselves after their awful experiences during the war. I urge the Government to provide a station at Darwin. It has been said that honourable members should say what they mean and mean what they say. If they follow that rule the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliamentmay be of some benefit to the public. However, having regard to the words often spoken in They heat in the course of a debate, the written report of -proceedings is preferable to the broadcasting of speeches. Most of ns, I hope, will have something worth-while to say; and I hope that most of us will mean what we say. However, many honourable members opposite speak with their tongues in their cheek. From a national point of view I hope that they do; but from the point of view of party politics I hope that the reverse is the case, because out of their mouths will they be convicted.' I refer honourable members to Professor Walter Murdoch's delightful essay, entitled The Art of Writing. The Professor explained that for many years he had been decentres. I am livering to university students lectures on the art of writing. He had advised them regarding the proper colons, emphatic words, and the like. The idea of saying, what we mean, and meaning what we say, will have a direct bearing upon the desirability of broadcasting the debates of this Parliament. Professor Murdoch wroteSay what you mean-ho w easy it sounds, how hard it really is! It is, in fact, an ideal, never to be completely realized by mere mortals. Let me illustrate by a figure of speech which I may have thought of for myself or found in some book or other. (It seems too good to be mine.) There are various ways of getting eggs to market. One way is to put them in a basket and carry them; this is a slow and laborious method, though a fairly safe one. Another way, an up-to-date and expeditious way, would be to put them down the muzzle of a cannon, find the range accurately, take good aim, and shoot them to market. Assume, for the sake of argument, that they would arrive; but in what condition would they arrive? Well, the whole art of writing is the art of getting our eggs to market without breaking them; that is, of getting our ideas to the mind of the reader without changing them beyond recognition. If you can so write that your thought reaches the reader's mind exactly as it was when it was a,thought in your mind, you are the perfect writer. But there has never been a perfect writer. If the spirit of Shakespeare could look into our minds as we read Hamlet's soliloquy, he would say, ""No, no; that wasn't exactly what I meant; you've got it wrong! "" Broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament can serve only one useful purpose. The sooner the debates of the Senate and the House of Representatives are put on the air the better it w ill be, because I know that if the Government erects regional stations in various country districts Ministers w ill soon convict themselves out of their own mouths.

The members of the committee wanted to have these matters dealt w it h by regulation: the bill prescribes that that shall be left to the joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament. Paragraph 52 of the report reads:We suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned not in one chamber for the whole of the time to the exclusion of ""the other chambershould be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the short-wave stations, except during the short periods when "" straight"" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air; .

It was not contemplated that the proceedings of both Houses should be broadcast simultaneously. Opposition suggested it , as also did the honourable members for Barker( Mr. I ' am suggesting Archie Cameron) and Richmond( Mr. Anthony). In paragraph 49 the Broadcasting Committee had this to sayThe difficulty of varying times could be overcome, where necessary, by recording the proceedings as they occur and broadcasting from the discs at the proper times, using land-lines, for transmission of the recordings to the local stations from which the broadcasts would be made. Most of the criticism has been in respect of re-broadcasts. It is feared by honourable members opposite that something -may be done, which w ill be detrimental to their interests. Yet the course mentioned was actually recommended. The members concerned did not know what they were doing, or they have now developed a fear complex in regard to the result of the elections. Strong protests have been made about clause 14, which providesNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Honourable gentlemen opposite have discovered in that provision a grave attack upon the privileges of members of Parliament, and a device whereby one political party w ill secure, an advantage over another.

Let me show the way in which privilege is accorded to the publication of Hansard. Section4 (1) of the Parliamentary Papers Act 190S-1935 providesNo action or .proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under the authority of the Senate or of the House of Representatives. Tn the bill, those words have been repeated where they apply.

The Government has' done precisely what the committee recommended; yet some honourable members are still not satisfied! ing the issue. statement. The provision made by the bill is identical w it h that made in respect of the publication of Hansard and other documents published under the authority of this Parliament. It was necessary to do that, in order to protect the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the performance of their duty as broadcasters of the proceedings of the Parliament. want. been done. The provisions of clause 14 do not affect the privileges of this House. Those privileges are protected, not under any legislation of this Parliament but by section 49 of the Constitution, which readsThe powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and of the House of .Representatives, and of the members of the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared sliall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and its members and committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. That is the source from which we derive our privileges. No parliament of the Commonwealth, from the first to the seventeenth, has passed any legislation to give to this legislature any greater powers than are enjoyed by the members of the House of Commons. This Parliament has not sought to take away the privileges given by section 49 of the Constitution, nor has it sought to take to itself additional privileges. Therefore, all this talk about the privileges of members being affected by clause 14 is merely a part of the hyperbolical nonsense to which we have been listening for two days. standing, when privilege is extended to cover any person, it covers every person. in broadcasting the proceedings of this Parliament, just as the persons who record, print or publish what is contained in the documents of this Parliament are privileged and protected against any action in any court. refers to the broadcasting of any portion there is no limitation. T h a t is a malicious power to broadcast anything is imposed by the relevant sections of the AustralianBroadcasting Act. Section 63 of that act covers the matter in part, and so does section 92. I am giving to honourable gentlemen opposite a lot of cheap legal advise, and I hope that they w ill benefit from it . Section 63 of the Australian Broadcasting Act providesThe licensee of a commercial broadcasting station shall not relay or broadcast any part, of the programme of any other broadcasting station, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere, without the consent of the owner or licensee of the originating station and the approval of the Minister. That at least answers the arguments of those who fear that-something sinister is being attempted under this legislation. Section 93 makes this provisionA person shall not, without the consent of the owner or licensee of the station and the approval of the Minister, publish in any manner whatsoever any portion of the text of an item transmitted by a broadcasting station, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere. That would prevent any newspaper or person from taking a note of a broadcast of the proceedings of this Parliament, and subsequently publishing it ; consequently, the danger of partiality, which honourable gentlemen: opposite have convinced themselves exists, has substance only in their own disordered imaginations.",53,Calwell

I have been grossly misrepresented by the Ministerf or I m migration ( Mr Calwell). that I had repudiated the signature which-1, as' a memberof the Broadcasting. Committee,' had attached to its report. It is true that the committee cam vassed all possibilities of broadcasting the proceedings of this. Parliament, and the Minister took up most of his time in reading the comments of the committee. But the recommendations rather than the comments are the meat of this report. The committee was charged with the responsibility of inquiring whether the broadcasting of parliamentary debates is desirable, and', if so, to what extent should' such broadcasts be undertaken. In answer to that I turn to the recommendation which I claim is meat and not comment. The recommendation of the committee to which I consented readsThat during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations, and from theregional stations,, as well as the. short-wave stations, except during the short periods when ""straight"" news sessions are normally on the air.. That no provision should be. made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of tlie proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of Parliamentary business, with the qualification that during divisions and such like intervals, an appropriate official (who should be an officer of the Commission)should broadcast an impartial description of what is taking place. Needless to say, tlie facilities should not be used for other purposes when Parliament is in recess. Paragraph5'3' is as follows*?T h a t gives effect, to We are aware that in New Zealand' doubts have been expressed in certain quarters as. to the! wisdomof broadcasting tlie whole of. the proceedings, but we are of the. opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts of the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset, 1 leaving the question of: modification for consideration in the light of experience.

I do so for the reasons advanced by myself and other honourable members during the second-reading debate. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the whole of the proceedings of this House or of the Senate shall be broadcast, instead of only part of the proceedings as proposed in the bill. I submit that to make a broadcast of only part of the proceedings would be a waste of money, and would not achieve the purpose which we have in mind. The point to 'be considered is whether the broadcast shall represent a fair and substantial account of the proceedings of the Parliament. Asi t is intended to broadcast proceedings for' some hours each day, this requirement will be fulfilled. member know ? The committee which is to determine the matter has not yet been set up. Apparently, it has all been decided -in caucus. that the committee, when appointed, will ensure that in the broadcasts a fair and substantial account of the proceedings is given. Therefore, it will be unnecessary to expend money on broadcasting the whole of the proceedings. Moreover, the committee has advised that technical difficulties in the way of such broadcasts are insuperable. the Opposition) [10.30] -The amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) raises in a neat form one of the two principal matters debated on this bill. I have risen not merely to repeat what I said on the second reading, but to say the impression that this was a non-party measure, that it concerned the relation of outside public authorities to -the Parliament, and I therefore express my profound disappointment that we should have been treated at the end of the second reading debate to a purely party political outburst on the subject. The question before the committee is not to be determined'by arguing about what the Broadcasting Committee said. Its views are the in print, and we all have had the opportunity of reading them and we know what they are. The question involved in this clause is whether we should broadcast the whole or only a part of the proceedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Some attempt has been made to suggest that honourable members on this side do not want to have the proceedings of the Parliament broadcast. Why honourable gentlemen opposite should deem this to be so I do not know. For one, I am very keen on having the proceedings of the Parliament broadcast, and I do not imagine that any more harm will come to one side than to the other as the result of their being broadcast.

264,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rGovernment cannot accept an amendment which, purports to override .the insuperable. Nor can it incur the expenditure of £500j000 in tying ,up 22 national broadcasting stations, because that is what is involved, instead of six national stations, one in each capital city, and a seventh in Newcastle, and -such other regional or short-wave stations as the -Joint Committee on the. Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings decides. It has been suggested that the short-wave and regional stations are not to be used for the broadcasting of parliamentary . proceedings. No one has. any authority to say that. The committee will decide that, and if I understand the temper -of 'honourable members arightj it is almost unanimously desired that the regional stations, as well as the national stations 'in the capital cities .and in Newcastle, shall be given the opportunity of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. We must start somewhere, and we .are making this experiment in .the way in which the Broadcasting Committee itself recommended. The amendment -cuts right across -what is recommended, and the Government cannot accept it. ; -The Minister has .departed from his -contention that the Broadcasting Committee did not recommend that the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings should be in full, and 'now argues fhat tihe proceedings .cannot be broadcast in f u l l because -of 'the costs. The matter before us concerns not. only whether the -proceedings should be 'fully or partially 'broadcast, but also whether partial broadprovision is fundamental to the whole casting will give immunity 'to the Australian 'Broadcasting Commission. In his >second-reading speech, the Leader of -the 'Opposition ( Mr Menzies) .said .that there was an obligation on the newspapers to publish .a fair and '.accurate ireport of the proceedings in .the 'Parliapoint of ..contention arising inrespect of ment, but .what will be .the .position of the Australian .Broadcasting Commission, which will be broadcasting -only a part -of .the proceedings:? Will the commission have the necessary privilege conferred -upon it to broadcast only part of a debate;? Libelous statements may be made . and the broadcast stopped before they can be'replied to. It may happen that only one side of -a debate would bebroadcast. That 'would not be a fair presentation of the .cases presented in the House. The Government seeks to meet that point by providing immunity to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In my second reading speech I raised the point .as to whether a special .privilege should b.e granted to one section of the community in respect of 'the broadcasting of speeches in the Parliament. It .is unjustifiable to grant immunity in respect of a broadcast which covers only part of a debate. The Minister, seeking to rely on privilege in this respect said that Hansard, under .a special act, enjoyed immunity; but Hansar'd reports cover -the whole of the proceedings in the Parliament. Therefore, the immunity enjoyed by Hansard is fair; it cannot be compared-with the immunity to be provided in respect of the broadcast of only portion of the proceedings, 'which might contain libelous statements to 'which replies made in. the Parliament are not broadcast also. This matter involves more than the point as to whether proceedings in the Parliament should be broadcast for the benefit of ithe people generally, or whether the whole, or. .only part, of the proceedings should be broadcast. .Under .this provision the Australian Broadcasting .Commission is tto be given the privilege of broadcasting only a portion of .proceedings which might be libelous. That' is a privilege that is not enjoyed by the press. Any newspaper which published only portion of prioceedings which contained libelous.statements and failed to publish the whole of the proceedings, would lay itsel f open. to. action for damages for libel. This proposal. As .the .amendment seeks to rectify the position I have indicated, I support it. The -amendment deals -with .the main -the -measure. If .the Minister for Immigration (Ma*.

Earlier in the debate he said that the Broadcasting Committee had never agreed that all of the proceedings in Parliament should he broadcast; and in support of that statement he quoted extensively from.the committee's report. However, the Minister cannot have studied the committee's recommendations thoroughly because in paragraph 53 of its report it states. . . but wo are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcastsof the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset, leavParliam'ent, and consideration should-be ing the question of modification for consideragiven to broadcasting proceedings in both tion in the light of experience. All of the members of the committee were parties to that recommendation, and in view of the Minister's statement. I wonder whether Cabinet realizes that he is acting counter to what was recommended by the Labour members of the committee. Has he told caucus the whole story? Is he trying to .mislead honourable members in hisquotations from the committee's report? The Minister could achieve unanimity with respect to this measure by accepting the amendment. I can see no reason why he should not do so. ask the Minister to read carefully paragraph 52 of the report of the Broadcasting Committee. . . that no provision should be made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of the proceedingsexactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business. . . .

However, the Government should implement the. recommendation of theBroadcasting Committee that proceedings should be broadcast exactly as they 'occurin the normal transaction of parliamentary business, that is, proceedings in each chamber should bebroadcast from start to finish. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) cited the evidence which I gave before the Broadcasting Committee. I do not retract that evidence. I said that there are. two Houses of theHouses. I suggested that in' order to facilitate this course being followed, more legislation should he initiated in the Senate, thus giving that chamber legisla^ tion to deal with before it became stalebecause it had been debated in this chamber: I also said that means might be found to alternate the introduction of legislation between the Senate and the House of Representatives. in each House should be broadcast. that the honourable member agrees that proceedings in each.

If that is his view, he should be careful not to vote for the amendment, because it proposes that the. whole of the proceedings) not the proceedings on any one day; in the Senate and the House of Representatives should be broadcast. The only way to broadcast the whole of the proceedings in each, chamber is to commence broadcasting from the moment the session opens to the closing minute of the session. Therefore, the amendment which proposes that'the whole of the proceedings in the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast means that the whole of the proceedings in both Houseswould have to be broadcast simultaneously, that is, from the moment each House met until it adjourned.

I have heard comment to the effect that the expenditure of £10,000 upon the present arrangements is exorbitant, and represents a waste of public money.

The report continuesThe only remaining proposition under present conditions is the use of the main national stations in the capital cities and the national supplemented by short-wave service to remote areas. This would mean the substitution of parliamentary broadcasts in place of entertainment, commentaries on current affairs, and other items normally broadcast from these stations during the period involved. Therefore, the committee recommendedWe suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in tlie chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations. and from the regional stations, as well as from the shortwave stations, except during the short periods when "" s t r a i g h t "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air. Obviously, the committee recommended exactly what the bill now provides.

If we adopt the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party we shall be. obliged to broadcast the whole of the proceedings of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.

It therefore becomes obvious that in order stations capable of serving nearly all fairly to convey the deliberations of this Parliament to -the listening public of Australia it is necessary to broadcast fully the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. But this is both financially and physically impracticable at the present time. The proposal now before us is immature; it has been brought before us at a time when the Government can not afford to do the fair thing financially nor is the country able to do it physically. I wish to make it quite clear that if the amendment moved bymy leader be carried I am under no illusion that that would result in both Houses of the Parliament being broadcast simultaneously. I know only too well that, for the time being, there would be no broadcasts at all. I want to be perfectly straight-forward in this matter. If I am confronted with thechoice between no broadcasts and a distorted broadcast-becaus e a partial broadcast could be nothing but a distorted broadcast-the n I am against broadcasting altogether, and I support the amendment moved by my leader. of the Australian Country party) [11.5] -The honourable member for Indi when he stated that the matter boiled down to a question whether there should be a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections, ineffectiveness and consequent waste of money, or a full broadoast of the proceedings of both Houses when money and facilities are available. That is exactly what I had in mind. The present is not an opportune time to incur the enormous expenditure that would be necessary for a completely effective broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. On the other hand, I am firmly of the opinion that money should not be extracted from the public purse for what must obviously be merely a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections and mechaever, certain honourable gentlemen opponical disabilities. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) went from the sublime to the ridiculous when he drew attention to the fact that the Broadcasting broadcasting of the proceedings of that Committee stated that the ideal arrange-. ment would be the. provision of a network of 22 additional national medium-wave populated portions of Australia, the equipment for which alone would entail expenditure of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £500,000. That envisages the most complete and perfect system of f u l l broadcasting of the parliamentary debates of which Australia is capable. The Broadcasting Committee did not contemplate such a grandiose scheme in the initial stages of parliamentary broadcasting. Such a proposal envisages serving the whole population of Australia. The proposal now before us does not go nearly as far as that. I have already pointed out that there are many people in remote' parts of Australia, including those in the electorates of Kennedy and Wilmot, who will never have an opportunity to listen to the partial broadcasts proposed by 'the Government. And even the broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses fully would not, in the initial stages, necessitate the utilization of the 22 additional stations.

The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) does not want any broadcast. He said that the money proposed to be expended on such broadcasts should be applied to the erection of more national regional stations throughout Australia, and that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast when the whole of the programme of tbe Postmaster-General's Department has been completed.

If the Government proposes to broadcast the whole of a debate, arrangements to that end can be made. If it were decided that the debate on an amendment which was likely to last for some time should not be broadcast,. the Australian 'Broadcasting Commission could easily carry on with alternative programmes in the meantime. If the Government had made' up its mind to broadcast the whole of a debate from the beginning to the end of a bill, so that everybody would have an equal right to participate in the broadcast, and to treat the Senate similarly on a future occasion, I should be in favour of the bill. That is the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee, of which I am a member. Buti f the Government will not give that assurance, then I take my stand with the Leader of the Australian Country party. If the Minister desires to secure my vote, let him give me an unqualified undertaking that he will do what the Broadcasting Committee has recommended-that no provision will be made"" for any pre-arrangement of speakers for any time, and that there will be a "" straight"" broadcast of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business. If he will not do that, I shall have no faith in the bill and shall support the amendment. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) has been a member of this Parliament long enough to know that it would be impossible for the Minister to give the assurance that he seeks. The honourable gentleman has said that unless the Minister assures him that a debate having been started in this chamber it will be continued to its conclusion, he cannot support the bill. The honourable gentleman has had long parliamentary experience, *and knows that no committee could forecast when a debate will conclude in this chamber and be commenced in the Senate. Frequently, a second-reading debate appears likely to finish before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, but a new line of -argument arouses other thoughts, with the result that the debate is continued and at the end of the day has to be adjourned until the following sitting. In order to give the assurance desired by the honourable gentleman, the whole of the proceedings would have to be conducted to a timetable. would.

If it were sought to give to the proposed committee the right to tell Mr Speaker that he should call upon a certain number of speakers from each side, the Standing Orders would have to be altered very considerably. The question of the choice of speakers does not arise. The bill provides for the closest possible approach to the report which the honourable member has signed, and in order to induce him to vote for the measure I wish to convince him of the absolute impossibility of the Minister giving such an undertaking as that asked for by the honourable member. .The duties of the 'committee will have to be most elastic-. It must be capable of being easily called together in order to fix a programme of broadcasts in' both branches of the legislature, perhaps from hour to hour. To attempt to forecast at present exactly what would happen would resemble optimism on the -jazz. Surely the honourable member for Dalley move the adjournment of the House in ( Mr Rosevear) has raised unnecessary order to direct attention to urgent matters difficulties. He has omitted to mention that there will be a compere watching what then ? It would be the proceedings and that he will take his cue from Mr Speaker.

The honourable member for Dalley spoke of the expenditure of £500,000 being necessary for a complete broadcasting service for Australia in respect of parliamentary proceedings, but we have witnessed the expenditure of much larger sums for purposes of less value to the people. I suggest that we should consent to a complete broadcast of our proceedings with such facilities as are available. We cannot force the people to listen to the proposed broadcasts. Many do not wish to hear them, but those who desire to follow the debates intelligently, and do not get all the information they want from the newspapers, should be able to hear the debates broadcast over the various networks. One can well imagine the unseemly jostling that would occur around the forest of microphones, under the proposal contemplated in the bill. If the proposed committee were abolished mously. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) sought to give us the benefit of his advice, as presiding officer in this chamber, as to how the system would function. If I had need of further argument to convince me that I should oppose the partial broadcasting of the debates, his speech provided it. He pictured a committee which would not be bound by regular hours of broadcasting, or any predetermined schedule, but which Would decide from time to time when the debates were to be broadcast and for what period. It is quite impossible to decide such matters as that without bearing in mind whose speeches are to be broadcast. The parliamentary system which we all claim to cherish has its whole virtue in the conir pletely unfettered freedom of every honourable member to speak,bound only by the Standing Orders, as and when he thinks fit.

If I needed anything further to convince me that partial broadcasts of the debates would constitute a deadly attack on the free use of our parliamentary system, the speech of the honourable member for Dalley.provided it.

I do so for the reasons so ably advanced by the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen). The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) gave honourable members his idea of how the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings would be carried out, and this prompted the honourable member for Indi to point out how the system could be manipulated to the advantage of the party in power.

Honourable members opposite seem to have something weighing heavily on their minds. They would not divide the committee on the question of broadcasting both Houses of Parliament simultaneously, although' I had hoped they would, because I was curious to see how many of them would support the proposal. amendment, if accepted, would destroy the whole purpose of the bill, and would prevent two-thirds of the .members of this Parliament from being heard over the air. We are not going to help the Opposition to destroy our bill, nor to achieve anything so undemocratic as is proposed in the amendment. The amendment was not circulated before the committee met. It was an afterthought, and the Government cannot accept it. The committee has before it an ill-conceived and ill-digested measure. We have been told that the bill is based on the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, but none of the Government members on that committee has anything to say about it. It appears that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), who is in charge of the bill, has not even read the report oi' the committee. Nevertheless, we arc asked to accept his say-so, and he and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), arc the only two on the Government side who have given any explanation of the hill at all. I suggest to the Minister that he should report progress now, and consult caucus about the bill to-morrow. He should say, ""Look, boys, I forgot to tell you about this committee that it is proposed to appoint"". But for this obnoxious provision the Government might well have had the bill before this. have taken part in this debate only not realize because, for the time being, I , as Speaker of the House, am the custodian of the rights of honourable members, and am charged with the duty of administering the Standing Orders. I pointed out that the things which honourable members opposite seem to fear will not take place because the Standing Orders will prevent it. BecauseI said this, the honourable said that myspeech convinced him that tlie bill was designed as an attaek upon -the privileges of honourable members. Although the honourable member for Indi and his leader ( Mr Fadden) sleep in the same bed, they do not dream the same dreams. The honourable member for Indi is concerned about the rights of private members. He expressed the fear The present that the tendency would be for parties to select speakers to state their case while Parliament was on the air; that pressure would be brought to bear on other members not to speak during those times. The honourable member for Indi was afraid £<)v democracy and demanded that every member of every party should have equal right to be heard, but now his leader moves an amendment, the purpose of which is the exclusion from the air of one-half of the Government supporters. claimed that if the broadcast of a debate was started, it should be continued till it finished. "" I know of no standing order or provision of this measure that says that when the Opposition side runs out of speakers the Government's side shall not be allowed further speakers.

That is apparently the position. member for Indi talked about the rights of individual members. Everything in the bill is viewed with suspicion. thereafter the Labour party speakers shall Members are to be gagged. They are to have pressure placed on them. Therefore he fears this bill. Yet his own leader a complete broadcast of both Houses. has moved, not that members be gagged by their own leaders, but that, when the Opposition side runs out of steam, we must also run out of steam. I do not call that democracy. When I first looked at this amendment,. I agreed with the Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Calwell) and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear). If this measure provided for the full-time broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament the honourable gentlemen would be correct. But their contentions now distort the facts, because the broadcast is to be only a partial broadcast of four hours a day, and it is impossible for 75 men to speak in that time. broadcasts were to be limited to four hours a day? the committee decided that the broadcast should alternate between the two Houses. Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. poses sharing equally the few hours in which the proceedings of the Parliament will be broadcast. for Immigration and Minister for Information [11.47] -The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) indicates that his party, is working on the assumption that the proceedings' of the Parliament will be broadcast for only about four hours or some other limited time each day. There is no justification for that assumption. It will be possible for the proposed committee to decide that the proceedings of the House of Representatives should be broadcast for a whole day or two days. The Senate does not sit so frequently as does the House of Representatives. The proceedings in the House of Representatives must be broadcast all the time tbe Senate is not sitting. The Australian Country party's proposal is that the proceedings shall be broadcast for a certain length of time, and that go off the air. That is absurd. First, the Australian Country party argued for The amendment means that the Australian Country party does not want all the proceedings of the House of Representatives broadcast during, say, a week when the Senate is not sitting. They say now "" Oh, well, we have changed our minds. Although we can have the House of Representatives on the air all the time it is sitting and the Senate is not sitting, we do not want it, and the Government supporters can have only a portion of the time "". cast the proceedings in the House of Representatives for the whole day when it is in session? make a decision and report to the Parliament, and if honourable members then want to broadcast all day they will, be able to alter the report, if necessary, to read that way.

I do not know who the members of that committee will be. It may not convince the Parliament of its views; but if the members of it act as reasonably as members of the Broadcasting Committee have acted in this matter, it should be able to bring in unanimous reports. Mr Speaker and the President will be members of the joint committee, and the Leaders of the Opposition parties in each chamber, or their deputies, will also be members of it. I ask honourable members to facilitate the establishment of the joint committee and thus enable it to get to work. It will be time enough, when that committee presents its report, to raise the matters of the kind now raised by honourable members opposite. The right honourable member for Darling Downs said that the Government was putting up "" Aunt Sallies"" ; but that is exactly what he is doing. His proposal lacks' merit. This is the first time in the history of the upon it, but I wish the Minister to clarify Parliament that government supporters have been asked to stultify themselves in order to suit the whims of members of the Opposition when they could not carry a proposition which, because of its impracticability and the fact that it involved excessive cost, was rejected by the Broadcasting Committee on which the'Opposition parties have four representatives out of a total personnel of nine members. The remarks just made by the Minister charge of the measure sums up after the for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) convince last speaker has addressed the House. me that he does not understand the meaThe honourable member for Dalley( Mr sure. He said that-he does not know what Rosevear) has implied that that procedure proposals will be put before the joint committee. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that full debates should be broadcast. That proposal has been rejected by the Minister in favour of broadcasts of only portion of the proceedings. That being so, the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) has moved an amendment with the object of dividing the time allotted to these partial broadcasts equally between Government supporters and Opposition members. That is the amendment in a nutshell, and any one who believes in-fair play should support it. The Minister has said that he does not know how much time will be allotted to the broadcasts. That' ia another reason why the amendment should be carried. If the broadcasts are to last for, say five or ten hours the time should be divided equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties; but, in the case of full-time broadcasts, honourable members should he given such ti-nie as they consider necessary to enable them to deal fully with the particular subject under consideration. The Government has refused our requests for full-time-broadcasts and proposes to have partial broadcasts; but the Minister cannot tell us what the duration of those broadcasts will be. In these circumstances, it is the duty of all honourable members to urge the Government to be fair by dividing the time equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties. I have an open mind on this matter. I have listened with interest to the remarks of all honourable members who have spoken one point. It has been stated by some honourable members opposite that the normal procedure will be followed during the period of broadcasting. The normal procedure as I have observed it since I have been a member of this chamber is that, when a bill is before the chamber, Mr Speaker calls upon honourable members alternately from the Government side and the Opposition side, and the debate proceeds until the Minister in",69,Calwell

It provides that the proceedings of the Parliament shall be broadcast. All honourable members know that under the existing system of broadcasting in Australia, the whole of the proceedings of both chambers cannot be broadcast simultaneously. This bill provides that as much of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast as is possible with the existing equipment. The suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) is so much eye-wash. The right honourable gentleman began by raising all sorts of objections to the bill. He then read evidence which he had given to the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. It contradicted the speech that he was then making. He turned somersaults, and attempted with one amendment to provide that the whole of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast simultaneously. .Of course, he is aware that at present it is impossible to carry out such a proposal. When that amendment was defeated, as he knew it would be, he submitted the proposal now under consideration. He is attempting to show that the Government is trying to "" put over"" some trick to gag the Opposition in debates. If the proceedings of this chamber are broadcast for four hours, six hours or twelve hours in any one day and the rules of debate are observed as they have been in the past, the Opposition will always have its opportunity to be heard. SinceI have been a member of this Parliament, I have listened to considerably more speeches from members of the Opposition than from honourable members on this side of the chamber. In my opinion, the object of the Leader of the Australian Country party is not to improve the bill in any way but to obstruct its passage, and attempt, as far as he can, to make it unworkable. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) reveals a similar attitude. Earlier, he was whole-heartedly in favour of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, and signed a recommendation to that effect. Since coming into this chamber this evening, he has changed his mind about eight times, and has reached the stage when he does not know whether he is standing or sitting. He is so muddle-headed about the whole matter that he has forgotten what the purport of the bill is. ber for Moreton stated that if we could convince him, he would support us. vinced, as I know from experience during the last two years. This clause provides for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament. Other clauses provide the method whereby those broadcasts, shall take place. There are no tricks in the bill. We have not put up any ""Aunt Sallies."" The legislation is clear and straightforward, and the only reason why the Leader of the Australian Country party is persisting with amendments is to obstruct its passage, and, if possible, make it unworkable. -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson) did not hear the earlier discussions, but I remind him that he signed the committee's report containing the following recommendation:That no provision should be made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transactions of Parliamentary business. Although he signed that report, he now makes all kinds of ridiculous utterances and attacks the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis). The bill was thrown upon the table of the House, and apparently the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) did not inform' Cabinet or caucus about this rather sinister committee. The Opposition's proposal that all the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast has been rejected. Now, we 'desire to ensure that the practice of Mr Speaker of calling alternately speakers from the Government and Opposition sides of the chamber sliall be observed during the broadcasting of debates.

The Minister can accept it without loss of prestige, although he stated that it would destroy the purpose of the bill. I was prepared to accept this as a half-baked but reasonably fair bill to bring the Parliament closer to the people. To the Minister for Information, who claims that the proposed amendment will destroy the purpose of the bill, I can only say that if that be so its purpose is one of ill-intent. Let us put the amendment to a vote and thus provide an opportunity to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite. -The honourable member for Indi( Mr Maranoa( Mr Adermann),"" Wimmera McEwen) frankly admitted that the whole purpose of the amendment was to destroy the bill. tation. member openly admitted that that was the purpose of the amendment. but to destroy the intention of caucus. honourable members opposite are suffering from a bad attack of pre-election jitters. The Broadcasting Committee as a whole approved of certain recommendations upon whioh this bill is based. But since the bill has been before us it, has become increasingly obvious that the whips have been cracked over the heads of those honourable members opposite who put their signature to the Broadcasting Committee's report. Can there be any other explanation of their hostility to the bill? It is admitted on all sides that a f u l l and complete broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament is impossible at the present time. Therefore the object of the amendment can be no other than to destroy the bill. pose is to defeat the intention of caucus. the people of Australia were asked to decide to what party they should entrust Is the the reins of Government, and by their votes they returned to this Parliament twice as many representatives of the Labour party as of the parties in Opposition. Honourable members opposite, howThis mentary debates will not alter the procedure normally adopted by the Chair ever, have the audacity to claim that despite their numerical inferiority speakers for the anti-Labour parties' should be allotted broadcast time equal to that allotted to members who sit on this side of the chamber. I pointed out that the broadcasting of the Parliain calling members alternately from the Government and Opposition sides as far as it is practicable to do so. It does no$ always happen, however, that members of the three parties represented in this chamber are alternately called. I recollect that during a recent debate in this chamber the honourable members for ( Mr Turnbull) and Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) successively received the call from the Chair. I have invariably found that more speakers rise from the Opposition than from the Government side: I fail to see any merit in the amendment, and I shall vote against it.

The Public Works Committee consists of three members of the Senate and six members of the House of Representatives. I have not heard of any protest having been made by the Senate in regard to its representation on that very important body. powers of tlie Senate are very limited. ing that. The Public Works Committee examines works projects of the Commonwealth Government, and makes recommendations to both Houses of the Parliament in relation thereto. The Social Security Committee, upon whose recommendations most, of the social services legislation of this Government and the last Administration was based, consists of three members of the Senate and four members of the House of Representatives. Committee has on it, two member's of the Senate and .five members of the House of Representatives. Parliamentary committees that are now in existence. They have made importantrecommendations to different governments, and I ' have not heard of any protest regarding inequality of representation. Equality of representation of the two chambers has never been an accepted principle. I stated in evidence to the Broadcasting Committee that it would have to make up its mind as to whether the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings were to be regarded as having entertainment or educational value. The number of members of the House of Representatives is more than double the number of senators, consequently, this chamber ought to have greater representation on committees than has the other chamber. Those who sincerely believe that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast must admit, that the broadcasts should be made of the proceedings of that House which will most appeal to listeners. In making that statement, I am not saying anything derogatory of the Senate. The interest displayed by visitors and residents of Canberra is a true criterion of the appeal that is made. Whenever there is an important, debate in the House of Representatives, its galleries are filled any such committee. The honourable to overflowing, whereas the galleries ""reserved for strangers in, the Senate chamber are invariably empty. That is generally the position. Politically minded people who will listen to parliamentary proceedings will be guided by the interest taken in the respective Houses in the past, and I consider that this chamber is entitled to the representation sought. I object to the argument advanced by the honourable member for Indi as to the right of the two branches of the legislature to equality of representation. In the selection of members of important parliamentary committees the two Houses have never had equality of representation We do not frequently hear the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and we are reminded that he is no mean antagonist in debate. I recall that, when the Labour party was in opposition, he showed much skill in debate, and he has The War Expenditure now demonstrated that he has not lost the art and some of the artifices of debate. One of the oldest tricks which he has Those are the only presented is that of replying to a point which his opponent has not made. I claim that there is no precedent for any machinery, committee, or regulation enabling one branch of the legislature to exercise authority over the other on procedural matters. The honourable member for Dalley has shrewdly pointed out that the House of Representatives has a majority of members on the Social Ser-' vices Committee, the Public Works Commitiee, and the War Expenditure Committee, but those committees have nothing to do with the procedural conduct of debates in this Parliament. HadI not replied to the honourable member he might have ""got away w it h "" a shrewd trick; but, it is not difficult to expose the fallacy, of his argument. He cannot challenge my contention that there is nothing in our parliamentary practice which enables one House to exercise authority over the other in the procedural conduct of its affairs. .

Surely the honourable member for Indi does not suggest that the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) or the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) should be left off the committee.

Sub-clause 1 is, I think, a proper protection to give to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, assuming that we accept the principle of giving privilege to partial broadcasts. I have said what I wanted to say on that subject. If that principle members is accepted, the amendment seems to be .reasonable. But the second part of the amendment, which is designed to alter the privilege of members of Parliament in relation to debate, is not one that can command my support. I should perhaps add a word to what has been said on this question of privilege, which is very important. There has been some confusion about it in the course of tbe consideration of this bill. The problem is not one of the privilege of the member of Parliament. As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the privilege of the Parliament rests on an entirely different basis, one that this bill does not touch. Whether an honourable member, is reported in a newspaper or in Hansard or is broadcast, it is still true that what he says in the chamber cannot be made the subject-matter, or cause of action against him. So the privilege of a member of Parliament we can set on or criminal, one side. It is not touched. All broadcasting that the bill proposes to do under clause 14 is to give a new privilege to a new publishing medium, the broadcasting medium. I pointed out before that the basic distinction is a distinction between, on the one hand, the qualified privilege that we give to the newspaper, a privilege attaching to only a f a i r and accurate report, which, in the case of attack and counter-attack, must be balanced if it is to enjoy that protection, and, on the other hand, the absolute privilege now proposed to be conferred upon the partial broadcast of parliamentary debates. I take the greatest exception to conferring the latter form of privilege. This does not concern members, except insofar as the creation of this privilege may actually damage a member.

I am taking the matter in two steps. This requires a great deal of thought. ""We are creating this new absolute privilege for the broadcasting of -only a portion of a debate. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) has foreshadowed an amendment to insert the word "" re-broadcasting"" in clause 14 after the word ""broadcasting"". So absolute privilege will attach not only to the original broadcast but to a re-broadcast of a portion of a debate, and the re-broadcast, of course, need not be a reproduction of all the matter in the original broadcast. It may he a re-broadcast of one speech or a fraction of a speech, and we are attaching abso-' lute privilege to that. That seems to me most unsound. The only protection would be that conferred in ' the foreshadowed new clause13A (1.) The committee shall have power of the parliamentary debate is broadcast, to determine the conditions in accordance or any fragment of it that may then be with which a re-broadcast may be made of any portion of the proceedings of .either House of selected and approved. For that reason tlie Parliament. (2.) No re-broadcast shall be made of any portion of the amendment as a second portion of the proceedings of either House of line of defence, my first protection the Parliament otherwise than in accordance is that clause 14 itself should be with the conditions so determined. All that means is that we are putting privilege created by' it should be confined into the hands of a committee the right to the broadcasting of Parliament and to say under what circumstances a fragshould not extend to any re-broadcast ment of a debate broadcast to-morrow may other than that broadcast within a few be re-broadcast perhaps six months hours for the purpose of synchronizing hence. I put it to this committee that interstate services. there is no' occasion whatever for rebroadcasts except for the purpose of alinement of times on the interstate for Immigration and Minister for Inforservice. If the purpose is to provide, for mation) [1.1 a.m.] I suggest that in example, that Western Australians shall order to facilitate discussion of the probe able to listen to the debates at a position contained in the amendment we reasonable hour as if the State were an should take the two proposed sub-clauses eastern State, that would be appropriate, separately. but, apart from the need to meet the convenience of listeners in that way, I see no reason why anybody should be given be a good idea.. permission to take a part of a partial broadcast and re-broadcast it. But whether that is done in whole or in part to-day or six months hence, it will utill enjoy absolute privilege. I say, with great respect to everything that has been said, that that is something about -which every honourable gentleman should think. It is not for ' the Parliament to whittle away the privileges of ' the Parliament, but it is for the Parliament to protect its rights, and one of those rights is that its members shall be reported, if reported at all, fairly and accurately. It is no answer to say that some newspapers do not do that. Of course they do not. It is no answer to that to say that the qualified privilege enjoyed by newspaper reporters has been abused; of course, it has. But privilege is well defined in point of law, and they lose their privilege unless they exercise it according to the law. And that exists for our protection and the protection of the Parliament just as much as for the protection of the public. What we are doing here is abandoning that protection by saying, in a rather light-hearted way I am afraid, that there will be absolute protection for the original broadcast, or for any re-brdadcasts, of whatever section whilst I would support the first omitted, or, at the very least, that the",78,Cameron But Government Majority On The Committee

Clause 14 of the hill provides that no action, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. seeks to provide that, the privilege shall be enjoyed only by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, the clause itself gives a protection to any person who broadcasts the proceedings of the Parliament. An amendment which I propose to move later will extend the privilege to rebroadcasts of proceedings of the Parliament. It may he thought that at some time some commercial station should be allowed to broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament, for instance, a speech by the British Prime Minister during his visit to Australia. If the clause is limited to the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission only, protection is not given to employees of any commercial station who may broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament. I desire to cover the whole position, and I suggest that honourable members agree to the clause which provides that any person employed in the work of broadcasting the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be protected. n.m.'J -The honourable member for Warringah (Mi. Spender), in framing his 1 amendment, took into consideration the fact that the clause extended protection to any person, whilst the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) explained that the amendment would prevent a commercial station from re-broadcasting proceedings of the Parliament. ' mentioned that the amendment would not extend protection to a eomraercial station which might broadcast, for instance, a speech by the British Prime Minister in this building. The amendment is designed to place a responsibility upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission which is responsible to the Parliament by virtue of the .fact that it will originate the broadcasts. Buti f the provision is left in the broadest terms to cover arty person, there will be nothing whatever to prevent a commercial station at some stage from extracting some portion of a speech and re-broadcasting Whilst the amendment it with complete immunity. We object to making the provision so wide. The point is that protection should be extended to a body which is responsible to the Parliament, but not to a commercial' broadcasting station that may broadcast some part of a speech made six months previously. This clause has given me a great deal of anxiety, particularly in relation tu the privileges of honourable members. I listened carefully to the speech made by the honourable member fo:Warringah ( Mr Spender). I heard his criticism and his alternative, and from my study of parliamentary privilege,. I should say that no proposition more damaging to parliamentary privilege has been made than that contained in tlie amendment ' forecast and circulated by the honourable member when he spoke to the second reading. I note now that the honourable member has introduced another subclause into his proposition. I agree with everything that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said with regard to the danger of the. clause as it stands in the bill. The clause makes it possible for anybody, .not necessarily, perhaps, any bona fide commercial station, to tune in with a recording instrument to an "" A "" class station broadcast, if forewarned to do so by somebody who intended to make a dangerous, or malicious attack, and by mechanical means extract from that broadcast the more malicious part of it and rebroadcast it from any other station as Mi-.

As the Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out, there is certain privilege in the publication of reports of Parliamenary proceedings; but when anything malicious is contained in the speech reported there is no privilege if the press, or pamphleteer, publishes the defamatory portion of the speech, or the wholeof it containing defamatory matter, and does not at the same time, publish the reply. No privilege at all applies' to such a pubBecausei t adjudged him guilty of a lication. May's Parliamentary Practice cites many cases, particularly in Great Britain, of people having been mulct in heavy damages, notably newspaper proprietors and pamphleteers who used the method employed in those days to defame persons, namely by getting a member of Parliament to make a defamatory speech which they later published. No privilege attaches to that, but no limit is imposed upon the licence contained in the clause in its present form. An individual who is attacked has no means of protecting himself. Therefore, I viewed with grave misgivings the clause in its original form. I repeat that the purpose of the bill is to confer privilege upon the Australian and its employees. confer privilege upon members of Parliament, because that"" is already provided. T,he proposal of the honourable member for ""Warringah is a strange mixture of ideas. First, he endeavours to introduce into the bill, which does not purport to deal with the privileges of members of Parliament, a matter entirely foreign to the intentions of the measure. He seeks to. overcome the danger which might result from broadcasting and re-broadcasting. he introduces the matter of the individual privilege of members of Parliament. With me, this is not a personal matter, but if any honourable member has studied closely the subject of. parliamentary privilege, he will agree that this proposal makes one of the worse possible attacks on it. The Parliament itself decides a question of privilege if the occasion arises. Members of Parliament are privileged; but if , in the opinion-of the House, an individual member is guilty of Mr Rosevear. a breach of those privileges, it may sit in judgment to determine, whether he has committed a breach of privilege, and, if so, the penalty for it. No one has ever recognized the authority of even the highest tribunal in the land outside of the Parliament to deal with the offending member. That right has always been jealously preserved by the Parliament. This Parliament has gone even further than that. On one occasion, it dealt with a member of the House for statements that he made outside the Parliament. breach of privilege, it expelled him, and he never returned. The second proposal of the honourable -member for Warringah is inconsistent with the purposes of the clause, which confers privilege on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees engaged in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The honourable member proposes to. abandon the privilege which the Parliament has always jealously guarded, namely, the right to deal with its own members for breaches of privilege. A perusal of the amendment will reveal that the intention is to make an honourable member liable to the jurisdiction of some authority outBroadcasting Commission side the Parliament. The honourable It does not member for Warringah would deprive honourable members of the privilege that they enjoy to-day, and allow some judicial authority to decide whether a breach of privilege had been committed. If that view were to prevail, the freedom of speech which honourable members now enjoy would be restricted by the fear that their statements in this chamber, which they thought were based upon excellentauthority and yet were untrue, would make them subject to the authority of a Secondly, tribunal outside the Parliament. Their immunity from proceedings for statements made in this chamber would be removed. Briefly, the proposal of the honourable member for Warringah,' if adopted, will deprive the Parliament of the right to determine privilege and exact a penalty for any breach. The honourable member is prepared to withdraw the amendment if a special committeea ""triumvirateconsisting of Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister and. the Leader of the Opposition, is constituted to determine what the House should determine, namely, whether an honourable member has committed a breach of privilege, and the penalty for it. In view of all the circumstances, I believe that that part of the amendment should not he tolerated for a moment. It represents the worse attack that I have ever known on the accepted principles of parliamentary privilege and the.manner of dealing with it. from the Chairi n . dealing with this matter. Earlier, I indicated that I could not support .sub-clause 2 of the amendment for reasons similar to those which have been stated, hut I am in accord with the principle of sub-clause 1. In fact,. I prepared an amendment, suggesting that the words "" any person "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" the Australian Broadcasting Commission or any employee thereof acting within the scope of his authority "". If the amendment is rejected, shall I then be in order in moving the amendment I have just indicated? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Barnard) -If the amendment now before the Chair is negatived the right honourable gentleman will then be in order in moving his proposed amendment. for Immigration and Minister for In formation) [1.21 a.m.] -Becaus e of the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), I did not expect that tlie second portion of the amendment would be discussed. The honorder) would take us back to the days before the last of the Stuarts left the throne of England. As I said earlier, our rights and privileges as determined by the Constitution, are those laid down for the House of Commons unless and until such time as the Parliament otherwise determines. The Parliament has never otherwise determined, and so we enjoy the rights and privileges of members of the British House of Commons. The privilege of freedom .of speech is declared in the 9th Article of the Bill of Rights ""in 16SS to be That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or . place out of Parliament. No other Parliament has ever adopted the principle which the honourable membe has proposed. their purpose members of tbe Government do not hesitate to take refuge in a etatute passed in the reign of William and Mary. comparatively modern period of time, having regard to the political ideology of the honourable gentleman from Warringah. A t the commencement of every British Parliament since the reign of Henry VIII . , it has been the custom for the Speaker to lay claim to the ancient and undoubted rights of the members of the House of Commons, particularly that their persons, estates and servants, may be free from arrests and all molestations, that they may enjoy liberty of speech in all their debates'; may have access to His Majesty's royal person whenever occasion' shall require; and that all their proceedings may receive from His Majesty the most favorable construction. I do not believe thai, forty-six years after the establishment of federation, this Parliament will agree to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah, nor do I believe that such a proposition should be considered during the debate on a bill which establishes the right of Parliament to broadcast its proceedings and which vests in the Postmaster General the authority to broadcast such proceedings. The Postmaster-General is not the proper authority to deal with the question of privilege. As a matter of fact the whole amendment might very well be ruled out of order.

429,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofbroadcast the proceedings of the Parliament; certainly no right is conferred upon any other body to do so. That is why it is rather curious to find that, having provided in clause 4 that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be the broadcaster of our debates, clause 14 then provides that no action shall lie against "" any person "" for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings. I believe that the giving of a privilege to a partial broadcast is wrong. I shall not labour that, as I have already stated my view; but if privilege is to attach it should attach only to the commission and its servants. It should not be given to people who are outside the commission. I see no reason why there should be re-broadcasts of portions of the debates in this House by commercial concerns. I do not understand that. If this bill is designed as a means of acquainting people with what is being transacted in the Parliament, then the national broadcasting systemshould broadcast the debates to the people, and consequently my amendment is designed to confine the privilege to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the people who are carrying out the work for it. That, I believe, puts some limitation on the privilege conferred. seems eminently reasonable and from my point of view it is the next best thing to having no privilege at all. I do not know whether it is contemplated seriously that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to make the broadcasts of Parliament available to commercial stations so that they may re-broadcast little bits of the debates as it suits them. I was under the impression that the idea was that wn provide direct broadcasts of the debates in the Parliament. know why the word "" broadcasting"" does not cover the making of records and their replaying. The words "" broadcast "" and ""re-broadcast"" are not technical terms. We are using them in the loose sense; but there is little doubt that the whole broadcast itself might be made from records. If that were done it would still be a broadcast The real point is that it should be done only by a body which has direct _ responsibility, as has' tlie Australian Broadcasting Commission. Consequently, failing in my desire to see clause 14 omitted altogether, I propose Mr Menzies. the amendment in order to confine theprivilege to the commission and to itsemployees. for Immigration and Minister for Information) [1.29 a.m.] -There has been a long-standing argument between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission as to wherethe responsibility of one begins and that of the other ends. If it could, the commission would acquire the control of all of the technical side of broadcasting; but up to datethe Postmaster General's Department has been able to establish with every government its claim that its authority extends right up to the microphone and that the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Commission begins only at the microphone. When the matter is one of re-broadcasting and the provision of land-lines, the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department become involved both directly and indirectly in the actual work of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. It is true that only the Australian Broadcasting Commission is named in the bill as the authority that will broadcast It the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. That was necessary because the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an independent authority which could refuse a ministerial direction to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Australian Broadcasting Commission offered to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. But the Government considered that the Parliament should not be dependent upon the favour of'an instrumenIn fact I do no! tality of its own creation, and decided instead to introduce a bill which would enable a direction to be given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to do certain things, and to apply compulsion should that body refuse to do what the Government and the Parliament wanted to have done. The officers of the Postmaster-General's Department are in a entirely different category. They are employees of the Crown, and, as such, can be directed to do certain things; consequeutly, there was no necessity to make any provision in relation to them or the department except in the matter of",82,Cameron But Government Majority On The Committee
430,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rprivilege and immunity from punishment. The words "" any person"" were used to cover -all the persons who could be legitimately employed in broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. The proposal of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) so to narrow privilege as to embrace only the officers and agents of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is, in substance, what is now proposed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). The Government considers that everybody associated with the broadcasts should be given the same immunity and the same protection-no t merely those who name the speakers and do other things incidental to malting the broadcasts possible, but also all other people who collaborate throughout the length and breadth of Australia in taking broadcasts or rebroadcasts into the homes of the nation. What the bill proposes is in accord with the provisions of the act of this Parliament, which grants immunity to those who record, print and publish the debates of the Parliament, as well as those who print and publish every other document that is issued under the authority of the Parliament. whole of the debate, or the whole document. honourable gentleman says is correct. But there is"" no inconsistency between that provision and the provision that any person associated with broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament, whether they be partial .or complete, should be granted immunity in respect of what he does under the direction of the Government. I hope it is not considered likely that there will ever be an abuse of authority by any of the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission or of the Postmaster-General's Department. There may be technical faults. Climatic or other conditions may cause a breakdown of the broadcasting service, and that is a contingency against which we cannot guard against. Honourable members need have no fear of any abuse under this clause. It will be for the committee which the bill proposes shall be sat up to determine how many or how few broadcasts shall take place. I do not think that any honourable member desires that the clause shall be abused, and I am sure that the committee that is to be set up Avill not allow it to be abused. a.m.] -The Minister( Mr Calwell) has made it plain that to extend privilege in connection with broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament merely to the Australian Broadcasting Commission would not be sufficient, because the Postmaster-General's Department also will be associated with the broadcasts. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman ha.*' given very careful consideration to the possible effect of the clause as it stands. Provision for the protection of those who will he engaged in the broadcasts authorized* by the Parliament is essential. So long as the Minister is satisfied that the clause as drafted does not go much farther than that, and confer on commercial broadcasting stations who make an unauthorized re-broadcast of portions of a debate, a licence to broadcast selected defamatory sentences, with complete privilege and immunity from punishment, then it will be all right. relates to the amended, of itself, would not do that; but it would if taken in conjunction with proposed new clause 13A. proposed new clause 13A, because it aims to give to the committee the power to determine the conditions under which -a re-broadcast may be made. So long as the Minister is satisfied that there will be power to punish a commercial station that is known to have re-broadcast one or two defamatory sentences, or defamatory portions of a speech, after the Parliament has been prorogued and while an election campaign is in progress, the bill is satisfactory. gentleman that under the Australian Broadcasting Act the Postmaster-General would have the power to revoke the licence of such a broadcasting station.

The comprehensive pools were established in concentrated areas with prolific production potentials. The objective was the maximum production of foodstuffs for the fighting services to fill urgent demands which otherwise could not have been met. Much of the machinery was entirely new to Australian farmers and Australian conditions and a considerable amount of demonstration work was essential. Moreover, in order to induce farmers to use the machinery it became necessary to fix hiring charges at levels which would otherwise have been higher. Further, the acute shortage of mechanical labour and repair facilities made it necessary to employ operators and mechanics for the whole year instead of on a seasonal basis. 3. Yes. In 1945, the hiring charges for the comprehensive pools in New South Waleswere increased by approximately 33& per cent. The results of this increase have not been apparent because of the Government's decision, following upon the easing of the heavy Service demands for vegetables and potatoes, toterminate its direct interest in these pools. The machinery in some of the pools has already been disposed of and action is being taken in respect of the remainder. Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e , u p o n notice1.

In ' all cases evidence must be provided that a group of farmers require this service. 3 and 4. The hire-purchase machinery pooling system has been in operation since early 1944,"" and has developed strongly in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, and to a lesser degree in South Australia. The New South Wales and Queensland Governments, have instituted their own machinery pooling schemes and have not participated in the system established by the Commonwealth -Government. Following upon the Commonwealth. Government's approval of 26th March, 1940, tlie New South Wales and Queensland -Governments have, been given a further opportunity to join in the scheme, but have not -so far signified their intention to do so. The additional funds provided by the Commonwealtli Government in. March were for the purpose of ensuring continuity of tlie hire purchase machinery pooling scheme already -in operation ponding the development of a -long term plan tobo agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States. These funds have been expended by way of advances to contractors in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania to enable tlie purchase of approved machinery to be used on a pooling basis aud the Government will shortly be giving consideration to the -question of tlie further extension of the scheme. In March the Government also approved of -a three-year programme for the development -of new types of agricultural machinery and the fostering of farm mechanization.

If so, (a) where, (b) what was the total expenditure to the latest available date, and (e) what were the receipts for products supplied by such farms to the latest available date?' r i g h t honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The total gross expenditure to 24th June, 1940, on Commonwealth vegetable farms in north Queensland was £157,731. This amount includes capital expenditure on establishment of the projects, including farm buildings and accommodation for workers (including prisoner-of-war labour), also machinery and farm equipment, irrigation facilities, etc., in addition to operating expenses, wages, materials, fuel, etc., much of this expenditure was necessary in order to 'bring qxiickly into large scale production of vegetables some extensive areas which were not previously equipped for such production. 2. Receipts for products .supplied from these farms to'the termination of activities at the end of October, 1-945, totalled £23,882. The figures have not been dissected to the extent desired by the honourable member but it can. be stated that the bulk of the produce from these farms was supplied to the services in north Queensland either directly or through the Committee of Direction of F r u it Marketing, which organization acted as the agent of tlie Comniouwealth for the purpose. 3. No. 4. 31st October, 1945. 5. and 0. These farms were established in 1943 at a time of special-emergency in north Queensland in order to produce locally a proportion of the fresh vegetables required by Australian and Allied forces based on north Queensland. A t the time shipping and land transport facilities were overtaxed and the establishment of the Commonwealth projects agricultural mechanization in other was undertaken at the direct request of the fighting services concerned. There were no Commonwealth vegetable farms of a similar nature elsewhere in Australia, although it is understood that the Army grew vegetables at a number of points in north Queensland and and the islands. Further, by agreement with the New South Wales Government, the Department of the Army and my department cooperated with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in the large-scale production with prisoner-of-war labour of vegetables",90,Agricultura Lmachinery Pools

The answer to the honourable member's question is. as f o l l o w s : For the most part, trade union delegates travelling abroad have been sent as representatives to International Labour Organiztion conferences or committees. The general practice which has been followed for workers' representatives in such cases is to compensate them on the basis of wages actually lost during the period of absence from Australia on the business of the conference or committee, or £10 per week, whichever is the less. Under the constitution of the International Labour Organization, each member government is responsible for the travelling and subsistence expenses of its country's delegates. However, for delegates to industrial 'committees, as distinct from conferences, the International Labour Organization bears the cost of travelling and subsistence expenses for both employers' and employees' representatives. The member government bears only the expenses of the government representatives. In addition, all governments have from time to time made some contributions towards the expenses of trade union and other representativestravelling abroad to attend important international conferences. As regards Mr Thornton, this Government paid his fare when he attended the first World Trade Union Conference in London as one of two Australasian Council of Trade Unions delegates. All other expenses were met by 'the delegates.

The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following answer:Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited was formed as a wartime storage aud distribution measure at tlie request of the Commonwealth with a view to the most effective use being made of bulk storages and as a means of conserving man-power and transport. The agreement then entered into provided that the "" pool "" should continue until six months after the cessation of active hostilities, which meant that the arrangement should have ended normally as at 31st March, 194G.
