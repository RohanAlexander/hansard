29,Mr Knox,"The Treasurer indicatedtake it that the only matter before us now is whether we are in favour of duties being imposed under item 229, after the iron industry has been sufficiently established in Australia. I wish to say, at the outset, that m dealing with the subject as I shall do, I do not desire to reflect upon any Minister. honourable member for Kooyong that the manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty. who were only turning out iron I do not think that manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty, and cannot understand the honourable member suggesting that they would. might. only one manufacturer of iron, he would prefer a duty to a bounty; but every user of iron would be of a different opinion. For that reason I think that the granting of a bounty is a much better method of encouraging the industry than is the imposition of a duty. I am not averse' to a duty being imposed if the industry is established. The creation of the industry would more than compensate for any drawback that might arise from the collection of such duties as these.

I am prepared to support these proposals, but do not think there should be any lengthy debate upon them.

Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat paragraph r be left out. Item, as amended, agreed to. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [2.53] -We have now to deal with the heading to this division, which readsTo come into operation on dates to be fixed by proclamation, and exempt from duty in the meantime. Proclamation *to issue as soon as it is certified to Parliament by the Minister that the manufacture to which the proclamation refers I do not agree with the has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. As I explained a few minutes ago, this proWith the exception of those vision is different from that which has been associated with a similar schedule in two other measures. On three prior occasions we have had under consideration a schedule of this kind, and in the last instance we varied the heading, using words similar to, if not exactly the same, as those now under consideration. In the Tariff of 1902, it was provided that the duties should come into operation by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament. I have been advised all round, however, that the uncertainty attaching to such a provision would militate against the establishment of the industry. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not agree with the honourable member; I think that it is. member wishes to carry on legislation by I do not desire that Government. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I hope the honourable member will not grumble. UnderI should oppose their the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, up to the ist January, 1913, a certain sum of money will annually be expended by way of bounties on the production of pig iron. If at that time, or before the expiration of that time, it appeared to the Ministry that the production of pig iron in Australia.was I was ready to do somesufficient to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth then, under this pronosal, a proclamation could be issued providing that the duty of 12$ per cent, should, come into operation. As soon as the duty comes into operation, the bounty will cease. I wish at once to disabuse the minds of honourable members as to there being any desire on the part of the Government that the duty and the bounty shall be concurrent. Mr W. H .

Sir WILLIAM LYNE to trust the Parliament; but I would remind honourable members that occasionally it takes a long time to secure the passing of such a resolution. Personally, this provision is nothing to rae, gests that it is. Sir WILLIAM LYNE feel in regard ""to this matter; and I recognise that there is a difference of opinion on the subject. If it be decided that these duties shall not come into operation except upon a resolution of both Houses of Parliament, I shall have to submit to that decision; but I think that such a condition would hamper the investment of money in the industry, and that it would be better to adopt the Government proposal. We use the words ""sufficiently established."" The question of how best to express our intentions in this regard has always been a troublesome .one; even when the right honourable member for Adelaide was Minister of Trade and Customs great difficulty was experienced in determining what would be the most suitable words to use as a direction to the Minister. On one occasion it was proposed that the duties should come into operation when it was shown that sufficient pig iron was produced to supply Australian requirements. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Such a provision would not do, because whilst we might be producing a small quantity of pig iron, we might have no machinery in the Commonwealth for carrying on. the rolling and other necessary processes. Sir WILLIAM LYNE bounty the production of pig iron will quickly be followed by the erection of the machinery necessary for rolling it out and turning it into an improved marketable commodity. We provide for a duty of 12 J per cent, on pig iron, ingots, blooms, slabs, and so forth. There would be 12^ per cent, duty on pig iron and 12J per cent, on puddled bars. If any manufacturer produced pig iron in sufficient quantities he would secure that amount. carried out the process of converting that pig iron into puddled bars he would get another 12 \ per cent, on that form of the iron. doubt he could do it, and he would do it. well on the production of pig iron that he I am prepared would go no further. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No t at all. He would know that he would get the extra 12J per cent, on the iron converted into puddled bars. If we could induce any person to produce a sufficient quantity of pig iron to meet Australian demands, there would be no difficulty in inducing them to take up I speak as 1 the processes of converting the pig iron into the other forms of iron upon which they would afterwards be able to obtain the advantage of the duties set out in item 229. gentleman is not too sanguine. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not know whether I can be regarded as a sanguine man, but I believe in Australia and in developing Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And I believe in developing first of all the production of pig iron in Australia. themanufacturers of pig iron will necessarily go on from that to the other processes. Sir WILLIAM LYNE Of course they will, if they are assured that they will not be swamped by the American Steel Trust with steel and iron imported from Pittsburg. Unless we can give them that assurance they certainly will not proceed. the honourable gentleman is aware, show that there is no serious competition by the American Steel Trust. competition in every industry of iron and If we grant a steel manufactures. end. until we put a stop to it. the question whether the proclamation is to be issued on the authority of the Minister or of Parliament?

When I first looked at the proposal I wondered if it had been submitted for the purpose of protecting the revenue. I have not heard the Minister say anything about that phase of the question. 1 take it that if the Cabinet did arrive at the conclusion that any of these industries were sufficiently established to warrant the imposition of the duties, it would be their duty to bring down a schedule of the duties in the ordinary way, imposing them at the same time. That would be necessary for the protection of the revenue. I do not think we should loose our hold of the right to consider the matter de novo when that time arrives.

One of the worse features of our democratic form of government is to be found in the suggestions that are sometimes made against the probity of Ministers. That is a bad thing. I do not think that that accusation can be made at all. There is no reason why Ministers should have cast upon them sucli a These duties cannot be -responsibility as is proposed. A democratic Parliament should hesitate to hand over any of its powers to any Minister or Ministry. I trust the Committee will in no way bind itself by agreeing to a provision of this kind.

He wanted the duty because he desired to get a higher price.

He wanted a duty because the price of the imported article was lower than his price, and he regeneral commercial rule. I do not think presented that his product would be bought if the price of imported polish were doubled. That disposes of the contention of the Treasurer that on several occasions the effect of a duty is really to reduce the price of the local article. In this case the manufacturers of the local article distinctly state that their object in asking for the duty is to shut out the importations, so-that they can double their own prices. Mr Spooner said that he did a large trade with New Zealand and sold f.o.b. there at a lower price than he charged buyers in the Commonwealth. I have made those references to the evidence to show the purpose of those who are asking for the duty, and to point out that, on their own admissions, they are doing very well indeed. they quote a lower price for export.

Three years ago it was 4s. per dozen, and then it came down to 3s. gd., and 3s. 6d., and retailed at 6d. per tin. The lowest wholesale price to-day is 37s. 6d., or 38s. 6d., less 2^ percent, for parcels, and the retail price at the present time in the boot shops is 3^d. and 3d., and in some of the up country towns the line is retailed at 2d. per tin. The retailers in Great Britain are compelled to sell at 4-Jd. per tin. Here, to enable the market to be swamped, they sell at as low as 2d. per tin. When the importers attain theirobject, they will no doubt do what they did before we had the local competition. They used to sell at c-d. and is. per bottle, but when.the local men began to compete the price was reduced to 6d. The importers are naturally anxious to capture the market. If they succeed, the price will undoubtedly go up. I have here dozens of letters obtained from retailers in Melbourne .to show the price of the article in former years and at present.

245,Mr Salmon,"The honourable membersoon find that there would' be sufficient competition in the business in Western Australia to prevent dumping from within or without the Commonwealth. [4.40] -The honourable member for Laanecoorie, in common with all other Victorian protectionists, claims that if duties are put up high enough internal competition will do the rest. The reply is easy and not far to seek. case of many other goods which have been made here for many years; as witness the revelations in the harvester industry. The manufacturers were getting high prices for their goods, there was plenty of internal competition, and yet they 'were paying their employees as low as 5s. 6d. a day. Sir, lower prices for their goods. was not raised by any honourable member who spoke on this item previous to me. orable member assume that I was arguing with respect to the wages paid? the honourable member takes into consideration all the conditions surrounding an industry when he refers to the effect of competition. I say that dumping has not the effect attributed to it from time to time by honourable members in discussing these duties. I wish to point out that in connection with the blacking industry a brutal frankness was exhibited by those who appeared before-the Tariff Commission. One witness wanted 50 per cent, if he could get it, and had the candouT to sayWe would ask for a nigher duty if we thought Commission had the power, and, in my we would get it. I should think he would. if he thought he had to deal with a Miniswith to give evidence. ter like the Treasurer, who would be prepared to give almost any duty which would prevent the importation of anything that could be made here? if he knew he would receive? could be more simple than to have an ingiven by those who were interested in terested manufacturer'give the Tariff Commission, and then to take his word without testing it in any way. the Commission ten years to get thrown The witness to whom I refer was asked their work if they had done that ? .what his object was in asking for a higher duty, and on this point I quote the followyears. ing evidence given in answer to . question 62070-'Do. you think there ought to be a good opening in Australia .for the. local manufacture of have been done if the evidence submitted these polishes? honourable member quoting? of Mr Alfred Belcher, manufacturer, of (Parramatta) Prospect. His answer to the question I have quoted wasYes, I am sure of it. If we only get a little higher prices on some of these things or get the others out of the market there would be a. splendid trade. It has not done the rest in the There is a cool suggestion-knoc k everybody out of the market, and put the prices up here ! Then the witness admitted that he would be doing a splendid trade. He was further examined as follows Have you anything else to tell us about blackings and polishes ?-No; all we want is the duty increased, and that would increase then we will have a show. We can do them at the same price. We are prepared to put our goods into the market at the same price, but people prefer the imported. I know that. I pass by the evident contradiction. The witness first said that he wanted a higher duty, and then he only wanted the imported article shut out. I direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that !£ .I, S S t h e c , as s of evidence given to the l a r i ft Commission throughout their inquiry..

Sir JOHN Chambers of Commerce come forward to represent the consumers? looked after their own business, as the manufacturers did -So far as I know, they do not specially represent the consumers. The honourable member is aware that they consist largely of business men. were called upon to pay increased duties they could pass them on to the public. need not expect the manufacturers or importers to bother very much about the consumer. The importer knows that he can pass the duty on, and the manufacturer knows that he can take advantage of it for himself. I say therefore that, in my judgment, an obligation rested upon the Tariff Commission to secure evidence to show how the consumers would be affected as a result of the duties to be imposed. impugning the honesty of manufacturers who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. I say no more and no less than that human nature operates in them in the same way as in other people. The 'evidence submitted by' the Tariff Commission is. in the circumstances, largely valueless, as being the evidence of interested persons. to the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi, with respect to the polish to which he referred, I wish to inform the honourable member that the tin he produced was filled by a man who was asking for a higher duty. The honourable member is the representative of the foreign trader, and, speaking as such, he produced a tin of polish filled by an. Australian workman. The honourable member for Parramatta has just made a speech in which he has once more shifted his ground. Honourable members of the Opposition have repeatedly referred the Committee to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and times out of number have quoted from it. They have asked on more than one occasion that we should quote it, but now, because a manufacturer who went before, the Com.mision asked for an increased duty, the honourable member for Parramatta says that the evidence collected by the Commission is worthless. It is sufficient for me to know that this industry, which some time ago employed fifty or sixty men, is only employing fourteen to-day. The honourable member for Indi knows that these goods are being less than that for which they can be bought wholesale in the Old Country. Only a I presume they short time ago 10,000 gross of "" Nugget"" were dumped into Sydney at 25s. a gross. The article is being sold to-day in the Commonwealth at a lower price than the local article, with the object of securing a monopoly of the trade by crushing the local manufacture out of existence. That is what the foreign trader always does when he gets the opportunity. I trust that honourable members who believe in supporting the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission will do so on this occasion, and give this industry a fresh start. ber want fixed duties or not? cause with them we know exactly where we stand and what we are doing. SomeI am not times correct invoices are not supplied. The only way to get over that difficulty in all cases of this kind is to have fixed duties. Then those importing the articles know exactly what they have to pay, and we know where we are. the honourable, member come to support so many ad valorem duties ? fixed rates. Sydney) [4.52] -The remarks made about foreign traders and advocates for importers should cease, if it is desired to get business through. The importer is not a bit different from the manufacturer. They are practically the same individual, and a matter of chance has directed them into one occupation or the other. Each will do the best for himself, and will take all he can get. There is, therefore, no sense in constantly making statements such as I have referred to. The business of a Parliament is to see that neither of them is put in a position to take advantage of the public. The whole debate has centred round one article the polish called ""Nugget."" But polishes for other purposes than dressing boots, such as polishes for harness, metals, and so on, are included in the item. If the argument with regard to "" Nugget"" applies in the case of boot polish, it has no reference",33,William Lyne Bu T They Charged Slightly The Price Of These Imported Lines And

282,Mr Crouch,"That is true, but itThe former duty was 20 per cent., and the new duty is 35 per cent, preferential, and 40 per cent, general. We import a liquid harness dressing in casks of 45 lo 50 gallons, which .we tin off here into pints and quarts, but principally pints. The tins for this, the printed labels to put on the tins, the wood boxes to ""hold one dozen tins, are all made in Melbourne, and, of course, our own employees do the WOTK of filling, labelling, and boxing (no girls or women employed). If the duty on dressing imported in bulk were made, say, 10 per cent, less than for that imported in tins, it would give us a chance of competing with the tinned dressing-otherwisee we w i ll have to arrange to have our dressing tinned, labelled, and boxed in England, as the charges for these items will be very much less than if done here, while labour is proportionately cheaper there than here. Yours truly, There are other firms interested. I do not ask that the article should be made free for them. I suggest that a protection of 30 per cent, should be given for those who manufacture the bulk liquid, but the honourable member for Bendigo will see that the industry has some right to a preferential treatment of, say, 5 or 10 per cent., seeing that, if that is not given, several men will be put out of employment in the case of that firm alone, and a lot of work which is now done in Australia will be sent away. more than the tinning done here; we want the blacking made here. is the more important? I do not say that this will altogether stop the dressing from (being imported, but it will limit it to a .special line of harness dressing, which is -of great importance to the farming community, and I understand that harihess dressing cannot now be made in Australia of the quality required. Whatever duty is agreed to for this item, that the duty shall be 10 per cent, less on harness dressing imported in casks containing not less than 40 gallons. that we polished this item off. I. intend to support the proposal of the Government. As to' all these other individuals who want special concessions, we ought to dispense with that sort of pleading for special cases. I am altogether opposed to fixed duties, because they mean a penalty which is altogether, prohibitive against the cheap article. If this business cannot succeed with a protection of 40 and 35 per cent -, it ought to go under altogether. move That after the words "" 40 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 3rd December, 1907, a j val. (G.eneral Tariff), 25 per cent.,"" be inserted. I intend afterwards to move for a United Kingdom duty of 20 per cent. I make no secret of the fact that the figures which I now propose do not represent my idea of what the Tariff should be. If I thought I had .the remotest chance of carrying it, I should move for a very much greater reduction, but I have to bear in mind that our time is limited, and that if we are to get through the Tariff we must not indulge in too many useless divisions, even for the sake of showing our weakness. If I were Co. to propose anything less than the rate in the old Tariff, several honourable members sitting on this side would not agree to it, because they are pledged not to go below the old rate. I am therefore constrained to move this amendment, which will bring the United -Kingdom rate down to the rate in the old Tariff. understand that the Minister will not give any preference forharness dressing which is imported in bulk? I am told that harness dressing is not made, and cannot be made, in Australia. emphasize the speech made by the honourable member for Lang. The honourable member has moved that the duties be 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., not because he approves of such duties, but because he cannot get enough free-traders to support him in his desire to impose the old Tariff.

He is very much behind the economic movement of which he is supposed to be a leader. time. The inevitable result of these duties must be to encourage the importation of the articles. honourable member. the duties honourable members create a vested interest in the importation of the goods. dity of imposing high duties to secure the mere bottling of the oils, they are encouraging their importation. With our climate and with handicrafts such as we shall develop very shortly we ought to make Australia quite self-supporting in regard to all these natural products. advantages which our isolation gives us, we cannot beat the world in the production of these articles, we shall be in a very bad way indeed. I hope that we shall not go on imposing duties which do not protect a manufacture as such, but protect only a minor process in connection with some manufacture. The more we can tie the producing and the bottling of the things together the more efficiently we must necessarily make the production of them, and the better it will be for the consumer and all concerned. The honourable member for Parramatta-wh o by the way is more an "" ex "" as a Labour leader than I am-ha s accused me of desiring to make work as such. I have no such desire, but I think that a great deal of argument can be urged in favour of transferring work which we. can accomplish from other paTts of the world. I trust that the Mr W. H .

It is much better to do our own work than to pay other persons to do it for us. matters we must pay some regard to the efficiency of production ? duty was not quite high enough, but we need not go so far as the Tariff Commission, has recommended. We want to be careful not to admit oils in bottles at a lower rate than that we propose to place on the oils and the bottles when brought in separately. That is one point which I think honourable members should keep in mind. The bottling of oils in Australia should be I thought that we were past that encouraged because it is a light, clean occupation for girls. There is no reason why nearly the whole of the olive, castor and linseed oils should not be bottled here instead of being bottled for us abroad. I think that the honourable member for North Sydney was mistaken in what he said as to the proportion of the imports. According to his statement, the duty paid on Apart altogether from the absuroils imported in small packages totalled only ^4,000, and that included castor oil, which is imported very largely in small bottles. bottled here. If , with, all the and Morton, particularly the latter, still export to Australia a great quantity of castor oil. It is extra refined, and is claimed to be tasteless.

When oil is sent out in casks there is considerable waste and leakage, and the more the article is handled the greater is the cost to the consumer. It can be bottled abroad and delivered at considerably less cost to the consumer than it can be when it is sent out in bulk and put through different processes here. I remember the time in Victoria when, in order to give work, they used to employ men to dig holes in Melbourne and then fill them. That was thought to be a grand way of providing employment. The pouring of oil out of casks into bottles is very much on a par with the employment of men to dig holes only to fill them. Let us establish in this country all the industries we can. Do not let us put on duties which will increase the cost of an article without doing any good to the worker. We have agreed to give a bounty upon the production of certain oils. We have, to some extent, tried to induce persons to grow cotton and olives and other materials for the production of oil. When a duty is imposed on oil for protective purposes, it is all right. But we ought not to impose duties simply in connection with the covering of an article. It is a poor sort of protection to charge a duty on the straw or packages in which articles are imported. Let us be f a ir and-square; let us put a duty on the article itself and keep it there, but do not let us say that any goods shall not be packed in any country but Australia. From a protectionist standpoint, that is not an evidence of strength, but rather a petty-minded sort of taxation of the people. opinion, the duty proposed by the Treasurer is rather high. In my notes, I set -down is. per dozen-that is double the -old rate-as a fair duty. The honourable member for Balaclava has stated that the bottling cf oils is' not an industry. He should remember that bottle-making in Victoria is a very considerable industry, and one which may be increased to a very large extent. RecentlyI visited a local factory, where I saw bottles being made. I thought it was a very good thing to see so much bottle-making carried on in the community. If the bottling of oil is encouraged, it will lead, not only to bottlemaking, but also to case-making and packing. If is all these little things which go to make up a great industry. It is of no use to speak of one large industry. Only by having a multitude of industries can we do good to Australia; and if we can, by means of this Tariff, cause oil to be bottled here, we shall be doing good for at least one Australian industry and providing means of employment for a large number of peoplewish to ask the Treasurer whether he is going to be consistent in regard to.olive oil? When we were dealing with the duties affecting iron and steel, the Treasurer stated that where a bounty was granted, the duty would not operate at the same time. I remind the Treasurer that in the Bounties Bill we have provided for a bounty on olive oil. To be consistent with his former .statement, he should provide that the duty on olive oil shall not operate at the same time. The increase of duty proposed is based upon the analogy of the differentiation between bulk and bottled beer. On bulk beer, the duty is is. per gallon, and ort beer in bottles, is. 6d. per gallon. The analogy holds good in regard to oil. Sydney) [6.8] -May I point out to the honourable member for Bendigo that the difference in duty between bulk beer and bottled beer is 50 per cent. In this case, the difference is much more than that. The duty now proposed is an increase of 300 per cent, on the old duty. It cannot be said that an increase from 6d. per gallon on cotton-seed oil and 3^d. on a lubricating oil, to 3s. per half-pint is an increase of only 50 per cent. It has been suggested to me that there ought to be a preference in favour of Great Britain in this case, and, therefore, I am willing to alter my amendment to make the duty 9d. on thg general Tariff, and 6d. against the United Kingdom. May I ask, also, how far the Committee propose to go with this sort of industry? It would not involve going much further to say that we will not import refined oil, or that we will impose such a duty upon refined oil as to compel it to be refined here. Mr W. H .

Amendment amended accordingly. [6.10] -The bottle-making industry is concerned to some extent in the item under discussion. It is useless to impose a higher duty on the imported bottles if we allow bottles to come in free when full of liquid. I do not know whether honourable members are considering what it would mean to the trade of Australia if all the bottles in which commodities are sold were made here. In three States-Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia-abou t i;8oo hands are employed in the bottle industry, and some hundreds of thousands of pounds are invested in it. The most serious competitor that the industry has to face is the bottle that is imported free with a duty on the contents. Bottle making requires the service of high class mechanics. If all the bottles used in Australia were manufactured here, there would be work for thousands more artisans. . In the first place, work would be provided in bottling commodities if they were imported in bulk and bottled for the market in Australia. The printing of labels and the making of cases would also involve the employment of a large amount of labour. Honourable members know that many men have been thrown out of employment in the printing trade through the introduction of the linotype. We have here an opportunity of increasing employment in the printing trade, ancl so absorbing the services of many of these unemployed workmen. I see no reason why the making of oils should not become an important industry' in Australia. of the oils which honourable members opposite laughed at when we were dealing with, the Bounties Bill, such as peanut oil and sunflower seed oil, are of great commercial value, and might just as well be manufactured in this country. I realize that the temper of the 'Committee has led to the reduction of duties, but I trust that in this instance a truly protective duty will be imposed for the benefit of those who are manufacturing oils in Australia. ment of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat was that so many commodities are brought out in bottles that there is so much less work for those engagedin the bottle-making industry in this country. Why, then, does not the honourable member propose that articles which are sold in bottles shall be imported only in bulk? If his concern is simply for the use of Australian-made 'bottles, I make this suggestion to him-that if the bottle trade is beings injured, as he makes out, the wav to get over the difficulty is to insert in the Tariff a proviso that imported oils must come out in bulk. Why should I vote for a high duty which would not do what the honourable member wants? I think that the honourable member for North Sydney made out a good case, and I do not see any necessity for a high rate of duty on oil. We can consider what is necessary for the bottle industry when we deal with the item affecting bottles. I admit with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the trade is a very large one, and I also remember that there is a bottle factory in my own electorate. In fact, there is hardly, anything worth having in Australia that is not made in my electorate. Its-representative"" is, in himself, a very good sample of what can be produced there. However, the ""bottleho"" argument has really nothing to do with the case, and I must support the honourable member for North Sydney's amendment. to raise a protest against this new duty upon goods which we do not, and, I think, cannot, make here. There is a duty on bottles which will have to be considered hereafter, and I am prepared to protect the bottle-making industry as far as is reasonable. But we make no castor oil in Australia, nor do we make many of the other oils which are affected by this duty. I will support a duty of 2s. per gallon on olive oil. I take it that we can so devise Some the Tariff as to make duties apply to bottles and not to their contents. I shall not vote for a duty on goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia, unless it can be made plain to me that there is not another way of getting a duty on bottles. But I fail to see that there is no other wav. I should think that the Trade and Customs Department ought to be able to conceive",43,Pairs

He says that he is prepared to vote for a duty on olive oil. oil produced; it is difficult to get pure olive oil anywhere. we should penalize those who sell other oil as olive oil. We have in Australia large areas capable of producing sufficient olive oii to meet the world's demand. In some parts of New South Wales, including my old electorate, olives are grown to perfection. The honourable member for Macquarie has, I think, overlooked the fact that if we abolish the duty on bottled olive oil it would be unfair to impose a duty on olive oil in bulk, because those who at present import oil in bulk and bottle it in Australia would thus be placed at a disadvan' tage. posed to abolish the duty on olive oil in bottles. for Macquarie indicated that he was in f a vour of its abolition.

The honourable member for South Sydney seems to be particularly anxious about the bottlemaking industry. with the item of bottles. the bottle industry, why. these hysterics about the bottles used in the olive oil trade ?

The duty should be levied on bottles as bottles, without respect to what they contain. am as anxious to cultivate the industry of bottle-making as is the honourable member for South Sydney, and as anxious to impose a duty on oils that can be produced here, but I am opposed to a revenue duty on mere oils. If we were given an opportunity to deal with bulk importations first, we should know where we were. I do not object to the imposition of a substantial duty on the importation in, bulk of oils that we can make in Australia, or to a reasonable duty on bottles as bottles, which, 'of course, would affect everything imported in bottles.

Kerosene is very largely used in nearly every household in the country, and oil of the best quality must be obtained. It may be very well to suggest that one oil is as good as another, but in my own household they will not use any but the best oil, because inferior oil gives off a smoke which is objectionable from a health point of view, and blackens the ceilings. In my opinion, a duty of 3d. per gallon on oil imported in tins containing less than 10 gallons would not secure the object in view.

[8.46] -The party to which I belong has always voted against the imposition of duties on kerosene and tea, because those commodities are so largely used by the working classes. I am entirely opposed to increasing the taxation of those who can least afford to pay taxes. I feel convinced that the imposition of a duty .of 3d. per gallon on o i l imported in tins will not make that oil any dearer to the people of Australia. It will, as a matter of fact, lessen its price. Of course, some honourable members laugh at this statement, but they laugh,, too, when evidence is produced showing that the effect of duties upon goods which can be manufactured here has been, by increasing the local competition, to lower prices. We, in Australia, know of the wide ramifications of the great Standard Oil Trust, which has now such a hold upon the kerosene trade of the world that it can dictate to buyers and sellers alike the conditions under which this commodity must be traded in. Until within the last seven years the Trust had no competitor in Australia. I have little sympathy with the British Imperial Oil Trust, whether it is or is not run by the Rothschilds. Buti f the two trusts are sharks it is better to keep them employed in Australia fighting each other than to give the whole field to one of them. No doubt I may lose votes by supporting the duty on oil imported in tins; but that consideration weighs little with me when I know my cause to be just. We have been told that less employment will be given if oil be imported in bulk than is given now, when it is brought here in tins; but it is not necessary to disprove a statement of that kind. My common sense tells me that twice, if not three times, as much employment will be given in Australia if .the oil comes here in bulk, to be tinned and cased locally, than is given now, when it comes in tins. The representatives of Western Australia are opposed to this duty, but apparently they are not aware that the Standard Oil Company charges 50 per cent, more for kerosene in Western Australia than in Victoria. 'Buti f the proposed duty is imposed, and the British-Imperial Oil Company opens works at Fremantle, the price of the Standard Oil Company's oil will be reduced to meet the competition. .While the Standard oil is now being sold in Victoria at 8s. a case, it is sold in Western Australia for anything between 10s. and 12s. a case. proof of it . ber's other statements are no better than that, they are worth nothing. ber for Fremantle on one occasion made a speech f u l l of what he said were facts, though no one would accept them as such, and his statements, having been disproved, he wishes to disprove mine. . Honourable members are very ready to profess themselves eager to reduce the price of kerosene in the interests of the poor worker; but I ask free-traders, who say that competition is the soul of business, whether prices will not be lower with competition in the field than if , by the taking off of the duty, it is brought to an end? the last Tariff was before the House, every member of the Labour Party tried manfully to bring about what was termed a free breakfast table, and to secure the free importation of kerosene; but on this occasion none of them has raised his voice in the interests of the working man. They appear to have lost all concern in him. The imposition of a paltry duty of 3d. per gallon has been proposed to protect a local industry, it is said. But it will have no such effect. If the local industry is to be protected, the duty must be much higher. As a matter of factr kerosene should be admitted duty free. No class uses more kerosene than does the working class, and it will have to pay this duty, if it be imposed. posed, competition will be crushed out, and the workers will have to pay more for their oil. vernment is neglecting the interests of the working man, which they profess to study. I shall vote for free kerosene. As I have paired on this question, I wish to explain my position in regard to the proposal of the Government. I am in favour of the duty, because I wish to keep down the price of kerosene to the consumers. I have gone carefully into the whole matter, and am convinced, from inquiries I have made, and from my visits to the Williamstown worksI shall not weary honourable",51,William Lyne The Y Mesmerize Convenient To Have It Brought In Tins Be

This witness, who asked for. a duty of 40 per cent, was'askedWith what sort of colours would you undertake to provide the Commonwealth, suppose you had your 40 per cent. duty. Name the principal? .He repliedRaw sienna, burnt sienna, raw umber, burnt umber, purple brown (which is red oxide of iron); raw oxide, quaker green (three shades), bronze. green, hematite, Oxford ochre, yellow ochre and others. He produced some of his colours to the Commission, and we were satisfied that large and valuable deposits existed, not only in South Australia, but in other parts of the Commonwealth. We have drawn up a scheme providing for a duty on those colours, and placing on the free list colours not produced in Australia, such as Vandykes, manganese, Letharge blacks, Paris white and vermillions. If we desire to protect the raw materials of the industry, we must retain, at a high standard, the duty on the finished article. under the impression that Victoria, in preFederation days, was a pronounced protectionist State, and as such, one would' have expected to find that under its Tariff paints were heavily protected. I learn r however, that under that Tariff, they were dutiable at 40s. per ton., or 2s. per cwt. not tried to make it. has a ready excuse. Victoria did not awaken to the importance of the paint manufacturing industry when it was at the height of its protectionist boom. Prior to Federation, New South Wales was acon the free list; whilst Queensland had a duty of 3s. per cwt.; South Australia a duty of 2s. per cwt., and of 4s. per cwt. in the case of the made-up articles; Tasmania, a duty of Jd. per lb.; and Western Australia a duty of .10 per cent. Under the first Federal Tariff, the duty under this item was 2s. per cwt., and the Government now propose to raise it to 4s. 6d. on foreign imports, and to 4s. per cwt. or> imports from Great Britain. Having enjoyed for five years an increase of 200 per cent, on the old Victorian Tariff, paint manufacturers here, instead, of being able to show that their industry is a flourishing one, are asking for more protection, and the Treasurer offers them a still further increase of 250 per cent The honourable member for Bendigo says that these proposals have been very carefully considered, and I must certainly admit that the paint manufacturers have been. most carefully considered. But what about those who use paint? To my mind, the honourable member for Bendigo gave away his case when he said that the excessive dnties upon the raw materials of the paint-making industry, made it necessary to impose a high duty on the finished article. That being so, this cannot be called a scientific Tariff. yet dealt with the duty on white lead: . the basic elements of paint. The honourable member for Lang has touched the real point at issue. If we impose this heavy duty upon the finished article, we shall severely tax the coachpainter and others who use paints of this kind.

We put a duty on linseed oil, one of the raw materials of this industry, and we should now complete the scheme proposed by the Tariff Commission, and enable white lead to be successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth. As to other colours, a variety is produced at the Blumberg mine, South Australia, and in various parts of the Commonwealth. The secretary to the Blumberg mine, Mr O'Connell, gave pretty lengthy evidence before the Commission as to the necessity for a duty to enable the company to compete against wealthy British companies. The industry is well worth establishing, and will undoubtedly be established in every State in I cannot allow this attack on the Australian the Commonwealth.

A quantity of sulphate of lead, which is a cheap by-product, has been manufactured here-w e ourselves in years gone by have utilized about 300 tons of the same. It is an article altogether inferior in covering power to genuine white lead, and, if offered to the public in Great Britain as such, would be a breach of the law. the Australian product.

I do notsay that the Australian paint is inferior, but I know that it makes a great deal of difference to people who go to large expense in renovating buildings or putting up new structures if they use a paint that will stand the weather. An inferior paint is absolutely worse than useless. It has a bad' effect upon the property, it is a disappointment all round, and we should not by any legislative means seek to force its use upon the people of this country. I have now to report that .the sample of lead instructions, by the Australian White Lead Company, was analyzed and proved to contain and that quite forbid the presence of free sulphuric acid. Tests were made to discover the best white lead obtainable in Melbourne; it was tested for any foreign -material, such as baryta, and was found to be pure.

I quote that as a refutation of the slanders which have been circulated. [10.5] -Al l the manufacturers like to get their raw material free, but unfortunately in practically every instance the raw material of one industry is the finished article of another. The question of paints and their constituent parts is so complicated that it is hard to discover what is really the basic raw material. The worse of it is that each manufacturer concerned wants his raw material free, and each condemns the Australian-made raw maferial, saying, "" I have to compete with the rest of the world in the Australian market, and must get the best material to use. in producing my manufactured article. Therefore, I must import it."" The manufacturer of white lead in Australia assures us, and backs up his assurance with a certificate, quoted by the honourable member for Bendigo, from a gentleman duly qualified to express an opinion, that the article which he is producing is as good as, if not superior to, the imported -white lead. Unfortunately, the man who uses white lead in making paint, being interested, condemns the Australian white lead. He says, "" I want imported colouring material if I . am to give my customers the paints which they demand. I must also have imported white lead."" The manufacturer of colours in Australia shows us that he* is quite competent to produce the best' colours, having men here who are qualified through experience in other parts of the world. The honourable member for Lang stated that it was impossible to make these colours in Australia. He enumerated all the colours of the rainbow, from elephant's breath to boiled mutton, and told us that they could not be made here. But first-class pigments are produced in South Australia. I am not surprised at 1 the honorable member"" for Lang making that statement, because he is a free-trader a foreign representative. times against the application to me of the epithet of ""foreign representative."" It is offensive, and I ask-that it be withdrawn. I do not apply, offensive epithets of that character, to .honourable members opposite. I am just as much an Australian representative as is the honourable member-perhaps , member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw the remark which the. honourable member for Lang regards as offensive. fensive to the honourable member for Lang,. I withdraw it without qualification. I was not speaking.in a personal but merely in a political sense. In spite of what the honourable member for Lang says, there is ar* establishment in my electorate which is producingfirst-classcolours. I am sure to be asked whether there are any of these'works* in mv electorate.

That .firm have imported a man who has had twenty-five years' experience in England. They can produce any of the colours which the honourable member for Lang says are not made here. They turn out good commercial commodities, which are on the market at the present day. B.ut it is essential, in order that they may keen them upon the. market, that they should have some protection. There are certain portions of their ra w material which they have to import, and., seeing that there is a duty on that, it is necessary that they should get a duty on their manufactured article, which, in its turn, is the raw material of another industry, so that they may compete with imported articles. Then the house or coach painter,, who uses paints, wants his;'raw material as cheaply as possible. The coachbuilder isstrongly protectedI have many in my electorate-7-and yet he will send us documents to show'that we must not ask him to use the Australian article. But the very argument that we have to .adduce to get himto use it, is the one which we have to urge, in order to get the Australian public to use the finished article which he produces. So that we find the same difficulty all along the line. It matters little to me what the commodity is so long as we can bring the' industry in Australia up to a proper standard. There is no process in the manufacture of white lead, or the making of pigments, or the mixing of paints, that cannot be undertaken here.

Sir JOHN QUICK The circular that was read said that Australian white lead is of inferior quality, and had not the same covering power as imported white lead. I have here another certificate from the Storekeeper of the Newport Railway Workshops, Melbourne, in which he saysThe sample of white lead submitted by you' for trial at the Newport workshops has been reported on as follows, viz. :-It is soft and fine, and requires little or no grinding, and, weight for weight, will cover a larger surface than the ordinary dry white lead.

If honorFirst of all, I decline to believe that a metallurgist has necessarily an expert knowledge of the covering qualities of white lead; when he begins to talk about the covering qualities of lead he steps outside his function altogether. The question is I have one for a practical painter; and experience must be the great teacher I fancy that covering qualities ultimately depend on the wearing qualities of the lead; that must be the test. So far from the honourable member for Echuca being singular in the quotation he made to-night, and in the views to which he gave utterance, I have to say that a practical ironmonger, a friend of mine in Sydneya man of the highest integrity, who has been selling white lead all his life-expresse d the same opinion. able member's own showing, that man cannot know anything about the covering qualities of white lead. evidence of this man is worth just as much as that of any other man connected with the business..

The honourable member for Bendigo questions what was stated in the circular quoted by the honourable member for Echuca, and I now desire to read the following sentences In spite of some hysterical articles in our local press, we can confidently assert that genuine white lead, as recognised in Great Britain, is not yet an article of manufacture here. A quantity of sulphate of lead, which is a cheap by-product, has been manufactured here-we , ourselves, in years gone by have made about 300 tons of the same. It is an article altogether inferior in covering power to genuine white leadand if offered to the public in Great Britain as such, would be a breach of the law. That is all the circular says. be true. not true? good white lead is not made in Australia. raising that question; I am only pointing out that the letter states that white lead made from sulphate of lead is inferior to white lead made from carbonate of lead, and that that is an opinion confirmed by the highest authorities. honourable member for North Sydney has stated that he does not know that Australian, white lead is used for painting purposes. ber has not distinguished between metallic lead and white lead.

It presented telegrams from Bendigo, Ballarat, and Geelong, and was accompanied by a representative of the Coachbuilders' Association, of Adelaide, and the President of the New South Wales Coachbuilders' Society.

That, I think, ought to be sufficient protection on any class of paint. To my mind, it is a very big charge. I do not know what 'paint is worth, but I should think that £ 2 0 would be a very good price. On that value a duty of £ 6 a ton would be equal to 20 per cent.

714,Sir William Lyne,"Let us go on with the answer to the suggestion that the Treasurer should agree to the postponement of the one item of. varnishes. This is what we get in return for checking debate on the kerosene duty. It should not be forgotten that even if the Minister applied the closure to the debate, and merely took a division on each item, it would be impossible for him to get the Tariff through before Christmas without the co-operation of the Opposition. end of this division that I think we misht finish it to-night. Treasurer would meet the Opposition in connection with varnishes, there should be no difficulty about that. -Every one must recognise that the honourable member for North Sydney is right when he says that unless there is co-operation amongst members on all sides we cannot expect to finish the consideration of the Tariff in this Chamber before Christmas. Still, I suggest that this division might, be put through to-night. I must say that the Opposition have treated honourable members on this side fairly tb-night. I point out with regard to varnishes that the proposed increase is not such an enormous one as has been suggested, and I think it will be found when we reach the item that there is a fair prospect of an agreement upon it.
