Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General is one of the longest that I more topics than is usually the case, and if I may say so, without disrespect, throws no light whatever upon any of them. The honourable member for Werriwa is to be congratulated upon having had an easier task in moving the Address-in-Reply to this Speech than he had in endeavouring to anticipate the policy underlying it in the recent addresses he delivered to his constituents. The nature of the Speech relieves me of the obligation of touching upon more than a few of the paragraphs, and then chiefly by way of reference lo omissions. In point of fact, the omissions from this Speech are far more eloquent than the statements contained in it. For instance, the assurance that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has not only been appointed, but is actually engaged upon his duties might raise a question as to what those duties are. Apparently his first duty is to start a new The honourable member for Australian Savings Bank for the purpose of competing with State and other Savings Banks now operating throughout Australia. The distinguishing feature of the banks already in existence is that the moneys received from the citizens of Australia are employed in Australia and. in each case within the State in which they have been deposited. The consequence of this very wise and fruitful course has been a material assistance in the development of the agricultural and other interests of Australia. Now the proposition appears to be to start a Commonwealth Savings Bank, which, competing in every State with the States Savings Banks, shall make any funds received available for general Commonwealth purposes, many of which if they are not to be met out of taxation or from resources already available, ought to be met otherwise than by demands upon any local funds available in Australia for local purposes. ' I do not desire to see expenditure inflated, and, least of all, to see borrowing abroad resorted to when that necessity can be avoided. But why deplete our local resources already found too limited? I say frankly, and without hesitation, that we ought not to divert moneys which have hitherto been devoted to the veloping its interior and by cultivating its soil to official purposes which, being in every sense Government purposes, most of them not productive in the same sense, should be met out of taxation or by appliremember.

A Federal Savings Bank will obviously injure, rather than help, our rural population and land settlement. We are told'that the Australian Notes Act is working satisfactorily. I am glad to hear it. We are not reminded that it is only working at present under a verbal undertaking from the Prime Minister that until after the next election no advantage shall be taken of the provision in an Act passed last session, allowing the Treasurer at his pleasure to greatly diminish the gold reserve hitherto held against these notes. That question does not arise at this moment. The Act stands on the statute book, but it is a fact of which the electors require to be continuously reminded; Finding from paragraph 8 of the Speech thatIt is hoped that an early opportunity will present itself for settling the question of the know either of them only as far as it consolidation of State debts. I am inclined to ask the Prime Minister to oblige us when he addresses the House with a definition of ""an early opportunity."" In 1910 it was pointed out that this very Act was becoming more urgent as time passes, and it was hoped then that ""an early opportunity"" would present itself. Apparently the .Government do not go in search of opportunities. The opportunity is to "" present itself."" It is to arrive in some mysterious fashion self shaped, so as to bring about the consolidation of the State debts. The only encouragement we derive from this paragraph is that the "" early opportunity "" has not yet altogether passed by. A glance at paragraph 8 will show honourable members that it has still to come knocking at the Ministerial door at some convenient hour before the Ministry will receive it or introduce it to the House. Next comes one of the really startling statements, of the Speech. thatAlthough there has been a very marked increase in the volume of oversea immigration, to which the land tax and general policy of my advisers has largely contributed At that I come to a dead pause, unlution of the recent Premiers' Conference able to finish the sentence. Stupefaction quoted appeared to amount to a recomis the only state of mind that can result mendation that the Commonwealth should from the perusal of that assertion. In the first place, as to the land tax, analysis shows that a very large proportion of the subdivisions have been made either between partners, or families, or relations, already interested in the estates, so that this great body of subdivisions imply no increase I shall do so before I whatever in the population. A large number of the other subdivisions require only to be measured, as no doubt other honourable members are aware, by the returnsfor preceding years to show precisely the extent to which that statement can be given any weight whatever. there has been a decrease. will be shown a decrease, and in others a slight increase. I am grouping the States together, and do not delay over the figures. As to the "" general policy of my advisers,"" that is a very judicious phrase to use, because what the general policy of His Excellency's advisers is no one understands. I do not know whether honourable members opposite are even yet acquainted with what the Government may be pleased to present as their particular policy. We has been announced or acted upon, and in neither of these branches of their policy is there anything that can possibly be pointed to as encouragement to immigration. On the contrary, it was only at the beginning of this year that the Minister of External Affairs, commenting on an article in The Times as to the populating of Australia, said the Commonwealth Ministry were ready at all times to co-operate with the States, but that until that co-operation was sought the Commonwealtn could not interfere. Honourable members will recollect that this co-operation was sought formally, pursuant to the following resolution of the Premiers' Conference:That the Commonwealth be asked to provide 25,000 assisted passages per annum for immigrants, arranging with the shipping companies and paying the cost of transportation on a uniform basic .rate, the States to select the immigrants and place them, as at present, and any State being at liberty to supplement the number It is set out of assisted passages allotted to it at the same rate.

They had just complained that there was no divided "" control ""-that the "" control "" was to be left wholly in the hands of the States. It is, therefore, not very clear what they meant by that reference. The proposition was that the States should continue to hold themselves responsible for the selection of the immigrants, and that the Commonwealth was simply to finance their voyage here. We had nothing else to do. If that is a divided control, it is so only in a narrow was pointed out last year, is that the apand special sense. It is not difficult for anybody to pay for anybody else's passage. The complaint of this Government was that all they were asked to do was to pay for the passages, and then they objected that this meant a divided control. I think the Minister will find it hard to reconcile those statements. Either it is not a divided control, or, if it is, it must mean that some small amount of heat was genesomething more which was not then and is not now clear to the Commonwealth Cabinet or any one else. control. honourable member to try to help Ministers when they cannot reply for themselves. The Commonwealth Ministers said that they were unable to recommend the Federal Parliament to vote funds for the purpose. Here was their Minister for External Affairs complaining that their Government had not been invited to co-operate. held out the invitation that they should be invited to act. They were invited, and then said "" No . "" Apparently, saying "" No "" and doing nothing is the part of the "" general policy of my advisers "" which has largely contributed to the increase of the population of the Commonwealth. I cannot find any honourable member for that statement? trace of anything else being done by the Government which has assisted to increase I read to the House and commented the Commonwealth's population; and, on during the Address-in-Reply debate this therefore, admit that the conundrum intime last year. This has been quoted volved in this statement is one which, peragain and again, and never yet challenged sonally, I am obliged to give up. The second part of the paragraph conself from the Vend prosecution, it seemed to tains a very far-reaching proposal. The me quite unnecessary, as well as ill-advised, words ""maternity g r a n t"" will, I think, for the Attorney-General to resent a referappeal man and every woman in this country, but the vague form in which the proposition has been launched leaves us so far without any conception of its extent or limitations, or the conditions and safeguards with which it is to be surrounded. Until they are laid before us, it would be idle to endeavour to discuss something of which all we know is that it is to be a maternity grant. The speeches made with regard to it indicate that it is to be made of the most general character possible. With fhat we shall be able to deal in due time. In the next paragraph, we find that certain Royal Commissions have been appointed. The first of these I notice is the Sugar Commission. The misfortune, as pointment of this Commission was made at least twelve months too late. The present condition of that inquiry offers a good deal of ground for comment, which need not be made at this moment. In connection with the Australian Industries Preservation Act, allusion is made to the action brought against the Coal Vend. I regret rated yesterday in respect to it . There is no necessity, so far as I can see, that, on this particular subject, any member of the Government should be as excitedly sensitive as the Attorney-General was, because, when It is very good of the the case against the Coal Vend was first launched, the Attorney-General publicly dissociated himself from the prosecution. When replying to the complaints of Mr Edden, then Minister of Mines in New South Wales, who protested that the Coal Vend was an excellent thing for the miners whatever it was for the companies, the AtHe torney-General, in a public interview, repudiated all responsibility for its prosecution, and placed it upon the Shoulders of our Government-the previous Government -shoulder s which are very willing, indeed, to receive it. or questioned.

50,Mr Webster,What authority has the,18,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
51,Mr Deakin,"The statement which'of the most curious developments that, within my experience, has been witnessed in a Court of the Commonwealth. It appears that on an appeal against the decision arrived at by a Judge of the High Court which penalized a number of parties to the Coal Vend, declaring that there was a vend in existence, that its existence was contrary to the law, and mulcting several of the parties in fines of thousands of pounds, an application for an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal was made on their behalf. This application was concurred in by counsel representing the Crown, that is to say, by the Commonwealth. That was my statementI have never said more at Ballarat or elsewhere, and cannot say less. The circumstance was brought to the notice of all Australia because the Chief Justice and other members of the High Court exhibited the utmost anxiety to make it clear that they desired to avoid any adjournment which was not absolutely necessary. They showed that they were most anxious to hear and determine the case, and, as one of its authors, may I express the hope that they will uphold the Act. Here, then, we have the spectacle of our highest Judiciary, in the discharge of its judicial duties and actuated strictly by judicial motives, urging on the hearing of a case more important than any of the same kind which has yet been determined in Australia. We have those who had been penalized applying for an adjournment, and that adjournment being assented to by the Crown. The Attorney-General last night gave as the reason for that assent the absence of the Crown Solicitor, and went on to say that arrangements had been made that Mr Powers should be present when the case again came before the Court. AllI have to add is that, from a long -experience of that gentleman, I feel sure that no delay which he could avoid has -been incurred, and I wish it to be clearly -understood that nothing which I have said -can be construed as in any way a reflection -either upon him, or upon the counsel engaged in this particular case, or upon any -other officials who cannot be heard in this House. I put the case forward as a curi-ous one. It is curious, not only because of the very decided views expressed ""by the Bench, but also by reason of the -concurrence of the Crown in the application made by the other side for an adjournment. Fori f there is one point upon which the people of this country require to be assured by a judicial decision, it is as to the length which we may go to protect this community under the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which our Government was instrumental in placing upon the statute-book. Until that judgment is delivered we are not in a position to fully and fairly criticise any proposals which the present Ministry may br'ng forward to amend the Constitution in this regard. We have no private 'interests to serve in this connection. We have only public interests.. It is absolutely in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth that the people should be protected from the operations of unjust combinations, and therefore this judgment of the High. Court should be obtained at the earliest possible moment. I admit freely that there are many classes of cases at law in regard to which a postponement is a matter of indifference to public men and to the country generally, though it may be of enormous importance to private persons. But this is a case in which the importance to the whole of Australia and to the Parliament of the Commonwealth is transcendent. No excuse can be urged to justify its adjournment for a single hour longer than that at which it can fairly be brought forward. NowI hope that we have this issue right away from personal considerations of all kinds, because it ought not to be in any sense a party question. I have brought the incident forward the trusts? undertake to say that the honourable member's party got a great deal more of it at the last election than did any members of our party. £100,000 was put into the funds of the party opposite. member resume his seat?

That is only half the truth, the other half being that, as I have said, we had been crippled by the Braddon clause, but, knowing the revenue was to be increased a few months prior to its termination, we deliberately commenced expenditure which would not all fall due until after the Braddon section had expired. Consequently the claim to have made up out of the Commonwealth receipts the deficiency of the last year of our Government ought to have been accompanied by the statement that extra revenue to a far larger amount was about to become available. We have the taunt from honourable members opposite that we did not do enough for the Post Office, accompanied by the further taunt from the same side, that we were extravagant, and a third taunt that the present Government has been able to meet J:hc expenditure out of resources, which, it should be remembered, amounted to £2,000,000 more in that year than was -enjoyed by the previous Administration in the year preceding.

Paragraph 26 of His Excellency's speech tells usI t is proposed to proceed with and pass into law the Navigation B ill as a measure of the greatest urgency and importance. In 1910 the Governor General's speech told us that this Bill was to be introduced at an early date, and it was introduced, I believe, in another place, where it has remained for two sessions. In this House it has only been read formally a first time, in October last. So far we have not had a word of debate or explanation. This is one of the longest, most intricate, and important measures ever before us, .and yet This destroyer was built we are told, by way either of threat or intimidation, that it is proposed to pass it into law. It is to be hoped we can pass it ; but, in doing so, we must do justice to ourselves as a Conunonwealth and to a ' measure which is more fraught with difficulties of a technical character than any we have hitherto dealt with.

But the Government did that last year when they fixed that as the gauge-for the transcontinental railway tp Western Australia.

Paragraph 34 refers to the forthcoming -readjustment of our parliamentary representation; and so far as concerns Victoria, it is said that a curious anomaly exists. We are told that, when the estimate of population was made, Victoria was below the quota necessary to retain two of her present number of members, but that, since then, the Victorian population has risen to such a degree that the representation should be decreased by only one member. By the time this has become law and is effective for all we know, if fhe progress of Victoria continues, it may even be possible that this State should not have lost either of its members. Surely this is a condition of affairs obliging us to ascertain the facts' on which such statements are based; because if an injury to this State is being done a remedy should be found.

Paragraph 37 of the Speech makes allusion to wireless telegraphy schemes. Is this a convenient way of alluding to difficulties which have been encountered ? BecauseI have just been favoured with a volunteered statement purporting to show that, although the Government say that a chain of stations are being opened, nevertheless there are factors in connection with the work which call for some explanation. The following telegram has been forwarded to me:20 June, 1912. The Hon. Alfred Deakin, Federal Parliament House, Melbourne -Fo r your, information wireless position is as follows :-Although Government was offered by us chain of stations cashindemnity against infringement of twenty thousand pounds and undertaking to completewithin three months, they elected to take an unknown system of same size stations designed by Government expert, who was stopped by Marconi in England by Judge Parker for infringing Marconi patents.. Government promised Parliament close last session they would have Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart within six months. Only Melbourne HobaTt completed, at twice the cost Government could have obtained from us. Instead of Government getting cash indemnity against infringement of patents Government hnshad to give Father Shaw indemnity for making stations, holding him free of all costs and damages for infringement. \Ve are informed Government has now secretly given Father Shaworder for twenty other stations without calling for .tenders.

Some excitement was caused yesterday over the word ""curious."" I find that the thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England have a rival in this particular Speech. A number of paragraphs are devoted to a number of questions, upon only a few of which I have yet touched. Two of these paragraphs contain a list, that, judging from a glance, I should say comprises some fifteen or twenty Bills which the Government propose shall be dealt with in the coming session. merely the titles are mentioned, it is impossible to offer any appropriate comment upon them, nor do I desire to do so. however, are thirty-nine paragraphs; here are references to more than a score of important Bills; and yet, as far as I can judge, the one subject of national importance^-the one subject towering above all others in the public interest, the one subject have appealed for order. If he does I shall which to this Government and this Parliament and the members of it means more than any others-is not mentioned here. It is not referred to. It is ignored. What is that subject ? It is the problem created by the industrial unrest which has been convulsing this CommonweaUh. It is quite true that industrial unrest exists over a large part of the civilized world. feature is that this country-whic h has gone further and done more to avoid and to cope with that industrial unrest wherever it arises; which has made more extraordinary efforts and sacrifices to that end than any other country; which has studied the subject closely; which has endeavoured to bring to bear upon it judicial and other methods as far as they can be made to apply, and perhaps further; that this country which has done so much, and whose history is marked by more continuous improvement of conditions, raising of wages, and bettering of industrial circumstances than that of any other country in the world; that this country, doing all thiswhich has been so sincere in its efforts to these ends, has not yet coped wilh, but is, on the contrary, confronted with a greater measure of industrial unrest than we have ever before known in the historv of Australia. Surely we might have expected that this vital subject of industrial unrest would be dealt with in the national interest, and that, at all events, there would have been an endeavour to throw some light upon the causes of those I do not know. perpetual disturbances which have occurred -disturbance s which, in some instances, have gone very near to assuming the gravest anti-national character. the Commonwealth now. the Worker office? ment came into office under cover of a strong;"" advocacy and eulogies of the peaceful constitutional settlement of all industrial disBut, as putes.

It has not attempted to multiply or strengthen Australian industries. What have Ministers done even in the way of safeguards? They have, it is true, passed legislation which, if taken at its face value, was to put an end to many of these difficulties. They have made the most extraordinary concessions for the purpose of tempting the settlement of some classes of industrial disputes. In order to gain peace, this House parted with powers and created authorities such as exist in no other country, which can only be upheld on the ground of their fulfilment of the purpose for which they were created.

108,Mr Deakin,"This Government camehappened in the last two years, the record of which discloses more disorder, more dissatisfaction, and more strikes than any other period of our history, to consider and reconsider this gravest of questions. Without detaining the House by giving too many details, I shall do the best I can with the official statistics available. On recent matters they are very incomplete, and also partial; but, fortunately, there are figures relating to New South Wales which, as the largest State of the Commonwealth, may be taken as typical of the rest. Since the Commonwealth was established, what has been the progress made by the industrial community of Australia? In New South Wales during that period the number of factories has increased by 50 per cent., the employees engaged in them by 60 per cent., and the wages paid by 100 per cent. That, in concentrated form, is the industrial development in the Commonwealth up to the present. Taking New South Wales as typical of the other States, if that record is Australian, as I hope it is, crack than any other civilized country? no country in.the world, I believe, not even the United States and not even Canada, can .show such a record.' The changes have all gone one way. Every alteration has been for the benefit of those engaged in the industries. From 1907 to 1910 there was an increase of £ 1 0 per head to the incomes of the wage-earners of New South Wales. I trust that similar figures obtain for the whole Commonwealth. work out? of the returns, and I put them aside with reluctance, since their recital would cause me to trespass too much on the time of the House. As I have already said, we cannot obtain the full figures for the whole of Australia in respect of last year. have, therefore, to deal with them partially. While during this period there was a steady increase of pay and a decrease of hours, there were more references to the tribunals to which we look to settle these questions, and a greater number of decisions by them than ever before. The extraordinary feature is that, side by side with unparalleled advantages and prosperity, side by side with the largely increasing use of means for the peaceful settlement of industrial troubles, tliere has been a record of strikes, somewhere. Where? And""by whom? By throwing all previous records in the shade. Surely in combining these characteristics, Australia stands alone to-day among the communities of the world. Taking the returns for New South Wales, we find that in 1908 the days lost by strikes in that State totalled 1,650; in 1910 they had risen to 11,000. That illustration puts at once in concrete form the problem that must puzzle every European inquirer. There is now on his way to these shores, or in New Zealand, one of the most distinguished men of letters in Great Britain, who is also one of her most distinguished statesmen. I refer to the British Ambassador in the United States, Mr James Bryce, of whose high attainments and abilities both friend and foe speak alike. That very able and brilliant man-and I am the more free in paying these compliments, because on some cardinal questions I differ from him -is largely actuated in visiting Australia by a desire to study the industrial situation in these new communities. When he views figures of this kind, will he not admit that Australia presents a more difficult nut to Advances most rapid, continuous, and beneficial in every direction, and at the same time insurrectionary outbreaks fiercer and more threatening than ever before! HOAV can the two go hand in hand? Why do they go together? That, surely, will be a problem which that statesman will endeavour to face. I hope that we shall have his help in facing it, but it is one to which I , personally, will not attempt at present to give anything like a complete answer. Still, it ought to be clear that the industrial problem cannot be settled by strikes. Strikes are undertaken by those engaged in a particular industry, or branch of if, for a particular gain. If they win, the rest of the community is in no way bettered. Possibly the circumstances of another industry We are then so much affected that it has to appeal to an industrial tribunal or, if it be utterly reckless, to strike for concessions in the same way. A strike is always partial and limited, and even when it is in part a sympathetic strike-abou t the most unsympathetic thing it is possible to conceive -thi s is always in the interest of a particular industry or industries. If certain employees, as the result of a strike, gain an improvement in wages or hours of employment, that improvement has to be paid for the rest of the community.

110,Mr Deakin,"They are given in onedraw upon our general current funds, upon national finance and national ability to bear the new burden. Consequently even some thinkers who are ranked amongst the most extreme supporters of socialistic views, have admitted that true national progress is not possible by the instrumentality of strikes -on e for peace and the other for warAll that is possible is an improvement of conditions in a certain number of occupations, and all at the expense of the general community. Rarely is the granting of improved conditions accompanied by such a revolution in the methods of production as to enable the extra payments involved to be withdrawn from the industry concerned without affecting other classes of the community. Then there is sometimes a diminution in the number of employees. Thus we are now having in Australia, sometimes in one State, sometimes in another-sometime s in this trade, sometimes in that-strike s which create, not only bitterness and hostility, and involve heavy loss, but which impose increased pecuniary burdens on our people. Follow this process' round, and you find that the more increases you grant the more burdens you have to bear; the more strikes you get, the more you increase some one's burden, ancl so round and round. some honourable members opposite, it may apply irregularly, but the wildest must admit that it cannot go on ad infinitum. Civilization itself could not bear that strain. In Parliament, if anywhere,-the whole of our inmean, in material affairs such as wages, terests ought to be taken into consideration. In this House; and in the Senate, if anywhere, a problem of this kind ought to be faced. Here we have representatives of all trades, callings, and interests, and surely this task which does not arise from theoretical, but from practical considerations, is forced upon this Government, if they are in earnest, of endeavouring to find some solution which will comply with that programme for peaceful settlements of these disputes with which they set out, and which, so far, falls far short of its aim. lie on the wrong road. ' Where is the right road ? open minds. It involves questions which go deeply into our social life and history. T am perfectly prepared to admit this, and face them. But surely it is a mockery for the Government to come forward with a programme of industrial peace when that programme, not only has no effect upon the average number of disturbances of average gravity, but is accompanied by more disturbances and worse, and greater interferences with national interests than ever was the case before. The two movements are absolutely antagonistic. They ought not to be allowed to proceed side by side. Apart from what is done behind closed doors and by personal persuasion of which we know nothing, we see little attempted to be clone by those who are in control of this country; or, indeed, by honourable members generally, on the other side in order fo suppress and bring to an end such disturbances as do find an outbreak. orable member has proclaimed himself an out-and-out revolutionist. has used words to that effect.

The way may be difficult, and it may be long, but we must solve the problem. It takes two forms-the discovery of what social justice means, and can be made to hours, and conditions of labour, production, and so on; and, on the other hand, the firm and rigorous.suppression of every form of outbreak, physical violence, or outrage as the consideration which the community receives for the sacrifices it makes to that end. sion of some employers, who want to continue sweating. able member of unions more tyrannical than Facts prove to us that we must any employers, not only to their opponents, but to their own members.

120,Mr Deaktn,"T can tell the honorThe confusion of the business of politics, of the financial interests of individuals and classes with the comprehensive interests of the nation, would occasion the worse encounters, and threatens the most disastrous results. It appears to me, as it has always appeared, that the only practical outlook presented is in the direction of profit sharing, co-operation, and similar methods of employment. Those engaged in the various industries can organize them on the same plans as have already furnished some brilliant successes in the Mother Country. In these there are no strikes, no dangerous differences; but, by a judicious policy, the individual workers are placed in a position which they realize to be fair, and which affords them all the advantages they can reasonably expect. In addition, a standard is set with which other industries in the same line can by the force of public opinion, if not by the force of law, be brought into accord. Profit sharing, cooperative, and other undertakings of the kind supply invaluable standards. They show what an industry will bear, and without destruction, help to build up others upon a permanent basis. Those methods possess enormous advantages over any attempt at State control. It implies a handling of business directly between the employers or owners of the works ancl their employees. When the latter are satisfied with their lot, as they appear to be most abundantly satisfied in England in several great enterprises, and in a few elsewhere, we have a solution of the problem, fostering the individual interests of employers and employed, encouraging other interests to adopt the same methods of linking labour and capital harmoniously together. member has forgotten a third party, and that is the consumer. nothing of the kind. It is perfectly plain that with fair competition between the industries conducted on these equitable principles you have nothing to fear either for the employers or for the employees; both are guaranteed a fair return. With the free competition of one firm against another, you secure the protection of the public for whose custom they compete. The object of each is that, having given fair consideration to its employees, they enter the public market on an equality of terms as well as an equality of prices, so far as they are controlled by cost of production. are abolishing competition. Surely the honourable member knows that competition is dying a natural death. go on with the actions against the trusts? would have done fifty years ago. honourable member to repudiate it , for as far as I can see he repudiates everything existing, aiming at something which he thinks will come into existence fifty years hence. sharing. or fairer than profit sharing. Although, of course, one speaks always with a frank confession that through those means v/hich are known to us and in actual operation we can perhaps find some better developments than those which we now see, the best road is distinctly through profit sharing and the peaceful handling of industrial problems by the parties directly concerned. The protection of our public as to prices should be secured by open competition under the safeguard of the Inter-State Commissiona body which I have always supported-to be composed of business men with such an acquaintance with the inner and outer working of our industries as to be able to advise Parliament generally as to what are the fair and equitable terms and prices to be observed. They have no such Commission in America, and, so f a r as I remember, no provision for its creation in their Constitution.

VVe have pursued that weary round of which I have spoken-strikes , pacifications, more strikes, more pacifications, and still more strikes. What do we find side by side with the Arbitration Court? Defiant opponents of those Courts. What did we find in such a case as that which occurred in Perth, where the tramway men struck against an award of the Arbitration Court? The Tramway Company made the men an offer of some advance beyond what the Court had granted after a fair and full hearing, and the men refused that offer. The company then made a higher offer, and that, too, was refused by them. I regret to say that this was also accompanied by incidents of great disorder and gravity. They finally made a third offer, which meant a loss of £6,600, or over £2,000 a year for three years. This violent strike was only settled by that addition to terms which the Court had held to be fair and right. What, then, is left for our Industrial Court? What confidence can we place in its decisions if , upon those who are in no way directly assoas in this instance, no sooner are they given than they may be overridden ? ' In this connection one is bound to note with the deepest regret that, while even in savage warfare certain conventions and understandings for ""the protection of the weak and wounded are observed, nocode has been evolved to protect the innocent and defenceless when a strike occurs. of the Adelaide hospital. action. During the Perth strike men who continued to work under the award of the Arbitration Court were followed and attacked in lonely places-no t man to man, but one man by two or more, and three of them were sent into hospital. Those attacks were criminal as well as cowardly. Why are the women and children of those whose actions do not accord with the views of the strikers allowed to be molested and harried? Even in the bloodiest warfare safeguards are provided for them; but there is no respect even for the women of the community from some of the hangers on who boast that they are upholding a strike. Surely it is time that the men in command and those who represent labour principles should establish a code protecting the innocent from malicious attacks, and allowing those responsible for the struggle to settle matters . peaceably between themselves. However huge the cost of arbitration, it is not a fraction of the cost of strikes, direct and indirect. If only for purely business considerations, the wholeforce of public opinion should be exerted against every proposal to strike, when there is an open way to the Arbitration Court. Brisbane could have got to the Couit, there would have been no strike. which the one and only cause of the action taken was the refusal of permission to wear a badge. on which the strike actually took place, although the point had been submitted to the Court, and was then under jurisdiction. Had that fact been made known to the strikers at the time, in all probability there would have been no catastrophe. The mischief is that the real burden of strikes often, and to some extent always, falls, not upon those concerned, but upon the innocent, ciated with either side in that dispute. It might be arranged, as in a pugilistic encounter, that the principals should meet, and they alone be answerable; but even the code that obtains in a prize-ring does not obtain in strikes. able member apply his principles, and .have a go at the Prime Minister? orable member tender himself as an antagonist?

They attend every meeting of peace societies at which they can conveniently be present, denouncing war, bloodshed, and violence, and preaching the universal pacific settlement of differences. But why do they not preach these doctrines when a strike is imminent or proceeding? Why do we hear nothing of their peace principles then? and effectively appropriate then, and that, perhaps, is why they are omitted.

159,Mr Deakin,"On the facts, as I subwithout a permit from his Strike Committee. No city, therefore, was ever more absolutely held up by an armed hostile force than Brisbane evidently was at that time. I say a hostile force, because it was not that of the Government. It had no sanction from any Parliament or from any Government. Indeed the strike bulletins published at the time boasted that the Government itself had to go to the committee to get permits. I am told that this is untrue, except in so far as it refers to the Water Board,. which is a Government institution. The Board had to ask for permits as well as private persons, so had the largest and smallest merchants of Brisbane, and so had private people who wished to get food or supplies. As Mr Collings, on the Strike Committee, said, they were the dictators of Brisbane. The city was captured, held up, and half starved. I find that Mr Coyne, on 2nd February, sent a message, by telegram, to the Prime Minister, in which he stated that the Strike Combined Committee have maintained absolute order up to this morning. Peaceable prowords more. cessions have taken place, also peaceable public meetings this morning. and so on. What we should note is the extraordinary nature of the whole of this message. It is not a message from Mr Coyne as a member of the Queensland Legislature or as a trade unionist, but from Mr Coyne as master of the city of Brisbane, stating that the committee of which he is a member has control of that city just as any foreign invader who had landed troops and seized the city would have had. He decides what people may and may not do. He is absolute master, has processions when he likes, claiming that they are peaceable, because at that time there was no one strong enough to resist him. was the absolute dictator of the city. I want to know whether in any constitutionally governed country such a condition of things is possible without the entire destruction of the authority of Government. If Mr Coyne had said nothing else and done nothing els.: but boast, as he was entitled to boast, on the facts that he was dictator of Brisbane, this in itself was the most direct challenge which could be given to the Government of this country-whic h is a Federal Government, and includes both Commonwealth and State Governments. Here was a man who had seized power, and was exercising it, as no real Government holding the power has ever ventured to exercise it in this Commonwealth. This in itself is a matter that calls for a great deal of reflection, particularly on the part of honourable members opposite. Then Mr Coyne went on to complainPermit to hold processions refused; foot and mounted police f u l ly armed posted all corners preventing people proceeding peaceably along streets. I understand that they attempted to proceed along the streets in bodies of several thousands, and under very provocative circumstances. Many serious unprovoked assaults by police. That is so like the police, we know. We have vigilance committee keeping perfect order if not prevented by police. Perfect order when people were living, moving, and feeding only under permits from the Strike Committee. W ill you assist us with your naval and military to maintain peace and order. Reply urgent. I should think so. document, but if there is more shall be prepared to read it with pleasure. Setting aside what the statement implies, this is what Mr Coyne saysStrike Combined Committee have maintained absolute order up to this morning. That referred, to the 2nd February. NowI find that on the 23rd January, 27th January, and the 28th January-the e occasions -dynamit e had been discovered planted on the street tram lines, which if it had been exploded might have blown the trams to pieces, killing the innocent, and, so far as the. strike was concerned, disinterested persons that were riding in them.

There were crackers in the streets. members opposite deny this?On January 23, 1912, a plug of gelignite, a powerful explosive, with a fuse and detonator, were found on the Bulimba tramline at Doggettstreet. Mr J. B. Henderson, Government Analyst, reporting on the material found, said : ""Had the explosive detonated uncler a carwheel,the wheel would have been shattered and pieces of it driven up through the car. The explosion would have caused very serious damage to the car, with correspondingly serious risks to the passengers.""",28,Foster Th E Honourable Appear To Have Realized That Our Inter

The flanges of the car wheels were not sufficiently deep to reach the caps in the grooves; otherwise an explosion would have occurred as the car passed over the material. twenty-five more caps, with dynamite attached, were found by a. private citizen in one of the "" b o x e s "" on the same points. I come now to the time when the strike undoubtedly was in existence. On 13th and 14th February, on Kelvin Grove-road, near the Normanby Hotel, two tramway employees cleaning out the points found four plugs of dynamite, six half plugs, and fifteen detonators. with sand. passed over the points, but no explosion' took place. Were four plugs of dynamite a harmless dose to give a car ? then? looking after the rioters led by the honourable member. Perhaps they were forming a guard of honour for him. February, the strike still continuing, at 6.55 a.m. six plugs of dynamite were found between the points of the tram line in Murray-street, New Farm. The dynamite was all together, and partly covered with dust, and was, fortunately, discovered before the trams ran. March, at 8.45 p.m., an explosion took place in Wickham-street. exploded a charge of dynamite which had been placed on the rails, but no damage was done owing to the fact that the explosive had been damaged. I suppose that was the "" cracker "" ! On 8th March', at 11.20 p.m., a plug of dynamite, with detonator, was found on the Kelvin Groveroad tram line. My point is, that this is evidence of what must be expected in practically any great city in which the Government of the day is thrust aside, while unauthorized persons, by their numbers and organization, take command of the streets. That justifies no deduction attempted by persons connected with the before the strike, or that they were committed with their knowledge, but you must realize The strike was about that in every city of any size you will find, not only a certain number of criminals Does the honourable who seizeany opportunity which a disturbance presents, but also a number of unOn 27th. and 28th balanced people who, in times of seething excitement, processions, marches, and so on, identify themselves with a cause with which previously they may not have had anything to do, and act without authority, under the impulse of the excitement generated. You have to recognise the fact, just Later on as you must recognise that in a city f u l l of wooden houses there is always the dangt-r of a conflagration. Why the authors of that strike, and those members who joined with' them are rightly placed at the bar of public opinion is because-knowin g these facts as men of the world-the y bring about a condition of things in which other men, having little or nothing to do* with the cause, or possiblyThe explosives were covered weak men in their ranks, lose their balance, A Leichardt-street car had and commit criminal acts endangering the lives of innocent citizens.

When they seize it by violence they invite others to adopt violent I suppose they were means. When they disregard the law, they 1 encourage others to flout the law. Consequently the responsibility fairly sheeted On 20th home to those who conducted and authorized the Brisbane tramway strike, is that they most assuredly did, in the first in stance, proclaim that the wearing and display of the badge was not before the Court. They distinctly said that at the commencement, and had to withdraw it afterAgain on 6th wards. In that they were responsible for making a blunder to which, perhaps, is The car had due the whole of that unfortunate series of incidents. In addition to this, /they are responsible for taking command of the city from that time forward, under conditions which permitted violence, robbery, and worse to take place, because the authorized guardians of the law had been deposed. The strikers were taking their place, but had not the knowledge or control enabling them to give the city the protection to which it was entitled. Therefore, quite apart from any separate offence of indulging in or inviting practically civil war, they had taken upon their shoulders two great responsibilities. In the one they had been entirely misled, because the question of the that these outrages were badge was before the Court; and in the",29,Foster Th E Honourable Appear To Have Realized That Our Inter

That is a very serious condition of things; but to us here the most serious and unhappy of all is that I can find no reprobation, no condemnation of these acts, in the speeches of the Prime Minister or of his colleagues, or of the other leading men -who were connected with the strike. I can find no attempt to put the men right on the question of the badge, and to point out that, having made a serious mistake, they had not yet lost the opportunity of correcting it, and of returning to their trams, to await in patience the decision-of the Court. will find an attempt to put him right on some of those points, at any rate. ceeds, I shall stand corrected. I have not only looked myself, but have had search made through these papers, and in every case have public warrant for what I have said. In this connection, I come to the first serious step taken by the Government. I quite recognise that in this matter the Government act as a whole, and I refer to them as a whole, not as individual members. So far as I know, there has been no departure by individual Ministers from the attitude or policy adopted by the Government as a whole. The Government made their choice, and their party evidently approved that choice when, in reply to the telegram from the Premier of Queensland, through the Governor of that State, asking the Prime Minister to take steps immediately to protect it against domestic violence, Mr Fisher declined to do so. Every honourable member by this time must be perfectly familiar with that section of the Constitution which readsThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and on the application of the Executive Government of a State against domestic violence. The word ""shall "" therefore covers both applications. The Commonwealth "" shall "" on the application of the Executive Government of a State protect it against domestic violence. The Prime Minister in his reply saidHis Government did not admit the right of any State to call for their assistance under cirmerely asked to do what it thought was cumstances which are proper to be dealt with by the police force of the States. The condition of affairs existing in Queensland does not, in the opinion of my Ministers, warrant the request of the Executive Government of Queensland, contained in your Excellency's message, being complied with. That answer was plain. I admit that under that section it was within the competency of Ministers to return that reply. The word "" shall "" in "" the section of the Constitution which I have quoted is mandatory, it is true, but that word as applied to a Government would receive the ordinary interpretation, which requires a Government to shoulder responsibility. It is just possible that some State Premier upon losing his head might,' ask for support from the Commonwealth when it was not necessary. But this was not such a case. I am expressing my own opinion, and it is a very clear opinion on that point. ber would not have sent troops to Brisbane if he had been in power. He would have been too cunning for that. what I would have done because nobody can prove it. Consequently, it is a profitless subject for discussion just now. tical dodge. quest of the Queensland Government? What this incident constitutes is a pre-"" cedent, and that is why it must be very carefully examined by this House before we allow it to pass. I am speaking in this instance because, in common with every other honourable member, I now stand responsible either for endorsing or condemning the action taken by the Commonwealth Government. I am condemning it because it is part of my responsibility, which I cannot avoid if I would. Seeing that dynamite had been used in a dozen cases in Brisbane, that the city was under the control of a body which was not elected by its citizens, but self created, that honest citizens could not go about their business or obtain supplies in the absence of permits from that body, I say that if these things did not constitute an interruption sufficient to demand action on the part of the Executive Government, there is no case which cannot be explained away. What was the Commonwealth Government asked to do? It was not asked to send 20,000 men, accompanied by artillery, to Brisbane, even if it had them.

174,Mr Deakin,"What, refusing the renecessary to make the police measures effective. We may gauge the standard of what was necessary by the fact that the State Government in their straits called for, and created, special constables, by whose aid they were able gradually to resume control of the city. What was done by the special constables at the request of the State Government in such an emergency could have been done more easily by a body of men of the same number, or by a smaller body, who, being the agents of the Commonwealth, and acting for Australia as a whole -in other words taking no sides with either party to the dispute-woul d have been able to check that domination of the city by a section which had usurped all authority, simply because it had a strong following. Certainly the Commonwealth militia would have been able, without any more exertions than were put forward by the police, and probably with less, to have controlled the city. There the responsibility lies. I congratulate the Prime Minister and his colleagues-and heartily rejoice in the fact-that their refusal to comply with the request of the Queensland Government led to no worse results than actually followed. That so many attempts to use dangerous explosives passed without loss of human life is something for which we must all feel profoundly thankful. Probably that result was due to the fact that those who laid the dynamite were not sufficiently expert in handling it. Had it been used by men of mining or blasting experience accustomed to it, probably a very different story would have to be told. Ministers that no such blot has been cast upon the escutcheon of the Commonwealth. have been a disaster if the military had been ordered out. which happily at this time of day will not carry farther than the honourable member sitting next to the interjector. We have no "" military "" in this country. We have a citizen militia, but the remainder of our citizens are not separated from them as they are in parts of Europe. There, in times of emergency, soldiers can be placed in the streets, drawn from portions of the country which have little community of interests with the city, and these men, being without ties, are prepared to use their weapons ruthlessly if necessary. But will any one say that the citizens of Australia would be likely to err in that fashion, or that ""a single individual would be found bathing his hands in his brother's blood, except to save bloodshed? down to Brisbane wanted to do it. who are politely alluded to as "" the crowd brought down to Brisbane"" is happily clean, because nothing happened. The honourable member apparently recognises the danger of bringing down a certain number of civilians to act as special constables. I admit some danger in that regard. There is always more danger from untrained civilians acting in such circumstances than there is in drilled men who are accustomed to obey the word of command. In the latter case the risk of a man losing his head and his judgment and committing an act which may embroil his fellows in trouble is less. often done by the other side with the object of getting unionists put in gaol.

The first ground on which troops may be called out is to execute the laws of the Union.

It ought to have contained a warning that men who had usurped authority which did not belong to them, and were upholding it by force, should at once return to their peaceful vocations. That was the first admonition that should have been made. The second should have been a warning that if they did not, then the Federal Government would feel obliged to act under section 119 of the Commonwealth Constitution for the protection of the people of Brisbane. I say that the Government did less than justice in that reply, which showed no sense or recognition of the heinousness of the state of affairs existing, and of the seriousness of the outbreak; which merely put the strikers off with the hope that good sense -of which they had hitherto not exhibited any sign-woul d prevail in the end.

The copy from which I was quoting is printed in small newspaper type, and with the glasses ivhich I am now obliged to use I did read "" in the end,"" though the word is "" to."" But the conclusion to the whole of this unhappy subject is that even a reference that implied that good sense was then obtaining was in absolute contradiction of the fact. Good sense was not obtaining, and had not obtained for a long time past in Brisbane, and there was also the danger of greater departures from any I said "" to the end."" good sense existing. Consequently that reply showed, in-my opinion, an inadequate appreciation of the responsibilities of the Government. That Ministers and the members behind them should have been partial larly careful to avoid intervention, if they could avoid it, by any device, is not surprising, since this most illegitimate appeal on the part of an unauthorized authority I see no difference became from men on their own political side, associated with them industrially. The yes, the honorincident afforded the Government an opportunity of showing that our oath binding us The honoito be faithful and bear true allegiance is meant to be obeyed, and will be obeyed, so that we make neither difference nor distinction on party grounds in such crises. It is therefore most unfortunate that there should have been any distinction between the character of the reply sent to an illegal, illegitimate authority, and that sent to the legitimate, the legal, and indeed the only authority under the Commonwealth. I do not propose to press the point too far, but the attitude taken up by the Commonwealth Government was not that which one would have expected from a Government absolutely impartial and independent.

That brings us, as I say, face to face with so fundamental a change in the industrial situation that it imparts a still greater weight to the sober warnings which have been given, based on the experiences to which I alluded before the adjournment for lunch. While the bulk of this House is eager to see the peaceful means of settlement by a competent tribunal with powers wisely developed to the utmost, certain bodies which are most concerned, and which include some of the leaders of labour, in New South Wales, are taking a diametrically opposite course. The result of this must be to defeat the purposes of the arbitration law, and to drive us farther along the road of conflict, which we have made, or have been willing to make, many sacrifices to avoid.

The other point which I passed, though it appears to be worthy of note, is a consequence of the action of the Government, in refusing the request from the Government of Queensland for their intervention to bring the tramway strike to an end, since this led to their appointing some hundreds of special constables with whose aid order was preserved for the remainder of the strike. I did not call attention, as I ought to have done, and intended to do, to the fact that this implies a shifting of the centre of gravity, so to speak, which, in the interests of the Commonwealth, and its Government, should not have been allowed. Up till now the reading of the Constitution has been that, any rising, strike, public disturbance, or domestic violence, arising from any cause, connected or unconnected put down by some strong hand, in addition to the control by the ordinary police, should be dealt with by the Commonwealth Government. That prerogative which it enjoyed, and which no one else enjoyed, which it was not called upon to depute, was not exercised. The effect of this refusal was that the State Government, by means of an additional force of special constables, acting in a perfectly legal way, has acquired for itself a constitutional standing in this connection, which previously belonged to the Federal Government. It took the charge and custody of the affairs of Queensland into its own hands, on a matter as to which under the Commonwealth Constitution this Government and this Parliament were entitled to take control. The establishment of this precedent is clearly a limitation of the authority hitherto exercised by the Commonwealth Government, and an encouragement to other States to deal with similar difficulties in a like way. It appears to the minds of many more besides myself who were associated with the framing of the I am informed that Constitution-thi s particular provision seems to have passed with little or no discussion and by common consent-wa s that the Commonwealth Government was to be the authority in all matters calling for the exercise of what might be termed supreme force, that it was to be a Court of last and highest appeal in cases of domestic violence, and that its action, for its verdict would be an action, was to be final. failed. to the State authority failing. way. can be. read into the provision, but if it is, it will be read into it by those who are anxious to extend the sphere of State authority and to curtail the sphere of Federal authority. fail before the military authority will take charge.

The strike is estimated to have cost £500,000, tramway company to a . very large expense. Men who were in revolt against an industrial system, who had an appeal before a Court in which their application for liberty to wear a badge was included, who had a legal remedy provided for them, who had taken the necessary steps to appear before the Court and were waiting a decision-which , as events have shown, would have been in their favour if they had continued to work-eve n under all these circumstances insuring them an early hearing -stil l chose to strike. That, in my opinion, was an illegal act, an unconstitutional act, and also, on a fair consideration of the. circumstances, an unjustifiable act, since they had only to wait a few weeks longer to spare their city the desolation which fell upon it. They refused to do *so. They were headstrong, reckless, and thoughtless enough to take that step plunging thousands of their fellow citizens into losses and difficulties, also hindering and injuring the producers of the State, whose goods were held up for six weeks.

Yet we are now told that these men should be rewarded by being found places in the Government service, when we know that those who stepped forward to take their places in the service of the tramway company would never have received such an offer at all if they had lost their employment by reason of the reinstatement of the strikers.

The judicial machinery is -being discredited and disowned, sometimes by the manner in which it is being employed and dropped at pleasure. Finally we have a new intimation, authoritatively endorsed by an honourable member opposite, -of the strength of a movement for sweeping away the whole structure so painfully and laboriously raised in order to return to the primitive, dangerous, and costly method of the strike. This illicit device, as it appears to me, is being adopted under the sanction of the organized bodies of labour, the trade unions, to whom one naturally looks for light and leading on these matters. If I may be permitted to say so, trade unionism could never have taken a step more dangerous to its own reputation, or more likely to turn to its injury in the future.

A part of our community is not organized into trade unions, and, acthat part is somehow or other to continue to find the funds necessary to enable the trade unions to obtain as much as they think they ought to get whenever they like. On the one side we are to have a body of people who are to determine for themselves what their share of the wealth production of the community is to be, and on the other side a section who are to have no say as to their share or liabilities, but simply to provide the wealth, if it can, for trade unionists and their organizations whenever they want it.

The process never has an end. The demands go round in a ring. As soon as you have gone round you begin again with fresh demands ? opening out before us ! This is what is called "" industrial peace,"" into which we are expected to enter with our eyes open. I had hoped that I would be corrected and checked in my prediction, instead of receiving an unqualified assent.

If the destructive party is always to be the successful aggressor, the constructive party must cease to exist. The only outlook will be syndicalism. This means unionist syndicalism. all property by those who are engaged in connection with it. How the trade groups will then settle between themselves as regards the different kinds of property I do not know. There may be great conflicts over that question. In any event, we are being led into a desert out of which I see no pathway. The main point is that a greater burden will now fall upon those on this side, and all who sympathize with them, to devote their attention more than ever, while there is still time, to evolving a conto have the whole of their demands granted, structive system of legislation which will appeal to the public as doing frank justice between man and man, and, as far as possible, between class and class. novel for you. country before the honourable member who interjects had any part or lot in legislation. Those attempts will continue to be made, because only those who examine ancl reflect upon the infinite variety of human undertakings and their development in this age, and in the novel circumstances which we are now witnessing, will realize how much the problem as a whole is beyond the wit of man to solve by any one effort. It can only meet with a progressive solution from time to time, by adjustments which, without disturbing the course of national events, will permit of the adoption of a juster and sounder system. That is not the system of the frequent and general strike on the least provocation, and the demand, by force, of toll from the rest of the community. That is recklessly destructive. The constructive programme must produce an entirely opposite state of affairs. I have already alluded to some methods which may be employed in manufactures and many occupations, such as co-operation, profit sharing, and other means which, if patiently pursued, can solve this question in the process of time in a way in which the ideas of the honourable member for Dalley can never hope to solve it. Human character ancl human ability differ so immensely in every respect, even in their ordinary employments, apart from all other circumstances, that to bring them all at once into line or to march them in one direction, is an achievement which no statesmen whom the world has ever seen would consider within the It means the appropriation of reach of our powers and possibilities. But on the other hand I submit that the constructive side of social legislation, instead of being torn down by the general strike, is worthy of extension, development, and perfection. Much, very much is possible by its means. But these gains cannot be achieved while the threat of a general strike is always hanging over the community. In the last resort men like the honourable member for Dalley and those behind him hold the last card. They are while those upon whom their demands are made may do nothing but concede them.

I await with interest the declaration of the Government proposals in respect to the establishment of an InterState Commission, because, as I have frequently pointed out, that Commission affords them one of the widest opportunities which have yet been presented for constructive work in several directions, and esoecially in connection with tlie development of Australian industry. Personally, as a Protectionist, I have always looked forward to the establishment of that body as an independent and original authority to which can be referred without hesitation many of the practical propositions-som e of them comparatively small and others of them very large-whic h await settlement before we can hope to witness a proper application of Protectionist principles at the Customs House. able members opposite to say to that? tion both sides of the House are divided. There is no need to disguise the fact that not only are there general divisions between Protectionists and anti-Protectionists in this Parliament, but there are also a series of minor divisions between those who are prepared to protect only certain industries and those who have wider aims. The important thing for all to recognise is that the establishment of an independent tribunal such as the Inter-State Commission is rendered [4] more essential by that condition of affairs than by any other. For instance, from He speaks not only for the Protectionist stand-point we find ourselves crippled by the continual challenges of existing duties, or against demands for new duties. I venture to say that there are dozens of duties in our Tariff which have been injuriously affeotfed by mere conflicts of opinion as to facts What we require is a Board which shall become these questions, and which, without disclosing the particular means-whethe r they be mechanical or chemical-by which various processes are being improved or cheapened, can so master every business It says, ""pending the affected as to be able to say what are the conditions surrounding its continuance, and how far its appeal for more consideration', I hope so. either in the direction of increased or I have appealed to the altered duties, can be supported. ber think that the Commission would l>e able to do that ? even such an expert body would only be able to find a verdict in respect of any particular industry for a certain period which it is impossible for any person to name.

I have been frequently informed of facts which if they had been known when previous Tariff proposals were under consideration would have materially affected the actions of the open-minded, men in Parliament. By the creation of an InterO n the fiscal quesstate Commission we should get rid of a very large percentage of the misunderstandings which have hitherto existed, and of the angry feelings which have been aroused by a sense of injustice. All that the Commission would be asked to do would be to ascertain the facts. For instance, it might find that the production of this inkstand cost so much in Australia, but that it could be cheapened by the adoption of such and such a process, or that it could never become a stable industry.

What is the Tariff which is operative now? with which nobody was satisfied when it was enacted. It defeated our hopes in respect of I do not know how many duties. The increases that were given resulted in a Tariff-ther e was some excuse at the time, but there is none now-to which a largely revenue tendency was deliberately given by a section of members who were in a position to make or unmake majorities.

I should not be pleading so strongly if I did not believe that the case for Protection, which now awaits an answer, is so good that an impartial investigation would satisfy most honourable members who are opposed to-it, and, further, that the country can well afford now to part with a number of revenue duties.

Until the expiration of the Braddon section, it was practically impossible to amend the : Tariff seriously; but since then we have been placed in a financial position enabling us to look the question fairly in the face, and that is what we ought to do at the earliest opportunity.

When the present Opposition went to the country, we were met on every side with the complaint that, whatever else we had .to say for ourselves, we could not promise anything like the wholesale grant of higher duties promised by members of the Caucus during this Parliament. We pointed out that, under our proposal, a branch of the Inter-State Commission would have investigated some portions of the Tariff during the first year of its existence, and more during the second year, and faster as time went on. We further pointed out that, in the light of experience, Protectionists who huge possibilities of productiona country had faith in the policy need have nothing to fear from such inquiries as guarantees and safeguards. But a high Tariff at once was declared to be a necessary outcome of the return of the then Opposition to power. In Victoria and other States honourable members opposite were returned to this Parliament by majorities gained by assurances given by themselves, ancl taken as .applying to the whole of their party, that large Tariff increases would certainly be made without any Inter-State Commission or inquiry-that generous additions would certainly be granted by a Labour Government with a Protectionist majority behind it.

Vet, according to the Governor General's Speech, this Parliament is to close without even an attempt to give effect to those promises. The alterations which have beeu made in the Tariff, when compared, not with the promises, but with what is everywhere recognised as necessary, do not amount to a percentage worth mentioning. Protection is not the only safeguard for Australia, but it is undoubtedly one of the essential considerations in a country of such which requires to develop its means of utilizing its own productions in manufactured form, if we are to give our own people a fair chance of finding markets within our own borders as well as beyond.

The Inter-State Commission is empowered to deal with navigation, shipping, railways, and with the enormous area covered by the general title of trade and commerce. The Inter-State Commission is not authorized to deal with Customs duties, and no one desires that it should be; but what we desired was the creation of an expert Board, subject to the Inter-State Commission, devoting itself to those researches, inquiries, and experiments of'which I have spoken, in order to keep this House in close touch with industrial progress abroad and progress at home. This would enable us to decide, in the light of knowledge, when we should grant further Protection, and to what extent. Such a body could continually conduct a close the honourable study of the industrial life of Australia, compiling complete records of growth I have not; but or decadence, of the needs of the people, and the necessity for readaptation.

These being ascertained would allow Protectionists and those who hold, other doctrines to consider in the light of those facts their obligations to the citizens who sent them to this or to the other Chamber. We are sadly in need of such an independent non-party body, if it were only to shorten debates in this House. able member, when lie was at the head of a Government, appoint such a body? those benches longer, not only should we have done much good work, since neglected, which required to be done for Australia, but such a body would have been appointed by this time. Parliament would have been absolutely supreme in matters of policy, but we should have been able in some way to keep in touch with the marvellous developments, mechanical and other, of the present age which are having such effects upon the industrial life of this country. In point of fact, what such a body would do would be to keep the finger of Parliament upon the pulse of trade, so that it might be regulated with exactitude. We have hitherto never approached in any particular the consideration of our Tariffs in such a way as to promote the development of new industries for the good of Australia or of those existing which had proved to make for the general well-being of the whole community. I have been told by way of interjection that there are honourable members of the party sitting on this side of the House who are not Protectionists. Well, the programme of this party has yet to be shaped by the Parliamentary party itself. But what proposals it has received from the leagues, drawn from every State and embracing every colour of fiscal and other political opinion in those leagues-wha t we Have obtained as a basis in this regard-is a declaration in favour of the f u l l development of the resources and the industries of Australia and of oversea markets for our products. shows that it is not only the Protectionists, industry and its opportunities in this but men who have never claimed to be Protectionists, who are willing to recognise this as a legitimate national platform to which effect should be given. There are other provisions further developing this plank. They may differ, and do differ, as to the methods which ought to. be employed for the development of the resources and the industries of Australia; but nevertheless they put that as amongst the first duties of the Commonwealth Parliament. There is a question in the minds of some as to the cost involved-as to whether the price to be paid is or is not here orthere too much. There may be duties which are too costly. The return from some would not perhaps be sufficient to justify ,their imposition. But, regarded from the Australian point of view, in my opinion it would be found that all the great industries of which we have accomI f we had occupied plished the establishment, and some others which could be fostered, and which it would be to the interest of Australia to foster, could' be buttressed in such a way that there would be no secret tax levied upon this community without its knowledge, and, on the other hand, no attempt to conserve foreign interests-bot h of which tendencies have been exhibited too often during my long experience of the discussion of Tariff questions. We should get, for the first time, men who would put the welfare of Australia first, and who would regard the industries of Australia as amongst it greatest possible possessions. members of the honourable member's party think of that idea ? ledge of the capacity of my colleagues to know that they are perfectly well able to take care of themselves, and to answer for themselves as Liberals. the honourable member speak at Goulburn? the places chosen for me to speak at were very kindly selected as near the Victorian border as possible, in order to permit me to spend my Sunday at home. astutely chosen. commendation of this body is that it would prevent future attempts to make protective issues the tools of any party, but would lead to their consideration on their merits That -accordin g to the possibilities of an continent, and not according to political necessities or to meet the exigencies of party government.

We put forward as a national policy the development of the industries of Australia, but we insist that those industries and those resources are to be developed by private enterprise, under the control of laws which shall secure equity and justice in the matter of wages, hours, and conditions of employment. Our fundamental difference is not in respect to those wages, hours, and conditions, but in respect to the nationalization of all those industries instead of their preservation in the hands of our citizens and workers, and their progress by the motive power of independent initiative. We rely upon our citizens working for their own families and their own future to develop our resources and perfect our industries in a way that could never be attained by a regimented body of public employees marshalled under political control and bringing political pressure to bear in their own class interest, no matter how ruinous its effects might be upon Australian interests at home and abroad. Big as Australia is, immense as her resources are, she cannot live alone any more than any other continent can. She looks There was to her oversea trade, and the development of oversea markets, for her produce is one of the chief aims set out in the programme of the Liberal leagues.

A Government whose policy has been rejected cannot be considered a Government. posal. What the carrying of that referendum would mean is the reduction of all the State Governments of Australia to the position of mere local governing bodies and glorified road boards their reduction to mere glorified road boards endowed, except in regard to education, with no great power worthy of a Parliament.

I have to apologize for having omitted from the early portion of my remarks a reference to a resolution of the Hobart Conference, which I wish, briefly, to place -on record as being extremely important in its relevance to my previous comments on the application of Queensland for assistance, and the reply of the Commonwealth Government. It reads as follows :That the Defence Act should be so amended as to clearly set forth that the object of creating a Citizen Defence Force, based upon universal -compulsory military training and service, is for 'the purpose of defending the Commonwealth against possible foreign aggression, and therefore-So far so good. There is no real bearing in the ""therefore,"" but here it comes-and therefore, under no circumstances, should auy person so enrolled be compelled to bear arms against any fellow Australian citizen, notwithstanding anything contained in the oath of allegiance, or in any other of the conditions of . Apart from the extravagant compulsory service. During the Broken Hill strike of 1909 the statement, mistakenly attributed to the Prime Minister, was made on authority. This resolution was passed at the last Labour Conference, which met at Hobart on Monday, 8th January, 1912, and closed on 12th January. The telegram of the Queensland Government was sent to the Prime Minister on the ist February, and his reply was made on the 2nd February. This appears to have been the date of Mr Coyne's telegram, and the reply to it ; so that, at the time when the services of the Citizen Defence Force were denied to Queensland, the resolution I have read had been recently passed by the Hobart Conference.

What connection, if any, there is between these events it is for Ministers to explain. I am also unable to touch on several of the matters included in the amendment of which I gave notice, owing to the lapse of ' time and the failure of my physical strength, which has embarrassed and, I fear, impaired my arguments throughout. I find that I have not, except lightly and incidentally, dwelt upon the maladministration or on the financial extravagance or on the appointments which have been made, on' which I intended to touch. Attention has already been called to the latter, indirectly ; and I have no doubt that my omissions in these regards will be more than made up before this debate is closed.

429,Mr Fisher,"Yes; kill them by theaggression of any kind. Let us consider the -position in which the women folk of some of the men who were dismissed from the tramway service were placed. During a long period they lived in a constant state of anxiety. which to women is worth almost more than life itself, because they knew that their husbands were independent men, and would speak their minds. No doubt, husband and wife talked matters over each day, and both must have felt that the time would soon come when trouble would fall upon them. In the face of this, the honourable member -for Ballarat talks lightly of the aggression of these people in leaving their employment, causing disturbance, and so on. ing before the Court. time of truce, employees of the tramway company were being shot, speaking industrially. What kind of men would their .fellows have been if they had allowed their representatives to be passed out of their eni-ploy while a case was being made ready fbr the confederation of the Court? These are the facts,. Let me pass rapidly to the question of the appeal for the assistance of the military. The Leader of the Opposition was good enough to say, and I thank him for dealing with the matter so explicitly, that he did not read section 119 of the Constitution as mandatory on the Commonwealth Government to send troops merely because they were requested to do so. As my colleagues are aware, that is the view of the matter which I took as a layman. The honourable member for Ballarat was good enough to admit that, under excitement, a State Premier might ask what the Commonwealth Government would feel it their duty to refuse. That exactly describes the circumstances under which we refused the appeal for military aid. I ask for no sympathy -for the Government in this matter. We did not send troops to Queensland when they were asked for. We considered that we had the power to accede to, or refuse, the request, that on the evidence before us there was no warrant for the demand made for assistance at the time, and we refused it . I shall refer more at length to that matter later on. I . wish to deal with a matter which is outside this particular question, which concerns neither this nor the opposite party, but the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I have not consulted my icolleagues, and I therefore .speak for myself only when I say that, in my opinion, had we been so unfortunate that, in our view, the situation at that time compelled ,the granting of the request for troops, and they had been sent, an irreparThey lost the bloom of youth, able injury would have been done to Australia. I go so far as to say that a conflict between the troops and the people of Australia at the present time would mean the end of our first-class defence system. It would absolutely defeat and destroy the wonderful system for the defence of this country which is being successfully inaugurated at this time. I am not saying that circumstances could not arise when it would be necessary to send troops to the assistance of a State Government, but I mention what,, in my opinion, would have been the effect if we had acceded to the request of the Queensland Government. On the question of the publication by certain newspapers of a statement attributed to me, 1 have to sav that I wish the reference had never been made. The statement has been published in .almost every newspaper in Queensland. It arose in some mysterious manner that had nothing whatever to do with me. I think it is known that it affects another person. 1 allowed it to be published in Queensland without a reply, and here to-day it is; brought up again by the Leader of the Opposition. I must once more deny that E ever uttered or authorized the statementOther papers require only to be examined to show how the matter arose. I must not close without making some reference to remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the Australian note issue. Itmust have been amusing to my honorablefriends on this side to hear the honourable gentleman state that the success of the Australian note issue rests upon some action? taken by honourable members opposite. We have been invited to believe that the reason, why it is in a stable condition to-day is that: I made a certain promise to the honourable member for Flinders that, until after thenext election, I would hold a larger reservein gold to meet the notes than I think necessary. That is not the reason for thestability and satisfactory condition of our note issue. That is perhaps a reason whyit is not in as good a position as it mightbe. But we have in this matter to -treat our honourable friends opposite as an olderperson treats a younger, or as a father treats a child. It is necessary retake certain persons by easy stages. If they are handled with patience they may be brought over. I wish to say",51,Elliot Johnson Tha T Or Me That The Idea Which Probably Was In
430,Mr Deakin,When their case was com,52,Elliot Johnson Tha T Or Me That The Idea Which Probably Was In
431,Mr Fisher,"I say that during thatagain that in keeping not less than 25. per cent, of our note issue in gold at the Treasury, which would mean an average reserve of one-third in gold for a working margin, we should have an ample gold reserve against a national note issue. 1 promised the Opposition and Parliament, and the country that I would keep a gold reserve of 40 per cent, until Parliament met. I have been faithful to that promise; but the real effect is that we have less money to employ, and, consequently, less earnings from the note issue. The fluctuation until now has not amounted to 5 per cent. The gold comes in and the notes are taken away. May I state again to the House and the country, and to all those who wish to listen to me, the basis of this note issue? Nobody is asked to take a note or keep it unless he .desires it in preference to gold. People have to bring the gold to the Treasury before they get the notes. If they went out of the door and came back with the notes, they would get their gold, and we should Accept the notes again. During the Werriwa election it was reported to me that the honourable member for Parramatta had said that the gold reserve in the Treasury vaults was depleted, and I.O.U.'s put in instead of gold. The honourable member for Parramatta shakes his head, implying that he did :not say it. I am glad to know it. Personally, ' I do not know whether all the gold is jn the safes or not; but I can say that I hold the certificate of the Auditor-General that the safes were sealed with that amount in them.

As there may be some who desire to know the question I wished to ask, it was thisWhether the honourable member for Ballarat recently said at a public meeting at Ballarat that the Customs imports into Australia were increasing by millions of pounds, and that the Tariff should be re-opened for the purpose of giving more protection to Australian industries. If he said that, why has he made no reference in his want of confidence motion -to the Government's silence regarding the re-opening of the Tariff, and has the Leader of the Opposition refrained from making reference to. the matter out of deference to the fiscal opinions of the Free-trade section of the Fusion, Messrs.
