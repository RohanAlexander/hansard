Of course, that objective is laudable and one Having said that, I also want to make it that all people will seek to support. plain that our opposition is not to the concept of having a structure of international The Opposition will, however, oppose this humanitarian law and it is not an opposition Bill for several reasons. The first reason is to some of the principles and provisions that the principal provisions of the protocol which are set out and contained in the proare ambiguous, and are not simply ambigutocol. For our part we 'support the concept ous on a strict legal interpretation but amof having international humanitarian law biguous in their substance to the extent that where there is a case for it. We support that the actual operation of this protocol must be notion in principle and we will support it in left in very grave doubt. The second reason practice. We support the efforts made by the we oppose the Bill is that the protocol, if it International Red Cross and ,other branches applied to Australia and its armed forces, of the Red Cross and,. indeed, the efforts would undoubtedly limit the effectiveness of made by other organisations and people to the Australian defence forces and limit them lay down principles of international humanvery severely, to the extent that we must itarian law. All of that is common ground; conclude that there wOlild be doubt as to we are at one on those points. To take it whether the Australian defence forces would further, we can also say that we support be able to achieve their objective in an armed attempts to protect civilians from the devasconflict if they were required to comply with tating effects of war. Anyone who seeks to the terms of the protocol. argue that, from our opposition to this Bill, It goes further than that, however, be the Opposition is opposed to international cause, thirdly, we also take the view that if humanitarian law is completely mistaken. In the Australian armed forces were bound by deed, for our part we would expect the Austhis protocol, they would in fact be put in tralian defence forces to comply with civilised principles when they are engaged in an armed There are provisions to the effect that the conflict, even those that may not be enforcecivilian population must respect the wounded, able under the law that is applicable at the the sick and the shipwrecked. And so it goes time. on. There is no need for me to detail what There are many provisions in the protocol would total a considerable list of provisions that we support. One would hope that they in the protocol to which we take no excepwould be common ground amongst all who tion. I want to make that perfectly plain. As are concerned with this subject. They are, I have said before, and I simply repeat it and should be, common ground. We say, before I move on, we would support those therefore, that when we look at the protocol, principles in practice, whether or not they we see provisions in it which we support. No were contained in a regime of international suggestion should be made by anyone that law. Indeed, they are probably second nature we are opposed to the entirety of the provito all Australians. sions in the protocol, because that is simply not the case. Of course, it can also be said that many of those provisions are already contained in I refer the House to some of the provisions the Fourth Convention, which is one of the of the protocol in order to support that four Geneva conventions which Australia proposition. As I say, there is a whole series. acceded to and which are enforceable under In fact, the protocol has about 63 pages and Australian law by the Geneva Conventions therefore contains many provisions. In that Act, the Act which is being amended by the protocol there is a large number of provisions to which we take no exception. Indeed, Bill that is presently before the House. It not only do we take no exception to them, must be acknowledged by any observer that but also we would assume that they would many of those provisions are already conbe applied and are applied, whether they are tained in the Convention and there is no contained in this or any other provision of need for an additional instrument to set them international law, or whether they are conout again. tained in any statement of international law.

So it is invisions of the protocol in total give rise to a tended to have a very wide ambit. The third justification for rejecting the Bill and for not provision is paragraph 3 of article 49, which ratifying the protocol. Let me illustrate that states: point and make it plainer by referring. initially to two articles of the protocol, the first The provisions of this Section apply to any land, being article 48. I draw your attention, Mr air or sea warfare which may affect the civilian population . . . Deputy Speaker, to the fact that article 48 is headed 'Basic Rules'. We can assume that It is not 'which does or necessarily will' have the draftsmen of this protocol meant what that result, it is 'which may affect the civilian they said and were aware that substance of population'. In further supporof that I draw this basic and most important area of the the attention of honourable members to arConvention is to be found in article 48. ticle 52, paragraph 2 of which provides that Article 48 provides: attacks shall be limited strictly to military In order to .ensure respect for and protection of objectives. So we find once again this very the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parclear intention of the protocol, being not that ties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish bewe are trying to achieve the best or the best tween the civilian population and combatants and in all circumstances but that the protocol is between civilian objects and military objectives and intended to have a strict limitation and a accordingly shall direct their operations only against strict application. One of our concerns is that military objectives. in military encounters that imposes a burden I draw the House's attention to the fact that on the armed forces which.is really impossiif this is to be applied in the words that are ble to ask for and impossible to achieve. set out in the protocol, the word is 'only'. The basic rule is that operations are only That then is the basic rule. In addition,. I to be against military objectives. We know will for the purposes of this argument draw that what is being talked about is a situation the House's attention to article 51, which is that may be one of defence as well as offheaded 'Protection of the civilian populaence. We know it is intended to have a tion'. Paragraph 2 of that article states: particularly wide coverage. The total effect The civilian population as such, as well as individual of all this is very plain indeed. It is to isolate civilians, shall not be the object of attack. civilian targets in such a way that in our There we have a fairly basic proposition. But view the armed forces would be neutralised. to make the effect of that clause clear I ask There is no doubt that this is what President honourable members to go back to article Reagan had in mind when he said that this 49, which explains in effect what the protoprotocol was fundamentally flawed and when col is talking about at that stage. I draw the his Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee made a House's attention to three provisions in artistatement in an article on this subject, which cle 49. The first, which is paragraph 1, makes many honourable members would have seen, it plain that these restrictions apply not only to the effect that there is a lot in this which when a party is engaged in an offensive is simply militarily unacceptable. posture or exercise but also when it is in In many cases the provisions are vague defence. I think in the version tabled in the and uncertain. When one a<;lds that vagueParliament there is a spelling error-I preness and uncertainty to provisions which alsume it is a spelling error-which might be most reek of an inability to apply them with corrected. Should it not be 'whether in offthe intention the draftsman had, we believe ence or in defence'? Perhaps we can change that the only conclusion that fairly can be that at some stage. IfI am right on that, the reached is in the first place that this will intention of the draftsman is to say, 'Whether impose very severe limitations on our armed you are engaged on the offensive or the forces engaged in exercises in which we and all Australians expect them to succeed. It circles on the structures? The conclusions really is an unreasonable limitation to impose are given in paragraph 7, which states: upon them, a limitation which when they The absence of such marking in no way relieves any are engaged in those exercises will result in Party to the conflict of its obligations under this their being in a situation of danger.

It is probably no surprise for honourable So those on the receiving end may mark members to find, when pondering provisions their installations with three orange circles, such as those I have read out and many obviously as a warning to the attacker that other provisions of the protocol, that there they are about to face a situation where a is a provision-article 82-to the effect that provision of this protocol will limit and premilitary commanders are to have lawyers vent them from attacking it.

Then we find that if those in the they get legal advice as to whether they are defending country, if we can call it that, do allowed to attack a particular objective I not have the markings on the structures, it leave it to the House to speculate. It goes does not relieve the attacker at all. One further: When we look at some of the basic might well ask what was the purpose of it principles of the protocol we see that they all. What were the lawyers doing when the emphasise the ambiguity and the uncertainty decision was being made as to whether to and the difficulty there will be in applying attack or not. them. For instance, article 56 is an interestIn our view, when we put all of that ing article.

It goes on to say: forces. They would be fighting with one arm tied behind their back.
