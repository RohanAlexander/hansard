The issue of the level of promanufacturing directly provides 'only' about 25 tection immediately involves the costs of tariff per cent to 27 per cent of employment. Of course, protection because it is right that tariffs do have indirectly it results in a further large quantum of costs. The real issue then is the magnitude of employment, perhaps as much again as that base those costs and who bears them. I think it is 25 per cent. The point I would Uke to stress here worth remarking in passing-the honourable is that 25 per cent or 27 per cent is the figure for member for Port Adelaide touched on this matAustraUa as a whole. It needs to be recognised ter-that in that respect there is really a great that manufacturing is a much more important deal of muddled and misleading thinking.

The effect of that large devaluaably high in the international league table.
