(2) What will be the impact on the movement of aircraft in the air for departures and landings resulting from the full implementation of the Precision Runway Monitoring System (PRMS) and upon what information does he base this answer.

(2) Is he aware of world class practice in environmental management of airports. (3) Is he able to say whether the environmental management at Sydney Airport is comparable to environmental management practices at Amsterdam Schipol Airport, Zurich Airport and Arlanda Airport, Stockholm, in terms of world class practice. (4) Can an ecologically sustainable airport development and world class environmental management be achieved at Sydney Airport if world class airport management concepts, such as developing an understanding of environmental capacity of airports, are not actively incorporated into Australian airport environmental and transport law, management, development and planning; if so, how. (5) Is he able to say whether Schipol Airports total-airport environment strategy extends to environmental impacts outside the airport boundary fence, including such issues as road traffic congestion, air toxic emissions and noise. (6) Can Sydney Airport achieve worlds best practice in total-airport environmental management if impacts outside the airports boundary fence, including such issues as road traffic congestion, air toxic emissions and noise, are not taken into account.

(9) Did the Schipol Group, in its 1999 benchmark of Sydney Airports Environment Strategy against world class practice, (a) note the strategy did not extend beyond the internal airport area and excluded environmental impacts outside the airport boundary and (b) stated that operational aircraft noise, air pollution due to aircraft, external safety risks for third parties, airport related odours and smells, land use planning and zoning, airport related groundtraffic (density, congestion, pollution, etc.), recycling/re-use of materials, recognition and compensation of environmental damage, and handling complaints would need to be addressed equally well if the aim is to become the airport with the world’s best environmental management system. (10) Are all subjects listed by the Schipol Group comprehensively addressed in the Sydney Airport Master Plan. (1) As I have stated in my answer to Question No. 2312, each leased Federal airport, including Sydney Airport, is being encouraged to implement an Environmental Management System consistent with the International Standard Organisation’s ISO 14001 standard. This standard is recognised around the world as current best practice in Environmental Management Systems. The requirement to: comply with the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations; prepare an Airport Environment Strategy every five years; and submit Annual Environment Reports to the Federal Government, ensures that the airport lessee companies develop airport sites in line with the principles of ecologically sustainable development and continuous environmental improvement.

343,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Schipol’s Environmental Policy Statement and Action Plan 1998-2003 includes environmental impacts outside the boundary fence. (6) Environmental impacts outside the boundary of Sydney Airport are taken into account and managed in a number of ways. Specifically, air quality issues are comprehensively addressed in Sydney Airport’s Environment Strategy and ground based noise issues are addressed in the Environment Strategy. Noise relating to aircraft in flight is addressed through specific legislation such as the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995, the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, and programs such as the Long Term Operating Plan, and the Noise Amelioration Program. (7) I am advised that Schipol Airport’s environmental management systems are generally considered as a good example of sound practice in airport environmental management. (8) The Schipol Group was commissioned by Sydney Airport to benchmark the Preliminary Draft Environment Strategy (PDES). Schipol’s findings are included in the Strategy document. (9) Yes, the Schipol Group did make these observations (which are reproduced in Attachment D of the Environment Strategy)in its benchmark study. Consequently Sydney Airport amended the objectives of the PDES to include environmental advancement in both actions and performance, to act as a good neighbour and to prevent pollution. As I have said above, SACL comprehensively reports on its performance to Government. (10) Sydney Airport does not currently have a Master Plan, as defined by the Airports Act 1996. With the prospective sale of Sydney Airport and the complexity of a master planning process for the Airport, and given the range of competing industry and community interests, I have asked that a draft master plan be provided by 31 January 2003 by the new owners. British Nuclear Tests: Australian Participants (Question No. 2724) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Did he announce on 16 July 1999 that work would begin immediately on assessing the impact of the UK nuclear tests on the health of Australian participants; if so, how far has this study progressed and when will the results become available. (2) How many (a) Australian military personnel, (b) non-military Commonwealth personnel and (c) civilian (including indigenous) personnel are listed on the nominal roll compiled by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). (3) Did he state in his written answer to Parliament of 2 November 2000 that an independent scientific advisory committee would shortly be established by the Government; if so, (a) when was the committee established, (b) what are the terms of reference and (c) who are the members. (4) If the independent scientific advisory committee has not yet been established, what is the reason for the delay in doing so. (5) Has the Government checked official records to establish the accuracy of media reports regarding the proposed outline of Operation Lighthouse at Maralinga; if so, what do the records reveal about that matter. (6) Has the Government checked official records to establish the accuracy of media reports regarding Operation Hurricane at Monte Bello Islands in October 1952; if so, what do the records reveal about the matter. (7) In relation to the 25 Australian officers who were deliberately exposed to radiation at Maralinga in the so-called clothing trial, and Senator Minchin’s answer to the Senate of 22 May, (a) for how many of the 14 deceased personnel does DVA have health records, (b) for how many of the 11 living personnel does DVA have health records, (c) what were the specific types of cancer affecting the 3 personnel known to have developed cancer and (d) what assistance is available to these personnel, and their next of kin, for physical or mental illnesses or injuries arising from their participation in this trial. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The development of the Nominal Roll and the associated mortality and cancer incidence study were announced in July 1999. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) commenced work on compiling the Roll shortly after the announcement. However, the Department required access to records of a previous study on atomic tests participants conducted by the then Department of Health in 1983. Access to these records raised a number of legal issues. Resolving these issues led to a lengthy delay between November 1999 and September 2000. Access was finally granted to the Department in October 2000. At that point, shortcomings in the previous records became apparent, necessitating extensive manual checking of original source records. The preliminary version of the Nominal Roll of Australian participants in the British Atomic Tests Program was completed at the end of June 2001. Completion of the Nominal Roll was essential before detailed planning for the cancer incidence and mortality study could commence. To ensure that there is an effective means of communication between the atomic tests participants and the team undertaking the study, a Consultative Forum has been established. The Consultative Forum is comprised of representatives from relevant government agencies as well as ex-service organisations, including those who represent the interests of atomic tests participants. It held its first meeting on 30 July 2001. The cancer incidence and mortality study will be overseen by an independent Scientific Advisory Committee comprised of individuals with demonstrated scientific standing. The Consultative Forum was consulted about the membership of the Scientific Advisory Committee and its members will be announced at the end of August 2001. The cancer incidence and mortality study is expected to commence as soon as the nominal roll of Australian participants in the British Atomic Tests program is finalised. The final version of the nominal roll is expected to be published by October 2001. Results of the study are expected to become available in the second half of 2002. (2) The preliminary version of the nominal roll of Australian participants in the British Atomic Tests program currently contains 16,716 names, categorised as follows: Navy– 3268 Army– 1657 RAAF – 3201 Civilians (including 10 indigenous residents) – 8590. (3) and (4) Yes. However, due to the delay in the compilation of the nominal roll as outlined in (1), and the resultant delay in the commencement of the cancer incidence and mortality study, the Scientific Advisory Committee has not yet been appointed. As outlined in (1), the members of the Consultative Forum are to be consulted about the composition of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This issue was discussed at the recent inaugural meeting of the Consultative Forum and I expect to announce the membership of the Scientific Advisory Committee in late August 2001. (5) Due to the moratorium on all nuclear testing agreed to by the British, United States and Soviet Governments in October 1958, Operation Lighthouse did not take place. Details of planning for Operation Lighthouse have been on the public record as documents in the National Archive of Australia since 1986 when they were opened for public access. (6) In its investigation of the British Atomic Tests Program, the McClelland Royal Commission considered a range of issues concerning Operation Hurricane. The conclusions of the Royal Commission include reference to the fact that there were no breaches of health and safety regulations aboard Royal Australian Navy vessels which allowed personnel to be exposed to radiation beyond the limits set and that decontamination procedures were thoroughly carried out. The report of the Royal Commission has been on the public record since its publication. (7) (a) DVA has health records for 11 of the surviving personnel; (b) DVA has partial health records for 11 of the surviving personnel; (c) These records show that 5 of this group of 25 have developed cancer. The cancers noted in these records are 2 carcinomas of the lung, 1 carcinoma of the rectum, 1 malignant melanoma and 1 carcinoma of the prostate. (d) Any member of this group can seek compensation (i) under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation 1988 as administered by the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme; and (ii) if any member of this group has eligible war or defence service, as defined by the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, they may be entitled to treatment benefits for certain conditions, including cancer, under that Act. Regional Forest Agreement: Western Australia (Question No. 2745) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 21 June 2001: (1) Did the Regional Forest Agreement signed in May 1999 include a commitment from the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth would provide Forest Industry Structural Adjustment (FISAP) funding of $15 million to Western Australia. (2) Did he issue a media release on 11 August 2000 announcing that agreement had been reached with the State Government on guidelines for Industry Development Assistance Grants and that the funding applications under round one would close on 8 September 2000. (3) At the close of applications under round one, (a) how many applications were received and (b) what was the total amount of funding sought by applicants. (4) To date what amount of Commonwealth FISAP funding, if any, has been provided for (a) Industry Development Assistance Grants and (b) other FISAP elements in Western Australia. (5) Has his attention been drawn to the recent public comments by the honourable Member for Forrest criticising the Commonwealth’s failure to deliver the money owing to the timber industry in the South-West; if so, what is his response. (6) Will he undertake to honour in full the Commonwealth’s funding commitments to Western Australia; if so, what amount of funding will be provided in (a) 2001-02 and (b) 2002-03. (1) The Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement committed funding towards a joint South-West Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Program. Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Western Australian Government on 4 May 1999 the Commonwealth committed funding of $15 million to FISAP in Western Australia. (2) Yes (3) (a) 37 (b) Approximately $14.6 million, excluding those applications for which an amount was not stated. (4) (a) Nil (b) $118,800 for Rescheduling Assistance paid in 1996/97. (5) I am aware of the reported comments. (6) I have corresponded with the Honourable Clive Brown, Minister for State Development, regarding both Commonwealth and State Governments’ commitments made in the Regional Forest Agreement (RFA), in the light of the State Government’s decision to increase conservation reserves and reduce the supply of resource to industry. The State’s decision is inconsistent with the agreed outcomes of the RFA. I have advised the Minister, the Commonwealth remains willing to assist the Western Australian native hardwood timber industry through a joint Commonwealth-State Industry Development Assistance program but cannot do so until the State Government determines how much resource it will make available to individual businesses in the industry. The timing of any funding to be provided for Industry Development Assistance is thus initially in the hands of the Western Australian Government and is then dependant upon decisions to be made by businesses about their willingness to invest further, given the significant uncertainties surrounding their long term future. Fuel Taxation Inquiry (Question No. 2796) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: In developing the Fuel Taxation Inquiry, which business, transport and motoring organisations did the Minister consult with after the announcement of the inquiry in March 2001, and which business and industry organisations did the Minister write to seeking comments on the terms of reference.",102,Questions On Notice

Privy Council: Judicial Committee (Question No. 2802) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: Is he able to say which countries have (a) allowed or (b) ceased to allow, appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council since his answer to question No.1634 (Hansard, 29 August 2000, page 19602). The source of the following information is Whitaker’s Almanack 2001. (a) The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is primarily the final court of appeal for the United Kingdom dependent territories and those independent Commonwealth countries which have retained the avenue of appeal upon achieving independence as follows Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Brunei, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Kiribati, Mauritius, New Zealand, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Tuvalu. The Committee also hears appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. (b) Since the answer to the House of Representatives Question No.1634, no country has ceased to allow appeals to the Privy Council. Higher Education: European Convention (Question No. 2826) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 August 2001: Can he update his answer to question No. 1605 (Hansard, 29 June 2000, page 18813) and confirm whether Australia and New Zealand have signed the Joint UNESCO/Council of Europe Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education in the European Region, 1996 (known as the Lisbon Convention). The Convention is no longer called the Joint UNESCO/Council of Europe Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher Education in the European Region. Australia signed what is now simply called the Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher Education in the European Region on 19 September 2000. The New Zealand High Commission has informed us that New Zealand is not a signatory to the Convention.",106,Questions On Notice
