Man","POWER. ment of the Minister for the Army, that within the next twelve months there is likely to be in Australia an acute manpower problem, does the Government contemplate in the immediate future any positive steps which will release manpower from civil industries? Does the Minister consider that this method of supplying the deficiency of man-power is preferable to a reduction of the home defence forces? If the Minister has in view any reduction of the home defence forces, as is indicated in press announcefor Watson, and he has had an opporments, does this intention arise from a desire to reduce the budgeted war expenditure or to divert man-power, or is it due to both causes? tion is now being made of the whole subject of man-power. The matters which are being taken into consideration relate to the commitments of the Australian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Militia Forces, and the munitions factories of Australia. I shall not be in a position to make a definite pronouncement as to what the Government's policy may be in relation to the whole matter until a complete picture of the situation is before me. It is not true that I made to the press a statement to the effect that the number pf men in training is to be reduced. WhatI said was that the whole matter was being thoroughly investigated. The overriding consideration will be the adequate and effective protection of the hearths and homes of the 7,000,000 people in Australia, and the carrying out of our pledge to the men who are defending Australia in theatres of war overseas. MR. W. J. SMITH . ox WAR EXPENDITURE. Mr W. J. Smith, Director of Gun Ammunition, has been summoned to attend before the Joint Committee on War Expenditure this evening, in relation to certain allegations made by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein) with respect to his activities, and that certain evidence has been handed to the Minister for Munitions by the honourable member for Watson. Is the Minister prepared to deliver this evidence to the Joint Committee on War Expenditure in order that that committee may be made aware of the nature of the allegations against Mr Smith, and may give to him an opportunity to answer them ? consultation with the chairman of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure in relation to the communication handed to me by tbe honourable member tunity to peruse that document.",11,Setup

BRENNAN . personal explanation. Yesterday, the honourable member for Batman( Mr matter investigated now. Brennan), in a personal explanation to the House, denied a previous statement by me in which I had charged him with referring to the British Navy as pirates. When I spoke, I was not quoting from Hansard, but from memory, and if I was mistaken in the actual words, I was not mistaken in their meaning. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I propose now to quote from a speech of the honourable member for Batman delivered in 1936 and recorded in Hansard, volume 152, page .1564. This is what he saidOur association with the British Navy is entirely an evil one . . .

In view of the possible repercussions on private industry arising from this decision, and as four representatives of various unions attended the hearing, will the Minister say whether an opportunity was afforded to private industry to be represented in court? my department presented to the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court all tbe facts relating to the case.

Is it the intention of the Minister for Commerce to honour that undertaking, or is there any truth in a rumour that it is likely to be repudiated ? by a promise that was made by my predecessor, particularly since in this instance, plans for the export of eggs to the United Kingdom were considerably altered after the undertaking had been given. The Government of the United Kingdom asked the Commonwealth Government to withhold certain supplies of eggs, and to forward another rationed substitute. Consequently, the position has changed materially since the right honourable member for Cowper gave that undertaking.

Government pays nearly £100,000 per annum in rent for leased premises in Melbourne, and tenants are being evicted from the Shell Company building in William-street, in order to make available additional space for the Department of Munitions. Will the Minister for Munitions emphasize to Cabinet the urgent necessity for erecting a new Commonwealth building in Melbourne, to be constructed by arrangement with the Government of Victoria in the general administrative block in Treasuryplace, and to be sold to the State Government at the conclusion of the war ? accommodation that is required by the department is not only causing increasing .concern to me, but is also creating serious dislocations of the business and professional life of the city of Melbourne. At present, four or five buildings in Melbourne house the executive offices of the department, and that cannot be regarded as an efficient arrangement. The annual rent charge for them is substantially less than the figure which the honourable member mentioned; it amounts to between £40,000 and £50,000. I have already taken action to review the matter, and have intimated my earnest desire for government-owned property to be made available for the housing of this department under one roof, in order to relieve the Commonwealth Government of the obligation to pay heavy rents, and increase the efficiency of administration. sional period I asked the Minister for Supply and Development what steps were being taken to hasten the manufacture of aluminium in Australia. My question had particular reference to the large deposits of first-class bauxite at Mount Tambourine, Queensland. Amongst other things, the Minister said in reply that the Government was discussing the matter with the Department of Munitions I have nothing further and that later he would advise me of the result. In view of the urgency of this matter, I now ask the Minister whether those discussions have been concluded and whether he can announce what decision, if any, has been reached? aluminium in Australia is a problem which the previous Administration endeavoured to face. It involves the expenditure of a very large sum of money and the circumstances of the. expenditure, I feel safe in saying, were not altogether satisfactory to that Administration. Consultations have taken place between the Munitions Department and the Department of Supply and Development on this matter, and, frankly, those consultations are still proceeding. The problem is difficult and the Government must necessarily be satisfied about the venture before a large sum of money is expended. That is the course upon which the Government is travelling at the moment. Supply and Development tell me whether metal magnesium is being produced in Australia, and, if so, where, by whom, and the monthly production? Was any undertaking given by a Minister of the past or present Government that, if certain interests would set up a plant for the recovery of magnesium in Australia, the Government would discourage the manufacture of aluminium from bauxite? tion to give a satisfactory answer to that question, which involves the previous Administration and refers to what it proposed to do. I shall make inquiries and advise the honourable member later. of the Minister for Supply and Development to the motoring public to help in the solution of the transport problem by fitting producer-gas units to their motor vehicles, will he give consideration to the fact that very few official motor cars in Canberra are fitted with producer-gas units, and to the fact that the private",15,Machin E Tools

The responsibility for the supply of charcoal has been placed largely with the State Governments. I am not aware of the extent of tlie development in South Australia, but the Government of New South ""Wales has helped considerably in this matter and has erected kilns for the. purpose of manufacturing charcoal. If the honourable member would obtain the aid of the Government of South Australia in this matter, I think that we could arrange for priority to be given to the supply of steel for the erection of kilns in that State. Supply and Development yet able to disabilities that the industry is suffering make a further statement to the House as the result of inability to secure as to the result of his negotiations with adequate supplies of wheat offal? the Government of New South Wales and National Oil Proprietary Limited with regard to the shale oil undertaking cussion on this subject with the Ausat Glen Davis?

In the case of such articles the war postage charge of i d . w ill be payable in .respect of each unit of weight, viz., per 20 oz. for newspapers and per 16 oz. for periodicals calculated on the aggregate weight of the postings made at the one time, it is not intended to apply the war postage charge to parcels transmitted by parcels post. For several reasons it was not deemed advisable to apply to parcels the war postage charge made during the lust war, and the same circumstances exist to-day. Furthermore, only a comparatively small amount of additional revenue would be secured from the application to parcels of the war postage charge, and it is conceivable that the traffic would be detrimentally affected by such a step, especially as the rates of postage on parcels are now higher than they were during the last war. Coincident with the introduction of a war postage charge on domestic mail matter, steps will be taken, through the appropriate channel, to introduce a similar charge on postal articles addressed to places beyond the Commonwealth, but this charge will not apply to postal articles addressed to members of the Commonwealth or Empire forces abroad, nor to air mail articles addressed to' other countries on which the present charge is higher than the charge for domestic air mail articles. In a l l respects the bill is identical w i th vision as it originally stood; but bearing the measure introduced during the last war, and assuming that there w ill be no serious falling-off in postal traffic as the result of war conditions or dislocation of business activities, it is anticipated that the proposed war postage charge will 'produce approximately £1,000,000 of additional revenue annually. adjourned. WAYS AND MEANS. (Grievance Hay.) Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into a Committee of Ways and Means-resolve d in the negative.

Some confusion seems to exist in the mindsof honourable gentlemen opposite concerning the attitude of the Australian Labour party oil the subject of the employment of Australian troops in overseas theatres of war. Prior to June, 1940, during all material times, the plank of the Australian Labour party's platform relating to this subject, read as follows:No raising of forces for service outside the Commonwealth, or participation, or promise of participation, in any future overseas war except by decision of the people. In June, 1940, a federal conference of the Australian Labour party decided by a majority of delegates to qualify that provision in the following terms:Necessary provision for reinforcement of the Australian Imperial Force Divisions, the extent of European participation by volunteer army to be determined by circumstances as they arise, ha.ving regard to the paramount necessity of Australia's defence. "" Having regard to the paramount necessity of Australia's defence,"" I have always with due deference to the decision of the party to which I belong, and of which I bave been a loyal member for many years, had a personal preference for tlie proin .mind the state of the war and our circumstances generally, and having regard also to the fact that Australian soldiers had already been recruited and enlisted for service overseas, and were actually serving abroad, a majority of the delegates at the 1940 conference decided to amend the provision as I have indicated. I do not criticize their decision, but I have never wavered in my personal view that the paramount necessity of Australia's defence made it undesirable to enlist soldiers for service in overseas wars.

I have never presumed to criticize the actions of the British Government, or the operations of the British fleet anywhere, but I have more than once criticized Australian Governments for having sanctioned, and, indeed, insisted upon, the Australian Navy taking part in a variety of foreign adventures, which, it seemed to me, imperilled, or tended to imperil, the safety of Australia and to embroil us needlessly with countries with which we were on entirely friendly terms. In one of those speeches, made some years before the outbreak of the war, I intimated that the participation of the Australian Navy with the British navy in quarrels in which more adequate payment to the soldiers we Australians had no part, was entirely undesirable. On Friday last, the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) seized upon certain statements made in such circumstances in order grossly to misrepresent my views and to say that I had referred in disparaging and indeed contemptuous terms to the British navy, 'which, of course, I have never done. Having heard the honourable gentleman's personal explanation to-day-that is, as much as I could hear of it owing to the general laughter which accompanied his admissions that he had misread a part of my speech-and having heard, alsounder similar conditions-hi s admission that there was no justification whatever for the language which he used in respect of myself, I beg to assure him that I accept his apology. I shall let it go at that. the honourable gentleman, and I did not apologize to him. unique experience of having had two budgets placed before us within as many months. Not often do we have such a feast of reason and a flow of soul as two budgets in as many months, if we are to consider as a budget speech the revision of the present Treasurer. The Government showed wisdom in having accepted the framework of what may be described as the Eadden budget. It had to present a financial statement hot upon its accession to office; and, as the business of the country is urgent and highly important, the Treasurer acted rightly in conveying to the committee and the country the assurance that a considered Labour budget will be presented at a later stage. I am happy to be able to congratulate the Government so early upon its having wisely been persuaded to accept the gratuitous and unsolicited advice-if I may so put it-whic h I gave a few weeks ago. In that short address, I said that I should be very disappointed indeed if the Government failed to make good the promises in respect of invalid and old-age pensions which were made by the Prime Minister when Leader of the Opposition, and if the honourable gentleman failed to fulfill his promise of and their dependants. I indicated, also, that we should look forward hopefully to the underpaid sections of the community being relieved of a burden which their incomes do not qualify them to bear. The Government proposes to make good at an early dateI hope that it will be a very early date-Labou r policy in relation to invalid and old-age pensions. In the present financial statement, it has made abundantly clear its intention not to saddle the underpaid with excessive taxes, and that the soldiers and their dependants will receive a greater reward, totally inadequate it is true, but at least much more nearly approximating to justice than did the proposal of its predecessor in office. I submitted, in that short address, that the Government should have regard to placing first things first. As I view the matter, the basic necessities of our civil population must be a first charge on the resources of the nation. I know that there are those who say that, putting first things first, we must first win the war. If we are to win the war by doing gross injustice to the most defenceless and deserving members of our civil population, then we shall win it disgracefully, and inevitably the ideals that we have set before us, so far as we have stated them in this war, must be defeated. It was in connection with the raising of the",19,Budget 1941 42 Revised

83,Mr Brennan,"We have had themoney for this purpose that I submitted also that regard should be had rather to the total value of the security of Australia as a whole, and of our productive capacity, than to the artificial balancing of budgets-which , I fear, is a fetish that we sometimes -pursue with too little realism and too little regard for our paramount obligations. For what purpose are wars fought? They are not fought by soldiers for soldiers; the soldiers themselves would be the last to claim that. They are certainly not fought for the convenience of politicians, or for tlie purpose of keeping nice people in nice jobs. As I understand the position, wars are fought, by democracies at any rate, in order to maintain an ordered system of Government, according to justice, and are based upon a democratic theory. This means that they are fought for the civil population, and in the first place for those members of the civil population whose need is the greatest. The sick, the aged, their large numbers of dependants and relatives, and the underpaid-'thes e are the persons for whom, in the first place, wars have to be fought; and if , in the fighting of the present war, these persons are starved or misused, or die through ill usage, we shall have lost the war in advance. I know, of course, that this is idealism rather than realism; but if we run away from our ideals, we run away from the last excuse that we have for waging war. I have read in the financial statement of the Treasurer that Labour's war policy is to extend the war effort to the maximum degree, by using all unemployed who are physically fit, and by diverting labour and resources from civil to war purposes in order to meet the balance of the requirements. With great respect to my friend the Treasurer, I cannot help thinking that, without economic conscription, and conscription of man-power, this statement of Labour's war policy is largely a matter of wishful thinking, if I may be pardoned for using that hackneyed expression. Nevertheless, I am glad to know that the Government isirrevocably, I hope-pledge d against both economic conscription and conscription of man-power for overseas service; or, so far as I am concerned, for service anywhere. I venture a word of warning on the subject of a maximum war effort. It has always seemed to me that since the war is, of necessity, a wasteful operation on the most liberal construction of any theory of national credit, if it lasts long enough our resources must inevitably become exhausted. Even though we start with an overflowing bucket, if more be taken from it than goes into it, inevitably it must become empty. When we speak of a maximum war effort, and of diverting men and still more men from what are called non-essential services to war purposes, we admit that our present policy is to take out of the bucket more than we pour into it. In my humble view of the situation, this war promises to be a long, not a short, one. Indeed, the indications are much more favorable to a long war to-day than they were in the earliest stages, two years ago, and I have noted with some disquiet the observation, attributed to General Blamey, who is visiting us from afar, that we can hardly hope for victory without American support. That statement seems to indicate that the late Government distributed to various European countries guarantees to which it was unable to give effect. In fact, we have not been able materially to advantage any one of the countries to which the late Government gave guarantees. I say nothing about the present Government in this regard; it has been far too short a time in office. I speak of those who handled the situation in the beginning, and pledged Australia to an unlimited war effort. The conclusion I draw is simply this: We should consider as a part of the budget the estimated length of the period of the war, and especially we should consider the objects which we have in view-ou r war objectives. Otherwise, the budget cannot possibly be either an intelligent )or a)n iintelligible document. Many changes have taken place, and very many confusing issues have arisen, since last a statement was made in this regard by the head of the British Government, and then it was in a very indefinite and, if I may say so with respect, a somewhat rhetorical way. Certainly, no statement, so far as I know, has ever heen made from the point of view of Australia as a self-governing nation, and I look forward with great interest to a declaration defining the attitude of the present Government upon this point. I naturally expect that, consistent with the history of the great Australian Labour party, a statement will be made by the Government early in the New Year of what our war aims really are. I remember with some pride that, during the last war, the Labour party was active in the matter of what was then called a negotiated peace. Although it incurred, as people always do incur who entertain or express sane views regarding waT, much odium, and much rhetorical abuse and much newspaper vituperation, tlie fact remains that, had the views of Labour then prevailed, it seems more than probable that that war, with all its disastrous consequences, might have ended sooner, and also-whic h is much more to tlie point-the present war might have been rendered unnecessary. I put this matter, not from the point of view of the Commonwealth of Nations, not from the point of view of our friends in Britain or of the British Government, but from the point of view of Australia. Australia is a self-governing country. Nobody challenges its right to complete self-determination. Australia itself has given pledges of support to foreign countries. Australia itself has undertaken, through the late Government as its spokesman, to set Europe in order, to restore the independence of countries, ill get? She, too, will purchase a little defined as they were, with all the complications arising from their religious, sectional, and national animosities. It is a giant task for a nation so small in population and occupying so vast a tract of the world's surface. The budget points out that the diversion of labour and resources to war production will reduce the volume of non-essential goods available for civil consumption. Well, as to the wages fund , that state1 ment seems to be true, but as the wages fund is now very high-the Hughes) would say too high-and pensions are to be increased, as well as the wages and allowances of soldiers and their dependants, it seems to me to follow that there must necessarily be an increased demand for a smaller quantity of goods. In these circumstances, I am led Mr Brennan. to wonder how the Government is going to face the task of keeping down prices. Certainly, it cannot be done through the operations of a Prices Commissioner who will readily point out to the Government the inevitability of the elementary economic law that, the demand being increased and the supply of goods being less, prices must rise. Reference is made in the budget to non-essential goods, and in this statement the Treasurer has adopted the language used by his predecessor as a convenient form of description. What are these non-essential goods? They are, apparently, goods not manufactured or purchased for distinctly war purposes. It is terribly ironical to suggest that non-essential goods, if that is what is meant by the term, are not. to be purchased or manufactured. What does the old-age pensioner buy? What will he purchase with the few more shillings which he may hope to receive? I presume he will purchase the right to have a roof over his head in order to keep the rain off, and he will purchase such meagre supplies of clothing and of necessary articles of food as arc required to keep body and soul together. I presume that that is how his money will be spent in the future, just as, in the vast majority of cases, it was spent in the past. What will the soldier's wife buy with the few extra shillings she will more, it may be-it cannot be very much more-of the necessaries of life. She may be able to add a little more to the comfort of herself and her children. Even the wage-earner whose wages are increased will use them, for the most part, to pay off accumulated debts. If he is a member of the aristocracy of labour, he has probably paid a deposit on a home which he is trying to purchase. Yet' those things which will be used to keep t.he blood of the aged invalid in circulation, and to pay the debts of the worker, are said to be non-essential! It may be honourable that even a provident worker who is trying to buy a home will deceive himself. History bas a way of repeating itself. After the war, the value of securities will shrink and wages will fall, and those great buttresses of civil liberty, the trading banks, will step in and take possession of the wage-earner's home in",20,Budget 1941 42 Revised
84,Member For Wakefield ( Mr Duncan,"precisely the same way as they did in the past. The honourable member for Wakefield seemed to deplore any increase of wages. He puts it that if the workers have the money, they will spend it. There seems to be some difference of opinion between him and me as to how they 'will spend it . He suggests that they will waste it. I suggest that they will use it, aud, perhaps, lose it, on trying to acquire But the truth is that the mortgagees of the necessaries of life. The honourable member hints that they will waste the money on amusements, or on the purchase of those ordinary amenities which, in the case of a man with ample resources aud moderate tastes such as, I understand, he is himself, are commonplace, and of a kind which the honourable member would not think for a moment of depriving himself in time of war. soldiers in Tobruk have not many amenities now! member for Wakefield is a self-confessed conscriptionist. But does he favour the conscription of the wealth of the rich? ""For the workers he seems to favour service and death at comimand. Apparently they are only cattle. If that be so, their Their success depends upon the extent to women folk are breeders of cattle. True, they must be stabled and fed like other cattle; but if there is to be no idealism, no conscience, no soul, no individual right, no religious tradition and no Christian theory, wages, high or low^are for them superfluous. Surely those things which I have last mentioned must be regarded at the best as non-essential goods. The honourable member for Wakefield spoke of the grudge which, he suggests, is entertained by supporters of the Government against the rich, whom he describes as the "" successful section of the community"". My own view is that, not necessarily in every case but in the great majority of cases, wealth can usually be traced to a poisonous root. It originates usually in an offence against charity and justice. Honourable members should study the position in Great Britain, against which it has with such irross untruthfulness been said that I have unfriendly feelings; whereas in fact, my unfriendliness is directed only against tlie mortgagees and the money grubbers whose iron heel has squeezed out of the teeming masses of Britain everything but their bare existence. To-day, it is confidently stated that the mortgagees of Britain do not number more than eighteen. They are the landowners; tlieir number may be increased by a considerable group of industrial magnates who have sprung up in more recent years. Britain, and of this country, have been not successful but lucky. They inherited wealth; they did not earn it. They secured wealth, not because of any conspicuous service to the country, but because they happened to be the sons of their fathers. In this country, accession of wealth was usually the result of a lucky accident. Men who gained riches because they succeeded through being just and fair are extremely few in number. Because of this fact, I think that the Government has acted most wisely in imposing additional taxes upon the rich. A budget is made up of matters of fact, law and speculation. The taxation proposals of the Government are a matter of fact. Taxation is policy supported by law. Loans, upon which governments largely depend, are a matter of speculation. which they are taken up by volunteers. [Extension of time graauted.J Generally speaking, loans are made sufficiently attractive to ensure their success. An investor is offered suflicient reward to induce him to subscribe to them. But whilst he draws interest upon his investment, he subscribes to the doctrine of compulsory military service for the worker. This is a war budget; our "" a l l "" is to be put into the war effort, subject to one important qualification. Some things, I should not be prepared to give away even in order to win the war. Oldfashioned people would court death itself rather than imitate practices which are attributed to the enemy. Many people are more deeply concerned with what they take out of the war than with what they put into it. To my knowledge, patriots who enriched themselves in the last war bought into representative positions and every year paid out of their profiteering fund a certain sum in order to hold those positions.",22,Budget 1941 42 Revised
85,Mr Duncan,HUG HES -The Australian,23,Budget 1941 42 Revised
86,Mr Brennan,"The honorableApparently that is democracy at its best, and democracy is a wonderful thing! Regarding the problem of man-power, I desire to utter a word of friendly warning. The Government is committed to the voluntary system. If the successful prosecution of the war depends upon man-power, and it is to be fought in any theatre that may be chosen for us without the consent of the Australian people, it is perfectly obvious that the continuance of the policy of reinforcing our troops abroad may very well lead to a dearth of man-power. Indeed, experts now declare that the problem is acute. As each man has to decide for himself whether he should fight in foreign countries, it must necessarily be pure speculation whether our "" a l l "" in human flesh and blood will be given. Some uninformed people might ask me at this stage whether I favour conscription. The answer is in the negative. It has been in the negative for many years. I have even gone so far as to say that if I were a younger man and representatives of the ""press-gang"" attempted to seize me for the purpose of making me fight on foreign battlefields at dictation and under authority other than of those responsible to the people of the country, I should consider myself bound to resist them by force. That is my view of conscription for service outside Australia. I am also opposed to conscription within Australia, but for different reasons. We must analyse the minds of the men of Australia to whom the appeal to enlist is made. Many Australians naturally recall Greece, Crete and other theatres of war, stories of lack of equipencouragement in the carrying out of that ment, and of Australians who were not given a fair chance. Indeed, they need not go beyond members of the present Government for most solemn evidence to confirm them in the view that the Australian Imperial Force has been misused in foreign lands, that the troops have been ill-equipped and ill-supported, and that they were not given a fair chance. Some also wonder why they are required to fight against nations with whom they have no quarrel. recall the invasion by the Allies of Iran and Syria. Before the Labour party Mr Brennan. took office they also had in mind the poor provision for the dependants of soldiers and the poor reward for military service. Finally, some consider that theirs is not the responsibility for settling the turmoil in Europe. So they might not enlist in the numbers desired, or according to plan. I ask the Government to bear those facts in mind if Ministers conceive it to be a part of their duty to stimulate the enlistment of troops for foreign service. The theatres of war must also be carefully chosen by the Government. If they are to be scattered, as they were during the regime of the previous Government, over the surface of Europe and the near East, the drain upon Australian manhood must necessarily be excessive, and gravely to the detriment of the interests of the country. Nevertheless, if the Government fails to bear that in mind and if reinforcements required for the troops overseas are not forthcoming, it will be presented with a very difficult problem. I am far from suggesting bhat, in any circumstances, the Government will depart from the pledge which it gave with such celerity and, I think, sincerity against compulsion for overseas service; but, whilst I acquit the Government of being insincere in that matter, it does follow that a difficult situation will be created if Australians fight in all of those widespread theatres of war. not intend to make the budget a subject on which to abuse the Government. It has a colossal task before it and I , with all honourable members on this side of the committee, intend to give to it every task. The budget has already been debated at length by more able speakers than I , and I am content to accept the facts and figures which have been presented by honourable members on this side of the committee with more analytical minds than mine; but I cannot let pass the opportunity to comment upon the two major departures made in this budget from the Fadden budget, namely, immediate, instead of deferred increases, They and the abandonment of compulsory loans, both of which were, to my mind, commendable features. After the war,",23,Budget 1941 42 Revised
87,Mr Collins (Hume) [4.16],"I dodoubtless, there will be a stage of transition in which the production of munitions will give way to the production of peace-time requirements and not only munition workers but also returned soldiers will be looking for work. The accumulated deferred pay that would have been available to the returned soldiers, had the principle of deferred pay been accepted by Parliament, would be a bidwark in t)he re-establishment of the returned men. The worth of deferred pay was well established after the last war. Men occupying bigh positions today have told me that they owed their re-establishment in civil life to the money and not stacked, and must remain so until which had been available to them on their return from the last war. I hope Shat in framing the supplementary budget, which the Government intends to introduce in the new year, it will will give further consideration to the matter and decide to accept the principle of deferred pay. I concede the need for dependants of soldiers to receive their marshall all of our resources of men, allowances in full without any money being withheld for payment after the war, because, no doubt, they require the money now in order to buy the necessaries of life, but Uhat does not hold true member advocate the standardization of in respect of the soldiers, because what they were paid in actual cash in the last war was sufficient for their requirements, and great benefit was derived by them from the accumulation of deferred pay. Compulsory loans can be likened to the superannuation payments which are made by public servants and also by many employees in private industry. Many people will not save of their own volition, but when, either at the suggestion of an employer or by compulsion, they have put £10 or £20 into a savings account they make a prisoner of every shilling on which they can lay their hands in order to increase their savings against the day when they pass out of industry into retirement. This Government has rejected the principle of compulsion in savings and is pinning its faith to tihe voluntary system. I hope fchat its expectations will be fully realized, but I have grave doubts that they will. I even doubt whether the people will put all of the money required into the £100,000,000 war and conversion loan which is now being raised, but, unless the public will lend its savings either voluntarily or compulsorily to the Government this country cannot expect to prosecute the war to the full extent of its capacity. I go so far as to say that a 100 per cent, war effort cannot be made by Australia until the Government has taken complete control of all man-power, wealth and resources of this country. For instances of how the Governments failure to take control over man-power is having detrimental results, one has only to go to the rural districts and see the result of the lack of labour in the harvest fields, where hay is lying cut the wheat is threshed and the men are released from military camps. If necessary, in order to regiment Australia's man-power, the Government ought to standardize wages so that there will be no running from one industry to anothev in search of more lucrative posts. Whatever government be in power, the necessity to money and materials will have to be resolutely faced. profits 1 profits if my advocacy be followed. I am sure that the Minister assisting the Treasurer would see to that. One instance of the way in which men are being drafted into military service without reference to national needs is the fact that men, possessing the rare qualities which enable them successfully to breed Clydesdale horses, Shorthorn cattle and Corriedale and Merino sheep of the right types, have been sent to camp and forced to leave their stud farms at the mercy of the world. I agree that these men should be trained militarily, because they are of the type from which the best soldiers come, but, before being sent to camp, they should be given the opportunity to train someone to replace them on their farms while they are in camp. The success of a stud farm depends on its master, and the only men who are capable of successfully managing places where stud stock is bred are those who are expert and able to visualize the types of animals that are required for particular purposes.",24,Budget 1941 42 Revised

Tbe Minister for the Army( Mr Eorde) said that the Army, Navy and Air Force were at a high standard of efficiency. The Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) announced thai Australians need not think that, in the event of hostilities, they would starve, because provision had been made for the distribution throughout the length and breadth of Australia, of sufficient food to last at least six months. Those are glowing tributes to the last. Administration, and they reflect the greatest credit, on the Ministers of the Menzies and Fadden Governments who had charge of Service departments and other departments associated with the conduct of the war, and who ensured that Australia's forces would be ready to meet any attack launched against us, and that Stocks of food would be available to feed the people in any emergency. The present. Government is building on the foundations laid by its predecessor. This is understandable because, when in Opposition, some of the members of the Labour party were on the Advisory War Council and learned many of t.he. functions of the Government. With the experience so gained they arc able to fro on to prosecute the war to our full capacity. The rate of invalid and old-age pensions is to be increased and. a further increase has been foreshadowed. With that I have no quarrel. Indeed, I commend the Government for its decision to help to meet the needs of the unfortunate aged and invalid members of the community. ignored them. the Government provoke me I am driven to point out that this is the first occasion is attractive to people who want to have on which the Labour party has ever increased the rate of the invalid and old age pensions, although it has had many opportunities to do so. The invalid and old-age pensioners would have received an increase of their pension as the result of the increased cost of living, but in its budget proposals the Government bas anticipated further increases of the cost of necessaries of life. Before this war ends every section of the community will be called upon to hear real sacrifices, not sacrifices brought about by rationing of petrol, or paying heavier taxes, but sacrifices which may prove to be comparable with those which have been made in bomb and shelltorn England, where, in some areas, for two years women have done little more than weep and. pray, where men have not laughed, nor children romped and played. So far the only people in this country who have made sacrifices, apart from those who have gone to the war, are those who have suffered bereavements. If we are ever forced to make such sacrifices we shall have reason to talk of our war effort. But until that time comes, if it must come, let us get on with the work of government, and bear the burdens that are imposed upon us, even though the taxes take the last copper piece from our pockets. I have heard various plans expounded for raising money for the war effort, including fantastic proposals for the creation of money by the use of the printing press. I cannot understand why men subscribe to such views. In order to produce money we must have assets created by our own labour. Wool, wheat, butter, and other primary products are realizable assets; even physical strength can be used to produce the credit necessary for a livelihood. If everybody subscribed to the belief that money can be created merely by printing notes, we should live in a most remarkable sort of world. If we could have money without producing wool, wheat, butter, or other commodities, or the endowment payments without bavins; children, and. so on, we should have our pockets full of useless £1 notes, but our stomachs would be empty.

Many people believe that all of the shares in such' big concerns as the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, and the financial institutions, are held by only a few people. That is not true. Intelligent men, who watch the share market, are aware that people often invest from £250 to £500 in the shares of such concerns. Very many people have invested their savings in this way in order that, as the result of the sound administrative methods of the companies, they may secure a fair return on their small capital, which they may have saved with great difficulty. We have heard recently many statements by men who have come from the theatre of war in the Middle East. Sir Thomas Blamey has told us lihat the morale of our troops is very high.

ColUns. quer them. If other nations sincerely wish to live in peace with us in the Pacific, let them say so and prove their intentions. Japan is on the wrong side to-day. It was announced recently that Japan demands the right of unrestricted migration to all countries. That is something that we cannot tolerate in White Australia. We want to live at peace with the Japanese people and trade with them. But their conception of life differs fundamentally from ours; their religions, traditions, and standards of living are as far removed from ours as is the sun from the earth. It is better for them and for us that we should never try to live together as one people. We have a colossal task ahead of us, and it is the duty of all Australians to come closer together, in a spirit of patriotism, in order to help the Government in the great work on which it is engaged. While the war clouds hover over us, and while we live almost in the shadow of paganism, deeds of barbarism are being perpetrated everywhere by a nation which seeks world dominion. In such circumstances it is imperative that we come together as a great Australian nation, and endeavour to emulate the deeds of our forefathers, who fought causing great anxiety. The another form of war in the early days of settlement in Australia, when they set out to explore and develop our country and to lay the foundations of the great pastoral and agricultural industries which we possess to-day. They made the position far brighter for us, because they bore severe trials in the vast wildernesses which they entered. Their manifold privations have made this world a better place for us to live in. Their main object in life was to achieve success in the interests of their fellow men. It should therefore be our objective to follow honorably in their course and to promote, as they did, the numbers, the wealth, and the happiness of our people. Consequently I sincerely hope that the Government will put its best foot forward and make a truly statesmanlike effort to keep the ing consideration to the budget now before us, I invite attention to the followdiers are not receiving too much by any ing significant statement made by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) :Tlie Government intends to review the budget position as a whole early in the New Year and to bring down a supplementary budget to provide any additional finance that of our fighting services who have volunmay be required in a rapidly changing war situation. That statement makes it evident, in my opinion, that the provisions which we are now considering should be regarded only as the first step along the path of inescapold-age pension is small, but it will mean able obligations which we must tread in order to carry through the programme necessary to achieve victory. In these circumstances, I do not intend to offer any objection to the taxation proposals of the Government, or to make any suggestions of additional possible sources of revenue. I feel sure that the Treasurer will be well aware of every possible source to which I might direct attention, and will undoubtedly draw upon such sources when the need to do so arises. I congratulate the Treasurer upon having introduced the revised budget within such a short period of having assumed office. The chief items of the budget commented upon by honourable members are the increases of the rates of pay for soldiers and their dependants, the increase of the rate of invalid and old-age pension, and the effects of the Government's taxation proposals. I shall refer first to the increases of soldiers' pay. When .these increases become operative, it will be the first occaing from wealthy people money which sion since the commencement of the war, on which the pay of our soldiers, including deferred pay and allowances for a dependent wife and one child-that is the whole family group-wil l have exceeded the basic wage and then only by about Is. a day. The total amount is not, of course, being paid in cash. The soldiers will now receive 17s. 6d. a week. man including the value of quarters, clothing, and the like? receive £3 6s. 6d. a week. I admit that the soldiers get their keep and also their uniforms and equipment, but in comparison with the earnings of those who remain in safe occupations at home, and whose wages are adjusted according to fluctuations of the cost of living, our solstandard of judgment. Of the total amount of £4 4s. a week payable to a soldier with a wife and one child, 14s. will accrue as deferred pay. I do not think that any one will say that members tarily offered themselves to fight for this country are receiving too much from a grateful country. The increase of the rate of invalid and that this class of the community will be able to purchase a few items that are not included in the cost of living bracket, and so will be a little better off. The granting of this increase of the pension ra-te has been termed a political act. I prefer to call it a charitable or humane act, because I believe that the underlying motive which inspired the increase is benevolent. I accept the increase of the rate of tax on incomes in excess of £1,500 a year as an indication that the Government intends to go ahead fearlessly with a plan that will convince the community that a real state of emergency exists. The privilege of being hit first is one that the wealthy class of the community should welcome. It will be a much easier task later to place a heavier load of tax on persons in the lower income ranges, if they are convinced that this is necessary, now that steps have been taken to set an example by obtainwould otherwise be expended on luxuries. It would be of no use whatever to try to convince a man who has no surplus that he should make a real sacrifice while men more fortunately placed have not suffered any curtailment of their spending in respect of their ordinary habits and comforts. The higher tax on high incomes is correctly placed as the first shot in a campaign to transfer spending power from the excessive consumption of domestic goods, which is undoubtedly a stumbling block in Australia's war programme at the moment. The blanketing of the whole population with their portion of the loan cannot be avoided, in my opinion, as the war develops. The Government, I am sure,",27,Budget 1941 42 Revised

96,Mr Coles,"The wife and child willrecognizes this fact. The Treasurer has also visualized it, and desires to hold himself in a position of readiness to meet such a situation. If the higher tax on the top bracket of incomes has the effect of awakening the spirit of the whole nation to the needs of the situation, I believe that the wealthy people of the community will be the first to thank the Government for its courage in tackling the problem in the proper way. The effect of the proposed new company tax will be severe. The plight of some proprietary companies, under the new taxation, may be described as a "" hangover "" following tlie war-time company tax introduced last year. has no relation to increased profits made .as a result of the war. The legislation introduced a new principle in taxation, which was not based on equity, for it totally ignored the fact that the shares of large companies are sold on the market and are valued according to their earning power. By and large, the return from them approximates an average that is represented by their market price. The legislation can be accepted only as a revenue producing .measure, and not as a proper tax on war profits. Its worse feature is that it assures to monopolistic aggregations of capital immunity from the danger of new competition by checking the growth of new enterprises which develop or grow chiefly from the reinvestment of earnings in other businesses. It takes no heed of the fact that different types of businesses carry vastly different ratios of stocks to sales, and it places a big premium on the investment of capital by companies in freehold properties and buildings, which are normally lowenrning securities. The incidence of this tax on private companies was proved to be so unjust that the committee set up last year to consider it could find no solution whatever, other than the elimination of private companies from its provisions, and the treating of them as partnerships for taxation purposes, but leaving them subject to the ordinary flat rate of company tax. With the increase of the rate of personal income tax to 200d. in the f l , there are now companies which claim that they will be liable to taxes in excess of 20s. fixing of a percentage of margin on each in the f l which, of course, is an imposMr Coles. sible situation. I suggest to the Treasurer that he introduce an amendment of the War-time (Company) Tax Act to ensure that in no case will the combined State and Pederal taxes on any part of the taxable income exceed the highest rate applicable to personal income under the Income Tax Act; that rate is a little under ISs. in the £1. present giving consideration to that matter. whole subject of company taxation be reviewed in the light of the flucThat tax tuations caused in the value of shares by the proposals submitted in the budget. It would be more equitable to increase the flat rate on all profits of companies, however high the rate might be, in order to yield the desired amount. Such a policy would give the same percentage of reduction on all shares and would be just to the investors in all companies. I am not opposed to a high company tax as a wartime measure to produce revenue. The Government must, of course, obtain the revenue it needs from where the money lies. It is true that the ability of persons or companies to subscribe to loans will be impaired by high taxation, but, from the Government point of view, the position will be improved because there will be no interest bill to meet on taxation and no liability of repayment. The Government, of course, can get the money only once. In the interests of the TreasuryI wish to make some remarks on price control. Our price-fixing legislation is administered through the Department of Trade and Customs. So far it has been well administered. The procedure is obtaining tardy but nevertheless well-deserved praise from its first enemies, the people of the commercial world. The control has been directed to the prevention of unnecessary increases of price and the prevention of excess profits. The strength of t.he administration lies in the fixation and maintenance of a firm policy on which those affected-the manufacturers, merchants and traders-ca n regulate their operations with security and confidence. The policy should aim at the item or class of goods. It should be an",29,Budget 1941 42 Revised

98,Mr Coles,"I also suggest that theoffence to infringe this margin, and offences should be liable to suitable penalties. policy be advantageous to those who are n51e to buy on a very large scale? of control would govern that. If , because of larger sales, au enterprise showed an increased net profit at the end of a trading period, but had observed stipulated conditions strictly, to brand those engaged in the enterprise as profiteers would be unfair. The Treasury should welcome the extra profit as a field of taxation, and the Prices Commissioner should review the margins with the object of adjustment in the next trading period. Such a policy would give confidence to traders and merchants and would prevent the repetition of the happenings in June of this year, when large advertisements in our big cities resulted in the disposal of goods at low prices in order to enable traders to avoid unwanted profits, which, according to a press statement, wore to be regarded as evidence of profiteering. The result of that policy was an orgy of spending that robbed the Treasury of much taxable income, and diverted money from the purchase of war savings certificates and from savings. This was no advantage to the war effort. By attempting to co-relate gross and net profits, without a very large staff, the Prices Commissioner runs counter to the Government's stated policy to reduce spending and to divert savings to war purposes. The solution is to exercise control by a simple, direct form, which should be reviewed from time to time in order to prevent excesses, and to welcome into the Treasury any windfalls, in the way of excess profits which may be taxed. The approach to the problem of the diversion of man-power to war services and war industries, in the light of the situation of our war effort at the moment, must be positive, and be based on the principle (ihat no sacrifice is too great if it means the difference between saving and losing our country. We must reinforce our fighting forces, both at home aud abroad. These commitments must be met; and the Government has pledged itself to meet them. It is stated that 120)000 men a year will be needed for the Australian Imperial Force alone. It is not a secret that more than 100,000 new not such a workers will be required for transfer to government war factories during this financial year, if those factories are to be brought into full production. Then there is the ever-expanding war work in other factories and enterprises, under all sorts of contracts with the Government for the various needs of our operations. Arrangement have to be made for an increase of substitute fuels aud metals, shipbuilding, homes for the workers, and one hundred and one other matters. With industry working at full pressure throughout the country, with ""men wanted"" signs in every establishment, where is this extra man-power to be obtained? The Prime Minister has forecast that it will be transferred by means of rationing. That is right. But I wonder whether the implications are quite understood? The transfer and training of those workers will result in a lessening of tlie production of goods for civil consumption, and this will probably entail the grouping of many industries if rights are to be maintained and economies are to be effected. Any rationing scheme will need to be carried a good deal farther than a mere limitation of sales, as was done with petrol, the poor unfortunates who were hit being left to fend for themselves; it must be scientifically approached, if definitely known numbers of men and women, whose welfare during the process will be the responsibility of the Government, are to be released for transfer and training. The first line of rationing has been proceeding for many months and is represented by those industries which have been affected because their supplies of materials have been diverted to war production. In many instances, compensation has been obtained by th ose affected, in that they have received defence orders. But the deliberate transfer of workers is akin to industrial conscription; it is conscription of industry, and will be accepted in a very much better spirit if the Government can assure the industries affected that the workers will not be engaged in profit-making activities for other private employers. In this connection, the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman),",30,Budget 1941 42 Revised

100,Mr Coles,"Not at all; the methodsand his colleagues on the production executive, will have a real job and not an easy one. It is not a bit of good "" to talk turkey and act rabbit"". Many large industries which are partly engaged in the manufacture of war goods would be capable of a much greater outlook if their were wholly devoted to this work. At present, war work and domestic orders follow each other through the machines in the engineering shops, and the continual change over from one operation to another causes tremendous delays. I have seen work of major importance in factories held up in order to make way for the needs of civil industry. If we are to obtain the results which will be required in order to win the war, a thoroughly controlled and directed production effort must be substituted for the present system in private factories. I am not criticizing government because already they are working on that basis. Civil orders must be removed from the line of war work, which must be put through on a continuous run, being reduced to process work wherever that is possible in order to achieve mass production. The treatment that is meted out to those industries that are rationed will have to be applied also to those which are engaged on war work. Industry will need to be grouped, and work will have to be allotted in order to ensure the most economic production. equipment must be set up, if that will effect better operation. The interests of trade marks, trade connexions, and trade names, will need to be protected. All of that can be overcome if the job is tackled according to a straight-line policy by agreement. whether we are at war nationally or individually. in our assertion that we want an all-in war effort, the Government cannot avoid assuming control and responsibility. Individuals as well as industries will have to forgo rights. The production executive set up must be sure at all times of all the factors, and must be certain that it has materials, plants, power, transport and men. Then, with the continuity of demand which the war effort can provide, what is considered impossible could be taken in our stride. We Mr Coles. are not lacking in ability. Mr Essington Lewis and his associates have given ample proof that they have the necessary imagination and drive. The weakness of the whole set-up lies entirely in lack of control, and that can be overcome only by the Government, which has the necesoperations sary power. There are two other matters to which I should like to refer. The first is the need for greater encouragement to be given to the development of the second line of defence in Australia represented by the Volunteer Defence Corps, the Civil Protection Service-betterr known as A i r Raid Precautions-and the Women's Voluntary Services, which have become the Women's Auxiliary Forces. I appeal to the Government fully to recognize these bodies. If they be given equipment, enthusiastic co-operation, and regular training exercises in conjunction factories, with the regular forces, they can be built into a very valuable second line of defence capable of meeting an emergency. They should not be ignored. A t present, they are a little "" on the outer"". If they can be brought to feel that they are a pant of the show, the interest and goodwill of the whole of the community in our war effort will be increased. The second matter refers to the development of the mental attitude of the general public of Australia towards the national effort. Enormous tasks face New plants or Australia at present, and they can be accomplished successfully only with Che willing and enthusiastic support of the whole nation. As I stated earlier, this can be obtained if the people are convinced that it is necessary to make the effort. General Sir Thomas Blamey, The whole question is immediately upon his arrival in Australia, remarked upon the lack of If we are genuine interest in the war effort which was obvious to him.. There are many other pointers in that direction. The recruiting figures, the record attendances at race meetings, the predominance of sporting news in the daily newspapers, even the debates in this chamber, point to the one thing-the mind of the people has not been brought to the stage of believing that this country is in imminent danger. This state of affairs has been brought about largely by the way in which news is presented in the daily newspapers. I know that they publish the news in the form in which they receive it ; but they receive it at all times in a form which is silver-lined. Eeading the newspapers, we are led to believe that there is in Russia something between us and the enemy which is likely to develop into a 3econd "" China incident"", which will keep the enemy and the danger away from us for many years to come; whereas amy intelligent mind realizes that we have not yot held back the stream which is flowing against us. A really big job here awaits the Department of Information. It could present the bare truth. I do not say that the nation need be frightened. truth, and would respond to it. The actual facts should be given. We should not be told, as we were this morning, that Germany claims a victory in the 30Uth in order to divert the eyes of the world from the fact that it is being beaten in the north. The world knows nothing of what is happening. It forms its opinions merely on the reports which are "" cooked up"" for presentation over the radio from Moscow, Stockholm and other centres. Unfortunately, the defeats of the enemy which have been announced from time to time have rarely materialized. The Department of Information could organize a campaign for the education of the people of Australia to the position which actually exists. It could tell the people that the enemy we are facing is a youthful enemy, which has been raised in the last two decades; that it has been imbued with hate for us, and that we shall have to deal with it for many years to come. It has been trained away from religion, and its mind is filled with the "" K u l t u r "" of other cases, the gratuity bonds and incredible brutality. Somewhere, sometime, this force must be stopped by a superior force, and the only people caj>Scheme. Then the depression came, the able of exerting that superior force are those of the British Empire, in association with those of the United States of America. If we are able to impress that fact on the people of Australia we may be able to bring about in their minds something that was not present in the minds of the people of any nation in Europe, namely, a realization of the danger before they were overrun. We can achieve what occurred in England when the bombs were droppinga spiritual reaction that inspired the people to bend their energies to a national effort instead of concentrating upon selfish interests. If we can do that, we shall have a foundation upon which to build a winning war effort, and the people will accept, the inconveniences and sacrifices necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion. listening to the honourable member for Henty( Mr Ooles) deliver his impartial and approving survey of the budget, I feel inclined to compliment him, particularly as he is reputed to be among those Australia can take the who will have the privilege, as he put it, of being the first to be hit. I agree with him that it should be regarded by wealthy people as a privilege to be the first to make a contribution towards the national war effort. What do we find, however? Many honourable members opposite, who represent wealthy interests, and who themselves, perhaps, possess a large share of this world's good things, are the first to grumble about increased taxes, and to say that the poor should be taxed. I am glad that the Government proposes to tax those who can best afford to pay. I am also pleased that the soldiers have had their pay increased, and that the Government saw fit to abolish the system of deferred pay which was in operation during the last war. I remember that, when the soldiers received their deferred' pay and their gratuity bonds, they were freely exploited by merchants and insurance companies. In stead of the deferred pay being of any benefit to them, it merely helped some men towards destruction. In deferred pay went towards the purchase of a home under the War Service Homes soldiers were unable to keep up their payments, and the War Services Homes Department threw thousands of them out into the streets. Even to-day, many who were allowed to remain in their homes, have not yet overtaken the arrears of rent which accumulated during the depression. Australia has now reached a stage when its reserves of man-power are almost exhausted. We have reached the limit.",31,Budget 1941 42 Revised
101,Mr Mulcahy (Lang) [5.17],"Afte rWe are manufacturing munitions of war of a kind that were not even thought of during the last conflict. A great many of our people are engaged in the production of munitions, not only for use by our own forces, but also for the use of the British forces and those of our Allies. It is recognized that Australian workmen are turning out equipment superior in quality to any ever previously usedin the war. Many articles of the utmost value to the Allies are being made in our factories, in government workshops, ajid in munitions annexes. Bullets are just as essential as men in this war; it, mediately, provided they were peris no use putting an army in the field if we cannot supply it with proper equipment; but if we arc to continue manufacturing war equipment on the present scale we must, expect the number of recruits for the Australian Imperial Force to decline. We must ease down on one or the other. A t the present time there is a grave shortage of man-power in the industrial centres and in the country, due principally to the calling up of men for compulsory training. .Last week I visited the Riverina electorate and in spected the irrigation areas there. The Attorney-General( D r . Evatt) received a deputation from farmers and f r u it growers, who complained of t.he shortage of labour, and pointed out that an insufficient number of men was available to harvest the crop3. Members of the deputation asked the Government to release for harvesting purposes men called up for training. I trust that the Government w ill tion had not come into operation when accede to their wishes, and release these men for the duration of the war from fhe obligation to train. While I was in that district, the fact was brought under my notice that there are three distilleries there which might be placed at the disposal of the Government for the production of power alcohol. I am aware that, the last Government, considered the establishment of distilleries nt various points throughout Australia for this purpose, and 1 suggest that the present Government might obtain the use of the distilleries in the Riverina at a cost much below that required for the erection of new ones. A t present they' are in use for only three months out of the twelve:. for the other nine months they Mr Mulcahy. could be used as I have suggested, to the great advantage of Australia. The Government should encourage the installation of small plants for the distillation of petrol from shale. There are several shale deposits in New South Wales, apart from the Glen Davis enterprise. Recently, I took the Commonwealth Fuel Adviser, Mr Rogers, to inspect a small plant in my own electorate, and it was demonstrated to us that it could produce oil from shale economically. Without cost to the Government, those small plants could begin production immitted to sell the oil. That would relieve the industrial position considerably, because petrol rationing has inflicted great hardship upon the community. To a great extent, responsibility for the position rests with the previous Government, which allowed stocks to sink to such a dangerously low level that if an enemy had invaded the country, our mechanized forces would have been partly immobilized in a few weeks. On many occasions, the subject of petrol rationing has been discussed in the House. First, honourable members were informed that restriction arose from the necessity for conserving dollar exchange. reason. that would be seriously considered to-day. the Commonwealth Government introduced petrol rationing. became so acute, the necessity for conserving dollar exchange was not the reason for petrol rationing.

125,Mr Anthony,The arrangement is,36,Budget 1941 42 Revised
126,Mr Clark,"If that be so, what isupon our arrangement as something entirely different from the agreement arranged by our predecessors, to which I was entirely opposed. The only fault that I can find with the proposed arrangement is that it is to be brought into effect by regulation instead of by legislation, but I hope that legislation of a permanent character will eventually be passed to give effect to our policy. Perhaps the most striking contrast between this budget and the Fadden budget is provided by the way in which the two Treasurers approached the matter of income taxation. The approach of the Treasurer' responsible for this budget is fnir and reasonable, which is more than can be said of the approach of the previous Treasurer, who, had he had his way, would have placed a grievously unfair burden on the earners of small incomes. T have prepared a comparison of the contributions of taxpayers in New South Wales for the years 1940-41 and 1941-42, which shows how persons with no dependants will fare if this budget be passed then than he has gone in dealing with and how they would have fared under the Fadden budget. I shall take as my first illustration the man on £150 a year. Under the Fadden budget he would have had to make a national contribution in 1941-42 of £11 2s., compared with no contribution at all in 1940-41 and no contribution at all this year under the Chifley budget. The man on £250 a year would, under the Fadden budget, have had to contribute £33 6s. in 1941-42, an increase of £18 over his total tax payments last year. increases with the fact that a person on £2,000 a year from personal exertion would, under the Fadden budget, have had to make an additional contribution this year of only £6 16s. Why, the additional contribution which he would have had to make this year as compared with last year is exactly £10 lessthan the additional contribution which a man on £200 a year would have had to make. ber must not forget that most of the contribution which would have been expected from men in the lower ranges of incomes would have been represented by compulsory loans. show that whereas the Fadden Administration proposed to increase the contributions made by people in the lower ranges of income, it proposed to reduce the contributions made by those in receipt of big incomes. For instance, a person earning an income of £1,500 a year from property would have had to contribute this year under the Fadden budget £75 less than he contributed last year. The reduction in the case of a person earning £2,000 a year from property would have been £119, and for a person earning £3,000 a year the reduction would have been £155. Yet, an earner of £300 a year from property would have had to pay an additional £13 18s. this year, as compared with last year. If that is a fair way of dealing with the taxation problem, then my judgment is astray. By refraining from increasing the income tax rates imposed upon earners of incomes amounting to less than £1,500 a year, this Government has taken a realistic view of conditions. The Treasurer should have gone furthe taxation of income from bonds. According to figures supplied to Parliament, bonds in Australia to the value of £39,000,000 are exempt from taxation, and bonds to the value of £750,000,000 are exempt from any increase of tax above the rates ruling in 1931. The interest on those bonds amounts to £27,000,000 a year, and the Government would have been well within its rights in the present emergency in requiring that so much of that income as now tax-free Contrast those shall be taxed, and that the portion which is immune beyond the rates of 1931 shall be subjected to increased taxation. This war is being fought in order, amongst other things, to protect the assets of the people of this country, and those who have the assets should be ready to be taxed so that their assets might be protected. Another source of revenue which should be tapped is provided by the vast reserves which are held by various companies. Every year those companies pay huge sums of money into reserve accounts to meet depreciation and taxation. Legislation ought to be passed in order to compel those reserves to. be deposited with the Commonwealth Bank where the-money would be available to that institution to meet the financial needs of the nation, and where it",36,Budget 1941 42 Revised
127,Mr Paterson,The honourable mem,37,Budget 1941 42 Revised
128,Mr Clark,"I am endeavouring tocould be strictly controlled. The money could be in no safer place than in the Commonwealth Bank. Attempts have been made to standardize taxation in Australia, but so far they have been unsuccessful. I believe that the problem is capable of easy solution, although some honourable members are of the opinion that my plan is unconstitutional. My plan is this: the Commonwealth Government should strike rates of income tax to be paid by every taxpayer in Australia, irrespective of the rates of State taxation. Then, a rebate would be granted to each taxpayer of the amount of tax paid to the State Government. In other words, the taxation paid to the State would be allowed as a deduction from the tax payable to the Commonwealth, and that, I believe, would be fairer than allowing it as a deduction when arriving at the taxable income. Another important omission from the budget is the capital levy. People willingly pay fire insurance premiums in order to ensure themselves against loss of property by fire. If that be a sound principle, it is equally sound for persons to make a contribution from their capital in order to ensure against the loss of the remainder by war. Another matter to which I must refer is the effect of the increased sales tax and excise duties. There is an anomaly in relation to these imposts which needs rectifying. should be calculated so that only the exact amount of the increase will be passed on in the sale of the commodities affected. It frequently happens, however, that the increases are so designed as to make it impracticable to fit the new charges into convenient coin denominations. We had an instance of that a few days ago in relation to tobacco charges. The increased prices were fixed at figures which caused the manufacturers to advance the price slightly more than the exact amount of the increased tax. In my opinion, the big tobacco companies and brewing companies of this country are in a sufficiently strong financial position to be able to meet the new_ increases of excise duties. I am glad that the increases of tobacco charges were countermanded by the Minister for Trade and Customs, but I Mr Clark. trust that the anomaly to which I refer will be corrected. Considerable comment has been made by some honourable gentlemen about the new company tax. I commend the Government for having introduced this proposal, for I believe that the tax, under the new arrangement, will be more equity able. Honourable gentlemen opposite would have us believe that under the new imposts, companies will not reap any advantage whatever from profits they make in excess of 4 per cent., but that is not the case. A company which pays a dividend of 16 per cent, will be subjected to a tax of about 39 per cent, on the amount of dividend in excess of 4 per cent., so that it will still have the advantage of about 60 per cent, of its large profits. In such oircumstances, it can hardly be said that companies are being deprived of practically all of their profits. I ask the Government to give some attention to the definition of "" capital"" which appears in the law relating to the taxation of companies. I have the honour to be a member of a joint committee of Parliament which is investigating such subjects as company taxation, profits and prices. The evidence submitted to the committee indicates clearly that an amendment of the definition of capital is desirable. In' my opinion the present definition is being interpreted too liberally. Por example, dividends declared by the company but not distributed, or Increases of these taxes profits which are awaiting distribution, are regarded as capital, so that a company is allowed its 4 per cent, on a much larger sum than should be permitted. Capital should be defined as the actual capital invested, but limited by the market price of the shares of companies. It is unfair to regard as capital reserves, profits held for distribution, and other amounts not actually capital. The definition is too wide and should be amended. Prices and price-fixation are subjects which merit the immediate consideration of the Government. Since the beginning of the war prices have soared considerably; the latest available figures indicate that retail prices have increased by 10.2 per cent. Wholesale prices have advanced by more than double that amount. The Government should take imimediatc steps to stabilize and peg commodity prices. A prominent feature of the Fadden budget was service to theory, whereas what we need is service to the nation. The Fadden Government was intent on raising sufficient revenue to give effect to and not merely to meet the financial needs of the country and to carry on the war. I am opposed to that theory. I do not believe that prices can be stabilized and labour transferred from what may be termed non-essential industries to essential war-time industries simply by the implementation of a particular monetary and financial policy. In order to mobilize our man-power effectively we must adopt what I shall call physical methods. Rationalization, of itself, will not adequately meet our needs. It is essential that we shall absorb the whole of the unemployed resources of tbe country, including manpower. are unemployed in the honourable members district? my electorate SOO persons are still unemployed. We have been told, again and again, that there is no unemployment in the country, but that is simply not true. Let me state one instance. The policy of the previous Government of closing down certain industries without giving proper consideration to the transfer of the persons employed in them has had some most unfortunate effects. About three weeks ago a married man with two children asked me if I could help him to find work. He told me that he had been employed in a country garage, but owing to the restriction of petrol supplies and the general decline of the motor industry, his services had been dispensed with, but nothing had been done to find work for him in what is termed an essential industry. Consequently the man and bis family had to live on the dole. He saw me in Sydney and asked me to do what .1. could to find employment for him in the munitions industry. I sent him along to the appropriate officer, who told him that although he had had many years of engineering experience in a country garage he could not be found employment in the munitions industry because be was not <a specialized turner and fitter. I was able to place the man in a toy factory, where he is now making toys for the Christmas trade. Actually, that man was transferred a particular economic theory, from what was termed a non-essential industry to one that was definitely less essential.' His ease is typical of many. The previous Government closed many avenues of employment without ensuring fchat the persons who lost their work were found jobs elsewhere. We need a proper survey of our man-power and resources. If necessary, we must use physical methods in order to transfer workers from one industry to another. gentleman mean compulsory methods? which I am referring would gladly go voluntarily from one job to another, especially if they believed that by doing so they would be assisting the war effort. H o w many persons While being transferred from one job to another, men should be amply provided for by the Government. MenI n one country town in do not desire to be unemployed, for that means, in many instances, that they and their families must subsist on the food ration provided by the State. Wo have heard something in t.bi« debate about rhe organizing of female labour. There is no need, in my opinion, to put women into jobs that are more properly suited to men. There is ample scope for women to serve in war employments suitable to their strength and capacity. It is not necessary to dismiss men from their employment and to replace them by women. I have yet to be convinced that there is a shortage of man-power in this country. A technical training scheme that was organized in New South WaliiS some time ago to train men in certain classes of work has been discontinued because work was not available for the men after they had been trained. This does not indicate that there is an acute shortage of man-power. I trust that we shall see a marked improvement in the man-power situation after the Government has had an opportunity to consider all of the facts of the case. The Chifley budget envisages a proper allocation of our man-power resources, and the use of",37,Budget 1941 42 Revised

132,Mr Clark,"M e n of the class to the whole of our man-power and materials to the beat advantage. Until this policy can be put into effective operation we shall not be making a maximum war effort. I wish now to bring to the notice of the Government the need to rationalize tlie supply of materials for civilian wear. I realize that our troops overseas and at home must be properly clothed and equipped, but our munitions workers and the general community at home also must be provided with proper clothing. The men of this country are surely entitled to at least one suit a year, for that is the ration, allowed' in England under the card system. In the last month or two ray attention has been drawn to a serious shortage of worsteds in Australia. Our woollen mills are employed almost exclusively on the supply of military orders, and insufficient material is being released for civilian needs. Because of this fact clothing manufacturers in Australia have had to import materials from Great Britain, which is the only other source of supply open to them. I have had twenty years' experience in the wholesale and retail clothing trade and I know the quality of cloth when I examine it. I have in my hand a cloth which was being manufactured in Australia until recently and made available to clothing manufacturers for 6s. a yard. It is a woollen brushed eloth suitable for making ladies' coats that could be sold at from £2 15s. to £3 each. That material is now unobtainable because the mills which were manufacturing it are engaged solely on military orders. have therefore been obliged to import a cloth from England which is costing 13s. 6d. a yard landed in their factories. Ladies' coats made from cloth at that price will cost retail purchasers about £5 10s. instead of £2 15s. or £3, which they were previously paying for garments made from Australian cloth. Such an increase of the price of an essential article of apparel must necessarily increase the cast of living. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. £28,700,000, an increase of £2,100,000. of cloth which is described as an the reverse of that. For the year 1912-13, Australian check. It is made in Ausprior to the last war, 96,000 bales of wool tralian mills, and is priced at 8s. 4£d. a were used in the manufacture of materials yard. That material, which was used very in Australia. In 1938-39, prior to the extensively in the trade, is now unobtainable; consequently, material of the same type has had to be imported, at a price landed in Australian stores of 18s. l i d . a yard. While production by Australian mills is being so greatly reduced that they cannot supply the civil trade in this country, overseas goods are being landed at more than twice the price, with the result that the cost of men's and women's clothing will be doubled. If it be the desire of the Government to keep down tlie cost of living, this matter must be investigated without delay. The present allotment of material for men's clothing would not provide every male in Australia with one suit every two years, and is therefore quite insufficient to meet ordinary requirements. I have placed on the notice-paper a question which asks for information as to the production of Australian mills during the last financial year and for the last four months, together with the quantities allotted for civil use and military purposes. I am sure that when these figures are supplied they will establish my contention that far too little is being provided for the civil trade. There is a considerable quantity of suiting materials in many of our large emporiums. These establishments have expended hundreds of thousands of pounds on the stocks which they are holding. Yet, warehouses which supply the trade of small manufacturers, tailors and dressmakers in country and city centres, have not sufficient supplies to meet normal requirements. A return should be Our manufacturers demanded by the Government of stocks held in large emporiums. Those stocks should be frozen, and the firms should be compelled to ease them off. We could then prevent the continuance of a state of affairs which enables one person to purchase eight suits, whilst other persons are unable to obtain one suit because the material for its making is not available in their particular centres. The value of woollen and worsted yarn manufactures exported from Great Britain during 1939 was £26,600,000. In 1940, it was",39,Budget 1941 42 Revised
133,Mr Clark,"I have also a sample The production position in Australia ispresent war, 378,649 bales were so used. During the two war years, consumption of wool by Australian mills has decreased. In 1939-40 the quantity was 324,459 bales, a reduction of approximately 54,000 bales. In the year 1940-41, the quantity used was 376,457 bales, approximately 2,000 bales less than prior to the war. Additional plants should be the treatment and weaving of wool. Negotiations should be entered into for the transfer of some plants from Great Britain. Machinery is being imported for the manufacture of the various munitions and equipment which are needed in our war activities. The provision of materials for Australian and overseas use is equally important, and it could be accomplished economically. The Times publication, Trade and Engineering, for September, 1941, statedFurther progress towards concentration of production is reported by tbe wool textile industry. tion Committee, set up to prepare and administer a scheme for tlie wool textile industry, issued a series of letters. intimations to individual firms appeared to fall categories:(1) Some firms are advised that they are likely to be allowed to continue to operate their own plant and to qualify wool clip should not be sold too cheaply for nucleus status. (2) Others are informed that they may be required to suspend production on their own plant and are advised to iinake immediate arrangements to have their production undertaken on tlie plant of a continuing firm. (3) A third group are advised that they may be allowed to keep their own plant in commission if they can raise higher costs and the tendency towarde their machinery activity to a higher level by taking over the production of a fir m required to arrange suspension of (production. -For some time there has been in operation in Great Britain a scheme designed to concentrate production in fewer mills, and to transfer employees from one mill to another. While some mills are out of civil production and are not being used for war purposes, an acute shortage of material exists in Australia and other parts of the Empire because of inability to supply the demand. Much of that weaving machinery in England which is not now being used could be sent to Australia. Imports to Australia should be restricted, in order to avoid high prices of these materials and a consequent increase of the cost of living. The British Government has rationalized its industry along these lines, and plant is available to do the job. The agreement between the Commonwealth and the British Government for the sale of Australia's wool should be reviewed. A couple of weeks ago, I established in Australia for asked the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) whether the Government would consider negotiating with the Government of the United Kingdom for a review of that agreement, with the object of obtaining a price more in keeping with the prices of commodities, both local and imported. I am pleased at the statement of the Minister that the matter is being considered, and that it is hoped tliat before May of next year, when the contract will come up for consideration, negotiations with the British Government will be begun on the lines indicated by me. I hope that provision will be made . . The Central Concentrafor a price more in keeping with the present costs of production. This indus. . The try affects not only the person who grows the wool, but also employees directly into one of the following three engaged in the industry and those whose employment in country centres is dependent on it. Therefore, the Australian during the war. When the agreement was arranged, the price was fixed at lOJd. per lb. sterling, equal to 13.4d. per lb. Australian. Although some of those interested were satisfied with that figure, others were most dissatisfied, and believe that it was unfair because of still further increases during the w»r period. In 1916, the arrangement entered into for the realization of Australia's wool provided for a price of 15£d. per lb. sterling. Australian currency was then at par at sterling. The purchasing power of money was greater then than it is now. In September, 1941, as I have said, the >price of Australian wool was lOJd. .per lb. sterling, equal to 13.4d. Australian. The index figure in respect of wholesale prices was 1,325 in November, 1916, and 1,598 in September, 1941, an increase of 21 .per cent The index figure in relation to retail prices was 795 in November, 1916, and 1,009 in September, 1941, an increase of 27 per cent. If we adopt the figure 100 as the price of w ool in 1916, the price to-day would be represented by the figure 87. The corresponding figures in respect of wholesale prices would be 100 and 121 respectively, and of retail prices 100 and 127 respectively. Increases of costs since the exchange rate. present war -began are important .in. a consideration of this matter. of time granted.} The increase of retail prices from September, 1939, to September, 1941, was 10.2 per cent. The index of wholesale prices increased during the same period by 23 per cent.; the imports section by 42 per cent., and -the home section 'by only 13 per cent. Tho export index shows that the price of Australia's exports increased from September, 1939, to September, 1941, by Hi per cent, whereas the imports index shows that the prices of imports have risen 44 per cent., or that imports to Australia for tlie war period have riseu iu price 33 per cent, more than our exports. Now these figures show that the prices of imports over the price of wool increased from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent, and the cost of living by 10.2 per cent. Therefore, the price paid in Australian currency for our wool should be in keeping with the increase of the prices of our imports and with the increase of the cost of living which graziers and all others associated with the wool industry have to pay. The return to the grazier for his wool should be 15^(1. per lb., which would only equal the price paid during the last war. As compared with the 193S-39 price, the present price of Australian wool shows an increase of only 29 per cent, ou the pre-war figure, whilst the increase in the price at which Great Britain is supplying wool to the trade there averages 68 per cent. The wool index numbers issued by the Weekly gave the increases of the prices for December, 1940 as 67 per cent, for wool, 75 per cent, for tops, and 64 per cent, for yarns. The average price of wool under the British Australasian Wool Realization Scheme that operated from 19:16 onwards was about £22 10s. a bale, and under the present scheme the price averages about £17 15s. a bale, although the cost of living has substantially increased. The average price obtained in Mr Clark. New Zealand for the 1939-40 and 1940-41 clips under a similar scheme was £1S 17s. a bale, which is a substantially greater price than is being received in Australia. The Government should give consideration to the present position of the To appreciate the effects of the operation of that rate, it [Extension should be realized that we are buying goods and building up debts abroad at a premium of 25 per cent., whilst we are selling at a discount of 25 per cent. we get an advantage. paid in Australia, and not by people abroad. He is paid at a discount and the difference is made up by Australian importers. If it is desired to subsidize the exporting industries, which is said to be the purpose of the exchange rate, the Government should subsidize them from the Consolidated Revenue. The prices of imports into Australia have increased by 44 per cent., whilst export prices have increased by only 11.25 per cent. As there has been a 33 por cent, greater increase of the prices of imported commodities, the exchange rate should be adjusted more in keeping with the altered prices of imports and exports. I hope that these figures will be taken into consideration when the prices to be paid for Australia's major export linos are being determined. A movement was initiated some time ago to provide each returned soldier with a new suit of clothes. The woollen mills were invited to show samples of the cloth they could supply at about 7s. 6d. a yard. It will be remembered that on the conclusion of the last war, the suits supplied to the returned men were of poor quality and badly made. The suits now Wool Chart in Bradford proposed to be made available to them will cast £2 each. The material for each suit would cost about 23s. 6d., leaving only 16s. 6d. for the making of it. I should say it would be impossible tn obtain a well-made suit, even in the slop trade, if the cost of making alone were not more than £2 10s., so I fear that the soldiers, on their return to Australia, will have their dignity lowered by having to wear the suits proposed to be supplied to them.

It would be better for the Government to make a sum of money available to the troops in order to enable them to have suits well made and of good material. I trust that the matters to which 1 bave drawn attention will receive consideration, that a maximum war effort will be put forward, that justice will be done to the members of the fighting forces, and that such measures will be put into operation as will lead to the prosperity of Australia after the war, aud the absorption into civil life of the hundreds of thousands of men who will be released from the war sphere and the munitions factories. [8.25] -Before dealing with my main theme, I shall reply to one or two misconceptions revealed in statements by honHad that occurred, what guarantee orable members opposite. We were told yesterday by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson), that, until the present Government came into power, only 5s. a day was being paid to our soldiers fighting overseas. That was an entirely wrong statement. Actually, 7?. a day was being paid. In the budget submitted by the Fadden Government, exactly the same sum was to be paid to the soldier as is proposed to be paid by the present Government; there was a difference only in the method. The present Government intends to grant an extra Is. a day as a cash payment, whereas the Fadden Government undertook to provide the extra Is. as deferred pay. As a returned soldier, 1 believe that the method adopted by the Fadden Government was superior to that of the present Administration. My firm opinion is that if the members of our fighting forces could have 3s. a day accumulating for them in Australia, the money would prove invaluable to them on their return. It takes a considerable time for an ex-soldier to settle down to civil life after having experienced the disturbing effects of a world war, and, if he could put his hand on a lump sum representing deferred pay at the rate of 3s. a day, the money would be a godsend to him. money be made available to the soldier? Air. MoDONALD -On his return from the war zone. The statemeut that the Government would be unable to provide the money is ridiculous. It would be much easier to provide that deferred pay than to repay the huge war loan that the public is now asked to subscribe. As a representative of a country electorate, I believe that the wool agreement entered into between the British and Commonwealth Governments was an excellent one at the time when it was made. In effect, it enabled from 25 to 30 per cent, more money to be paid to the wool-grower than he received under open market conditions in the year prior to that in which the agreement was reached. To whom could we have sold (Corangamite) our wool, if not to the British Government? Isi t suggested that we should have traded with an enemy country? should we have had of receiving payment for our wool? When the contract was entered into, provision was made that it should be reviewed in May of each year. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) said that New Zealand was receiving more per bale for the wool sold by it to Great Britain than Australia is getting. The prices cited by him indicate nothing except that in New Zealand the bales are much heavier than those in Australia. The wool growers in the dominion go in for cross bred sheep, and it is possible to get 100 lb. more of that class of wool into a bale than of our light Merino wool. The higher price per bale of New Zealand wool did not mean that the growers in that dominion received a better deal than did the growers in Australia. I believe tliat the wool-growers are very satisfied to be assured of a market for their wool, and a guarantee of 95 per cent, of the price a fortnight after it ia appraised in store in Australia, irrespective of when it is shipped. Other primary producers would be very pleased if they could get a similar contract. I am glad that the present Government adopted a portion of the Fadden budget b\ agreeing to establish a rural bank, but I am sorry that, by its latest appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board, it has departed from the terms of the act which require that there shall be",42,Budget 1941 42 Revised

There never was a time when it was so necessary that a man possessing such qualifications should sit on the bank board, particularly as it is proposed to set up a mortgage bank for the benefit of primary producers. Government read the terms which should govern the appointment of members of the board, and when they remember that many of their own supporters have put themselves forward as champions of the primary producers, perhaps they will be prepared to give to the primary producers a voice in the control of the bank. I have not much fault to find with the Government's budget except that it amounts to taking a stout stick to about 20 per cent, of the taxpayers, whilst administering soothing syrup to the other SO per cent. I am not complaining because the Government is taxing the rich heavily, but I do complain when it leaves the other SO per cent, untouched at a time when the purchasing power of the people is higher than ever before. The voluntary system of raising loans has outlived its usefulness. Before the outbreak of war we had a voluntary system of enlistment for home defence, and speakers scoured the country in an endeavour to induce men to enlist so that we might build up our home defence forces to a strength of 70,000. thing about this matter because I took part in the campaign, and I know that it was not easy to induce men to join up. Last year, the Menzies Government tried to raise a substantial sum of money by voluntary loan, and though one could not class the attempt as a dismal failure, the results did not come up to expectation. not have confidence in the last Government. confidence in the last Government, what will they think of this one? I read in the press the other day that honourable members on the other side still pin their faith to the voluntary system for raising forces for home defence..

Rosevear, Mulcahy, Morgan, Falstein, James and Brennan, together with Senators Arthur and Large, waited on the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) and asked him to abolish the compulsory system of training and restore the voluntary system for the defence of Australia. When members of the I understand that this is still a plank in the Labour party's platform. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) after his return from England, issued a policy of his own, clause 16 of which is as follows:Compulsory enlistment, and the training ol men and women for defence and civil protection services. If he is in favour of that, does he think he is getting any nearer his goal by allying himself with a party which is opposed to compulsory training for home defence? facts when they are "" up against it "" . against it "" hard enough it will be too late to face the facts. A few weeks ago, when I was assisting in the campaign for the flotation of the present loan^ I was invited to talk in a town of five or six thousand inhabitants. I was addressing a war loan rally at which a welcome was to be tendered to a returned soldier of this war, one of eight brothers serving with the Australian Imperial Force. Exactly 53 .people turned up, and I told them that no country, and no government, was justified in accepting such a sacrifice from a single family while I and others had to stump the country and beg people to lend money to a Government which was going to pay them interest for it. That is the kind of equality of sacrifice that we get under the voluntary system. This budget puts a premium on selfishness. As a matter of fact, it induces the great majority of the people of Australia to paddle in a pool of sordid selfishness, while permitting a small minority to battle in the tempestuous sea of stern sacrifice and strenuous endeavour. WhilstI have stood in the past for the voluntary system, and have done all I could to induce recruits to join the Militia and the Australian Imperial Force, and have tried to gather money for war loans, I",43,Budget 1941 42 Revised

After war broke out, the Labour party was opposed to the sending of troops overseas, but. it now says that it is prepared to reinforce those who are there. When the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, was attacking the Fadden budget, he said that he was in favour of paying old-age pensioners 22s. 6d. a week, but he changed his mind a fortnight later, and now proposes to pay them 23s. 6d. a week. I cite that in order to show that the Labour party can change its mind rapidly and completely in two weeks. After the experience of the last Government in attempting to raise voluntary loans, the present Government will be merely courting disaster if it persists with that method. ber's party has never advocated conscription. my party have, in season and out of season, spoken in favour of military conscription.

Mr Forde spoke from national stations in an Armistice Day broadcast. He said: ""The only way we can go on is by the volunteered strength of the men of our country. "" If that strength is insufficient or too slow said that in the next sessional period to respond, the future is black indeed. "" If you are eligible, you must decide whether you should come forward at the critical hour. "" Our Arary can come home again in only one of two ways-in victory, or in defeat. There is no third possibility in this kind of war. "" Our Army must be supported with all the reinforcements it needs. You know there can be no tinkering with that simple fact. "" For two years we have been fighting our way up a steep h ill . We have battled our way to fairly level ground, but at our feet there is a chasm into which it w ill be a l l too easy to slip back "". Mr Fordo said the theme of Armistice Day was one of pride. Just as people in Australia were thinking of the men abroad, tbose men were thinking of their homes. He added: ""Unless they can think of their homeland as a land in which tireless, singleminded, implacable fellow-countrymen are driving the war effort ahead until their very sinews crack, tbe theme of Armistice Day w ill change from pride to bitterness. "" That day must never come "". I have no fault to find with that statement, but it will be impossible adequately to defend Australia if the compulsory system of military training be abolished. This is not the time to be administering sleeping draughts to the people; they need iron rations. Did the people of England, when they were being bombed and battered and beaten beyond description, throw in the towel? Was their morale shattered because they were facing terrific odds ? Do we fear that the people of Australia cannot stand up to the test? I agree with the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) that the time is ripe for members of this Parliament, irrespective of party, to go out and tell the truth to the people. Let us tell them that sacrifices will be demanded of them greater than any they have ever made before. Greater service will be required of them in the future, and I believe that they will bear what is before them with the same fortitude, the same determination, the same endurance and the same courage as were shown by the people of Great Britain. I support the budget, but I do so without enthusiasm. I support it because the apologists for the budget have described it as an improvised budget, and have members will have an opportunity to consider a further instalment of the policy of the Labour party and in accordance with its election promises.

The masses of the people who support the Labour party expect from a Labour Government the complete fulfilment of its policy at the earliest possible moment. The Labour party is different from other political parties in that it is not the political expression of what another Roosevelt, who also was a President of the United States of America, described wealth"". The Labour party, representing the interests of the great masses of the people, struggles for the day when it will control the forms and the machinery of government, so that it can translate into actuality the idealism which permeates its policy, and bring about the practical reforms by which it hopes to make this world a better place for men and women to live in. Judged by those tests, the budget that we are asked to vote upon does not give complete satisfaction; but it is an instalment of Labour's policy, and I hope, an earnest of better things to come. The Labour party has hold office in this Parliament in other days. Por the past 25 years, however, it has been in the shades of opposition, except for a brief period of one month in the year of grace 1941, and for two years and two months between 1929 and 1931. It does not hold power in the Senate to-day, and did not hold it there in 1929-3.1. In the present period it has not a majority in either House. There is this advantage in the present situation, however, in that because of the war situation, the Government of the day can, if it so desiresand this Government has given some evidence that it does so desire-expres s its will by regulation, which enables it to fulfil its purpose by a shorter process. It is trne that the Senate can, if it so desires, disallow any such regulation, as may this House also. That regulatory power is wide and extensive, and I believe that the masses of t.he people outside will expect the Government to have recourse to it in giving effect to the election promises of Board, and to throw upon the Senate the the Labour party, and in our time translate into legislative form the planks of the party's platform.

It is expected that some as ""predatory use will be made of those powers. given for the defence of the country, not for the benefit of any one class. the defence of the country against all enemies, both inside and outside Australia. And those enemies outside Australia do not want to make any contribution, if they can avoid it, to the successful prosecution of the war. It is a canon of taxation that taxes shall be borne by those best able to bear them. Insofar as this budget attempts to place the burden where it properly belongs, it has been framed in accordance with right' principles; but I am afraid that in some respects., particularly in the matter of the increase of the sales tax, the budget places the burden where it does not belong, because it adds to the load of those who are least able to bear it. The Opposition has criticized the budget on many grounds. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eadden) said that f)he banking proposals of the Government go too far.

The people have no faith in the Commonwealtli Bank Board. If the criticism of the appointment of Mr Taylor as a member of that board were valid the same criticism could be directed against every other member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. What right or title has the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, Sir Claude Reading, to be regarded as a banker ? He is a "" tobacco king"". He has no more right to be the chairman of that body than had his predecessor, Sir Robert Gibson, whose only claim was that he was a successful manufacturer of bedsteads. Messrs. Taylor and Duffy, the two Labour members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, are as fully qualified as are the other members of the board. The Commonwealth Bank Board was established by the Bruce Page Government in 1924 in order to sabotage the Commonwealth Bank and buttress the private banking institutions of this country. Immediately the board was established it directed the governor of the bank practically to cease trading in competition with the private banks. In recent years the bank has even been directed to refuse to accept transfers from of the honourable member for Barker by the private banks of the overdrafts of farmers and others, who sought the advantage of lower overdraft rates.

I have no faith in the priShylocJc, by the Honourable Frank Anstey, vate banking institutions of this country.

The degree to which we give effect to our platform will deterday becoming richer and richer and more mine our acceptability or otherwise to the masses of the people. That is why I deferentially suggest to the Government that a Labour government cannot compromise or temporize, and live. A Labour [15] government must be determined and energetic.

The report also suggests a number of most desirable amendments of existing social legislation. Among other things, it recognizes the necessity for the introduction of a scheme of widows' pensions. I hope that provision for this scheme will be made during the next sittings of the Parliament. I greatly regret that the subject of widows' pensions is not mentioned in the budget. opposed the national insurance scheme, which provided for the payment of widows' pensions. Mr 'OALWELL-The national insurance scheme did not provide for widows' pensions. The Government of the day lacked courage to put its scheme into operation even though the Parliament had passed it. The proposal was rejected by the people, because it would have compelled them to contribute for the pensions to which they would become entitled in their old age. The widows' pensions scheme is most necessary, bemost defenceless section of the community. New South Wales has a complete scheme and Victoria a partial scheme, but no other State has seen fit to provide for the establishment of any scheme. I hope that the omission from the budget of such a scheme is a mere oversight; but even as an oversight, it is almost unpardonable. The scheme must be introduced during the next sessional which we made at the last federal elecsocial service. Many other matters are contained in Social Security, and I hope that they capitalism in the same forthright and member for North Sydney was accustomed to do a quarter of a century ago party. I am in excellent company to-day. I have quotations from eminent members of the hierarchy of the Church of England who, in recent times, have harshly criticized the capitalist system of society. The Right Reverend Dr. Burgmann, Bishop of Goulburn, saidCapitalism, as a method of creating and distributing wealth, was the law of the jungle. Like the jungle animal, it left the bones and offal to the weak and the poor, and it was still doing so. The Right Reverend Dr. Moyes, Bishop of Armidale, saidUnemployment created one of the greatest crises in history. Money power would have to be made subordinate to social ends. The banking policy would have to be directed for the community's welfare as a whole, and noi; merely for those who owned wealth. The Right Reverend Dr. Stephen, formerly Bishop of Tasmania, and earlier, Bishop of Newcastle, saidThe modern capitalistic system will have to be either amended or ended. Capitalism favours the class which has the privileges in all spheres of life. Under capitalism, justice is ignored as a business principle, especially in big corporations and companies.

178,Mr Anthony,"The churches havetrite, inaccurate mterjections which the honourable member for Richmond' is continually making in this chamber. The people who are amassing wealth in this community are those who own the means of production, distribution and exchange. I have yet to learn that the members of any church are the owners of these big concerns. I propose to cite some figures to honourable members concerning the distribution of wealth in this community. My authority is a respectable member of the lecturing staff of the Melbourne University, D r . CL . Wood. About this time last year, D r . Wood delivered a lecture on money incomes and divided those who received them into three groupsthe rich, the middle class, and the poor. I quote from a newspaper comment on Dr. Wood's addressIf the rich restricted their investments to £25,000,000 a year and their private expenditure to £10,000,000 a year, they could get along quite nicely . . . The Government sliould take not less than £75,000,000 from the rich . . . The middle group, comprising fi50,000 persons, with some 1,600,000 dependants, receives a total income of £325,000,000. The lucky ones receive incomes ranging from £300 to £1,000 a year. Embracing roughly one-third of the people, the great middle class, including in its ranks tens of .thousands of the On the average, they had £387 per annum better-paid workers, who make their lives miserable trying to keep pace with the riotous expenditure of the rich, receives approximately one-third of tlie national income. The rest of the community constitutes the poor, the people about whom honourable members opposite are so concerned because it is said that they do not bear their share of the taxes imposed for war purposes. In the opinion of D r . Wood, that section of the community embraces no less than 2,200,000 wage-earners in receipt of an average income of less than £200 per annum, and upon whom are dependent some 3,325,000 persons. These people, and this is my view only, are the great mass of the rent-racked, overworked., sweated and unemployed people. All told, the poor get £465,000,000 with which to live, and pay taxation, direct and indirect. The Prime Minister, when Leader of the Opposition last year, cited figures concerning the respective in comes of the various wage groups and made his own calculations upon them. what the honourable gentleman then said T h a t is one of the by citing other figures which indicate that the great masses of the people have not the wherewithal to make greater contributions by way of direct and indirect taxation. According to the Prime Minister's figures last year, the total amount received by those whose in comes are less than £400 per annum was £517,000,000. The average income of individuals in that group was £207. They paid £5,000,000 in direct taxation at an average rate of £2 a head. In indirect taxation they paid no less than £50,000,000, or ' £20 a head. In effect, they paid ten times as much in indirect taxation as in direct taxation. The remaining average income on which those people had to live was £185 per annum. That does not permit riotous living, jaunts to the other side of the world, or the purchase of any of those things which our friends opposite term luxuries in time of war. The number of persons receiving incomes of from £400 to £1,000 a year is 310,000. Their total income was £143,000,000, and their average £461. They paid £8,000,000 in direct taxes, or £26 a head.

181,Mr Calwell,"The figures areHuge profits are being made out of tbe war by tbe big companies which provide the electioneering funds for honourable members opposite. The honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) knows to whom I refer. The honourable gentleman doubtless pays periodical visits to all the big banking institutions, and metaphorically holds out his hat to receive donations which enable him to fool the people and thereby secure his re-election to this Parliament so that he may continue to do the bidding of the vested interests which support him. I admit that he is a very faithful servant; he represents his masters very well, and a miracle will be wrought if he ever casts a vote for democracy or says a word in favour of the best interests of the greatmasses of the people. The huge profits being made by wealthy companies out of this war are increasing instead of diminishing. Paper Manufacturers Limited showed a profit of £255,728, an increase of £15,703 over the previous year's transactions. Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited showed a profit of £448,782, an increase of £43,026. Mount Morgan Limited showed a profit of £219,704, an increase of £127,052. Australian showed a profit of £28,736, an increase of more than £11,000. Drug Houses of Australia Limited showed a profit of £191,524, just a mere £5,469 more than the profit of the last preceding year. Assopaid into the Commonwealth Bank. ciated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited showed a profit of £31,717, an increase of no less than £8,354. Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, one of the big concerns which manufactures munitions and earns profits from death, made a profit of £403,560, an increase of £14,161. One of the great monopolies that should be nationalized is the British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited, which showed a profit of nearly £1,000,000, an increase of £55,122. Dalgety and Company Limited made a profit of £147,682, out of the wool-growers of Australia, or £26,077 more than in the preceding year. The Colonial Gas Company Limited made a profit of £89,435, or an increase of £3,845. Limited made a profit of £382,416, or an increase of £28,912 over the preceding Mr Calwell. year. All these profits were earned as the result of the war by companies represented in this Parliament by honourable members opposite who are constantly harping on the slogan ""equality of sacrifice "". The capitalist system which honourable members opposite are trying to bolster up was responsible for all the misery and degradation incidental to the depression period, and unless it be ended it will bring about more suffering and more poverty after this war. The Labour party does not exist to mend the capitalist system, but to end it. If the Labour party does not end it, that system will eventually destroy the Labour party as we know it. do with all these profits? Last year Australian the funds of the United Australia party and the United Country party in order that their nominees may be elected to the National Parliament and do their bidding. The interjection of the honourable member is typical of that bovine mentality which this Parliament has long since learned to associate with membership of the Country party. Recently this Knitting Mills Limited Government conferred with the banks and we now have an arrangement to be made the subject-matter of a national security regulation under which any excess deposits of the banks will in future be There are advantages in this arrangement for the banks, which I predict will not benefit the people. No bank will be permitted to fail during the currency of the war. The banks are to have the backing of the nation. Depositors will be completely safeguarded because, in addition to the banks' assets, they will have the guarantee of the Commonwealth Government as security for their deposits. If any weakness is detected in the structure of a financial institution, the Government will come to its aid. All that the nation is to have in return for that is the assurance that the banks will not, politically or otherwise, try to destroy the control which the Government Australian Iron and Steel exercises over their undistributed profits during the period of the war. There is not much difference in the form of control proposed in. the Chifley",51,Budget 1941 42 Revised

183,Mr Calwell,"They pay them intobudget and that proposed in tbe Fadden budget. But I distrust all banting institutions and tbeir policies. I am afraid that wben the war is over the banking structure will emerge stronger than ever it was before, and be in a better position to continue its depredations. In the last depression, sorrow, suffering and starvation stalked every street and every city of Australia. It was undeserved poverty brought about by a man-made depression. [Extension of time granted.""} The Baillieus emerged from the last war stronger than they were before it, and when this war is over we shall find the same financial groups more strongly entrenched in the life of the community than they were before it began. We think that this is the Parliament of the nation; it is certainly elected by the people to make the laws of the community, 'but its power is not as paramount as we believe. The real power is exercised outside Parliament by people like Sir Colin Fraser, Sir Alexander Watson, Sir Keith Murdoch, Sir Walter Massy-Greene, Sir Herbert Gepp, Sir Clive Baillieu and the other Baillieus, Sir Sydney Snow, Sir Norman Kater, Sir Claude Reading and Sir Norman Brookes, who are the dominant people in the metal group, the newspaper group and the financial group that controls the "" sugar squeeze "", to use the picwants sweeping changes and a fullturesque phraseology of the late Frank Anstey. These are the people who control all the big financial and insurance companies, the monopolies, the trusts and the combines, against which we campaigned so vigorously and almost successfully when referendums were submitted to the people in the early days of the federation. To-day, the monopolies have a stronger grip upon the community than ever before. Their rule is law. They have made and unmade governments. They have been particularly blatant, audacious and daring in the various schemes by which they have made Parliament subservient to their will. They own and control the important newspapers of this country-the allegedly so-called free and democratic press. What a press! It is owned for the most part by financial crooks and is edited for the most part by mental harlots. These are the people who at election time misrepresent the principles and policy of the Labour party, and theirs are the newspapers which libel, malign, traduce, and defame us. Quite recently honourable members opposite have tasted something of the powers of the newspaper oligarchy. The newspapers have recently driven one Prime Minister out of office, either because they did not like the shade of his hair or because they disliked something that he had done or something that he had refused to do. They have campaigned against other Prime Ministers and Ministers who would not do their will. They have seduced members of Parliament into 'betrayal of the workers who elected them. They have persuaded members of opposing parties to join hands in order that further crimes might be committed against the community. So that they might gain a new lease of power, to-day they are looking for a weakling in the Labour party who will give them the opportunity to resuscitate their power and win another victory. They will fail ignominiously. None on this side will take their money and do their work. I have no doubt that the great body of people of this community will not tolerate the things which in other times they were fooled into believing were for the nation's benefit. The Australian community blooded application of Labour's policy. The people want ns to do things in order that we shall get from the land the limitless riches which only tillage and exploitation can produce. Seven million people hold 3,000,000 square miles of territory, and the great majority of these people are jammed in a narrow strip of land between the coastal range and the sea on the eastern side of the continent. Dr. Griffith Taylor, who made a study of these things, declared that 20,000,000 people was our population limit, but we are struggling along with only 7,000,000 inhabitants who are destined to extinction in the course of a few generations, largely because of a disastrous economic policy. A former Treasurer told this Parliament that in 1970 or thereabouts the population of Australia at the present diminishing rate of natural increase, would reach its maximum, and that thereafter it would decline steeply and rapidly and that in the course of 100 years the population would be only 3,000,000. There is no need for the nations to the north of us to cast covetous eyes on Australia and fight a way into it if the prefor or interest in those who are fighting sent trend continues, because they need wait only a generation or two until we are so reduced in numbers that they will be able to walk into Australia in much the same way as Captain Cook did 150 years ago against the boomerangs and spears of the aborigines. It is time that we started a new order. Substantial instalments of that new order. I had hoped to see in this budget. I now hope to see those instalments introduced in the next sittings of Parliament, because, in addition to my office as an elected representative of the people, I have held high offices on the organizational side of the Labour movement for many years, and there we shall look for an accounting and for reports as to progress in the political sphere. I hope that, sitting in one of those positions, I shall be those young men who stand, not for the able to cast favorable judgment on the work of the fifth Labour Prime Minister. This budget does not satisfy me. I support it without much enthusiasm. I hope for better things in the future and for changes that, when they do come, will be as sweeping and as thorough as the circumstances of the moment demand. [9.37] -The words of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) impel me to remind the committee that the matter of the greatest moment at present is the winning of the war-the fulfilment of our obligations to the lads who have left Australia to assist in that very purpose. The honourable member would appear to be more interested in causing disintegration within his own Government party than in helping the war effort. He talked about a revolution in this country and about constitutional alteration by methods unprecedented in any country in the British Empire. He favoured the control by a certain coterie, which would include himself, of the banks, including the Commonwealth Bank, in which the people have savings amounting to £260,000,000. He says that this is the time to institute a new order. He did not say it was the time to defeat the new order of Hitler or the new order which may be forced upon us by Japan or some other nation! He is more concerned about his own political future than about this country, and he has no thought our battles in order to preserve our liberty and to enable us to continue to express our opinions freely. The honourable member would guide this nation not for the advantage of all but for only one section. The honourable member says that he is a democrat, but his form of democracy is government for a section of the people and the overthrow of the interests of the remainder. I remind the honourable member that our men overseas are fighting for the maintenance of his interests and for his continued enjoyment. The men of the Australian Imperial Force are sacrificing themselves on behalf of the honourable member, and their wives and mothers and fathers are looking to this Parliament to give greater assistance to hidebound interests of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), but for the interests of the Empire. The honourable member for Melbourne has attempted by every means at his disposal to cause disintegration within his own party, to say nothing of Australia generally. He says that Labour desires, not to mend, but to end the present system. That is the catch cry of the communist. He could have learnt it from Thomas and Ratliff, whom his party released from internment in order that they might continue to preach their doctrines, and from Thornton, of the Trades and Labour Council, who, to-day and every other day, advocates the overthrow of the present system of government in Australia. The honourable member says that this is not the Parliament of the nation and that the real power lies outside. That was the only true statement made by the honourable member, because to-day the Government of Australia is conducted by the members of the Trades and Labour Council. They dictate to the Government, not through Cabinet Ministers, but through those who have",52,Budget 1941 42 Revised
184,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"endeavoured to destroy the wiser judgment of the Cabinet. At least 80 per cent, of the Australian people favour a national government, but that is impossible whilst the party in power is influenced by Thornton and other communists, with whom one would not be seen dead, and who dictate Labour policy through their mouthpieces in this Parliament. Members of the Labour party must vote as they are told to vote by the communists who control the Labour movement through New South Wales councils. Until the whole of the Parliament acts in the interests of the Empire we shall not advance very far. The honourable member did not seem to be at all interested in winning the war. He did not discuss the budget. He did not analyse to any degree the difference between it and the Padden budget. All he did was to congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) on introducing it in the limited time at his disposal. He failed to appreciate that in the main this budget follows the lines of the Fadden budget, with the exception that it provides an additional £6,000,000 for soldiers' pay to be made available by way of active pay, whereas the Fadden Government deemed it wiser to treat it as deferred pay. The honourable gentleman referred in passing to the the position of the primary producers invalid and old-age pensioners. The Fadden Government increased the rate of pensions by Is. a week, and this Governrestricted markets. Success in marketing ment so far has not done better. The pensioners must be disappointed that in this budget the Government has failed to honour its promise to increase the rate of their pension to 25s. a week. The Government proposes to increase the rate of income tax only on incomes of £1,500 a year and over. I have been informed by telegram on behalf of shareholders in a concern established in my electorate that under the Government's company taxation ju'oposals their organization will be obliged to pay tax at the rate of 19s. 8d. in the £1. The Fadden Government's proposals to raise revenue by compulsory loans has been rejected by this Government; yet one independent honourable member who now supports this Government strongly supported that proposal. The Government also proposes to increase the rate of sales tax and customs and excise duties. Those imposts will place a heavy burden upon persons on the lower ranges of income. They will return to the Government a large amount of revenue. However, the Fadden Government had no intention to ask those sections of the community to bear such a burden. Instead, it proposed that the burden of our war expenditure should be spread equitably over all sections of the community, and intended to collect revenue from those on the lower ranges of income by way of small compulsory loans for later repayment. Perhaps, of all sections of the . community, the primary producer has most cause to complain under this budget. Many of their implements and tools of trade are to be subject to increased sales tax, the rate of which is to be raised to 10 per cent, even on such articles as axes. The Government is aware that owing to war conditions barbed wire is unprocurable in Australia to-day. The primary producers are obliged to rely on plain wire. Indeed, they are advised daily in departmental letters to use plain wire; yet on that commodity the Government has decided to impose a 10 per cent, tax, whilst other wire, including barbed wire, is still free. We must realize that will depend mainly upon the prices they secure for their products in our present depends very much on the policy and activities of the Commonwealth Bank. Section 11 (2) b of the Commonwealth Bank Act provides that the members of the bank board shall include a representative of the primary producers. Yet only a day ago, following the resignation of the primary producers' representative on that board, the Government appointed to the vacancy a city solicitor who, we are told, is a staunch supporter of unionism in the city of Sydney. Parliament itself decided that members of the Commonwealth Bank Board should be representative of certain interests, including rural pursuits. In the face of that decision of Parliament, how can the Government justify its recent appointment to that board. Fancy replacing a primary producers' representative with a strong unionist, who admits that he does not know too muck about banking, and contends that there is not too much to be known about it! Another remarkable omission from the budget is any suggestion that the Government proposes to nationalize the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. very strongly advocated by supporters of the Government when they were in opposition. They told us that this great octopus was working to the detriment of the nation, and of the wage-earners. This Government, however, has not attempted to give effect, to the wishes of its parliawater cattle. Even the Western Ausmentary advocates in that respect. I do not agree for one moment with that proposal, because I believe that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is Australia's most valued industry. Without its assistance we could not possibly have embarked upon the production of war materials as successfully as we have done since the outbreak of war. It has rendered great assistance to this nation by its efficiency in the production of iron and steel. It is the only producer of iron and steel in Australia. That fact is due to the foresight of the people who established the industry many years ago. Indeed, this Parliament assisted it in its _ early years, and to-day, instead of decrying its success, we should be applauding that company, and hoping that other great industries will be established successfully. Apparently, honourable members opposite have no intention of nationalizing industries which are not successful. advocate the nationalization only of successful industries, and attempt to tickle the ears of unfortunate people who are only too ready to believe that such action will be to the nation's advantage. I recall that some years ago a Queensland Government decided to establish its own steel works. With that object in view it brought out an expert from Canada, Mr want socialism. They are less interested Brophy, who made a survey of the iron ore deposits throughout Australia. On his advice the Queensland Government secured an option of the iron-ore deposits at Yampi Sound. concern to take a lease of those deposits. vernment did not produce any steel. At the same time the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited overcame nil Mr Bernard Corser. its difficulties, and, to-day, has proved most successful. Apparently, because of itssuccess, honourable members opposite now say that that great concern should be taken, over by the Government. Should that be done I venture to say that the experienceThat proposal was of the Commonwealth will be much the same as that of the Queensland Government when it embarked on State enterprises. It bought cattle stations and established butchers' shops. It acquired coal-mines, which produced not coal but. water which was pumped out in order totralian Government also purchased steamers which had to stop in orderto whistle. In these undertakings the Queensland Government lost millionsof pounds. To-day, however, in a time of war honourable members opposite talk about taking over our great successful industries. The one industry of which we should be proud in view of the service it has rendered to this nation in its present hour of need is the iron and steel industry. No greater disability could besuffered by Australia than would be caused by political organizations tampering with an undertaking which mean so much to the development of this young country and which employs 33,000 of our people. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the people will not allow this nation to be wrecked by any policy of nationalization of industry. The honourable member for Melbourne referred to the Labour party's determination to wipe out They capitalism. He and other honourable members of this Parliament are capitalists. There are no greater capitalists in this country than members of the Labour party. The unionists are crying out for increased payments from our capitalist system. They want more and more of thegoods produced under that system, and more and more of its money. They do not in socialism than any other section of the community. Certainly, they are lessinterested in it than the primary producer. I have no doubt that so far as It was the first the unionists are concerned the capitalist system will be maintained, because they However, the Queensland Gobelieve in private ownership of homes and bank accounts. If that were not so we should not have to-day £260,000,000 worth of deposits of working people in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. That is the greatest amount ever held on deposit hy that bank; yet that record has been established under the capitalist system, and at a time when this country is at war. It has been established by the worker?, and not by the primary producers who, unfortunately, cannot afford a bank account. The Minister for Labour and National Services( Mr Ward) was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 23rd October as sayingI f the primary producers wish to work on the land they should insure that the standards shall be only too pleased to accept it as they impose on their workers are the standards in other industries. If the primary producers were able to give effect to the idea they would possess banking accounts. At the same time, however, if that condition of affairs existed the workers would be obliged to pay 4s. per lb. for butter. But the wives of Sydney unionists to-day are protesting against a rise of a penny in the price of butter. Whilst the worker is gradually improving his standard of living, the primary producer has no time to complain, even in drought, and under the stress of war conditions, when, owing to shipping losses, he finds it impossible to market his products. He cannot complain when he is obliged to convert butter factories into cheese factories, and undertake all kinds of expenditure in order to comply with numerous regulations. At such a period, however, the unionists of this country go on strike because they want extra time for a cup of tea, a friend put back in a job, or a rise of 6s. a week. In that way the workers are profiteering in a time of war, when we should all get together and be prepared like the primary producers to meet our obligations, and to make the greatest possible contribution to our war effort. It is also noteworthy that no mention has been made in this budget about the free money which a few honourable members opposite, when they were on this side of the chamber, suggested should be thrown around. the budget of extension of credit beyond the fact that the Government proposes to issue £8,000,000 worth of credit in addition to the sum of £62,000,000 which the Fadden Government proposed to provide in that way. Honourable members opposite advocated the wiping out of all loans through the extension of credit. They were going to provide a costless credit. However, this Government adheres to the old system of loans, and is asking the people to contribute to public loans. The talk of honourable members opposite with regard to credit and free money has been attempted in every country in the world. However, if they can give effect to such a policy and show that it is in the interests of the country, I a means of financing the Government of this nation. But that will not be so. Instead of applying their miraculous credit expansion policy, as we might have expected them to do, we find honourable gentlemen opposite actually attaoking the banks. It has been claimed by them that the banks create credit and by that means provide themselves with money from time to time for investment in loans. In this connection, however, I direct attention to a statement which appeared in Hansard on the 26th June, 1931, volume 130, page 3132, in a speech delivered by the then Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) on the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill, showing how government securities were held at that time. It reads as follows:HOW GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ARE HELD. £ State Savings Banks. . 83,000,000 Commonwealth Bank (including Savings Bank) .. . . 65,000,000 Joint Stocks Banks. . . . 20,000,000 Superannuation funds .. 9,000,000 Other governmental and semi governmental funds . . 12,000,000 Insurance companies . . 35,000,000 Friendlv societies .. 3,000,000 Public* .. .. . . 329,000,000 556,000,000 That does not lend much support to the argument that the banks are the principal holders of government securities, for We find no mention in only £20,000,000 was held at that time by the joint stock banks. The table in fact is a complete exposure of the fallacy that the banking companies create credits for themselves. If a person wins the Golden Casket and buys banking shares with his money in the hope that thereby he w ill be able to multiply the £10,000 or £20,000 wou in the Casket he w ill be doomed to bitter disappointment. If the banks could create credit just as they wished they would undoubtedly have increased their capital very greatly, but they have not done so. Some honourable gentlemen opposite have placed great reliance in the statements contained in paragraph 504 of the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. They say that there is set out in that paragraph a means by which credits could be expanded in a remarkable degree. Paragraph 504 statesThe Commonwealth Bank could lend to governments and others in various ways and it could even make money available to governments and others free of charge. Paragraph 493 of the report statedThe limit of expansion is set by the necessity for maintaining adequate cash reserves. Paragraph 494 statedI t is obvious that this process of expansion requires customers who deposit and customers who borrow. In regard to monetary reform and the shortage of purchasing power, the commission statedWo are unable to find that the social credit theory offers any solution. Paragraph 506 of the report pointed out that the power and capacity of the Commonwealth Bank is limited ""hy an obligation to pay in legal tender whenever it is called upon to do so "". If it expands credit, it will sooner or later be called' upon to expand the note issue and, as the royal commission "" there is a practical limit as well as a legal one"" to that process. fact is that the possibility of doing very much under the provisions of paragraph 504 of the royal commission's report is extremely limited. the Government debt of £1,300,000,000 by the release of credits or the issue of interest-free then by all means let it do so and the sooner the better. method' of finance if it will our debts and free our local bodies and other public from the shackles of debt. Let us have this new system if it can be shown that it Mr Bernard Corser. w i ll be of any advantage to the community. But the great financiers of the Labour party w ill not be able to show any such thing. If private banks have had such a damaging effect on the community, why did a former Labour Prime Minister( Mr. Scullin) state on the 8th August, 1930The Loan Council expresses appreciation of the co-operation of the banks in assisting the governments to meet their serious exchange difficulties overseas. On the 5th November, 1930, Mr Scullin sent a cable to the then Commonwealth Treasurer, Mr Lyons, which readYour telegram of November4 received. The banks are expected to carry any shortage in budgets, also to underwrite loan conversions. That, together with the responsibility to finance the harvest, will be a heavy strain on the banks. To create credit for £20,000,000 for loan works is unsound and I expect the banks to refuse to do so. So much for the value of paragraph 504 of the royal commission's report! Some of the words of that paragraph, if used alone and isolated from the context of the report, are misleading. The context itself shows how undesirable such a course would be. It is true that the commission used the words: "" The Commonwealth Bank could even make money available to governments free of charge"". I hope that the Government w ill administer the affairs of this country to money the advantage of the Empire and of Australia. I hope, too, that it w ill be able to finance our war effort satisfactorily. But we shall need not only words of wisobserved, dom, but also wise administration. Words alone w ill get us nowhere. We The plain shall require something more than the advocacy of the monetary theories of K a r l Marx, or some other visionary. We shall want a policy which w ill not be If it be possible for detrimental to either the wage-earners or to liquidate our public to ithe primary producers of the country. Honourable members on this side of the money, committee w ill give the Government every support within their power if it Let us have this new will make a really effective war effort, eliminate and apply a policy that w ill ensure governing adequate support for our men who are instrumentalities serving the Empire on the sea, on the land, or in the a i r; but we demand such a policy as the price of our support. had not intended to contribute to the dethe right honourable member for Kooyong bate, but I am impelled to refute the statement of the honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser) that the Trades and Labour Council in the different States is allied with the Communist party. between any member of the Communist party and the Labour party.

Even the honourable member for Wide Bay must admit that none of those gentlemen is in any way connected with the Communist party. The representatives of Western Australia are the present included in the Ministry, and refused to Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr committees that were appointed.

The same applies to the representatives of Tasmania, who are Mr D'Alton, M.H.A., Mr Brooker, M.H.A., Gray, M.H.A. The other States are represented by gentlemen of similar calibre. Having heard these names mentioned, the honourable member for Wide Bay must agree that his statement was definitely incorrect in regard to not only decide who shall govern Australia. Queensland but also the other States. I congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr of the invalid and old-age pension. Chifley) on the very fine budget that he has brought down in the short period of three weeks. Some honourable members of the Opposition have claimed that the foundation of it was laid by the last Government, whilst others have described it as a vote-winning budget. The honourable member for Wide Bay protested that it does not contain provision for the use of national credit; yet only last week ( Mr Menzies) stated that it contains provision for the use of £100,000,000 worth of national credit. Honourable members opposite are divided in their views as an Opposition, just as they were There is not an alliance as a Government. They had every opportunity to give to this country a lead in the war effort during the two years of war that they were in power. They certainly began a war effort, but petty jealousies and internal wrangling caused them to become disintegrated as a party, and ultimately the brains of the party were blown out by the deposition of the right honourable member for Kooyong from the office of Prime Minister.

188,"Mr Barnard, M.h.r., And Mr Dwyer","increase the pension to 23s. 6d. a week immediately, and next March to fulfil the election promise made by the present Prime Minister as Leader of the Opposition, by raising the amount to 25s. a week. ""Who will say that that is too much for the pioneers who laid the foundations which enabled Australia to become the nation that it is to-day? I trust that the Government will fulfil as soon as possible the promise made to the pensioners. Another promise which the Government is determined to fulfil is that which was made to the soldiers. Government members, at least, will agree that 6s. a day, with an additional 2s. a day as deferred pay, is little enough to give to men who are prepared to risk their all for our benefit and the protection of this country. The previous Government proposed to increase the pay of the soldiers by Is. a day, but to defer the payment, so that a succeeding government would have to find the money. It was not intended that interest should be paid on the amount so deferred. I trust that the increased benefits to be given to the soldiers and to invalid and old-age pensioners are only two instalments of the Labour party's policy, and that, as we proceed, social legislation will be enacted which the people have been promised for the last ten years but which, until now, the Labour party has not had an opportunity to put into operation. The honourable member for Corangawinded statement to-night in respect of our attitude towards the members of the home services. I was interested in the proposal of the then General, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), a few years ago, for the raising of a militia force of 70,000 men. The response to the appeal then made was so great, especially in -Queensland, that the right honourable gentleman said that it was not possible to -cope with the number of men offering. I remind the honourable member for 'Corangamite that when that attempt was made to raise a militia force of 70,000 men, the rate of pay offered hy . the Government was 8s. a day. A few months afterwards, however, the IIr. Conelan. party to which he belongs repudiated that promise given to the members of the Militia Forces and reduced their pay from Ss. to 5s. a day. It was left to the present Government to increase the rate paid to the home service men of Australia. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who is a member of the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee, ably stressed the fact that, in the far north of Queensland, 1,000 engineers are practically idle. Unless their services are utilized to the best advantage, we cannot have an all-in war effort. Numerous industries in Queensland did not receive a fair deal from the previous Government. For the last two years artisans have been leaving that State because insufficient work is available. In Victoria the previous Government mobilized the services of motor garage employees in the metropolitan area so that they could contribute to the war effort. Similar action should be taken in the other States. I trust that the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) will have a survey made of all idle motor garage workshops throughout Australia, with a. view to their participation in the war effort. I hope that the Government will go ahead fearlessly with the Labour party's policy, and that, when its action does not meet with the approval of a majority in this Parliament, the party will face the people and ask for a mandate to carry out its policy. object in taking part in this debate is to reply to some of the amazing statements made by the honourable member for the wool agreement. As a practical woolAttorneygrower, I was keenly interested in the agreement at the time when it was made. It has been pointed out that under the agreement the growers received in the first year 3d. per lb. more than the price paid for their wool in the year prior to the war, but that statement would probably mislead the public because during the year prior to the war the Australian clip was sold at the ruinous average price of lOd. per lb. In considering the fact that an agreement was entered into for acceptance of the Australian wool clip at the price of about 13^d. per lb., it should be remembered that the previous price of",59,Budget 1941 42 Revised

I dispute tbe contention -of tbe honourable member for Corangamite that Australia is lucky that the agreement was entered into, and I consider that a review of the position is long overbers of it expressed the hope that such a due. I am amazed at his statement that wool-growers in his electorate are satisfied with the position under the agreement. I criticized the agreement in this House about six weeks ago, and I have had letters concerning my remarks from various parts of Australia, including ""Western Australia, and from several organizations. Even some of the big woolbrokers admit that the agreement is unfair to Australia. The price of wool has a tremendous -effect on the internal economy of Australia, and the Government, in its own interests, should have the agreement reviewed. As wool is as precious to-day as gold as a medium of exchange, I ask what is wrong with those who represent Australia in the negotiation of such agreements ? I understand that the price of tea is controlled in the same way as the price of wool, but the price of tea has gone up by about Is. 7d. per lb. The Government should not stand by and see the people of Australia exploited. Huge profits are being made out of the sale of Australian wool. The growers are supposed to get half of the profit made by the sale of their wool under the agreement, but I do not see why they should not get the whole of it. The growers were to receive half of the profit from the sale get anything else to do. The man of greasy wool, but owing to the spinning of the wool into tops the growers have received no share of the profit. America is crying out for more of our wool, and we shall also be called upon to supply wool to Eussia and our other Allies. Of course, the wool will be shipped overseas, because it is granted priority over other commodities. I urge the present Government not to wait until next May for the review of the agreement, because then the third clip will have been sold at the ruinous prices at which wool has already been disposed of under the agreement. The cost of superphosphate has increased by nearly £3 a ton since the outbreak of war, and on that account alone the cost of production of wool has gone up by over Id. per lb. Pleasure has been expressed by some honourable members at the intention of the Government to provide for the establishment of a mortgage bank. When the Opposition was in power, various membank would be set up, but I doubt very much whether the project would have been realized if anti-Labour governments had continued in office. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Badman) has been a member of this Parliament for many years, but he has never previously addressed himself to the subject of the establishment of a mortgage bank in the way he did last night. Why did he not use his influence in that direction with the previous Government? Many farmers have lost their properties, although they were in a sound financial position, merely because they could not get suitable financial accommodation. Years ago there should have been a mortgage bank, which would have enabled such men to obtain money on easy terms for long periods. The Commonwealth Bank was shackled in 1924 by the Bruce-Page Government, and so it was prevented from giving them any assistance. The Government has been criticized for its recent appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board, but we know that a nationalist government a few years ago appointed a famous polo player to the board, though no one knew what his other qualifications were for (he job. Usually, the appointees were old political dead-beats who could not appointed by this Government is a young, virile Australian with a sound knowledge of banking. Those appointed by previous governments had no knowledge of banking beyond owning bank shares. I congratulate the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) upon, so soon after taking office, giving the wheat-growers adequate representation on the Australian Wheat Board. Previous governments appointed to the board middlemen who farmed the farmers. I should like to know the qualifications of those who sit on the British Phosphate Commission which has recently put up the price of phosphatic rock -Recently, a man gave evidence before the Joint Committee on Rural Industries, a fine fat man, who had obviously lived well all his life.

192,Mr Mcleod.,"our chemists will put it right. There is a great future before Australia. In the years to come, we shall probably have the budgets three or four times as big as the present one. However, we shall never progress as we should if our economic development is left in the hands of private banking concerns. That is why I am glad that there is now in power a Labour government to control our finances. Financial reform is coming, and the banks know it. They will fight it, of course, and I do not blame them. Naturally, they will try to defend their privileges. The Government must be determined to control the destinies of Australia, and not to leave the control in the hands of private individuals for their own benefit. surer) [10.40] -in replyI shall not detain the committee at length in replying to the discussion on the budget, but I desire, first, to set out briefly the reasons of the party were required to say "" Yes"" why a Labour Government is in office in the Commonwealth to-day. The reason is not that the Labour party endeavoured in any way to distract the former Government from its war effort, or failed to co-operate fully with it. Rather is it that those who formed the previous Administration could not reach a reasonable degree of harmony amongst themselves, muchless achieve harmony among the people of this country, in conducting its war effort. It could be said that Labour accepted office as a national duty. Before the previous Government lost the confidence of the people it had lost the confidence of the members of the parties constituting it. ment may have a similar experience before long. have been times when there has not been budget of his predecessor. complete harmony in the Labour movement.

[10 ] Government, and because that Government, by its own actions, lost its nearmajority in this House, that the Labour party is now in office. One complaint against the budget is that the present Government has done too much in too short a period. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) suggested that because so many measures were brought forward the Government could not have given proper consideration to its proposed legislation before submitting it to the Parliament. He hinted at a lack of proper examination by Ministers, and that some kind of administrative "" gestapo"" was responsible for the budget. I do not think that any budget which has been presented to this Parliament had to undergo a more careful scrutiny than the one which I presented to this House a few weeks ago. Previous governments adopted the practice of delegating to certain individuals in the Cabinet the right to prepare a budget and bring it forward. Supporters to the proposals contained in the budget, and to support them warmly. does not believe that? was first carefully scrutinized by me and by the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini). After that scrutiny, and before any bill was presented to Cabinet, the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), whose ability to analyse a measure no one doubts, carefully scrutinized the budget and the legislation based on it. After that, the budget was placed before the Cabinet and finally before the party as a whole. I doubt whether any previous careful analysis and criticism.

199,Mr Chifley,"I am a member of aI think that the honourable member for Robertson was unfair in reflecting on those public servants in the Treasury and Taxation Departments who have assisted in the preparation of this budget. He suggested that they forced their views on the Government. I have explained the circumstances associated with the preparation of the budget, and I say now, as. one who has had a good deal of association with members of the Public Service in Canberra, that I do not know of a more highly qualified body of public servants, or of a fairer body of men generally. I do not expect men in public departments of tbe Commonwealth to say "" yes"" to every proposal put before them. I like to treat the heads of public departments as men who are free to place their views before me. I expect to weigh anything that tbey submit to me. I treat them as friends. After all, the Treasurer himself is a public servant. I regret that the honourable member for Robertson should have tried to create the impression that these public servants are tyrants who are able to dictate to Ministers. I remind him that at one time he himself was regarded as something in the nature of a tyrant when he decided to fix the length of bathing costumes. Minister should be a tyrant than that public servants should be tyrants. by the Opposition appears to be that the budget is likely to receive popular approval from the masses of the people. It has been described as a vote-winning budget rather than a war-winning budget. The Labour Government has had the courage to impose both direct and indirect taxation because it believes that, as far as possible, the war should be paid for as we go rather than that a huge debt should be piled up for posterity to meet. I do not know how the previous Government proposed to pay back the compulsory loans which its budget provided for. paid back in the same way as the present Government expects the £137,000,000 to be repaid. ways of repaying these amounts. One is to impose heavy taxation after the war upon a country which is then attempting to rehabilitate itself. posals there will be no money for -rehabilitation. means of heavy taxation was not the method proposed by the previous Government, what was its intention? £137,000,000 be repaid? previous Government intended to adopt the same methods as we propose, namely, an expansion of credit. There are only two methods of repaying compulsory loans, and it is evident that the previous Government envisaged an expansion of credit. There has also been some criticism of the proposed increase of the pay of soldiers. Some honourable gentlemen have said that the soldiers themselves would prefer an increase of their deferred pay. Other sections of the community which claim to be badly treated under the Government's proposals have approached me, but I have yet to hear of a soldier who objects to the payments being made in the way proposed by the present Government. If honourable members opposite are able to prove that there is an overwhelming volume of opinion amongst soldiers against paying this money to them now, I shall be astonished. soldiers have never approached any Government for extra money. cial, who claimed to speak on behalf of the Army, said that the Government's decision in regard to the pay of soldiers had given great satisfaction to all ranks. the proposal for deferred pay. said it publicly, or sufficiently loudly to be heard at a distance. They must have whispered it in some back corridor, because I have not heard anything to that effect.

211,Mr Chifley,"They could not havesliould make heavy inroads upon it. Indirect taxation is already doing so, and I remind the honorahle gentleman that some of the profits which were made by the friends of the Opposition were wrung from the working class. The higher their wages, the more the profiteers took as their price for carrying on peace-time, will now be asked to live the war. Because of that, the Government makes no apology for insisting that the wealthy section of the community, who in peace and war have done so well out of Australia, should be compelled to bear their full share of the burden. To me, it is extraordinary to find members of the Opposition suddenly discovering that most severe taxation should be imposed upon the lower income groups. A brief survey of our economic history during the last decade is most instructive. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Great As the result of the war, a number of workers are definitely receiving higher wages than they did a few years ago. Others, who were formerly in receipt of the dole, have now found employment. But for ten years, the working class, which is now expected to assist in the conduct of the war either on the battlefield or in the munitions factories, was treated worse than farm horses or pit ponies in the mines. They were thrown into the streets, where they were left to starve. Despite that treatment, they are now expected suddenly to develop intense feelings of patriotism. To their eternal credit they have done so, although they had suffered the greatest privations, because of the insistence of the United Australia party and the United Country party coalition governments upon the observance of an antiquated banking policy. The workers waited at the gates of factories, begging for jobs; and when they were refused employment, they were obliged to accept the paltry dole. ""While the workers were practically starving fashion journals advertised expensive luxuries. I regret that many of the leading newspapers published photographs of women with bare backs, in "" swagger "" restaurants. The workers, whose wives and daughters lived in misery and degradation, will not quickly forget that. Now, we are suddenly told that the great mass of the workers must be ground down again, and the last penny extracted from them, in order to finance the conduct of the war. Are they to continue to suffer the horrors that they endured in peace? The Labour party makes no apology for extending to them every possible consideration. Only as a last resort shall we ask them to endure the hardships with which the Opposition proposed to saddle them. People who lived well in modestly. Again we make no apology for that. Honourable members opposite have expressed concern at what they describe as the ""gap between revenue and expenditure for 1941-42"". To hear their lamentations, one would be pardoned for thinking that the Padden budget contained no gap between income and expenditure, and that Australia was the only country in that plight. According to Britain, which is imposing the most severe taxation upon the people in order to finance the war has a gap between income and expenditure this year of £250,000,000. If the Government were to impose most onerous burdens upon the people, they would have nothing to lose even if Germany won the war. Regarding the Government's proposals for the expansion of credit, the Opposition has claimed that, unless many lines of goods are severely rationed in order to enable workers to be diverted from civil to war production; inflation is inevitable. If the Opposition imagines that the Government has not surveyed all the possibilities, weighed every factor and taken into consideration all the requirements for an all-in war effort, it is sadly mistaken. I hope that the Government will achieve results, and will not, like its predecessor, talk month after month of what it proposes to do, and finally attempt nothing. I hope, further, that when the Government considers that the national interest demands that certain action should be taken, it will not suddenly promulgate regulations, appoint a board, and experience the bungling which occurred in connection with petrol rationing and with the marketing of apples and pears. I trust that the administration under the Labour government will function as smoothly and as equitably as is possible, considering the extraordinary nature of the times. I do not propose to indulge in a fierce banks; we shall depend on their undertirade of abuse of private banking institutions. My views upon tbe subject are contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. ""What is the position regarding the firm, agreement that the previous Government made with the banks ? Since the outbreak of war certain events have occurred in our banking system. Do honourable members imagine that the previous Government did not in some measure expand credit? trolled. shall tell honourable members opposite about that. All that previous governments did was to expand credit to some degree. The expanded credit flowed out to the public and it came back over the counter to the private banks. All the private banks had to do was to put the pen to certain papers and incur some slight administrative costs. After that, because they were unable to find avenues for their investments outside, they loaned back to the Government a substantial amount of the money which the Government itself had created out of the resources of the comonunity, charging a certain rate of interest. The Government had to pay the same rate of interest for the loan of money created by itself as it paid to ordinary private investors: The Leader of the Opposition moderately estimated the investable surplus of the private banks at £40,000,000. I need not go into that because it involves the question of London funds. I am content with saying that the honourable gentleman underestimated the amount of money that flowed into the private banks. The Government, led by the Leader of the Opposition said: ""Let us see what we can do to stop this scandal."" I point out that it did not act until this matter became a public scandal. I venture to suggest that even the private banks themselves realized that the practice could not be continued much longer. Having permitted the private banks to get all this easy money for two years, the former Government said: """"We shall make a gentleman's agreement with the taking to keep it . "" I say, frankly, on behalf of the present Government, that if the private banks are prepared to give us the measure of co-operation that they indicate they are willing to give, and which the Leader of the Opposition said they promised to him, if they realize that they cannot go on building up their assets to a great magnitude through free money obtained from the people of this country while at the same time they do nothing to assist the war effort, neither the Prime Minister nor any member of the Government will be unwilling to give them an opportunity to prove their bona fides. ""We propose to determine by regulation what shall be done with these investable surpluses. Honourable members opposite, notably the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), who are great advocates of compulsion and would compel all those in receipt of lower incomes to pay higher taxes, want the great financial institutions of this country to function under a gentleman's agreement. The arguments they advance as to what ordinary people should do are quite different from those they submit when dealing with the question of what should be demanded from the banks and financial institutions which are getting all this easy money. Honourable members opposite, with tongue in cheek, say that, because of certain powers to be vested in the Treasurer, a new dictatorship is arising in Australia. They know only too well that the Treasurer, whoever he may be, whether he be the present Leader of the Opposition or myself, is, after all, a servant of the people, a creature of the Government of which he is a member, the agent of the executive which is conducting the government of this country. For any honourable member to think that any Treasurer, who, in the exercise of the wide powers vested in him, created chaos overnight, would be permitted to remain in office for 24 hours is the sheerest nonsense. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) made some remarks about me last night which may, I think, lead the people to believe that a new form of dictatorship had arisen in this country.

It is in office, not because itby the Minister for Commerce( Mr harried and persecuted the Eadden Government, but because the Eadden Government was not -able to govern its own supporters, much less to govern the country. We are in office because of the demand of the majority of the people that there should be stability of government in the Commonwealth sphere. If honourable members opposite give to us the same measure of co-operation that we gave to the former Government, and place the same confidence in the common sense of the Prime Minister as we did when we were in Opposition, I have no hesitation in saying that the confidence of the people in the principle of democratic government will improve rather than deteriorate. I am not concerned about my personal position in this Parliament; but I am very much concerned about the preservation of the democratic system of government in this country. I appeal to all honourable members, regardless of their differences on specific subjects, to present a united front to the world on the main issues that confront the nation. Because we differ on certain matters of policy is not a reason why we should spend our time in holding up each other to ridicule because, by doing that, we also Government of the United Kingdom asked the hold up the National Parliament to ridicule. No Treasurers are infallible. I realize that there may be some defects in the budget which I have presented, just as there may be some anomalies in some of the complementary measures that have been introduced. Bearing in mind the fact that every possible penny of revenue must be obtained for the purposes of carrying on the war, if it can be proved that these measures will impose a gross injustice on the people, the Prime Minister and the members of his Government will be willing to reconsider them.

Because of its important implications to primary industry generally, I direct attention to the statement made to-day Scully) in answer to a question I asked about the price which would be paid for export eggs this season. He said that owing to circumstances which had changed since the previous Government held office there was some likelihood of the undertaking which had been given by that Government that the price to be paid for eggs to poultrymen would be reduced owing to the lack of shipping space or to some other circumstances. Eggs do not loom very large in the agricultural economy of this country, but an important principle is at stake, because, if the Government repudiates the undertaking which was given by the previous Government to egg producers, it is equally possible that it will repudiate other undertakings given to butter producers, wheat-growers and other primary producers. The poultrymen were promised that the price which would be paid for their eggs this season would not be less than that paid to them last season, but the Minister, in his reply, saidI do not feel bound by a promise that was made by my predecessor, particularly since, in this instance, plans for the export of eggs to the United Kingdom were considerably altered since the undertaking had been given. The Commonwealth Government to withhold certain supplies of eggs, and to forward another rationed substitute. Consequently, the position has altered materially since the right honourable member for Cowper gave that undertaking. For that reason it would be most unreasonable to expect me to adhere to it rigidly.

Other primary producers are placed in a similar position, because restriction of shipping space may easily occur in relation to butter or other export commodities. The previous Government arranged that if the export of butter was interfered with the dairymen would be paid regardless of whether the butter was exported or not. Arrangements were made whereby the butter would be held in cold storage. were completed there is nothing which this Government is called upon to do. ister is quibbling. producers are fully aware of the undertakings which were given by the previous Government. I suggest to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Commerce that the Government should give serious consideration to this matter, the principle of which involves the whole of our exportable primary products. serious position has arisen in my electorate with regard to war service homes and I should have liked the Minister for War Service Homes( Mr Frost) to have been present, but, in his absence, I ask the Minister for Social Services( Mr mission the extension of repayment Holloway) to take heed of what I have to say, because the matter indirectly concerns him as the Minister responsible for social services in this community. It appears that the War Service Homes Department is taking advantage of the rise of property values and rentals to dispossess the occupants of war service homes who have fallen into arrears in their repayments or who, strictly speaking, are not entitled to occupy war service homes but who came into possession .of them in the depression when many legitimate occupants were either evicted or gave up their homes because of their inability to maintain payments. The result of the present policy is tliat people engaged on vital war work have been evicted and now find it hard to obtain other accommodation. In order to illustrate the position which has arisen I shall cite, some of the cases which have come to my notice. One occupant purchased his property in 1922. He is employed by ""the Sydney County Council and his dependants are a wife and two children under the age of sixteen years. In addition he has two sons in the Australian Imperial Force and one son in the Royal Australian A i r Force. The balance of his liability at the 30th June last was £605 12s. 7d. It will be another twenty years before his house is free of debt. I do not blame tbe War Service Homes Commission for the application of the present policy, because, no doubt, he is acting on instructions that, if the occupants do not keep up their payments, they must be dispossessed in order to allow the occupancy of the homes by people who are able to The primary meet their commitments. The second case is that of a man wbo received an advance of £789 5s. 8d. in 1924. At the 30th June last his liability amounted to £840 10s., considerably more than the original advance in spite of the fact that he has been in occupation for seventeen years. The monthly instalments of repayment amount to £3 l is . Id. and the total payments by the tenant-purchaser amount to £519 12s. 9d., which is about two-thirds of the original advance. After making repayments for that long period he still owes more than the original advance. According to the Comperiod to 45 years would increase the monthly instalments from £3 l is . Id. to £4 4s. 2d. In another case an original advance of £818 was made in 1924. During the depression the purchaser, owing to unemployment, fell into arrears. The home was recapitalized. He has paid an ' amount of £59S, yet an amount of £871,",67,Adjournment Export Of Eggs War Service Homes

224,Mr Morgan (Reid) [11.16],"Awhich is greater than the original advance, is still owing after seventeen years. In another instance, the purchaser's repayments totalled £657, including principal, interest and insurance, on an original advance of £891. On the 19th November, 1941, he still owed £827, which is almost as much as the original advance. orable member competent to handle this matter with the Minister instead of taking up the time of the House in this way? that honourable gentlemen who are calling upon our young men to make great sacrifices and go overseas and fight for them do not seem to be anxious to sacrifice a little of 'their sleep. If they who are now returning from this war. do not leave the chamber, they wriggle in their seats, when an honourable member seeks to obtain better conditions for these young men and the men who fought for this country in the last war. I am merely bringing to the notice of the Minister, conditions which arose under the previous Administration in the hope that the new Government will rectify them. In another case an original advance of £675 was made in 1920, and the purchaser's liability at the 30th June, 1941, was £4S7. In another case an original advance of £825 was made in 1937, and at the 31st May, 1941, the purchaser's liability was £799. In another case a returned soldier from the last war, who is now 61 years of age, received an original advance of £933, and his total repayments amount to £837, including principal, interest and insurance. That man is married and has two sons, one of whom is serving on a warship. Owing to ilUiealth he had to give up his employment and to-day his total weekly income is £3 0s. 6d., including his pension. He will have to continue his repayments for another 20 or 30 years, and as he is now 61 years of age, he will have to live to be nearly 100 years of age before he can pay off his home. He wrote to the Assistant Minister for Repatriation asking for relief. His weekly rent was 18s. 10d., and the term for repayment of the loan was spread over 37 years. In order to assist him the commission in 1934 temporarily capitalized arrears amounting to £28 10s. 6d. The monthly instalment was reduced to £3 13s. 6d. but the interest rate of 4 per cent, was not reduced. I submit that the whole of this problem with regard to war service homes arises because of the high interest rates payable. For these long periods, men have been paying high interest to the bondholders who originally supplied the money. I ask the new Government to devise a scheme with a view to providing credit facilities through the Commonwealth Rank in order to enable these men to pay off their homes within a reasonable period. The homes in such instances as I have mentioned, should be recapitalized, and the interest reduced to nominal rates. Such a scheme should be devised not only in respect of soldiers who served in the last war, but also those I also urge the Government not to dispossess the occupants of these homes, whether they be returned soldiers who have been making repayments for long periods, or munitions workers. If such a scheme were devised I can see no reason why every returned soldier should not be able to pay off his home within a reasonable period of say 10 to 15 years, have his own home when he reaches middle age, and then enjoy some of the amenities of life.

In the meantime, I have arranged for a limited order to be placed with the Clyde Engineering Company Limited to meet the immediate situation. This must not be taken as a precedent by any other firm in maintaining continuity of operations. The order now made will meet temporarily the difficulty that had arisen .regarding the employnoticement of these men and will give the company the time necessary to arrange for the absorption of these men in other avenues of production.
