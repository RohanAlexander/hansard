There have been occasions when, with the permission of Mr President and myself, the Queen's Hall has been used for exhibitions which it was considered would be of an intellectual and informative character, and of interest to members generally. In this connection I might say that something of the kind is contemplated next week, in the nature of a musical programme associated with "" music week "" under the direction of a University Professor, to which, I think, no real objection can be taken. Members might obtain from the entertainment some relief from the tension and nervous irritation sometimes created by political discussion; but if serious objection is offered to what is proposed,I shall confer wibh the President of the Senate with a view to preventing the use of the Queen's Hall for similar purposes in future.'

I am endeavouring now to redeem the promise that I made, and I ask the Committee to accept the Senate's request with the modifications set out in the motion. I do not know who is advising the M in i ster ( Mr Greene) on tlie items relating to iron and steel, but it seems to me that he is treating very badly those who stood by the Government in relation to other items in the Tariff. The iron and steel industry is the key industry of Australia. When the items relating to iron and steel were originally before the Committee, statements were made by responsible Ministers to the effect that those engaged in the industry had not approached the Government, and did not require the duties that I was urging should be i m posed. On the House resuming, in September last, after a short vacation, I made a personal explanation, in wbich I showed that the people engaged in the industry had not only approached the Government in support of higher duties, out had done so as far back as 4th June, 1919. ancl, by request, had supplied tha Department of Trade and Customs with particulars as to their requirements as late as May last. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) would have supported the duties which I was urging the Committee to accept but that he was I ' d to believe that the people engaged in the industry had not asked for them. P-e. saidAndI have not heard that the proprietors of the Newcastle works have asked for additional protection. If they had done so and made out a case, as they might have done through the Minister, or the press, or by circularizing honourable members, there might have been some excuse for giving their industry additional protection. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. .Earle Page) also saidTt is remarkable that the Broken Hill Promade a request that the protection prietary Company Limited, who are producing the bulk of the steel, are not asking for this protection. . . They have not asked for it, unless it be within the last few days. I i i fairness to those who supported the increases for which I moved, I think it should be known that those engaged in the industry here had actually asked for the increase, and had supplied the Department from time to time with information as to the duties that were necessary to keep the iron and steel industry I do not think they of Australia going. It is not fair that responsible Ministers should make misleading statements. One of the firms engaged in drawing wireI refer to the Messrs.

When this item' was originally before the Committee amendments were made in the gauges of wire set out in it , and the effect was to rob the local industry of a considerable amount of protection. The Senate has granted in respect of one particular size or gauge of wire shall be wholly wiped out, thus leaving the industry at the mercy of the most glaring dumping that I think we shall ever be able to find.

I should like' to know why the proposed duties on wire are necessa'ry, seeing that the local manufacturers of it are protected against importations by the high freight chairges, and seeing, too, that they get cheap coal.' The prices that were quoted by the honourable member were entirely misleading. When we were dealing with a previous i'tem interested influence was suggested, and we were told that we could not take much notice of either side. But as one who purchases 'this black wire, I know positively that the information quoted: by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins"") is wrong.

The trouble with the local industry is that it commenced under war conditions, and those defending it desire to retain those conditions, whereas the general tendency in pll industries, is to return to pre-war conditions. The primary proT h e y fly the Union ducer has to submit to pre-war prices for his product, but those who .supply him w it h . the material used in his industry ask that . .he should be compelled to continue to pay war-time prices.

The Committee seems very ready to come to the help of the secondary producer, and no doubt it is nice to extend gracious patronage at the expense of the other fellow.

I have no for Swan has blown out that argument long ago. member f b r Swan has blown himself-out. As the facts of the case are not particularly acceptable to the honourable member, I shall place some of them before the Committee, and leave him to refute them if he can. The Tariff came into operation on 25th March, 1920, and in A p r i l following the local price of No. 8 gauge black burnished fencing wire was Â£24 10s., and the price of the English article was Â£ 4 2 .

157,Mr Gregory (Dampier) [4.46],"W eparty has said again and again that it is prepared to support a moderate Tariff, but only when such a Tariff is essential to the building up of an industry. We have had the sworn statement of the manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company that it was prepared to enter upon the steel industry here, and build up its business, without any assistance whatever fro m this Parliament. He said that it wanted neither a duty, a bounty, nor a subsidy. The value of the ore obtained by the company from the Iron Knob, South Australia, is double that of the ores that are imported into Britain, so that it takes 2 tons of the latter to produce *what 1 ton of I r o n Knob ore w ill give. The BrokenH ill Company has this enormous deposit of high-grade ore right on the sea-board, and it has its own vessels and wharfs, and coal within a mile or two of its works. It has also one of the most up-to-date plants in the world. What more should it require? We have a right to expect manufacturers w i th all tliese facilities to be able to compete with those of other countries. No greater advantage could have been given the manufacturers of Australia than was conferred on them by the recent great war, when prices advanced by leaps and bounds. There was then no l i m it to the price which a manufacturer could get for 1 his output. He was able to make enormous profits, out of which he could provide for up-to-date so manufacturers We are prepared 'to give a moderate Tariff, and I regard it as unfair for honourable member after honourable member to quote statements every one of which is from the circular issued by the Rylands Company. Let us take the price that that firm says they were supplying goods at in Australia in December,. 1919. Their price, according to the circular, was Â£ 2 2 10s., when the British price was Â£39. pelled to buy wire say that they obtained any advantage from those low prices? Again, we are. told that this firm was' selling at Â£ 2 4 10s. when the British price was Â£43. D i d purchasers in Australia get any advantage? I think the general reply, if it were given, would be that nothing was seen of any such low 1 prices. ber say that thÂ© statements in the cirbe a duty on wire sufficient to enable the . this firm were selling at such low prices the. wholesaler and retailer must have got abnormal profits. It would be unfair for me to suggest that the statements made by the firm are untrue; but I say that the consumer did not gain any advantage iby it . They are now asking that on wire over 12-gauge there shall be a duty of 20 per cent, as against Great Britain. In the firm's circular we are toldI t will be seen that throughout the war we have supplied the Australian market with fencing wire at practically one-half the price the British manufacturer charged. Now, I cannot believe thatThe price in the United States and in Canada was practically the same as in England. able member say that he cannot believe the statement? quoted to me, when I was obtaining figures for the general Tariff debate, were double those quoted in the circular from Rylands. very definite statement of fact. sible that their output would be so small as to be unnoticeable in the market. If so, the consumer again has to pay. plants, and The circular goes onf it himself to compete with in other countries. We adopted the policy of fixing the price merchants had to sell our wire atThat is a most dangerous policy^ one to which I have grave objection. When wo were dealing with the Tariff BoardB ill , and also when the Tariff was before us, I pointed to the undesirability of such a practice. The circular continuesand the. result of this is that Australian farmers have been able to buy their fencing wire at less than half the price farmers in any Can any one who has been comother country have had to pay. Then furtherOwing to the low price being quoted for Belgian wire, large quantities of which are now coming into Australia, we had to reduce the price of our wire to Â£20 per ton, which is below actual cost of production, and at which we.are making a material loss.

They' came into the business during the war. during the war freight charges were so heavy as to make it impossible to bring here in any quantity the commodities referred to. The prices were then 300 and 400 per cent, above pre-war prices, so that had the commodities been available they would not have been purchased. No one could buy wire or wire netting at the prices that' then prevailed, unless it were a bundle here and there for the repair of a fence. Â£80 a ton. 0 ting did, but the maximum price for wire 'Was Â£50, and during the greater part of the war it could not be obtained for less than Â£40 a ton. I do not expect to get these commodities nOw at pre-war prices, but we may hope to get them for prices much lower than we have been paying, and much lower than the latest quotations. During the war no purchases of wire and wire netting worth speaking of were made. There were no improvements or extensions carried out. Everything was in abeyance until prices should come down to a reasonable figure. What is now proposed is a very big impost on commodities that are a plain bread-andcheese line for the primary producers. Wire and wire netting can be made without the manufacturers having to pay large sums for patent rights. The processes are simple. They are not the result of brainy experiments, for which the users of the articles might fairly be expected to pay highly. Both commodities are essential, especially in the far interior, and are needed to open up new country to provide for immigration. Fcr a bread-and-cheese line the duties are excessive. equivalent of the rates on the present prices of wire? siderable. The Minister can work it out for himself. what are the prices that are being' charged, and that are likely to obtain? It has been contended that Parliament has only to protect an industry sufficiently to greatly benefit the consumer. Something in that way was done for the woollen industry forty years ago, but the consumer has got no relief. decent suit made of Australian tweed for Â£8, and pay Â£18 for a suit made of impelled tweed. ister could get a suit made of the best tweed that ever came out of the mill for half those prices. The firm of Rylands Brothers is one of the finest in the world. There are no better people in the business. But we have been told that they will act benevolently towards the community, and will see that the merchants do not step in to increase prices. Before the war the Government of South Australia said that this bread-and-butter line, as I have termed it , must be cheaper, and it imported wire and wire netting for the farmers. That importation had not to be continued long, because the big merchants said, "" We can get this stuff out as cheaply as the Government can,"" and until the war commenced it was brought out on an interest charge of only 5 per cent. There was not much robbery in that business, for the settlers could then extend and develop new country very cheaply, so far as material was concerned, but by this high duty the Government are simply placing an embargo on the development of the interior, while they are putting a duty upon people who participate only to a very small degree in the advantages of the Protectionist policy. I ask the Minister to consider this fact. He says that the raw material is in Australia; that is so. There is only one other place in the world like the Iron Knob, and that is in Sweden. With that one exception the Iron Knob is unique in both extent and character, and it is almost inexhaustible. I am, prepared to be very generous in regard to this new industry that is established in our midst, but the proposal of the Senate goes beyond the limit of generosity, and I shall oppose the Minister's motion. [5.22] I am. sorry that the Sovernment have agreed to hand over to the importing -section df the community, who are a bane to Australia, a clear profit.

The debate on this item has shown the inconsistencies of some honourable members. I listened with appreciation to the fight which the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) put up for the wire-netting industry. listened to the mutterings of honourable members in the Corner, who do not represent the farmers, although they profess to do so, and get kudos on that account. We saw also the fiendish grin which is usual on the part of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) when any reduction of duty is proposed. He administered a severe body blow on the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), when he twitted him. in regard to his attitude on the duties on explosives. If I had been the honourable member for Newcastle, I would have retorted by quoting the attitude of the honourable member for Swan timber. If any honourable members have adopted peculiar attitudes during the discussion of the Tariff, they are the honourable members for Newcastle and Swan The former advocates the protection of the wire-netting industry, but he will not concede to the men who work in the explosives factory the same assistance as he demands for the men who are employed in another industry in his own electorate. And we have heard the honourable member for Swan speaking against duties on timber and voting for them. The whole of the members of the so-called Farmers party are opposed to the duty upon wire netting, but quite recently we heard a great deal about maize. I remind honourable members in the corner that if maize could be imported cheaply into Australia, a factory in my electorate could give employment to three or four hundred extra men and women, but I voted for a duty that would exclude imported maize, because I know that the Australian farmer's product cannot compete with the cheaper grown article of South Africa. turer who got the dnty imposed upon maize. honourable member realize that if the manufacturer could get cheaper maize he could use more of it ? It is absurd to suggest that the manufacturers asked that a duty should be imposed on imported maize, which is the raw product for their The CHAIEMAN (Hon. J. M . Chant e r ) I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the item before the Chair. I also member expect the farmers to enclose their holdings with wireless fences? mers of Australia to concede to other sections of the community the protection they desire themselves. When the farmers demanded 9s. per bushel for their wheat and caused the price of bread to rise, and yet will not give adequate protection to the wire-netting industry, they are not acting fairly. The farmers know that during the war, and since the war, they would have been in a sorry position but for the local production of wire and wire netting. When they were unable upon to import wire netting because of its scarcity and cost, they exulted in the fact that the article was produced in Australia', but now, having got all they could out of the manufacturer, they are ready to see foreign wire dumped in this country, thus showing that they are anxious to get all they can from the rest of the community, but will give nothing in return.

Anyhow, the people of Australia are taking a greater interest in this matter than ever before. anxious to f ill the waste places w it h genuine settlers, but the encouragement of the right type of immigrant, must be practical. The Government cannot be said to be assisting those who are on the land and encouraging others who desire to settle outback by imposing heavy duties upon these wires. ture of barbed wire is not a new industry in Australia. of the wire, but the enterprise of drawing it from the local raw material is entirely new. of the manufacture of nails, the machine for which does a l l the work, even to the packing in the cases. An y one can import a barbed-wire making machine duty free; after which he may go ahead and flourish because of the special duties put upon barbed wire. The man who pays, however, is the man whom the Government say they wish to encouragethe man who is really developing this country. The requested reductions of the duties are f a i r and moderate, and this Committee should accept them. I hope that the Committee w ill agree to this and many other of the amendments requested by the Senate. for Trade and Customs) [8.15] I think it was generally admitted when we were discussing the iron and steel duties, which, honourable members will see, are carefully balanced, starting from the pig iron as a basis and proceeding through all the various stages of manufacture them again. necessary for me to go through all these items. They constitute one big, carefullybalanced scheme, going from the pig iron to the bloom; from the bloom to the rod, from the rod to the wire, and from the wire to the barbed wire or wire netting, and to each particular process the requisite measure of protection is accorded.. It was generally admitted that the iron and steel industry is essential to this country, and that the defence of Australia is utterly impossible unless the industry is developed. Upon that point I All the States are do not think there are two opinions in this Committee, with the possible exception of "" the representative of Russia"" ( Mr Considine). Honourable members must recollect that these products of the steel furnace represent a very large proportion of the total output of the f u r naces, and unless we secure for the Australian manufacturer the local market as far as practicable, we shall close down iron and steel industry w ill disappear. It is useless for honourable members to say that they believe that the iron and steel It is not. industry is essential to the welfare, nrogress, and safety of the country, and at the same time declare, as they would to all intents and purposes do by not giving a sumcient measure of protection to those items,. that we should impose low duties, which in their final analyses would mean that we should be collecting a revenue duty for all time, because the iron and steel industry would never become established. If there is one industry that depends more than another unon massed production and continuity of operations; it is the iron and steel industry. W it h out those conditions the whole scheme collapses. That is why I feel that it is essential that these items should be sufficiently protected. These are not high duties. What is happening to-day is this: The British iron and steel furnaces are nearly all cold; the proportion of them working to-day is practically negligible.. In Germany and Belgium every one of thera is working at high pressure night and day and is employing a f u l l complement of hands, and, owing to the conditions of exchange between Great Britain, Germany, and Belgium the British manufacturer finds it is cheaper to import Belgian and German steel in one form or another and work it up. We are to-day meeting with competition of that charland was largely responsible for that. whatever to do with the actual condition of affairs. The British iron and steel"" furnaces are not working, but the manufacturers are^purchasin? steel abroad and"" working it up in England, from which we are now getting low-priced wire. If""",43,Ostobs

272,Mr Greene,"That has nothingGreat Britain were manufacturing iron and steel from the products of her own iron mines, and working it up into the finished article she could not compete with Australia, but she is not doing that. Minister see that he is imposing a permanent impost in order to cope with a temporary condition of affairs? way to put the Australian manufacturer into a position in which he can turn out a cheap article is to give him, as far as we can, the run of the home market, so that he may keep his works going night and day. Even with the present measure of protection-it is not the Senate's proposals that are operating to-day-the local works are two and three parts idle. products are too costly to use. have used a fair amount of them myself, and I know pretty well what the cost means. After all, how much wire does the average farmer-no t the man engaged in pioneering work-us e in the course of a year? fenced because the farmer cannot buy the material. effect of encouraging local manufacture? The fact of an Australian industry having been established has enabled the farmer to purchase agricultural machinery cheaper than if we had hot manufactured locally. is wrong. opinion, but the whole of the evidence shows that, but for the Australian manufacturer, the farmer would have paid,' very much more for his agricultural machinery than he is paying to-day, and I am only too glad to know that the Tariff is accomplishing its purpose, and that the foreign competitors with Australian manufacturers are coming here to compete on Australian soil. After all is said and done, that is as it should be. I am credibly informed that the foundations of one big factory are already laid. A firm from abroad has purchased the necessary land, and is making all preparations to proceed with the erection of a factory. that if it were not for the Australian manufacturer the farmers would he paying more for their machinery. If that be so, how is it that the manufacturers want the increased duties? . these duties over Â£1,000,000 worth of agricultural machinery is imported each c year. If that money .were put into Australian factories, instead of foreign factories, and the local manufacturers could get that additional turnover, they would be able to supply the local market at an even cheaper price than they are charging to-day. I am satisfied that if these duties operate, as I hope they will eventually, when we escape from the exchange difficulties which surround us at the present time, they will enable the Australian manufacturer to compete successfully with all outside competitors. If he is to do that, I have not the slightest doubt that, as a result of the big turnover, he will be able to reduce the prices considerably below those which he finds payable to-day, and the ultimate result of these duties .will be that the farmer, instead of paying something extra, will be getting his wire cheaper. There is another phase of this matter of which country representatives should never lose sight. The establishment of these industries does provide a home market for hundreds of Australian producers. Today potatoes are marked up in Melbourne at 30s. per ton, and onions at Â£1 per ton. Do those prices pay for the mere digging and bagging? Honourable members' say that we should put more people on the land so that more people may grow potatoes and onions. There are not enough people in Australia to eat the potatoes and onions that are already produced. Honourable members must know that the places where we can have intense rural settlement are those places which are pre-eminently suited for growing, not the things which we export, but the things for which we require a local market, and it is utterly impossible to get that intense rural settlement, which I desire to encourage, as does every other honourable member, unless there is a local market to consume what is produced.

287,Mr Prowse,"No. But we hauteasked, ""What amount of wire does a farmer employ, in fencing his crops ?'' By-and-by the .question will be, "" What amount per acre does the Tariff add to the cost of machinery to a farmer ?"" I can point the Minister to a case where Â£30,000 has been invested in a. farming property, Ion which the o ovvmer has lost money. Hemade Â£250 profit one year; a loss of over Â£1,000 another year; and the net result of seven or eight years' working was less than' 5 per cent, return on his capital. When the Government comes along with its Tariff and wants to take this or that out oil the profit-Â£12 0 for a harvester', and Â£20 for a binder-that little bit of profit is eaten into. I say that the labouring man on the farm is not getting a fair deal, because his brother labourer in the city, working fewer hours, gets more money. This policy is forcing men off the land by making the conditions such that it is impossible for them to continue there. I would like to see the Senate's suggestion accepted, and the manufacturers and labourers in the secondary industries bend a little, and make up the difference, instead of passing it all on,to the man on the land, whose produce is suffering ,a slump in the market. The prices of prir maoy products are such, to-daythat it .is impossible, for the man on. the land to buy. the things ..that he needs without screwing himself down, to the eartb and working fif,ty, sixty, or seventy hours a week.

If the Committeeis. sincere in its desire to foster this industry, for the pro* duets of which only one -section of the community pays> it should do it by a bonus, so that! the whole community will share the expense. Australia would be more self-contained if the vast rural Darts of the continent weredeveloped more rapidly, instead of the population being squeezed into four or .fivo capital icities. Those who are complaining of the centralization evil are aggravating it by inflicting this Tariff upon the comparatively few people who are still struggling on. the land. Thehonoraible member for 'Swan( Mr wholetroubleisdue to the Tariff. If Prowse) reminds me very muchof' an. Irish friend I was talking to recently. Speaking of a gentleman with a reputation for generosity, he remarked, ""Yes, he is a very generous man. What he has to. give away he still, keeps for himself."" The honourable member for Swan reminds me of that gentleman. He is so generous that , what he has to give a.way he still keeps for himself. ;So that the cultivator of the soil shall be enabled to get cheap agricultural implements, he desires that the industrial working classes shall have it taken out of them. He suggests that the industrial workers of Australia should comport themselves like their cheapwages brethren in Europe; that they should "" bend a little"" and should take "" a little less,"" in order that the man on the land may have a little more. No doubt, he would also"" agree with the manufacturer, who says, when the industrial worker complains about the high cost of living, that it is due to the people on the land wanting extortionate prices for^their products, and suggests that theagricultural labourer should take a little less, in order, that both these gentlemen should have a, little more. 1 to work the harder because of this Tariff: all at present: working, but, unfortunately, at the present time, the majority of them are not, be/ cause of our old friends Codlin and Short.

Out of the mouth of this Minister, perhaps inadvertently, has come a truth,' though he may not be able to grasp the f u l l significance of it . He is, perhaps, not aware that to-day Russia is the only country in the world run by a working-class Government. In that sense I do represent Russia, and I am proud of it . stituency. acting one. The Minister again trots out the old wheeze that -this particular industry is essential to the defence of the country; but can he name one industry in Australia which is not essential to its that not one industry could be named which was not essential to the defence of the country; and, in fact, every word the Minister has uttered in regard to the iron and steel industry in this regard could be applied with equal force to e^ery other industry in Australia. We are told that for this reason the whole of the local market must be monopolized by the local manufacturer; and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) tells us that the industrial worker must take less so that the local manufactories may be buil t up you say agriculuntil they blossom into monopolies and Combines. I did not know that his share. H a v e you never good idea of what the honourable member means by the worker's share. But when compulsorily or voluntarily the worker has accepted less in order that local manufacturers may blossom for t h into monoE it h e r you expolists and ultimately become exporters, we shall find that he is again asked to take less in order that the manufacturing else is. working you. I was endeavouring monopolists may be able to compete in the world's markets with the more cheaply-produced goods pf other countries. Having assisted the manufacturer to monopolize the home markets, the worker must again take less in order that the monopolists may reach out and take"" the other fellow's markets. In the indust r i a l revolution GreatB rita in certainly had a unique advantage by having a flying start, but even now it is introducing a Tariff under the plea of safeguarding its manufacturers from foreign It is said that competition, dumping, and so forth . The history of France, Germany, America, and every other industrial country, however, has been the same-firs t a Tariff, then monopolies and Combines, then overseas exports, then Imperialism, and with it the need for bigger navies and bigger armies, and eventually war. The working class are squeezed in peace time and then asked to sacrifice themselves in war time in order that the profits and dividends of the manufacturers and the combined interests of the wealthy classes may be safeguarded. Therefore, from my point of view, the workers have nothing to gain from a Tariff.

I endorse the view expressed by some honourable members that an attempt is being made to bolster up certain industries at the expense of others which are certainly of equal importance. I invite honourable members to give special attention to that aspect of the situation.

Whilst certain honourable members in the interests of the workmen employed in the the Minister any production of iron and steel and other secondary products desire the imposition fence of a high Tariff, it must be obvious to them that it is impossible to maintain the It would cost about present high rates of wages in that industry if others of equal importance are, I am sure that even in as a result of that Tariff, to be rendered unprofitable. Important although these secondary industries are, it is unfair to ask the agricultural and mining industries, which cannot benefit by high Protection, to bear the whole of the cost of the Tariff which we are imposing for the purpose of building them up.

339,Mr Marr (Parkes) [9.20],"Th eSenate. The people of Australia at the last general election declared for a policy of reasonable protection to all our primary as well as secondary industries. If we hope to develop this country, we must have regard to our secondary industries. For forty years a firm in New South Wales has been manufacturing barbed wire and wire netting. It commenced operations when blooms and rods were free, and was thus able to compete with the products of other countries. With the object of developing the iron and steel industry in Australia, we have now imposed heavy duties on rods and blooms-the raw material of the barbed wire and wire-netting industry-and it is tlierefore absolutely necessary that we should give reasonable protection under this item.

We for thirty or forty years? [492] could produce them without trouble if the necessary encouragement were only forthcoming. In order to develop Australia we should stand by our secondary and primary industries. Messrs. Lysaght have been manufacturing wire-netting for forty years, and it is up to us to see they "" do not go to the wall"" for lack of protection. In February last they employed 1,400 men, some of whom had been in the trade for thirty years, but quite a number of them are to-day walking the streets, because, while we have imposed big duties on the raw material of the industry, we have not ""sufficiently protected the manufactured article.

""We should carry our Protective policy to its logical conclusion. At a deputation which waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs inâ Sydney recently, I heard evidence given by representatives of the New South ""Wales branch of the Wire-netting Workers Union.

(Eichmond,"Ministe rfor Trade and Customs) [9.49] -This and the following six requests deal, for the most part, with agricultural implements. adding 2^ per oent. to the duties that previously were in force to cover the protection on the raw material from which the implements are made-this , of course, is a rough and ready way-and then we raised the foreign duties 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. these duties were passed by this Chamber; and the Senate has requested a reduction of the British preferential duty below the pre-war duty. The Senate has not taken -into account the fact that we are now manufacturing this machinery entirely from our own raw materials. The request slightly increases the amount of British preference, it is true, bu t by reducing the duty on British goods by 7\ per cent., and the foreign duty by 5 per cent. done. I am most anxious to see foreign machinery altogether cut out of the Australian market. We can make, and have made in the past, the best agricultural machinery that Australian producers have ever used, and it is to Australian inventors that this fact is due, particularly in the case of wheat. ment are very anxious to see this industry still further developed. I am quite satisfied from figures that I have already given honourable members that it can be shown that the establishment of the Australiaif industry has led to the farmers getting their machinery at a lower price than they would if the industry had not been established. ber must admit that the American manufacturers, who are selling machinery in Australia, 'are accepting a lower price here than they do in other countries. is paying more for his machinery than doÂ«s the American farmer. the Australian farmer were as loyal to Australian machinery as the American farmer is to American machinery, I venture to say he would be paying a great deal less. tural machinery manufacturers have not been able to reduce their prices is that they have always influx of foreign machinjBty to face, and they cannot get the necessary turnover to enable them to reduce overhead charges, and, as a result, reduce costs. I do not think that we We adjusted these duties by should accept the request of the Senate; we should not be justified in doing so. I regard the original duties on this machinery as moderate and as sumcient to effectively do that which we desire shall be done-secur e for Australia the manufacture of practically all we require. I In that form am glad to see that the Tariff is proving effective, and that one of our biggest competitors is coming to manufacture in this country. That is exactly what the Tariff is designed to do, not only to secure the manufacture here of what we require, and can manufacture, bu t to create within our own borders the necessary competition which I admit is in the circumstances desirable, and provide employment that heretofore has gone i o other countries. This industry will result in I do not think that ought to be the employment of a very large number of men. If the Â£1,500,000 worth of machinery, which the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton) was talking about, is manufactured in Australia instead of abroad, in all probability it will mean the employment of at least 3,000 additional workers in this country. where the employment is given so long as it is in Australia ? These 3,000 additional workers, with their wives andfamilies, will mean at least 9,000 persons; and when we take into consideration the butchers, the bakers, and all who administer to their needs, we have a population of at least 15,000 persons for whom -Moonshine ! work is found. This population, in its t u r n , will put hundreds of primary producers on the soil, and give them an immediate and ready market. That is the object of a Protectionist Tariff. It puts men on the land and keeps them there. 1 so? Australia to-day.

For eighteen years of Federation it might be said that Victoria and Melbourne were the great Protectionist centres, and did the most manufacturing; but during that period Victoria has increased her population by only 190,000 persons, whereas the population' of Melbourne has increased by close on 220,000 persons. It will be seen that Melbourne not only absorbed the whole of the increase in the population, but. drew nearly 30,000 persons from rural parts. additional manufactures here have not affected the rural districts ? census has disclosed a similar state of affairs in all the States. of Western Australia during the decade increased by 48,000, while the population of Perth increased by 51,000. Necessary manufacturing is a good thing, but there should be a proper balance. Unless there be a sale for the things manufactured, the manufacturing is to no purpose. All the money that we live on comes out of the soil. paid for by what the soil produces-al l comes from the soil. anything, to retard the proper development of the country districts, for that not ducer, but every form of industry. There is no doubt about the logic of that. If we bring 3,000 additional people here to manufacture machines, it may ba more than are necessary, and it means that there are a greater number to feed out of that produced by the people on the land. This additional number will clamour for higher wages and cheaper food, a demand which can be met only at the expense of the man on the land. I have no objection to the extension of these industries, but they ought to be established in reasonable proportion to the rural producer, who has to buy the costly output.

In such circumstances, for whom are we going to manufacture? We cannot sell to America unless the overhead charges are reduced. The only men to whom we can sell are those developing Australian land, and it is by the votes recorded in this Parliament that men are being driven off the land, and I warn honourable members not to assist in doing anything in that direction. We speak of a Protective policy; but what protection is being given' to the primary industries which provide new money with which to pay our debts? [10.8] T do not intend to detain the Committee .at length, but in listening to a speech by an honourable member who claims to be logical I naturally looked for some logic in his utterances. His remarks have puzzled me a .good deal. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) and those associated with 'bam are very fond of referring 'to the people engaged in -primary industries as though they were the only ones --who did any useful work in bhe community. 'The man who produces -wheat :is -not going Ito eat it as wheat. Before *he consumes it :h& must be raided -by those 'who convert the wlheat in to flour, and -by those who make '.the f o u r into, bread. It seams to me that these gentlemen, if they apply their logical minds to the real facts, will find t h a t instead of directing their fight as they do against those who wish to develop the industries of this .country, they would be better employed in attacking the parasites who exist on all classes. I am prepared to pay a little more for Australian wheat than for grain t h a t is im ported, and I believe tliat I am interpreting -the -minds of a m a j o r it y of the Australian people aright when I say t h a t The Minister for they are prepared to pay more for goods manufactured here -than for those imj1 . ported from abroad, -and particularly those imported i r o m cheap-labour counI t would be infinitely tries, which seem to have such an 'attraction for some honourable members. The bonorable .member for Swan .spoke .of the (growing demands -of the Australian Only this workers, but he shut his eyes to the fact .that the .American workmen are organized trade unionists, and the Canadians, for If the whom he bas so many .good words, are also highly organized. If the honourable member cares to ascertain the wages paid to the American workmen engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements he w ill find that they are receiving a good deal more"" than the Australian workmen. Therefore, the oratory we heard a moment ago concerning the difficulties and high wages associated w i th Protection all goes by the board; because it has no bearing on the matter whatever. The honourable member for Swan delights in quoting figures, and submits tables when it suits his case; but lie failed to tell us what quantity of these goods were imported into America under a free T a r if f . As a fact, America deals with Canada, and 'Canada with America, and that is the end of the agricultural machinery Tariff. There are practically no importations of agricultural machinery into the United States of America, and I believe the time will come .when our agricultural machinery w ill be made under such conditions that importations will cease also. I am sure that if protection were needed to safeguard the American industry, it would .be afforded.; b u t tbe industry -has been developed in America uftder 'the .highest [Protective T a r i ff in the world ; and if , as the honourable member sajvs, it has resulted in the production of the",57,Paibs

384,Mr Hector Lamond ( I L L A WA R R A ),"cheapest agricultural machinery in the world, she has set Australia an example which we ought to be proud to follow. 1 was anticipating that the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) would have made some concession in regard to these duties. When the Tariff was previously .under discussion, the matter was f u l l y debated, and it is not now my intention to repeat the arguments that were dwm adduced. Careful consideration has been given to the matter in another place, where it has been suggested that the duties should be reduced to some extent. The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) referred to the manufacture of agricultural implements in America, and the statement has been made that lower wages ar.e paid therethan in Australia. That is f a r from the fact, because I quoted a statement made by Mr Brownley, a Labour leader,, who was. sent to America in. M a y last to report on, the question of wagesi n the industry. He found that the American workman: in the iron; andsteel industry was-receiving', on. the aver agej 3s. l d . per hour, as against ls. Sd. in Great Britain.

It is strange that the Canadian farmer should be able to obtain a reaper or a binder for Â£ 6 0 , while the Austnalian farmer has to pay Â£102 or Â£ 1 0 3 for the same machine advioe I had was that those reapers and binders had been landed in Australia in November and December, 1920, and were being sold on a duty of 10 per cent.

The want of loyalty has been on the part of. the Minister himself. wrong. Honourable members w ill recollect that I challenged"" thÂ© Minister, and asked him to let us have the information received regarding the price at which reapers and binders were being sold to the producers i h Canada and the United States of America. The Minister had that information. I was aware that he had sent for it , and after pressure we had it placed on the table in the Library. To the cost of the machine the Minister added the exchange fixed here to Canada, raising the cost of the machine by Â£ 6 . The exchange had nothing to do with the matter. The Canadian farmer paid in Canadian money, and the fact that there was a difference in exchange values of about Â£ 1 7 in Â£100 at that time made no difference in the price the Canadian farmer hadto pay. He gave Â£ 6 0 , while tha farmer in Australia had to pay from Â£ 9 6 toÂ£102.. Probably the price will, come down. We know that wages are-beingreduced, and that there has been a big reduction in the cost of iron and steel since the war; that is why the Minister has been so anxious, in connection with many of the iron and steel duties. The principal things-needed in Australia to-day are population and'production. When the back country is settled there will be ample demand for the 1 output of our great manufacturing' in -, dustries, and I hope there will be a market that will give the producers machinery at the same prices as obtain: in other countries. I very muchresent the atti tude the Minister has adopted on manyoccasions. He is looking after the in All the terests of the manufacturers only, and. he has persuaded honorable members opposite that, in supporting him,, they are doing what is best for the workers.

There are forty countries in which slight duties are imposed, and only one in all the world which has established a prohibitive duty. That country is Great Britain. . Secondary industries are as necessary as primary industries; the one group should work with the other.

I doubt if any honourable member 'would, as a matter of principle and practice, pay more for Australian machines, or goods, or articles in preference to purchasing cheaper imported lines. Price governs the buyer's solection almost every time; the origin of the article is Beldom worried about. I desire to help Australian industries, but I do not propose to abet Australian manufacturers in cnarging a higher price for these machines than is paid in the Argentine. The request of the Senate is fair, and should be acceded to. ing machines are among thc manufactures embraced in the group under discussion. It is rather curious that there has been no consideration of the manufacture of these machines since the Tariff was in troduced. Previous opportunities for suggesting that, in the interests of the dairying industry, milking machines should be admitted duty free, have been missed; and, unfortunately, the Minister( Mr. Greene) is absent from the chamber at this moment. I desired information concerning the extent of the manufacture in Australia; and I had hoped to succeed in pressing upou the Minister the fairness of admitting the machines free of duty. -Shortly before the TariffB ill was despatched to another place, I pleaded for the recommittal of (his item, but I had to he content with a promise that my arguments and suggestions would be gone into, and that, if my representations impressed the Minister and his Department, certain steps would be taken elsewhere.
