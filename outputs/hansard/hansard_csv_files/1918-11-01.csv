Following from Prime Minister foT your Prime Minister: Some days ago, General Townahend was liberated in order to inform the British-Admiral in command of the Aegean that the Government of Turkey asked that negotiations should be opened immediately for an armistice. A reply was sent that if the Government of Turkey sent fully accredited Plenipotentiaries, ViceAdmiral Calthorp was empowered to infonn them of the conditions upon which the Allies places, and cheered. would agree to a cessation of hostilities, and to sign an armistice on this condition on their behalf. Turkish Plenipotentiaries arrived at DEDUCTIONSPROMALLOTMEN T Mudros early this week, and an armistice was signed by Admiral Calthorp on behalf of the Allied Governments last night, and came into operation at noon to-day. l t is not possible recently issued providing that as from as yet to publish the full terms of the armisJuly last deductions should not be made tice, but they include the free passage for the from deferred pay. in Tespect of fines Allied Fleets through the Bosphorus to the imposed on soldiers who had died.

Is the Naval Board afraid that its decision will bo upset if the boy's condition is referred to an outside specialist or specialists who might have an opportunity of examining the boy? 5. Is it a fact that a duly qualified Board of Naval Surgeons decided that the boy should be sent back to the College; and, if so, will the Minister get the opinion of non-departmental specialists? 0. Isi t not a fact that the Naval Board's decision was founded upon the opinion of the College doctor? 7.

Can the Minister say now why this boy is regarded as an erjileptic? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes; by the Naval Board and myselt. 2. Both medical and by the Naval Board. 3. Because it is the autliority charged with the administration of the Naval Forces. 4. No; but, having regard to the requirements of the Naval Service, no further examination is considered necessary. 5. A Board of Naval Surgeons recommended that the boy should continue at the College, and be surveyed if other attacks occurred. The opinion of one non-departmental specialist has been obtained; no other is considered neeessary. C. Not solely. The Naval Board's decision was founded on tlie advice of their Directorof Naval Medical Services, who is an expert loaned from the Koyal Navy. 7. Yes. 8. No. 9. The Director of Naval Medical Services examined the boy at the time of his candidature for the College. 10. Tlie boy had a fit, which the surgeon who attended him reported as an epileptic attack. The Director of Naval Medical Services considered the report, and was of the same opinion, many oi the usual signs being present.

I refer, in the first place, to the charge made against the Government that the policy.contained in this Bill was iiot announced to the public prior to the election on the 5th May, 1917. I give that statement a most emphatic denial, and in confirmation of my denial I submit an extract from the Launceston Examiner of 21st April, 1917. It is portion of the report of a meeting held in the Albert Hall on the previous evening, and the Prime Minister is reported to have saidI have asked you to vote for three Senate candidates. Mr Good luck saw me to-day, and asked me whether I was in favour of preferential voting. I said I was. "" Well,"" he said, "" if you are in favour of preferential voting, and will say so to-night, I will withdraw my candidature."" That public statement by the Prime Minister shows that the charge made against the Government is absolutely unfounded. ter who said he would resign if conscription were not carried? be sent to the soldiers at the Pront? that it is grossly disorderly for honourable members to interject immediately after the Speaker has called for order. If honourable members will not obey the direction *>f the Chair, I shall have to have recourse to the Standing Orders in order to enforce obedience to my directions. reference to the restoration of the postal vote. Honourable members, who have not lived in a State in which preferential voting is in operation may be excused, to some extent, for their suspicion of it, because they have no practical knowledge of the benefits of the system. But that excuse cannot be offered ""in regard to the postal vote. The privilege of voting by post was enjoyed by the people of Australia for several years, but when the Labour party came into power Electoral Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Electoral Bill. on the second occasion,, they introduced an amendment of the Act, the object of which, apparently, was not to obtain a true expression of the people's view. That party deliberately took away from the people the privilege of the postalvote, and the remnants of that party are opposing its restoration to-day. I hav© a lively recollection of the effect of their action in the first election held after the postal vote had been abolished. 1 was living at that time on a station situated 50 miles from Longreach, Queensland, and owned by my son. Two married couples were living on the station; one couple were the station manager and his wife, who had a very young child.' The nearest polling place was at Evesham, 10 miles distant. The station manager and his I have a statement to make. wife desired, as citizens, to exercise their vote, but it was impossible for the wife to go because of the dJild. The result was that the manager and his wife were unable to vote, but the other married couple, who had no very young children,, asked me for the loan of the station buggy, in order that they might drive to Evesham. I told them they could have the vehicle with pleasure. ber ask them how they intended to vote ? through the abolition of the postal vote the married couple without very young children wei'e able to exercise tie franchise, whilst the couple who had a very young child were unable to do so, because of the action of the so-called Labour party. Incidents of the kind have been very frequent at every subsequent election. The abolition of the postal vote penalizes the pioneers, the men and women who bore the heat and burden of the day in preparing this country so that a large measure of prosperity might be enjoyed by the supporters of honourable members opposite.

Honourable members opposite have tauntingly inquired why the Government are proposing one system of voting for the House of Representatives, which, they -say, we dare not apply to the Senate. Honourable members could not have read the Bill or studied the question, because -that question could be as^ed only under complete misapprehension.

The Government are not proposing to apply to the -election of the House of Representatives a voting, system which they do not intend ""to apply to the elections' for ti e Senate; The Government do not propose, in the Bill, to apply proportional representation to the election of the House of Representatives. Why, therefore, should we be taunted with the fact that we> do> not propose to apply that system to the Senate? 1 In Committee I shall move an amendment to make the system of marking the ballot paper exactly the same in the case of both Houses, namely, that the elector in each -case shall employ numerals, and not the cross, to indicate the candidates he favours. Mr BoYD.^-Under that scheme' how would the returning officer determine which Senate candidates had been elected? not involve any change in the present system of counting the votes. As I am a thorough believer in the principle of proportional representation I accept this Bill, which embodies the system of preferential voting, as a step in the right direction, although it does not go as f a i as I would like to see it go. Two elements are essential in regard to proportional voting. It can only be applied to a multiple electorate returning at least three members, and the system of preferential -representation cannot be applied to single electorates. The great advantage of the adoption of preferential voting, is that it will familiarize the electors with that system of voting, and will make it easier to convince' them of the advantages of proportional representation. During the course of this debate many taunts have been thrown out against the smallness of the area, and the. limited population of the Island 'State in the Federation, Tasmania. But I wish to say that, although that island may be small in area, and although its population may be limited, its people have proved themselves to be mighty in conception and great in intellect, because, on their own initiative, and without any slavish imitation of electoral systems existing elsewhere, their own intelligence has ied them to adopt an electoral system which is an example to the whole world. member goes to Tasmania he'will not find any number of people who have voted under the system in force there, and experienced its advantages, saying that it is an example not to follow. away from Tasmania. that anxiety.

No Government brings forward an electoral reform unless it is for the purpose of securing some advantage to its party, and it is quite evident that Ministers have in the minds of the people that it was been looking a little bit ahead. Perhaps the result of the Swan election has made them a little nervous. Perhaps they also realize that, whereas they tare a mixed party, the Opposition is a concrete and earnest body with a definite policy, and that the people will soon cry out for it to take office. In his speech the Minister said that he had been waited on by different parties, presumably as a deputation, in reference to the introduction of the Bill, but on scanning the names of those gentlemen who approached him we see that nearly all of them were pure faddists, OT persons who, for selfish interests, were engaged in an endeavour to bring about a change of parties in the House. They have been engaged in the same game for years past. They fear the prospect of a truly democratic government coming into power, and since the 5th May, 1917, they have been very earnest in the matter of caring for their own vested interests. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) is typical of them, and no doubt his friends are very anxious to keep him here so that he may are not still pursue the task of watching over their .interests. I do not blame him; the count r y has given him the opportunity of being here, but he would do very much more for his party if sometimes he would be a little more serious, instead of endeavouring to turn the House into a circus. should be so simple that people can readily understand what they have to do when they go into a polling booth every three years to record a vote. Those honourable members who have acted as scrutineers at elections know that many very energetic citizens, who display considerable ability in the conduct of their affairs, are quite nervous when they go to vote. Not many years ago the electoral system provided that the names of certain candidates should be erased by the voters. The method of putting crosses opposite the names of.candidates has since been substituted, but at a recent election at which I acted as a scrutineer I was astonished to find that there was still an impression necessary to erase the names of candidates. Apparently the Government are desirous of creating still further confusion. They probably believe that it will be of some assistance to. them at the nexf elections, but if that is their object they will only be putting a nail in their own coffin, because no greater election cry could be raised against the Government than the charge that they are endeavouring to manipulate the electoral law in order to create confusion and prevent the true reflex of the people's will being recorded.

In the early days, when I watched the State Parliaments devoting their energies to matters of trifling importance, I looked forward to the creation of a National Parliament, in the belief that in such a Legislature the little things in politics would be unheard of; but here today we are asked to deal with measures of 'minor importance, while the great problems demanding our immediate attention are set aside.

It is for parties outside to lay down principles, and for the Parliament to give legislative effect to them. We shall never be able to do without the party system, but I hope we shall never have in this Parliament more than two parties. We have to-day but two parties -the one in favour of liberty and progress, and the other guided only by self interest. The Labour party will surely be returned to power, for the people are not prepared to remain where they are; When we do come into our own again, we shall legislate to do away with the slums of our great cities. We shall have no back slums, nor shall we allow poverty to continue. Production in Australia in the year 1917 amounted to £272,000,000, and thewealth of Australia amounts to £1,670,000,000. In such circumstances, there should be no room for poverty or discontent.

Evenbeing unfitted for active service, went abroad at their own expense to do their bit in the national cause, and there are many other patriotic workers who have done the same. There was no need for the Government to display anxiety to please all the faddists who are anxious to get into Parliament, and, under the present system, find themselves unable to do so. No one who has honestly considered the matter will deny that, there must be confusiou at' the next election with two methods of voting. It is not at all likely that the Senate will agree to any change in the method of electing senators, and, therefore, we must have two systems. The present arrangements should be satisfactory enough-certainl y they are satisfactory to most of us wnom they have sent to Parliament. Without conceit, I trust that I may say that I represent East Sydney as well as any one else could do; certainly I attempt to do my duty in that respect, and should I be put out of Parliament it will not worry me. SinceI haA'e been in this HouseI have heard a great deal said on the postal vote. If it is to be used to manipulate elections, -would not have expressed the views to I shall not allow myself to be euchred out of my position by an opponent. To my mind, the postal vote will serve chiefly those who are too lazy or too indifferent to go to the polling booths. The person who is really sick and suffering does not wish to be troubled about election matters. I know what it is to have a smashed leg, and to undergo a serious operation at the age of sixty-five years. opinion is that persons in such circumstances do not wish to be troubled about voting. cases ? women who are about to have children wish to be troubled with voting-papers Voting should be left to those who are well and strong, and in full possession of all their faculties. To my mind, postal voting is unnecessary, and open to abuse. The commercial traveller, or other person who is absent from his division on polling day, can vote under the absent voting provision. At certain times of the year a large proportion of the population of Sydney spends its week-ends out of town, and is thus absent from its electoral divisions when an election takes place, but its vote is recorded under the absent -voting pr3visions. Those who would benefit by the postal vote are few. To my mind, it would torture many sick persons to be asked to vote. As is well known, I have always held that every man and woman should have the right to vote A t one time. I thought that that would secure the salvation of Australia, but the result ol the last election seemed to me a mistake, though we must bow to the popular will. As to the selection of candidates, I do not know in what groove the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has moved, his conceptions are so strange. Honourable members must come to a Parliament pledged to some policy. We do not voice our own opinions pure and simple; we voice the opinions of those who send U3 here, and advocate the principles that we were elected to support. A Scotchman's advice to me once was to sleep over any matter on which I might be puzzled. Had the honourable member done that he which he gave utterance. ber think that preferential voting will do away with party politics.? House like the Tasmanian Assembly, in which nothing can be done. I am aware that it is not wise for a public .man to say anything against the press, because it is My contrary to bis interests to do so; but I cannot help calling attention to the fact that the newspapers are advocating tbe adoption of preferential voting. Of course, they are commercKii concerns, run in the interests of their proprietors, who, no doubt, think that if Parliament bfr^ comes a confused assembly, in which no decisions can be arrived at, the press will be more powerful. Some of the States, and in particular Victoria, have been press-bound for many years. Mr Alfred Deakin, of whom 1 am a great admirer, says, in a preface to a Life of Mr David Syme, that no Ministry, no Bill, and no policy was ever put before the people of this State until Mr Syme had been consulted.

Honourable members w ill be prevented from exercising the faculties with which they have been endowed, and the public will be compelled to rely on the press for its information and opinions. Nowhere has the preferential system proved of marked advantage to a country. Is there preferential voting in Victoria? dered at that Victoria is behind the other States, although she has had f a i r l y intelligent representatives in public life. second ballot? think it will be long in existence in New South Wales. I may say, however, that in cases where the first ballot has no result, the second ballot results_ in placing two parties before the country, and in obtaining a true reflex of the opinions of the people. The second ballot may not have done much good to the Labour party, but, at any rate, it has not helped the National party very much, seeing that when it has been exercised the Labour party has generally been successful. I should have had more pleasure in congratulating the Government on the subject of taxation and other proposals than in dealing with a B ill of this kind, which can have no effect-whatever in the winning of thn war or in assisting the progress of Australia. The proposals before us, if carried out, can only create confusion and discontent, and I shall vote against the second reading. _ I hope there will be an amendment submitted which will give us an opportunity of deciding whether it would not have been better policy and more in the interest of justice to delay this Bill until our men had returned from the Front. listened with close 'interest to the debate, and particularly to the remarks from the representatives of the Labour party. have not heard one argument by any honourable member opposite which shows that preferential or j>ostal voting will h u r t any person in Australia, no matter what his brand of politics may be. I have to congratulate the Minister on his consolidation of the various Electoral Acts, for this is one of the reforms we have a right to expect from an intelligent Government such as the National Government professes to be. ' The gravamen of the attack by the Labour party is that we have violated our pledges to the soldiers now at the Front. I have attended many meetings and demonstrations in connection with the Forces, and I never heard it suggested that in their absence the question of preferential voting would not be dealt w it h ; indeed, the question does not concern them, and I doubt whether many would I do not; and I do not be able to give a proper definition of the term. A few weeks ago, when in Sydney, I received a very courteous letter from the secretary of the Returned Soldiers Committee asking me, in the interests of the association, to support proportional representation and to suggest that the Government should introduce preferential voting; yet honourable members opposite tell us that the Government, in introducing this measure, are violating their promises to the men at the Pront. I have contested Calare at three different elections, and at all the meetings I spoke in favour of preferential and postal"" voting, which, judging by the applause, had the approval of the electors. I u the cities people have polling booths almost at their doors, but in the country districts it is unreasonable to expect men, during harvestor shearing, to down their tools and travel perhaps 50 miles to vote, when the franchise might be exercised near at hand by a scratch of the pen. the extreme out-back parts, where there are no polling booths. In the honourable member's own district there is always a polling booth w it h in 5 miles. where a polling booth is considerably I more than 5 miles distant.

Why should women who are performing the highest and most sacred duty to society be disfranchised and penalized? According to Mr Knibbs, from whom I have received some very instructive figures, . there Australia state of health their attending a polling both; there are 11,000 patients in hospitals, and it is estimated that other sick people number 33,000. 58,750 persons over the age of seventy-five; and, if we assume that two-thirds of these cannot personally vote at the booths, we have another 40,000, who, in the absence of postal voting, will be disfranchised. These figures represent a total of 95,000 persons, to whom, owing to infirmity of various-kinds, the postal vote is necessary. No man claiming to be a Democrat can say that these people should not have the same electoral privileges as others. We have heard a good deal as to corruption in connection with postal voting. turning Officer that in the 1910 election S4,000 persons availed themselves of the privilege, of which number 49,000 voted Liberal, -and 33,000 voted Labour, showing a majority of 16,000 in favour of the Liberal party. honourable members opposite object to postal voting.

There were no cases of fraud, for which a possible penalty of £50 is provided; and the small fines that were imposed are evidence of the trivial nature of the offences. But under what system is there no fraud? Under the Electoral Act, without postal voting, there is fraud, as, for instance, in connection with absent voting; and I am sure no one would suggest that, because of such offences, the whole electoral system should be swept away. As a matter of fact, there is no part of the voting system where less fraud is to be found than in postal voting. penalty there would be no frauds at all. penalty a fine of £50.

In connection with shire elections the adoption of the postal vote is optional, but most shires do use the system. The directors of the Australian Mutual Provident Society and various other large insurance and commercial companies utilize the postal vote for the election of directors. I recollect that, in 1913, the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) extolled the enthusiasm of Labour supporters, and he instanced a man in his electorate who actually walked 100 miles to a polling booth. Apparently the honourable member still desires bo compel a man to walk 100 miles in order to show his enthusiasm for the Labour cause, Whereas by the restoration of the postal vote the man could remain at home and allow the post-office to make his vote effective. The postal vote is in the in terests of the working men who have no motor cars to carry them to distant polling booths, and are compelled to tramp the distance. Therefore the Labour party, in opposing the postal vote, are acting against the interests of their own supporters. able member concern himself so much about the workers ? hundreds of them; they vote and work for me, and I intend to . see that they have some means of recording their votes. The honourable member for Maranoa should show consideration for his enthusiastic supporter who walked 100 miles to a polling boofjh, and give t h at man an opportunity of exercising bis franchise without so much sacrifice. In regard to preferential voting, that system is adopted by the Labour party in the pre-selection of candidates. I do not know how honourable member's opposite can contend that the .principle is right for selection and wrong for election. The injustice of the present system is indicated I remind the honorby the recent Swan by-election.

Mr Corboy received 6,433 votes; Mr Murray (Farmers and Settlers), 5,738; Mr Hedges (Nationalist), 5,535; and Mr Watson (Prohibitionist), 836; thus Mr Corboy won the seat with 6,433 votes, although 12,139 electors directly voted against h i m .

Under the preferential system, it is impossible to do so. Much has been said during this debate of the ballots conducted in the Labour ranks. many are conducted under the simplemajority system as there are under the preferential-voting system, and no hitch occurs in connection with the simplemajority ballots. The honourable member for Calare has said that the Labour party have adopted postal voting in connection with its pre-selection ballots. Postal voting does not apply to the selection of members of the Political Labour League. Where, however, there is a union ticket in operation, and the voter is permitted to vote on the ticket, he is required to tear from his Australian Workers Union ticket, for example, a slip which he attaches to his ballot paper, and so makes it impossible for corruption to creep' in Such a vote is recorded by post where the voter is more than a certain distance from a polling booth. No one could take exception to the postal voting system if it were conducted under proper supervision. On many occasions the postal voting system is necessary to enable invalids to exercise the franchise, and if. proper safeguards could be devised it would work very well. There can be no doubt, however, that the ° postal voting system, if brought into operation, would be largely abused. Many residents of country districts who are 5 or 6 miles from a polling booth would apply for a postal ballot-paper on. the ground of sickness in order to avoid having, to travel such long distances to record their votes. done, so long as each person had only one vote? antee that each person would have only one vote. It would be quite possible possible to put in 700 against me. put in something like 400 or 500 against me. I tried to trace those votes, but could not do so. In the Conservative centres of I believe in the exhaustive my electorate, committees working for the other side ascertained that a number of people were likely to be away on polling day, and, knowing that they would not vote, they caused votes to be cast in their names, as absentee voters, in other parts Just as of the electorate. That sort of thing is likely to happen in connection with the postal vote. While every encouragement should be given to the electors to record their votes, I do not think that avenues of corruption should be deliberately thrown open, as they will be if all and sundry are allowed to vote by post. Many of those residing at a distance from a polling booth would apply for a postal ballot-paper on the ground of sickness; but if a doctor's certificate had to accompany each application, corruption would not be so likely to creep in. My chief objection to this Bill is that it was generally understood that no electoral reforms would be undertaken while our men were at the Front.

If it is to be amended at the present time it w ill require still further revision'when the whole of our troops return. The men w ill be allocated in different parts of the States, the population of certain districts w ill thus be materially increased, and a further revision of the electoral system will be found necessary. I hope that nothing w ill be done in this direction u n t i l our men return from the Front. ""Within the next five or six months, perhaps the whole of our Australian troops may return, and the Government w ill then be able, if they so desire, to make whatever alterations they deem necessary in the electoral laws of the Commonwealth. to congratulate the Government upon the fact that they have at last realized that our present electoral system is not in accord w i th the true principles of Democracy, and that the people are actually being cheated out of th'eir right as free citizens to return to Parliament the men of their choice. My congratulations, however, are not unrestricted, since I find that the Government are wholly ignoring one of the greatest scandals of our present electoral law, and that is the present system of conducting Senate elections. hope, before this B ill is passed, we shall be able to persuade the Government that some reform is absolutely necessary in order that we may avoid a recurrence of what has happened at the last two or three elections, when little more than one-half of the population in this State returned the whole of its representatives in the Senate. If each State were divided into three electorates, or if proportional voting were adopted, the position would be different. I recognise that the proportional representation system would be rather difficult to operate in our populous cities, and that it would delay the count. As the simplest way out of the difficulty, I would re-commend that for elections to the Senate the States should be divided into three electorates, and that we should have in operation the same system of voting that we have applied to the House of Representatives. I have listened carefully to the objections that have been raised to this measure, and particularly in opposition to the preferential voting system. One would have thought that the result of the recent election for the Swan would be quite sufficient to satisfy the Labour party, who prate about Democracy and progress, that the present system is not one under which a progressive community should conduct its elections. It is not a system that enables a free Democracy to return to Parliament the men of their choice. We want a system that will insure the return of the man who, in a single contest, would beat any other candidate, and at the same time give a free run to any man who wishes to seek election. The system for.which this B i ll provides would, I desire to a large extent, have that effect. In extraordinary cases alone would it happen that the man whom the majority in his constituency favoured would be rejected at the first ballot, and so would possibly lose the election. H a r d cases of that kind would occur, perhaps, only once in ten thousand contests, and we cannot afford to delay the passing, of such a measure as this merely because one or two hard cases might possibly arise under it. There are two principal arguments advanced against this B ill . The first of I these is that, while our soldiers are away, we should not interfere in any way w i th our electoral legislation. The Labour party claim credit for the present electoral system, which permits of a spectacle such as we have witnessed in connection with the Swan by-election now nearing completion, a system that is utterly undemocratic and unprogressive. The electoral law is being altered to protect the returned soldier, and to give h i m the opportunity for the special representation to which he is justly entitled. Under the present electoral law he does not get a fair run. The electors have no opportunity to say whether a returned soldier as such shall represent them. able member care about that? iof the community that is numerically strong enough to send a representative to Parliament should have an opportunity to do so.

Preferential voting will bring new members to the fore in every party. The two main objections brought against the .Bill by members of the Opposition are that it is unjust to our soldiers to alter the electoral law while they are away, and that the electors are not intelligent enough to exercise the preferential vote. In reply to these, I have shown that the existing electoral system is unjust to the soldiers because it does not give them an opportunity to select representatives, and that the experience of Victoria is that fewer informal votes are cast under the preferential system than used to be cast under the old system. I trust that in Committee the Bil l may be amended so as to extend the benefits of the preferential system of voting to Senate elections. The present mode of electing senators is a scandal on Democracy, an obstacle to progress, and a dangei to the country. No doubt we shall find the M in ister reasonable in regard to amendments. He cannot but have been driven to the conclusion that the present system of electing senators should not con<inue in a country like this. -Honorabl e members opposite have made this jibe at the members of this party, that the preferential system of voting is used in our pre-selection ballots for parliamentary candidates. the election of Ministers. are different from the ordinary electoral ballots. When five persons, members of a party, offer themselves for selection for parliamentary candidature, those who vote for them under the preferential system vote for men all of whom advocate the same principles, and subscribe to the same platform, and thus do no offence to their consciences or political convictions in marking their ballot-papers in the order of their preference. It is tLe same with the election of Ministers by a Caucus. But at an ordinary parliamentary election the candidates are of opposite political faiths, and under the preferential system an elector's preferences may be applied to secure the return of a candidate to whose political views the elector is totally opposed. sory voting, although an elector might detest both candidates. voting is, at any rate, the least of two evils. If the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lynch) thinks that preferential voting w ill abolish political machinery he is mistaken. think it w ill render political machinery very uncertain. preferential voting is that if Jones and Brown, both of the same brand of politics, are candidates, and Brown is r e -' garded by an elector as the most dangerous opponent of Jones, the elector w ill not exercise the preferential vote as it is theoretically expounded, but w ill give Jones his first, and Brown his last, preference. elector. practice the preferential vote is not so f a ir as in theory it is supposed .to be.

I should like to see this Electoral Bill and the new ideas which are embodied in it postponed until Australia is in a more normal condition, and u n t i l our 300,000 absent soldiers have returned. Honourable members have said that it is a slight on the intelligence of the electors to say that the number of informal votes will be in creased by the introduction of the proposed new system of voting. Statistics endorsed by the Electoral Department show that in each year 85,000 people in Australia reach the age of twenty-one, and tiecome qualified to vote. other hand. 36,000 persons over the age of twenty-one years die, leaving a net increase of 49,000 voters. the three years' interval between elections, about 150,000 new voters are placed on the rolls, and exercise the franchise for the first time at a Federal election. I agree with those honourable members who have said that we ought to make the system of voting as simple as possible. Some of the younger persons who vote for the first time may do so more intelligently than others who have been exercising the franchise for a number of years. A t the same time when 85,000 persons qualify for a vote each year, we ought to make simplicity in voting our first aim. It will be one of the wprst sins which this Parliament can. commit if we provide for the operation of two systems of voting on the one day. taught to vote at the schools. proaching maturity might receive some instruction at the State schools; certainly when they are nearing the voting age they ought to be taught in their homes or elsewhere how to record their votes. A t the present time the system in connection with Federal elections, and some State elections, is to make a cross against the candidate's name; in other States, the voter must {place numerals against the names of candidates to indicate his preference, whilst in municipal elections he must strike out the names of the candidates whom he does not favour. These honourable varying systems create no end of confusion, whicli w ill not be lessened if a dual system is introduced by this B ill .

Where the names on the rolls ru n into millions it may be impossible to have an absolutely perfect roll, but at the same time it is rather strange that the name of the head of a household who* has been livin g in the same house for twenty years should not appear on the roll, while the names of the rest of the family are to be found upon it . In fact, in some cases the names of a whole family have been omitted from the roll. If we could send out an official notice prior to instituting a prosecution it would save many a citizen the inconvenience and loss he sustains by having to attend a Police Court, lose half a day's wages, and pay a fine of 10s. for, perhaps, an inadvertence on his part. I am sure that it would lead to 90 per cent, of these omitted names being placed on the roll, and I would like the Minister to look into the matterand found it utterly impossible to carry out the honourable. member's suggestion. People shift about so much. shifting. In one subdivision in my electorate where there are 9,000 names on the roll, I have been told by a Returning Officer that between two elections there have been almost as many alterations as there are names on the roll. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has alluded to a pledge which was specially given to the soldiers that no legislation affecting them would be amended or wiped off the statute-book during the currency of .the war. I have a oopy of the ANZAC Bulletin, dated 4th A p r i l , 1917, containing a special pledge given to the soldiers abroad. This paper is issued under the authority of the H i g h Commissioner, and besides contributions from literary men in London, it contains informative cablegrams as to what is happening in Australia. This fulfils a very desirable object, and no doubt the paper is treasured by the soldiers at the Front, because it tells them something of what is happening in their.homeland. The only thing that I object to in it-is that nearly everything which tells against the Labour party and in favour of the National party finds a place in. its pages, although it is supposed to be a non-party paper. However, this was the pledge of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), which appeared in its pagesIf the National Government be returned to power, not one stone in the temple of Labour legislation will be displaced.. It is a non-party Government, which accepts things as it finds them. It will not touch, except to increase, civil or military pensions, the maternity allowance, or the old-age pension. It will not destroy the principle of preference to unionists, nor any of the other Acts brought in by Labour Governments, and it will administer all these measures in a sympathetic spirit. Its object is not to destroy, but to build up; not to create djjscord between the various sections of the community, but, by uniting all, to enable Australia to do her' part more effectively in this war. It is an all-embracing phrase, "" nor any of the other Acts brought in by Labour Governments."" It was a Labour GovernI have already done so, ment which abolished the postal voting system, amid the ""plaudits of the Prime Minister and quite a number of honourable gentlemen sitting behind the Government who are now voting for its reintroduction. I can speak as to I have not the time to quote speeches delivered by those honourable members in opposition to the postal vote, yet we-find them to-day supporting the system with the pledge still ringing in the ears of soldiers on the othei' side of the world that not one piece of Labour legislation would be touched, injured, or altered in any way during their absence. The Prime Minister, bis Government, and the party supporting them, are now going back on that pledge. The very last vote that tens of thousands of those soldiers cast before they l e f t Australia was upon the question of the reintroduction of the postal vote, and they voted in favour of the Labour party, which said that this system of voting was not to be employed, yet while they are away it is proposed to pull down this particular portion'of-the temple of Labour, and this part of the electoral system which they helped to create when they were here.

The result of the contest in the Swan electorate during the last two or three days is an illustration of the faultiness of* the present system. ""We shall all be pleased to welcome a returned soldier to this 'House, no matter to what party he belongs; but the tender regard which the Labour party now evinces for the interest of our soldiers is of quite recent date. They talk about the pledge which the Nationalist party gave our soldiers at the Front that it would not interfere with Labour legislation in their absence; but they say nothing of the Labour party pledges they gave to our they say anything as to the way. in which they have tried to go back upon those pledges. Now that they find that r the tide is turning, the Labour party sing quite a different tune, so f a r as our soldiers at the Front are concerned. Surely they do not think that these men, who have risked their lives for us, are so unintelligent that they cannot see through their little game. We are told that we ought not to do an injustice to our soldiers in their absence; but I am satisfied that, when they return, they w ill show that they are well able to take care of themselves.

Thc honourable member _ for Wimmera( Mr Sampson) asked' this .morning whether, the Government proposed to postpone the curtailment of the issue of news print in Australia in view of the circumstances of the war. have considered the question, and have decided to postpone the operation of the regulation in-regard to news print u n t ill l t h December. A t the same time, we are intimating to the Advisory Committee, by whose advice this is being done, that the Government can in no way guarantee that shipping w ill be available to bring the amount of news print forward we hope to be able to get, and consequently it may be necessary later on to impose the restriction to the f u l l extent. I desire to immediately inform the M in ister that I refuse to accept any suggestions from him as a guide to my conduct in the House. Any suggestion of the character comes with mighty ill-grace from the honourable gentleman and members associated with him, who, all the time. I have known them in the House, have been particularly clever in making all kinds of suggestions about honourable members on this side. I say straight out and the Minister knows it , that I made no suggestion against Mr Brookes. 1 did not suggest in my question that he was coimected with the scandal. honourable member. quite clear-whethe r Mr Brookes, the Paper Controller, is the same Mr BrookesT l i is thing was done whose name is mentioned in connection with these scandals? I did not suggest whether or not his name was correctly mentioned, or anything about the matter; It has been made good I was interested only in knowing if it was the same gentleman. As to the facts of the case, the Minister now admits that It is not a question Mr Brookes is the same gentleman. connected with the firm interested. altogether. The honourable member put it in a personal"" way. name is mentioned freely in connection with the matter, and he has now had an The Government opportunity to clear himself. This opportunity he has taken, and I have no objection whatever to that. I made ho suggestion against his honour; but from what the Minister has said, it does appear as if the firm had been in the habit of paying certain secret commissions, and that because one manager has done so he has been victimized to the extent of losing his employment-losin g his employment for carrying out what seems to be a regular practice of the firm. Does the M in ister, who talks so glibly about conduct, approve of that kind of business? is assuming tliat this manager lost his employment as a result of this affair. that because you have told me so. the man. who was responsible is no longer in the employment of the f i r m . Minister that, so f a r as the connection of this gentleman w i th the firm is concerned, I know nothing whatever about it beyond what the Minister has told me ; and undoubtedly the impression on my mind, and no doubt on the mind of others, is that this man lost his position because he had been carrying out the practice of the My question was ' f i r m .

280,Mr Finlayson,"I can assure theillegal. firm responsible evidently think that they have justified themselves and their conduct by dismissing this man. But to my mind that does not help the case one bit. So far as Mr Brookes is concerned I know nothing about him. cerned only with the fact that there are certain allegations in connection with, a public matter in Brisbane, and that this firm, of which Mr Brookes is a particular member, is interested in those scandals. Surely the firm ought to be glad to have an opportunity to disclaim any connection with wrong conduct. Instead of the Minister castigating me, he ought to thank mc for the opportunity Mr Brookes has had to clear his name from any connection with this scandal. Minister in charge of the House indicate the order of business for next week ? Do the Government intend to proceed with the Electoral Bill? through Committee as soon as possible. go through Committee on Wednesday. day fortnight I asked the Acting Prime Ministeri f he would ascertain the position of the employees in the Customs Department in Queensland. The honourable gentleman carried out his promise that he would obtain the information. Minister in charge of the Department has shown me a copy of the questions which were asked in regard to the staff in Queensland, and the answers thereto, and I find that my suspicions were not well founded. Therefore, any imputations which I made when asking the question, I now withdraw. I desire to make to the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs a suggestion which will meet with the approval of both sides of the House. the telegrams, the death rate from that form of influenza which is called Spanish [270] influenza is terrible, and I ask the Ministeri f he will have simple directions prepared, and published in' the press and elsewhere, as to how people should treat the disease in the first instance. The Minister will recognise that, owing to what is known as the "" doctors' strike,"" medical attention is not given so readily to the I am conpeople as in normal times. I should like him to arrange for placards to be posted on the railway stations and elsewhere, prescribing certain simple rules. For instance, if Spanish influenza is like ordinary influenza, that soiled handkerchiefs, which are a prolific medium of distributing germs, should be placed in a simple antiseptic solution; that places of amusement where large crowds congregate, should be disinfected; that patients should rest in bed-if that is the proper form of treatment, as it is with nearly every disease; and that the windows -Will the should be kept open or closed. I am sure that the Director of Quarantine (Dr. Cumpston) would give the Minister full particulars as to what should be done, and a small leaflet, which would not be as difficult to prepare as an ordinary price-list, would be of great use to the people, particularly those in country disI am stressing this suggestion, because now is the time to act; prevention -wiD be more effective than any attempt to control the disease after it has made its appearance. Having regard to the statistics which have been cabled to us regarding the mortality in other countries, it is unnecesThe sary for me to warn the House of how grave the danger will be if the disease is allowed to get a hold in the community.
