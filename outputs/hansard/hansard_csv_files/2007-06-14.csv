194,The Speaker,"Order! It being 5.00Thursday, 14 June 2007 ----Telstra ing Herald of 13 June 2007 which stated that Western Australian MPs have been advised by email from Telstra that constituents should be advised to complain directly to Telstra. The story further stated that this practice would be extended nationally to all MPs. If this report is accurate, I am appalled. In the past, parliamentarians have had a direct contact at Telstra if we needed to clarify a question or if we needed to refer an issue. I have several objections to this abysmal decision by Telstra. Firstly, it is inappropriate for an organisation, publicly or privately owned, to determine what course of action parliamentarians should take on behalf of a constituent. Secondly, several of the complaints my office has received relate to the actual complaints procedure itself. Many people, especially the elderly, find it frustrating and, to be honest, confusing to be advised by a disembodied voice to push button 1 for one issue; button 2 for another; button 3 for a third; and so on-and, frankly, so do I. Thirdly, one constituent has advised my office that Telstra usually will not put information or problem resolutions in writing. The constituent has no comeback when Telstra say, for example, ‘We didn’t promise to reissue your bill,’ or, ‘We didn’t promise to restore your phone within seven days.’ Members of the public are, on most occasions, required to put their complaints in writing, yet Telstra is not required to do so. I am a lifetime supporter of Telstra and its predecessors and I find this latest decision intolerable. In 2004 I spoke against the proposed privatisation of Telstra in the debate on the Telstra privatisation bill. This newspaper report provides a classic example of why I did so. At the time. I stated that a privatised Telstra would be too powerful for any government to regulate efficiently. We now have evidence that a privatised Telstra is becoming too powerful for any government to control. The privatised Telstra has no accountability to the public beyond its shareholders. Telstra is not simply another private company; it is the provider of an essential service to the Australian community. The situation is not satisfactory. It is simply not acceptable. Telstra should back off from this proposal and continue to allow constituents to approach their members of parliament to act on their behalf. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges and I was a lawyer by profession before I came into parliament. I do not propose to give a definitive opinion on this, but I must say that Telstra is sailing very close to the wind in attempting to limit what members of parliament can do, and it may well constitute a breach of privilege. I seriously think that Telstra should consider its action, reverse it and allow the status quo to continue. Agricultural Shows Fisher and its surrounding areas for their very strong support for the substantial number of agricultural shows held each year in and around the electorate.

197,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.33 Am),"I would like to commend the people of the electorate of their local communities. They are also a wonderful opportunity for the community to work together and to have sporting and equestrian events and for local farmers to show the quality of their cattle and so on. Somewhat differently from the large city shows, the small agricultural shows in country areas very much revolve around volunteer labour. Often you find that the people who are displaying the produce are the people who are taking the money at the gate. I think we need to encourage as many people as possible to support agricultural shows, because they are a wonderful opportunity for a community to have a window to the world. Our agricultural shows have, of course, been affected to a greater or lesser extent by drought. I am fortunate that the area I am privileged to represent has had substantial rain, to the extent that the Caloundra City Annual Show at Maleny was virtually rained out on the second day of the show, held only a couple of weeks ago. The local shows in and around the Fisher electorate include the Kilcoy show, the Caloundra City Show at Maleny, the Caboolture show this weekend just gone, the Sunshine Coast Show at Nambour this coming weekend and the Woodford show on 21 and 22 June. All of these shows provide entertainment for local families and also help to recognise, and as a community enable us to value, the work of our farmers. Interesting things happen to members of parliament at shows. At shows I have had numerous opportunities to do things I do not do very well and this year I was invited to be one of the competitors in the milking competition. Not actually having been brought up on a farm, I must say the Ayrshire cow allocated to me was in no mood to have her udder emptied by a stranger and it took three people to hold her still. Even while I managed to get a late start, the event was all over before I could prove my milking skills, and the Caloundra City Mayor, Don Aldous, had claimed a victory. I am ashamed to say that I was actually disqualified. At the Caboolture show over the weekend I was able to reforge some acquaintances with people who have returned to the electorate of Fisher. Let me say that shows give all residents, young and old, the opportunity to be reminded of the importance of farms and rural communities and the sense of community spirit that is so important. (Time expired) New South Wales Flood Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.36 am)-The tempest that struck our region last Friday exposed the people of Newcastle and the Hunter to the world and, although we appeared battered and bruised, our community strength has been revealed for all to admire. The natural disaster began when 50-knot winds and 17-metre waves blasted the coal ship Pasha Bulker over the Nobbys Beach reef almost onto the shore, posing an immense rescue and salvage challenge. AMSA, Newcastle Port Corporation, harbour master Tim Turner and United Salvage Adsteam all went into action, and I particularly thank Gary Webb for his constant updates. Rescuing the 21 crew members in the horrendous weather was executed by the Westpac helicopter team with precision, skill and courage. Always our everyday heroes, on that day they were superheroes. To Graham Nickisson, the crew chief, and that bright, shiny boy I once taught: I am immensely proud. To the entire environmental damage control and salvage teams, thank you for being there so quickly. We hope for a safe and successful salvage. But Mother Nature had more in store. Rain continued to fall that day in quantities that would quench the thirst of this land, defying the man-made pass constructed to contain the MAIN COMMITTEE run-off and cutting paths of destruction through streets, homes and businesses. Trees were uprooted, powerlines fell and torrents of water wreaked havoc everywhere, and thus the rescue effort began. Family members, neighbours and strangers undertook great acts of bravery and compassion. About 2½ thousand State Emergency Service volunteers worked day and night, responding to 15,000 calls for help. At the height of the storm, 200,000 homes were blacked out, 28,000 people’s phones were off and water supply was cut in many areas. A superhuman effort by emergency and health workers, police, power, water and telephone teams, who swung into action, averted further tragedy. But the loss has been great and, while restoration has commenced, nothing can be done to bring back the nine people who lost their lives over the course of that terrible weekend. I extend my deepest sympathy to the families and loved ones of Wayne Bull; Adam Holt and Roslyn Bragg, their daughters, Madison and Jasmine, and their nephew Travis Bragg; Nigel Beeston; and Bob and Linda Jones. Thank you to the SES commanders, police commanders and the Premier’s office for their coordination and updates. Thank you to all our agencies and authorities who kept the information flowing and a very special acknowledgement to the entire 1233 ABC Radio team for their amazing heart-warming round-the-clock coverage. For many people without power, the trannie tuned to the ABC was their only link to the world-a constant source of emergency information, human contact and hope. We are all grateful and proud. Now that the recovery phase has begun, it is time for everyone-political leaders, bureaucrats, insurance companies, contractors, tradesmen and retailers-to become heroes too. TodayI name in parliament the first insurance company to fail that test. I name CommInsure, the insurance business arm of the Commonwealth Bank, which increased its profit after tax by 38 per cent last year to $215 million. You have failed one Hamilton North family who have complained to me. I ask you to think again. My office will continue to monitor the work of all parties involved in the restoration phase, and I will keep this parliament informed. (Time expired) Education Australian government’s initiatives for education. In a regional area such as Braddon, located on an island off the mainland, the need for quality education and knowledge is vital for the continuing sustainability and growth of the region. In Braddon we are very fortunate that we have secured very exciting and leading-edge education and knowledge transfer initiatives that not only build on the skills base of our region but also drive innovation and development within my electorate. My region of Braddon has to its credit a quality university, the University of Tasmania, which is developing leading-edge studies in knowledge creation in the science of regional studies as well as providing a wide variety of faculties to local students in business studies, computer science, arts, law and education. I am a graduate with an education degree from the University of Tasmania, and I am currently studying commerce/law. These facilities are so important to the progress of our region. As a specialist knowledge base for regional-specific learning, I am proud to say that in recent years we have secured the Rural Clinical School, which is meeting the challenge of proMAIN COMMITTEE",127,Statements By Members
198,Mr Baker (Braddon) (9.39 Am),"I rise this morning to support and comment on theviding an education to medical students specialising in rural medicine. Additionally, we are ensuring strong innovation and leading-edge knowledge transfer to our important agricultural industry through the agricultural research centre located within the Burnie campus. Thanks to the previous Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, we have secured an Australian technical college for our skills based learning in the trades area of the future. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as you would appreciate, education does not stop at university. I have mentioned the Australian technical college, but we also have a variety of high schools that continue to develop education applicable to the region. Our local schools have also benefited greatly from the Investing in Our Schools Program from which Tasmania, as a whole, has benefited by some $2.4 million for very worthwhile programs to improve the learning environment for our students. As a high school teacher in a previous life, I am very aware of the importance education and knowledge have for both the individual and a regional area. For this reason, I have supported the pilot of a program with the name of PICSIE, which enables the cross-pollination of working universities in developing the science skills of students from an early age through to high school. I commend the government’s budget initiatives in education, in particular the $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund, which will provide a base for the continued development of capital works and research within our university facilities. This program is complemented by the $1.7 billion Realising Our Potential program, which incorporates $638 million for VET funding and $843 million for our schools. With such exciting initiatives, complemented by the Australian government’s skills and apprenticeship learning programs, Braddon, as a regional area, stands strong to work within the global community. International Men’s Health Week ternational Men’s Health Week and is primarily concerned with the health challenges that men face and the incidence of particular diseases to which we are more prone as males. The week is also an opportunity to acknowledge the diversity of males around Australia and to celebrate the positive contributions of men and boys in our communities. Men and boys face different health concerns than women and girls-be they due to anatomical or biological differences, work or lifestyle differences or differences that have a psychological impact, becoming manifest through social, communal and often our own individual expectations of ourselves, the roles we perform and the responsibilities we shoulder. International Men’s Health Week is an important opportunity to both acknowledge these differences and look for ways to improve the health and well-being of men and boys. Fundamentally, the purpose of International Men’s Health Week is to heighten the awareness of preventable health problems and encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys. International Men’s Health Week has only been celebrated in Australia since 2003. It is quite new and easy to miss, but I hope in the future it becomes a big event. We should acknowledge that more than 40 per cent of Australian men over 40 years suffer serious health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Men have a lower life expectancy than women. In 2002 to 2004, male life expectancy was estimated to be 78.1 years, MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Statements By Members
199,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.42 Am),"Monday, 11 June to Sunday, 17 June is Inwhile female life expectancy was 83 years. Men under 75 years are almost three times more likely to die from coronary heart disease, stroke and vascular disease than women in the same age group. We are fortunate to have amongst us an advocate for prostate cancer checks, the member for Lilley, who continues to advance the need for such checks. I believe only last week he spoke in the seat of Adelaide about his experience with prostate cancer, just as he did in my seat of Hindmarsh last year. We had a huge turnout that day and were able to promote people’s awareness of prostate cancer. We have a former member of this place doing, I am sure, a terrific job on television at the moment advancing men’s effective communication with their doctors regarding mental healthMr Tim Fisher. I would like to conclude by making a connection between the health of men and the impact that poor health can have on loved ones in the immediate vicinity. White Ribbon Day is 25 November, a day in support of non-violent relationships, to exemplify the fact that men can stand by one another in support of healthy relationships with our family members and people generally. We all have ample opportunity to try to advance such good causes and such good messages within our respective communities and to promote healthier lifestyles and therefore, I am sure, happier and longer lives for men throughout the nation. Micah Challenge of Micah Challenge. Micah Challenge Australia is a global Christian campaign comprising over 40 Christian aid and development and church groups who are working together to provide a powerful voice for the poorer communities of the world. Next week across the nation and in Canberra, Micah Challenge will be holding and hosting a number of activities which will be not just about raising awareness but about challenging governments and people in our communities to increase action and become more generous. This year Micah Challenge will be focusing on the key framework of the Millennium Development Goals. These eight goals include the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; the achievement of universal primary education; the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women; the reduction of child mortality; the improvement of maternal health; the combating of HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases; the assurance of environmental sustainability; and the development of a global partnership for development. There has been progress made; however, not one region in the world is on the way to achieving their goals and there are many more who are nowhere near achieving them. I do, however, wish to congratulate the G8 countries that have committed to write-off the debts of 19 of the poorest nations in the world. But there is more to be done. Over 835 million people will suffer from chronic hunger. Over 10.4 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2004 from preventible causes. More than one in five girls of primary school age do not attend school. Basic sanitation in the developing world is accessed by less than half of its people. Having travelled throughout PNG and the Philippines, I have observed some of these challenges first hand.

In 2005-06 the ratio of Australian ODA to gross national income is estimated at 0.28 per cent, placing Australia above the OECD donor average, which in 2004 was 0.25 per cent. I would like to see us at least reach 0.3 per cent in 2006-07, but I encourage the Australian government to use the millennium goals as key measures when evaluating and planning our aid program. Australia has committed to providing increased aid focused on reducing poverty. (Time expired) Badgerys Creek Airport Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.48 am)-I rise today to add my voice to the ongoing calls for this government to come clean on its plans for a second airport at Badgerys Creek. As usual, we are seeing the government at its tricky best, dancing around the issue and trying to delay any decision until after the next election. The last minister to speak on this issue in this place was the member for North Sydney who, as minister for tourism, said: Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport in Sydney at Badgerys Creek ... Since that speech, no senior government minister-indeed, no minister at all-has stood up in this place and ruled out Badgerys Creek as their first, second or even last option for a second airport in Sydney. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services in response to a question in writing only last year said: The Government has previously made it clear that it does not believe that a second Sydney airport will be needed in the foreseeable future. It was not even a never-ever promise. It was a foreseeable future promise. Then he went on to say that they will be keeping the land and protecting it from development incompatible with the building of an airport. Why would you need to protect a site you do not intend to use? Now we know: the government just might use it but they will not tell us until after the next election. The Deputy Prime Minister has written to councils in Western Sydney confirming that there will be another review of the need for a Badgerys Creek airport in 2009 and, until then, land at Badgerys Creek will be held in reserve. Let me make this clear: a second airport at Badgerys Creek will not work and there will not be one under a Labor government. It would only inflict aircraft noise, air pollution, health problems and social problems on hundreds of thousands of extra people in the fastest-growing region in Australia. The EIS could not tell us how westerly winds from the Blue Mountains would affect the operation of the airport or how associated runway and approach lighting would affect the surrounding area. It did point out that some 38 endangered species of flora and 22 species of fauna, plus the additional 70 significant species of fauna that have been recorded in the area as transitory visitors, would be put further at risk, including a number of nationally significant species. It also pointed out that such an airport would mean an extra 24,000 articulated fuel tankers on the M4 and Great Western Highway between Clyde and Badgerys Creek, with an estimated five tanker accidents each year. That is just not acceptable. The government must come clean on its plans, rule out Badgerys Creek once and for all, and before the next election free up the site and move on to more sensible alternatives for Sydney’s growing transport needs. MAIN COMMITTEE Queensland: Toll Roads sions the fact that the only toll road in the entire state of Queensland passes through my electorate. Residents in my area not only have to pay a toll to access the Gateway Motorway extension, the Logan Motorway connection, to head on to roads west, north and, indeed, south of Brisbane but also have to suffer the problems of interstate trucks that are moving around those tollbooths during the daylight hours. At night it is not a problem because the Australian government pays the toll for the trucks. We have put $1.7 million on the table and made it a toll-free drive for trucks heading from interstate to the port of Brisbane. There were 221,000 fewer trucks on my local roads in just under two years as a result. You can imagine how exasperated I was to find in this morning’s Courier-Mail newspaper-a journal of great repute-that the Queensland government have decided to increase tax on residents in my electorate by increasing the toll on the tollway that I am complaining about. So, instead of actually taking the tollway out of contention and making certain that the best purpose-built road in my area is in fact used by motorists and not avoided by motoriststhere is something like a twentyfold potential increase in the amount of traffic that it currently carries; it runs at about five per cent capacity or less as a result of this toll-the Queensland government have decided to increase the toll. ‘It is only 10c,’ they say, but why don’t they just call it what it is? This is a form of regional taxation that impacts on suburbs in my electorate: Sunnybank Hills, Stretton, Calamvale and Runcorn. Local residents in those areas have to pay a tax to access a road that in every other part of Queensland is available free of charge. Queensland government local representatives, Ministers Spence and Robertson, are very important people; they are ministers in the Queensland government. Stephen Robertson presides over the failed Queensland health system. He is the bloke who is in charge of the issue of ‘Dr Death’, Dr Patel. Minister Spence presides over the failures of the Queensland Police Service to adequately meet community expectations. Neither of these people speak out against this. What has been their representation in cabinet discussions in the budgetary process which has delivered this tax hike for local residents in my area? Why is it that the Queensland government can take record amounts of stamp duty from new residents in my area? All of these suburbs are new suburbs. The Queensland government are never afraid, never behind the door, when the question of stamp duty on housing and land transactions is being discussed. They are always there with their hands out but never put their money on the table to assist people to gain access to reasonable infrastructure and services. Two state members are silent. I am the only one who ever speaks out on these issues. That is the difference I bring to the local community: I draw people’s attention to the failure of the Queensland state government. (Time expired) Telstra Radio and Television Reception Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.54 am)-I would like to support the comments made by the member for Banks in his statement to this House. I have had similar concerns. The Area General Manager of Telstra in the Hunter, Chris Cusack, came to visit me last week to justify the sacking of 210 workers in my area. Whilst he was there he told me that Telstra would no longer communicate with my office. He told me that, if I wrote to him on behalf of a constituent, he would contact the constituent and give absolutely no feedback to my office. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Statements By Members
201,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (9.51 Am),"I have reported to the House on many occacomplaint, it would not get back to me; it would get back to its customer. I want to put on record in this parliament my absolute contempt for Telstra and the way it has behaved in recent times. It has become a law unto itself, sacking workers and refusing to communicate with members of parliament. The other issue that I would like to very quickly raise relates to radio and television reception within my local area. I am currently undertaking a survey of residents in affected areas, checking out those residents to see whether or not they can get commercial or ABC radio coverage, mobile phone coverage-which appears to be the worse of all from the surveys I have received back-and commercial and ABC television. I have already written to the minister about this issue and she wrote back to me saying that residents in the area may not be able to obtain reception. She came up with a couple of suggestions-talking to an antenna technician, which all of these residents have done; modification of orientation of existing equipment, and most of them have already done that-and also stated that any changes for the ABC’s point of view would have to relate to budget considerations. The one suggestion she gave me that absolutely floored me, considering that none of my electorate would be more than 185 kilometres from Sydney, is that they apply for a satellite and then they might be able to access Southern Cross through the Seven network or Imparja. I think that, in this day and age in an area that is just outside Sydney and very close to Newcastle, it is an absolute disgrace that they are not able to access radio and television. I think that, once I have completed this survey, I will have the hard evidence to demonstrate that something needs to be done. (Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Xavier Catholic College almost $10 million worth of capital works at Hervey Bay’s Xavier Catholic College representing ministers Bishop and Truss. The college opened in 2003 with a student enrolment of 90, all of them in grade 8. But already it has forged a fine reputation in sporting, cultural and academic excellence. Departing from my set script that day, I was inspired to reflect on four images. The day was quite windy, so I felt it symbolised the spirit in the school. With most of the 720 students present, it reinforced the image of a young city like Hervey Bay. Hervey Bay faces some challenging infrastructure problems. In that respect the Catholic community in Hervey Bay has played its part in providing infrastructure which helps to make a diverse community cohesive and focused. I also had an image of choice at the opening. All families want to have a choice of where their kids are educated. By funding both government and non-government schools, the coalition is giving parents that choice. Part and parcel of providing quality education for children is creating a learning environment, whether that be in classrooms, playgrounds, science labs or the school library. This has been one of the largest capital works agendas I have seen over such a short time. Xavier Catholic College is doing a fine job by promoting a tremendous school spirit and giving students a truly Christian outlook on the wider world. A big part of that comes from support, fellowship and friendship of the schools, leaders and faculty. MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Statements By Members

The facilities which were opened at the weekend officially brought online all of the school’s primary classrooms, a senior technology precinct-said to be one of the best in the state-several general purpose classrooms, new computing and science facilities, and the college library and extensions to staff and administrative areas.

If you can give me some information about that, I would be grateful. Minister for Health and Ageing here in the Main Committee, for opposition members to put their comments, questions or statements that they wish to make and then I would respond to them all at the end.

If the minister wants to stand up each time and say that he is not going to answer them that is entirely up to the minister. The next range of questions-that, obviously, the minister is also not going to answer in any way-go to the dental package. The minister would no doubt be aware that in the announcement of the dental package it was estimated that 200,000 people would be able to be covered by this-a staggering figure given that only a handful of people have been covered to date by the existing program and given that the government does not know and has not yet been prepared to tell us what the rebates will be, what the out-ofpocket costs will be or whether or not the referral process will be reformed. I would like the minister to advise how that figure of 200,000 was worked out. What estimate is it based on, given that there is no estimation of what the rebates will be and there is no information as yet of what procedures are actually going to be covered? Minister, if you could tell me how that figure of 200,000 people was achieved I would be grateful. Obviously, the minister is not prepared to answer these questions. I am absolutely sure that the reason that this decision has been taken is that there are not any answers. The minister, MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008

One comment that I am going to continue to make will be about the fact that it is apparent that the minister is not going to, in any way, provide any decent information to us about these issues. Minister, I would like you to also answer some questions about the existing chronic disease program that the government has now committed several hundred million extra dollars to. It is my understanding that only 68 Tasmanians across the entire three-year period of the program have actually been able to access any benefit from this program. I would like the minister to confirm whether that is in fact true. Similarly, I would like to know whether or not it is true that only 657 Queenslanders across the entire three-year period have used this program. Obviously, the minister would be aware that there are currently 650,000 people on the public dental waiting lists and, given these extraordinarily low numbers, I ask again: how is it that the government reached an estimate of an anticipated 200,000 people using this same program in the coming three years? Those questions are the main questions in relation to the dental program and the minister might like to answer them in a group. going to be a very frustrating and pointless 50 minutes, I imagine, if this is the way we are going to go. Perhaps it means that the minister just does not have these answers. The vast array of people here from the department will no doubt provide the same information that has already been provided to Senate estimates.

Our particular concern about the copayment is our knowledge that there is an especially high incidence in the Indigenous communities. We are concerned that, for some members of those communities, the $50 will be a disincentive to participate in the program. I am wondering whether the minister will be able to tell me whether any assessments are made on who will be able to participate, whether the payment will have an impact and whether it will be a disincentive for people to participate in this program. Is the minister prepared to answer that question? He is still not prepared to, but I am hoping that there will be answers to these questions as I go on. Minister, I have a particular question about the listing on the PBS of Strattera. The budget papers make clear that around $100 million is going to be added to the PBS and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme between 2007-08 and 2010-11. I am wondering whether the minister can advise if the government has given any reconsideration to this listing or reviewed it in any way, given the growing community concerns that there have been about the side effects of this product. Obviously it is an issue which is of great concern to the many people who have been affected. I am wondering if the government can give me some advice on whether any other mechanism has been put in place to deal with this. Minister, further on the PBS issues, I am also wondering whether you can give us any information about ADHD drugs, which are also costing a significant amount of money through the PBS. Can you give us an update on the NHMRC guidelines committee that has been established? The minister may or not be aware of the process that has been put in place. There was quite aMr Pyne interjectingyears ago. It has been a very slow process to get a new committee established. We know that the government believes that that committee can do this work, but it is obviously a slow process. Can the minister tell me how that process is going, any expected time, and if any other variations to the process have been made, given the controversy over the conflict of interest of, I think, the chair of that committee? Perhaps the minister might also consider whether he is prepared to advise us of the members of that committee, which to date have not been made publicly available. Those are the questions in relation to the PBS. Minister, I am also wondering whether you can answer some questions in relation to the Ageing portfolio.

231,Ms Roxon,"So the minister would be aware that the guidelines were withdrawn twono doubt be aware that your own department assesses that they are something in the order of 500 beds short in Western Australia. Minister, I am wondering whether you can give us an update on the department’s and the government’s assessment of the bed shortages in each state. We estimate that they are of a high order. Whenever we have asked these questions in the past, the government has always talked about aged-care places as a whole. We of course acknowledge the care that is provided through community care packages. But, as the Minister for Ageing would be well aware, they cover entirely different types of needs and people with different care needs. If the minister could provide us with an update-particularly in relation to Western Australia, since he is in the paper asserting that there is a glut-that would be useful. We would also appreciate an update, Minister, if you have one, on the status of aged-care beds around the country. State by state would be preferable. I have some further questions, but I am going to allow my colleagues to ask a couple. The minister, unfortunately, has not seen fit to answer any of the questions along the way, but we are hoping he might. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (10.14 am)-I want to raise with the minister the announcement in the appropriations for health that three new MRI licences are to be allocated. I do not know whether the minister at the table is aware of this, but I know that Minister Abbott is aware that we have been lobbying for five years to get an MRI licence allocation at Wollongong Hospital. I am obviously very keen to know whether the three new licences are already identified to go to particular places. If not, if there is going to be a process by which a new round of allocations will occur, will it go on existing lists and requests or will a new round of requests and indications of interest be required? I would like the minister to jump up and assure me that Wollongong will get one, but I suspect that that is probably a bit of a premature expectation. At least if we knew what the process will be and what the intentions are for those three licences that would be useful to my community. It would be especially useful for the specialist base in Wollongong, because it is a major referral hospital and people from there constantly ring me to find out when they can get a licence for the hospital base machine for their patients. It is not so much your standard MRI for people who have sporting injuries and so forth. It is the major oncology and radiology referral hospital, so those specialists practising in that town centre really want to be able to send their patients to the Wollongong facility for an MRI scan, rather than, as some of them are doing, admitting them overnight to hospital in order to get a bulk-billed scan done as an in-patient. We are particularly keen to know what is happening with those three announced licences. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.16 am)-I want to add something further in that line. In relation to the MRIs we are particularly keen to know, as the member for Cunningham has indicated, if any decision or preliminary identification of sites has been made for those additional three licences. The minister may be aware that Launceston General Hospital have also been arguing for a long time that they should have an MRI licence. It is a similar sort of situation to the one described by the member for Cunningham, where there is a major hospital that does not have access to this facility. I have also recently been to Redcliffe Hospital, where they are developing an oncology specialisation as well. One of the things that is stopping that is the absence of an MRI machine licence. People have to travel fairly long distances from the north of Brisbane into town to access those services. Again, all three of these places seem like places that should be given consideration by the government, but we have not had any information from them. I know MAIN COMMITTEE that many people in those local communities are very interested to know what the government’s plans are. Also, Minister, if decisions have not been made, people want to know the expected time for decisions to be made on those licences. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.17 am)-Along those lines, Minister, I wonder if you could get some information for me on the licensing of the PET scanning machine in the Hunter. There have been numerous applications made for that machine to be licensed. At the moment it is operating well under capacity because the government refuses to allocate a licence. It is a very large area, covering an enormous number of people in the Hunter and New England, yet the government constantly refuses to license a machine. Could you please look into that for me and provide us with information. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (10.18 am)-The other issue that I would like to ask the minister to consider in terms of MRI licence allocations is one that has been raised with me by other providers in my area. I am interested to know if the government has done or intends to do any analysis of the competitive effects of licence allocations in regions. Obviously I am indicating the anticompetitive effects that happen with this very limited licence allocation process. WhilstI understand the cost implications for governments of giving these things out willy nilly, it has been raised with me by other scanning providers that the ability to offer MRI scanning has a big impact on your ability to attract staff. People want to be able to access as part of their professional development those diagnostic services, so the one provider who has the licence has an extraordinary advantage over other providers in the area in terms of business competitiveness. I think that is a genuine concern. I do not know that that is something that would change the allocations policy, but I would certainly encourage the government and the minister to have a look, at this point in the process of allocating licences, at any sort of anticompetitive effects it may be having on other providers in the area. It is clearly something that is being raised with members of parliament. I would suggest that serious concerns are increasing as this becomes not unusual service but in fact a standard component of the range of services that radiology looks to provide in the local area. Second, I understand that the most recent allocation of licences had a requirement for a bulk-billing component. However, the previously allocated licences do not. The dilemma that we have with licence allocation in Wollongong is that the provider only bulk-bills particular types of oncology patients. It does not bulk-bill, for example, healthcare cardholders in general. This is creating a great deal of distress, particularly amongst pensioners and family people. Indeed, only this week I saw a lady whose daughter had to have a scan once every two weeks as part of the treatment she was receiving for a cancer related disease, but she did not meet the very limited guidelines this provider has for bulk-billing. That is causing major issues. SoI ask whether the guidelines for the allocations have been changed for new licences, whether the requirement to bulk-bill will be maintained for, at least, healthcare cardholders, and whether there is any capacity to review the existing licence holders who are not meeting those requirements. Again, I would argue that part of the problem is the lack of competition for those providers. Particularly in an area like mine, patients have to get into Sydney-or travel down to Nowra, as the member for Gilmore knows-to get a bulk-billed service. I ask whether there is a view that there should be a review of some of that in-built anticompetitive bad pricing behaviour MAIN COMMITTEE that was there in the early rounds-which was unsurprising, with a new program and a rollout. Is there the capacity to go back and have a look at those charging practices of the existing licence holders? Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.22 am)-I would like to raise the issue of workforce shortage and the scheme that the government brought in a couple of budgets ago to encourage doctors to move to outer metropolitan areas. I understand that there has been a cut in funding to that scheme. I would like to ask the minister if he could go back and review the RRAMA classification scheme and the strategies that are in place to address workforce shortage issues. My area is classified as an area of workforce shortage, but I would like the government to make a lot clearer the method that they use for classifying those areas where there is not a doctor that is taking new patients and where there is a very elderly population. I would also like the minister to come back with information that will clarify for me and the people that I represent in this parliament why, in an area that is so close to inner Newcastle and Sydney, people are unable to see a doctor. I would like that information even for the benefit of my staff, who have to pick up people from their homes and drive them some 10 kilometres to see a doctor that will bulk-bill or even see new patients. I would also like the minister to come back to me and tell me what sorts of items are in this budget that are going to address that chronic workforce shortage. On another issue, I notice that in the budget there is a line item for breastfeeding education support. The minister may or may not be aware-or may or may not be listening to what I am saying-that there is a line item for this going over the next five years. I would like details of what that line item refers to, what the government’s actual strategy will be in relation to breastfeeding, who it is contacting and who it is using as its resource. I understand that the government is removing questions in relation to breastfeeding from the national survey that is conducted by the Department of Health and Ageing and I would like to ask how this line item, which seems to indicate that the government is making some sort of commitment to breastfeeding, lines up with the fact that it is no longer asking questions about it. That is another question that I would like the minister to provide me with an answer to. The next issue relates a little to one that the shadow minister raised earlier, and that is agedcare beds and the shortage of aged-care beds within the Shortland electorate. There is a chronic aged-care bed shortage. The Central Coast, I believe, has a shortage of just under 600, and in the Hunter it is just under 400. I would like the minister to come back to me with up to-date figures on what those bed shortages are. In addition to that, I would like the minister to provide me with details of the actual bed shortage number in relation to operational beds, because those figures are calculated once again on bed licences that are issued and do not show the number of beds that have been approved but are non-existent-phantom beds, in other words. I would like to be able to very clearly identify in my mind the beds that are operational and those that are just phantom beds-those that are out there on paper but are non-existent and not available to constituents in the Shortland electorate. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.27 am)-Minister, I have one last question, which I am sure you will not need the advice of the department on. I understand that the minister recently made some comments and, after acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which he was speaking, also decided that he should acknowledge the traditional owners of the Liberal Party, the Pharmacy Guild. I was wondering if the minister might be able to tell us what MAIN COMMITTEE exactly that means, and is there anything in the budget that we should be looking for that is an indicator of that commitment? Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (10.27 am)-I wanted to ask some questions about respite care and aged care. In my electorate of Boothby 18 per cent of the population are over 65, based on the 2001 census. I know that the Minister for Ageing has a similar age profile in his electorate-the Marion Central statistical local area is still recognised as an area of need or an area requiring additional places. One of the things I hear from constituents is a need for respite care when you have elderly carers in the family. Also, in the area of community aged care, we now see very much a preference for people, if they wish, to stay in their own homes as long as possible. I would be interested to hear if there is any update on respite care and community aged care. minister sums up? Ms Roxon interjectingthe minister has said that he will reply at the end.

I note that the member for Hindmarsh has entered the chamber. It seems that he would like to make a comment or ask a question, so I am happy to sit down briefly, if he would like. He can have a go and then I will try and answer his questions at the end. about aged-care beds. Recently in the 2005 stocktake, if you want to call it a stocktake, of aged-care beds in the south and western regions of Adelaide there was an undersupply of 287 aged-care beds as at 2005. That undersupply had increased to 315 beds by June 2006. That was approximately a 10 per cent increase in unmet demand. I was wondering what the June 2007 stocktake means for Adelaide’s western and south-western suburbs where there was unmet demand. Perhaps you could give me a figure of what it currently is and whether the supply will meet the demand perhaps by June this year, next year or the year after. When will the demand be met? Will there be another 10 per cent blow-out in undersupply by this June? Can the Australian public expect the unmet demand again to be in the vicinity of the 350 mark, as has been the case for a number of years now when the stocktake is done? Can the government continue to expect people to move to where the beds are? That is one of the big issues. When people come to see me in my electorate, they tell me about their loved ones, usually their mums or dads, needing a nursing home bed. Usually, they are either in respite or waiting in a public hospital. People may say to me that they have found a nursing home for their mother or father but it is up in Gawler or Elizabeth or down south in Christies, which makes it very difficult for some of these people who are themselves elderly, in their late 60s and 70s, to travel, perhaps every day, to see their loved ones. Even though there may be beds within the vicinity of metropolitan Adelaide, they are some distance away from the western and southern suburbs and that creates a problem for these people. How will we meet the unmet demand for people who need beds to stay within their communities? The other question I have is: can the minister tell us how many people are in beds in public hospitals waiting for beds in nursing homes in South Australia at any given time-perhaps a snapshot over 12 months? I also want to know about those waiting in respite care for nursing home beds, because that is the other issue. There are many people who come and see me in my electorate whose parents are either in a public hospital or even in a respite bed, but when they are due to come out of the respite bed in two, three or four weeks time there is nowhere for them. Again, it is the same issue about having people close to their communities. I suppose the question is: will that undersupply be met, when and how will it be met, and are there any dates for those targets to be met? If we could get those figures for Shortland in New South Wales, the Hunter and the Central Coast as well. I am sure the staff could get those figures for the member for Shortland. Minister for Health and Ageing today in the consideration in detail of the appropriation bills. The members for Gellibrand, Cunningham, Shortland, Boothby and Hindmarsh have been keen participants in this process and have asked me a series of detailed questions. Some of those are obviously within the portfolio of health, and I am less familiar with those than I am with the portfolio of ageing, but I will with the support and help of the department attempt to respond to these as best I can and hopefully to the satisfaction of the House.

Firstly, she raised the issue of dental health and dental treatment. It is an area that has been something of a bugbear in public policy for some time. Obviously dental health is a primary responsibility of the states. When Labor were in power all those years ago, they had a specific program that had targets to be met; those targets were met and the program came to an end. Since that time, the Commonwealth has expected the states to fulfil their responsibilities for the dental health of their electors, and in this budget we areMs Roxon-Tell us how your budget is going to work.

People with chronic conditions and complex care needs often do have poor oral health, which can adversely affect their medical condition or their general health. In the budget, the government committed $377.6 million over four years to make it easier for these people to access dental services in the private sector when they need treatment or they receive preventative care. Under the new Medicare arrangements, eligible patients will be able to claim Medicare benefits for a diagnostic dental consultation as well as benefits for a range of dental treatments up to a maximum of $2,000 each calendar year.

251,The Deputy Speaker,"Is the honourable minister prepared to take a question?the minister whether he will take a question. You prefer not to take a question? and I am trying to answer them. I am trying to give her the position generally on dental health and answer her specific questions as well. I was saying that an estimated 200,000 people will benefit from these new Medicare items, and they will commence on 1 November 2007. The budget significantly expands on the existing Medicare dental items, introduced in 2004, for people with chronic and complex conditions. The intention is to cover a broad range of areas. The member for Gellibrand asked about specific areas such as assessments, fillings, extractions and dentures. The member for Gellibrand specifically asked about whether dentures would be covered, and the answer is that that is the intention. The implementation arrangements are currently being discussed with the dental profession. The government is working closely with the Australian Dental Association on the issue of rebate and out-of-pocket expenses. My understanding is that the Dental Association have been very pleased with this announcement by the government and it went much further than they had initially expected. I was also asked about the uptake of existing dental items so far. That was a legitimate question from the member for Gellibrand. I think that the point the member for Gellibrand made about a low uptake of existing dental items is exactly the reason why the government has expanded this area of Medicare items. It is why we are addressing the issue. We recognised that there was an issue that needed to be looked at, and that is exactly why this item is in the budget. We are responding to the needs of the community, especially people with chronic health conditions. Rather than criticising us for doing so, I would have thought the Labor Party should congratulate the government on taking this excellent step. The member for Gellibrand asked a specific question about type 2 diabetes. The answer to that question is that the copayment for type 2 diabetes has been set at $50 and the government will consider waiving the copayment for concession card holders when designing the administrative detail of the scheme in the near future. When that is done, the member for Gellibrand will no doubt be informed of it, as she is in the normal course of events. I was also asked a question about Strattera and the PBS. I have to say that this is specifically an area for the Minister for Health and Ageing. I have sought advice from the department on the answer to the member for Gellibrand’s question and I have been told that all the appropriate staff in that area are in committee and unable to answer that question specifically today. I will take it on notice and make sure that an answer is provided to the member for Gellibrand in a very short space of time, which I think should be today or tomorrow, as soon as the appropriate staff are available. The member for Gellibrand and the member for Shortland asked about ADHD. This is an area that has been of great interest to me. When I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I had something to say about issues to do with ADHD, Ritalin and drug prescription, specifically to infants and young people, and I initiated a review of the MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008

255,The Deputy Speaker,Thank you. The honourable minister.,145,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
256,Mr Pyne,"I make the point that the member for Gellibrand has asked many questionsguidelines. When I was the parliamentary secretary to the minister for health we asked the Royal Australasian College of Physicians to conduct a review of the guidelines. The member for Gellibrand is quite right: they were rescinded in December 2005. It is an area that is of great interest, I think, to the mums and dads and grandparents of Australia, who are being bombarded with information that the uptake of these prescription drugs is growing exponentially. When I was the parliamentary secretary to the minister for health and inquired about this area, I was told that some of the statistics indicated dramatic take-up of some of these prescription drugs because of the fact that they had not previously been on the PBS, and therefore, when they did come onto the PBS, there was a large movement from other drugs across to, for example, Ritalin. It did not mean necessarily there was a massive increase in the prescribing of ADHD drugs generally, but it meant that there was a movement across to particular drugs which were now much cheaper for the mums and dads who were purchasing them. Ms Roxon-And the committee? bit to suggest that I am not answering the questions. I am trying to answer them as specifically as possible. The member for Gellibrand asked about the committee of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians that was conducting this review. It is true that Dr Daryl Efron was originally appointed by the RACP to chair the working party overseeing the revision. Dr Efron stepped down from that position. The new chair, as advised by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, will be Associate Professor David Forbes. Associate Professor Forbes is a highly regarded paediatrician. He is very familiar with the NHMRC guideline review process. His areas of clinical practice and research are not associated with ADHD in any way. He has declared he has no pecuniary or professional interest in companies involved in the development or marketing of drugs and medicinal preparations. Ms Hall-And the rest of the committee? really is a matter for the Minister for Health and Ageing to announce as he chooses to do so, or the parliamentary secretary for health. I am sure that that will be done in the fullness of time and when that is appropriate to do so. I am mindful of the time, so I will try to answer some of these other questions. The member for Shortland asked me about positron emission tomography machines-PET machines. I am advised that the minister for health is currently awaiting advice from the Medical Services Advisory Committee on new clinical applications for PET machines and the department is also preparing advice for the minister regarding funding for PET machines. I am sure that all of the applications for PET machines and MRI licences will be considered appropriately. I could not, as you would imagine, make a commitment to provide a PET machine in the Hunter, no sooner could I do so for an MRI licence in Wollongong. But I am sure that when those applications are appropriately made, they will be appropriately considered. The good news, Member for Gellibrand, is that I do have an answer now on Strattera. The appropriate departmental people have been able to be found. Strattera has been fully evaluated recently by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the TGA-the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The TGA and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee carefully MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
257,Mr Pyne,I am getting to the committee. The member for Gellibrand is champing at the,146,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
258,Mr Pyne,"I am not at liberty at this stage to advise on the rest of the committee. Thatconsidered the safety and efficacy of Strattera in the treatment of ADHD and recommended its use. The TGA has required a boxed warning statement. I am sure the member for Gellibrand would be familiar with what that means. I used to be responsible for the TGA and it is obviously significant. A boxed warning statement will be included in the consumer information for Strattera alerting people to the potential for suicide issues. The TGA will monitor the safety of Strattera once it becomes available on the PBS on 1 July. Of course, we would welcome reports from prescribers of any concerns about side effects. I really answered the question about MRI licences when I answered the question about the PET machines. The minister has not yet made a decision as to what process will be used to allocate the new MRI licences. I would like to comment on the Ageing portfolio, so some of the other questions on breastfeeding and workforce issues we will take on notice and get responses to the members who have asked those questions. I would now like to turn to ageing, which is actually my portfolio, for a few minutes. I was asked specific questions and they generally revolved around so-called phantom beds or a shortage of beds. I can advise the House that, in the last 11 years, we have increased the number of allocated beds by 48 per cent, which is a massive increase. Our record on the number of beds being available is, quite frankly, exemplary. We now have 208,000Ms Hall interjectingMs Hall-Yes. Australia-operational places. When we came to office, the ratio of beds for each group of 1,000 people aged 70 and over was 93 under the previous government. By 2010, the ratio will be 113. That will be made up of 44 high-care beds, 44 low-care beds and 25 Community Aged Care Packages. I note that the Labor Party has this obsession with ignoring Community Aged Care Packages and pretending that they are not aged-care places. Of course, I can understand why they do that. When they were in government there were only 4½ thousand community aged-care places. Now, by 2010, there will be 45,000 community aged-care places. We have increased the number tenfold. SoI can understand why Labor is embarrassed about community agedcare places and therefore tries to pretend that they are not an alternative to aged care. People vastly prefer to stay in their own homes and age in their own homes if they have that option available to them. That is why we have doubled the funding for home and community care places across Australia and why we have increased the number of community aged-care packages tenfold in the last 11 years. It gives people the opportunity to stay in their own homes for a much longer period of time, and it is obviously an important part of the government’s response to the ageing process. It does not surprise me that Labor is embarrassed about that, because we will have increased the spending on aged care since 1996 from a paltry $3.1 billion to $10.1 billion by 2010. Quite frankly, the government’s record on aged care should be embarrassing to the Labor Party. We have increased the number of community care packages, which the member for Boothby asked me about, from 4,500 to 45,000. There are now 25 per 1,000 people aged 70 or over. The Prime Minister has a particular affection for respite care, and we ensure that resMAIN COMMITTEE",146,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Proposed expenditure, $4,180,814,000. taking the time to come to the Main Committee this morning. I want to ask some questions about Budget Paper No. 2. The first is about an issue on page 80 in respect of the Cole inquiry and possible criminal offences arising from that inquiry. I want to focus on not so much the issue of the possible criminal offences but whether the department will be conducting an investigation into what we would submit is clear evidence of flawed processes. I am not going to the integrity or honesty of any person in raising this issue, but clearly there appears to have been, just as a basic matter of administration, failure of communication in respect of the weapons for wheat issue. Going back to as early as 1998, the Australian intelligence community had certainly been warning of the involvement of the trucking company Alia in paying kickbacks to the regime of Saddam Hussein. Indeed, Saddam Hussein’s family had interests in Alia. There had also been warnings by Bronte Moules, from the Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations, regarding bribes generally as far back as 13 January 2000 and on other occasions. There had been cables from DFAT in Canberra mentioning the occurrence of irregularities generally in respect of the oil for food program. There had been specific warnings going back to Colonel Michael Kelly, who was based in Iraq at the time. He said in May 2004 in one of his emails: Looks like the jig is up on AWB and the OFF scandal. Subsequently, in July 2004 he told an Iraq task force meeting that AWB were up to their eyeballs in the illicit payments of the oil for food program, had cosy relationships with the Iraqi ministry and regime figures, and understood where the money was going. I have a number of pages here documenting those warnings-in the order of 32. Albeit some of them are general warnings, others are very specific. As a matter of effective and efficient administration, we would think-and the public would expect-that the senior departmental administration would have called people in and asked them: ‘What did you know and when did you know it? Who did you communicate it to?’ Or ‘Why didn’t you communicate it?’ One would think the department would have been looking at some system to address what has been, from the point of view of basic administration, unquestionably a gross failure of effective communication. I note by way of passing that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report on the detention issue in Iraq in August 2005 pointed to this characteristic within the department. It said that ineffective record keeping, unclear, haphazard reporting processes and poor communication networks meant that both departments-that is, DFAT and the Department of Defence-were unable to present a coherent, detailed and accurate account of the matters of concern to the committee. In its recommendations, the committee raised MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
261,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.51 Am),"I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs forconcerns about the communication and reporting processes within the departments for falling short of what is expected of a highly skilled and professional organisation. With respect to the kickbacks issue, the AWB scandal, irrespective of issues of criminality, there are clearly further examples of failures of communication, transparency and accountability. We want to know what, if anything, is being done to find out what went wrong and what needs to be done to fix either the culture or the system of communication. tion members want, I am happy to accommodate them with that. I am happy to answer their questions as they come, one by one. It might be a bit easier than trying to remember them all at the very end. Because the government had information coming out of the Volcker process, in particular, that there were at least allegations of AWB Ltd having been involved in a kickbacks operation in Iraq-something that we profoundly disprove of-we decided to set up a commission of inquiry with the powers of a royal commission, which was called the Cole inquiry. This was established in late 2005 and had hearings through the early part of 2006. Commissioner Cole produced his report in November 2006-if memory serves me well. Commissioner Cole went through all of the documentation, cables and emails that my department and other relevant authorities had and, in some cases, he called people before the inquiry as witnesses and examined those people. Those people were also cross-examined by counsel representing AWB employees. The Labor Party had a close relationship with the counsel representing AWB employees. They spoke with them every day and kept in close touch with them, as they did with Caroline Overington. This was all played out in a dramatic way during 2006. All sorts of allegations and claims were made. The honourable member refers to Colonel Kelly. Colonel Kelly’s testimony was contradicted by people from my department and from other departments. In the end, Commissioner Cole chose not to call Colonel Kelly because he thought the claims Colonel Kelly made-and recently more light has been shed on the basis of those claims-did not merit examination. I cannot speak for Commissioner Cole, but this view was taken presumably in the light of the fact that Colonel Kelly’s claims were contradicted by other witnesses and other evidence. The Labor Party has come to its own conclusions. I appreciate that. The party political line here is that the Liberal Party and the National Party are guilty of all manner of crimes. My department, according to the honourable member, should be investigating fraud within the department. I have always said that the public servants in my department are good and honourable people; I do not have any evidence of their being corrupt. I do not have any basis for calling for an investigation into fraud in my department in relation to the AWB matter. More than that, Commissioner Cole produced a report and made his own findings and they happen to be at complete variance with the allegations made by the Labor Party. They were 180 degrees different. In answer to the honourable member’s question, I would recommend to him, with the best will in the world, that he spend time reading the Cole report. It is several volumes; I appreciate that it would take a lot of time-but I would do that if I were him. He might find it interesting. Just making a few party political points like the ones he has made will not take him very far. MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
262,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (10.57 am)-Whatever the opposiThe department will receive $4.6 million over four years for the implementation of the government’s response to the Cole inquiry, and the resources will allow the department to carry out the enhanced responsibilities for the implementation of UN sanctions conferred upon the department by the government. The department intends to use these resources to enhance its capacity to support the incorporation of sanctions regimes into Australian law, administer and coordinate the implementation of sanctions regimes, develop systems to monitor and ensure compliance with Australian law on sanctions, undertake outreach in Australia and overseas to develop awareness of responsibilities for the observance of sanctions regimes, and develop online and hard-copy publications providing guidance on Australian requirements for the implementation of sanctions. Those resources are provided under a crossportfolio measure, which was announced in the budget, led by the Attorney-General. the record. At no stage have I accused any representative of the minister’s department of fraud. I prefaced my previous question by saying it was based distinctly on raising an issue not of integrity or honesty but simply of systems failures. The minister’s final response to the question started to go in that direction. I should indicate to the minister that I have read the report. I have put a number of questions on the Notice Paper as a result of having read the report and there will be more to come. They will focus specifically on the issue of systems failures: why information was received at certain levels and why it was not communicated up the chain. I would have thought from the process of administrative effectiveness that the minister would want to have known why that did not occur. Stepping perhaps beyond my brief in my next question, I thought it appropriate to place that on the record. Our engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is an important issue for both sides of politics. I have a number of questions. Has the minister’s department considered placing a permanent representative with the United States Joint Interagency Task Force West? Have there been any discussions with the Federal Police, for instance, about placing a Federal Police officer with that agency? Both the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies in Honolulu and the East-West Center would relish the opportunity to have Australian representatives on staff. Has consideration been given to that so that we can work more closely with the issues of governance capacity building in our region? Is there concern that it appears that East Timor is developing its future military intentions without participation or sufficient input from Australia? Again, without being judgemental from afar, there seems to be a lack of effectiveness in our relationships with the Solomons and Fiji. Has there been any review as to how we might develop a different mode of operating so that we could be more effective in our operations? There is a reference in the budget papers on page 200 to the development of multilateral initiatives. Given the minister’s attempted canning of me a couple of days ago for suggesting that Australia should take an approach to multilateral issues, how does he justify that line item? Finally, in terms of disaster response, just what measures are we taking in respect to, for instance, the threat of bird flu? Are we assisting Indonesia to develop vaccines, both for chickens and people? What are we doing to plan for the evacuation of nationals? What are we doing to plan for the protection of first responders? Indeed, what are we doing to plan for a transit point to take evacuees prior to their return to Australia in order to check them for disease? In response to the Asian tsunami, has any analysis been undertaken by Australian authorities of the massive and substantial aid response-that is recognised-and how that could MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008

I appreciate that in the time available it may be difficult to respond to all of these questions, but perhaps the minister could do so at a subsequent time if he is able. member for all his questions. We have until 11.40, so I will leave time for other members to raise issues they might want to raise. I will go through these things very quickly and no doubt inadequately. First of all, I will look at the questions about the AWB matter. The honourable member started his comments by asking whether the department will be conducting an investigation into fraud within the department. That really took me aback a bit. That is an allegation that people in my department were involved in fraud. I wrote down what the honourable member said. If that is what he means, there has been a royal commission into this matter. As I said, I would recommend he not just glance at it and listen to his leader’s fanciful allegations but read it. As far as Australia working with the Americans in the Asia-Pacific region is concerned, I was in Honolulu a couple of weeks ago and our relationship there works as well as it has ever worked in modern history-since 1945. We have a very intimate relationship with the Americans working in South-East Asia in particular. Some of the great successes, for example, in the area of counterterrorism-obviously, because these are sensitive matters, without getting into any of the details-would not have been possible without the excellent cooperation between Australia and the United States. I often make this point to people, particularly people on the left, who say that they do not think we should be so close to the United States and that we are too close to the Bush regime and so on. If you want to deal with the issue of terrorism in South-East Asia, you need good, strong bilateral relations with countries like Indonesia and the Philippines and you need to be working with them. But you also need a close relationship with the Americans. You need to be able to influence American policy in South-East Asia. Bagging the Americans would probably somewhat reduce your influence in South-East Asia. I suspect that you would find that, should you win the election. As far as East Timor goes, I thank the honourable member for asking this question. There will be an election in East Timor on 30 June. IfI were the honourable member, I would watch the election process and not get into the game of reacting to every proposal that has been put forward by politicians in the context of an election in East Timor-though that might not necessarily be so true of Australia. Anyway, surely none of us would comment on that. In the case of East Timor, the parliamentary elections-which, in a way, are the most important elections-are on 30 June. The leaders of the different political parties are putting forward various proposals, some of which are, frankly, ambit claims. For example, the proposal that East Timor would build up a defence force of 3,000 and have naval vessels with missiles on them is not part of the planning that is being done at the moment for the next three-year evolution of the East Timor defence force. This is a debate which needs to be understood in the context of the circumstances of East Timor at the moment. East Timor simply will not have, at any time in the immediate future, the resources to deal with that. I would recommend that the honourable member have a good look at some of the activities of the governments of the Solomon Islands and Fiji. I would not want, if I were the honourable member, to put myself in the position where I was somehow a bit of an apologist for Manasseh Sogavare and Commodore Bainimarama. I am happy for the Labor Party to put itself MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Appropriation Bill No 1 2007 2008
264,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (11.06 am)-I thank the honourablein that position if it wants to, but it seems to me that that is not smart. To know all is to understand all. To know what these people have been doing, to know what their ambitions are, is to understand why the Australian government holds very strong views about them. It is fair enough, I suppose, for an opposition-I think I may have done some of the same things in opposition in the past, to be quite honest about this-to suggest that, ‘Gee, if we were the government, we would have better relations with Sogavare because we would be able to handle it so well. We wouldn’t have published an open letter in the newspaper.’ You would just do what he wanted you to do, would you? Is that the policy? If the opposition were the government and they did what Mr Sogavare wanted them to do then I do not think that would be in Australia’s interests. You do learn in public life sometimes that you should stand up for what you think is right, and sometimes that involves a bit of an argument with someone. Just because you are having an argument with someone does not mean that that is a bad thing. Sometimes that is a good thing. RAMSI still exists. RAMSI still has integrity. RAMSI is still in place, and it would not be if we had not taken a strong stand in the way we have done. Sure, that has involved some arguments with the Solomon Islands. The opposition thinks that it is wrong to argue with them. The right policy, therefore, must be to go along with what they want. I reckon that is wrong. We have a bad relationship with the Fiji government because it is an illegal dictatorship, in effect-a military dictatorship. We did our best, as did New Zealand, the United States, the UK and the European Union, to try to persuade Commodore Bainimarama not to mount a coup. So did plenty of people. I think we should keep the pressure up on Commodore Bainimarama. If the opposition policy is to do anything else-which I suspect it probably isn’t-I think it would be the wrong policy. Of course we participate in multilateral institutions. We are a member of the United Nations. I enjoy my five-day visit to the General Assembly every year. We have a very active engagement with the United Nations and other multilateral institutions. But we are basically focused on outcomes, not on process. Process is fine and process is part of life, but if diplomacy were just about process and all we wanted to do was have a kind of merry little relationship in multilateral institutions with New Zealand and Canada-which is apparently the opposition’s policy-I do not think we would get terribly good outcomes. We are getting good outcomes in counterterrorism in Indonesia not because we are having a great gabfest in the United Nations or because we have some fantastic liberal multilateralist initiative. We are actually having success with the Indonesians and the Filipinos in the area of counterterrorism because we work bilaterally with them. We are focused on outcomes. I do not have time to go through all the list, but there is a long list of various things that Australia has done in response to avian flu. I hosted a meeting of APEC health ministers in Brisbane to develop an APEC program for addressing avian flu. If the honourable member cares to go back and have a look at the conclusions of, I think, the 2005 APEC summit, he will see that APEC put together what I thought was a very effective response to the issue of avian flu. A tremendous amount of work is being done on avian flu. We, of course, are spending an enormous amount of money helping countries in the region. I have seen a few press releases and speeches on this from the honourable member. I would say that, whilst he is right MAIN COMMITTEE to draw attention to the issue of avian flu, and Australia should be doing everything it can to try to at least contribute to addressing that issue in the region, that work is all being done. Finally, I will address the issue of the tsunami. A lot of Australians put their own money into aid going to people in Indonesia and the victims of the tsunami. Off the top of my head, I think it was about $350 million of community money, quite apart from the more than $1 billion the Australian government put in. I set up a working group with the major NGOs to monitor how that money is being spent. We had six-monthly press conferences and meetings and we published reports on how that money was being spent and distributed and what the challenges and benefits are. I do not have time to talk about it any further, but I commend to the honourable member those reports and other material produced by AusAID on the success of the AusAID programs in response to the tsunami. I think it has worked pretty well. I do not think it is true that our response was in any way uncoordinated or ineffective. It was incredibly well coordinated, including coordination with the United States, Japan and the United Nations. There were phone hook-ups from time to time with Colin Powell, the then Japanese foreign minister, the head of OCHA and the United Nations to make sure that we were coordinated. (Time expired) will not rebut any of the points the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised; they are for subsequent argument. I think I may have used the word ‘rort’ as opposed to ‘fraud’ in the context of describing the the oil for food issue. I was not accusing any member of the department of fraud, and the Hansard should reflect that. tion before I make my major contribution. It relates to the question of the announcement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of $32.5 million for adaptation to climate change and, within that $32.5 million, the $7.5 million contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund of Global Environment Facility. CanI just get clear, before we talk about the merits of broader questions to do with climate change, whether that is in fact a one-off contribution or whether the $32.5 million is the beginning of a series of annual commitments of that amount? It is not clear on the face of it. Is the $32.5 million a one-off? The forward estimates do not reflect, as far as I can see, any expenditure in the out years. I wonder if the minister can just confirm that first. an ongoing program in the budget of commitment to assist developing countries in relation to the issue of climate change. I answered a question in the House about three or four weeks ago on this issue, and I commend that answer to the honourable member. This is the figure for this year, but I made clear in that answer that we have been involved for a long time, and will continue to be involved, in activities in relation to climate change in assisting countries in the region to adapt to climate change. I just use as one example-because it does not get too much publicity-the very long standing sea level monitoring stations that we have. Off the top of my head, I think there are about a dozen of them around the Pacific. So we can monitor any changes in sea level and obviously assist those countries if the situation begins to deteriorate to the point that it causes concern. We assist developing countries.

267,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (11.18 am)-We of course will havesearch into ensuring that crops in particular, but agriculture more generally, can be adapted to changing climatic conditions. I suspect that not only will we have for many years into the future a continuation of these programs to address the issue of climate change and adaptation to climate change but also-if some of the more serious predictions about climate change turn out to be right-we will probably have to do more than we are planning to do at the moment. minister to give a detailed specific response to that question at short notice, but I will proceed on the very generalised response that he has given me and pursue the matter subsequently. The government has announced with some fanfare some propositions with regard to climate change. Let us disaggregate the figures and look at them in the context of the aid budgetleaving aside the context including funding outside AusAID, most but not all of which will count in the aid budget with regard to the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, the adaptation to climate change and, within that, the contribution to Least Developed Countries Fund of the GEF. Certainly, I agree with that last $7.5 million contribution. It is not that I think we should not be making it. To the contrary, I think that is the sort of area to which we should be making a more substantial contribution. Peeling away the fanfare, I ask the minister to confirm the simple arithmetic. Over the forward estimates period the commitments with regard to the aid budget, both that from AusAID and that from associated departments on the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, come to between one and 1.3 per cent of the aid budget. It seems to me that there is no question that, for many of the countries in our region, the capacity to develop a sustainable response to poverty alleviation depends upon a capacity to respond to climate change. I am a big fan of This is a very tiny contribution, and in fact the funding in the budget on adaptation to climate change-the separate fund apart from the deforestation-comes to 1.02 per cent of the aid budget. My point is that we have rhetorically had statements of commitment that have been dressed up as very substantial amounts. But within the aid budget it is a totally inadequate response to the character of the challenge. I welcome the fact that the government has made a commitment to increase the aid budget; I said that and I do not retract that support. We all know that what has really happened is that, having made substantial cuts to the aid budget in terms of percentage gross national income, the increase simply gets us almost back to where we started from-but not quite. But at least it is better than not having that increase. I ask the minister whether he can confirm that the percentage of the aid budget for deforestation and the percentage of the aid budget going to the initiative on the adaptation to climate change, even assuming that it is annual-which the figures do not show-rather than one off, is in the order of, in each case, about one per cent of the aid budget. How can we see, going forward, this tiny proportion of the aid budget going to these climate change initiatives, irrespective of debate about their merits-and a lot of people have questions about some parts of that; I certainly support at least the part going to the Least Developed Countries Fund. I think that is an appropriate place to be spending the money. How can you say this is an adequate response to the challenge of climate change for our neighbours?

268,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (11.20 Am),"I understand it would have been difficult for theso everybody understands this, that the budget includes $164 million, which is over five years, for the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate-and I think that is a very important initiative. I would not necessarily measure the efficacy of these programs by the amount of money you put into them but by what the money buys and what it does. The $32.5 million is in 2007-08, as I explained earlier, and that is for partnerships with international organisations on climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives. AndI announced on World Environment Day, which was 5 June, a $7½ million contribution, which the honourable member for Fraser referred to, to the Least Developed Countries Fund and other smaller initiatives. I am not sure what the percentage of the total aid budget is, but I am not quite sure what the member’s point is. If the point is that we should cut funding for poverty alleviation and proportionately put more funding into some sort of unspecified climate change initiative, I would not do that. I would not do it. What we need to understand-in fact, I feel pretty passionately about this-is that we are a global community. Politicians need to be a little bit better than one-trick ponies. I know the focus groups and Hawker Britton and so on tell you to talk about climate change the whole time, and I know you did a little deal with AID/WATCH the other day-apparently you were opposed to debt relief for Iraq, or you were in favour of it but not in favour of it, and debt relief is not really aid. are of course enormously used toand he was on the radio first thing in the morning as if it was something he had just read in the paper and stumbled across. I think not, mon ami; I think not. I have been a member of parliament for over 20 years. I think I know what MPs get up to. My point is this: we need to address the issue of poverty alleviation and the issue of climate change, not just one of them-and addressing poverty alleviation can sometimes lead to increases in CO2 emissions. For example, poverty alleviation in China has been achieved but it has certainly led to a massive increase in CO2 emissions. But I am proud of the role Australia has played over many years in assisting with poverty alleviation, even though I accept that in many instances that has led to increases in CO2 emissions. At the same time we now have to try to get CO2 emissions down. That is an important challenge. We have got to do both things. So, if we were to set ourselves some sort of target to increase the aid budget from whatever the percentage is today-I simply have not calculated it, because we run programs that we think will be effective; we do not do it on the basis of the percentage. Setting targets is a great favourite of the political Left. Remember Stalin-he set targets, didn’t he, for steel production and things like that? Targets are a great favourite of the Left. To set ourselves a target for a certain percentage of-the honourable member is leaving. I will not bother answering his question.

So, if we are talking about bad manners, let us get that on the record. I have two aspects of trade that I want to go to: one deals with the free trade agreement negotiations with China and with the US, the other to exports and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. I will ask the questions about the free trade agreements first and get to the second group of questions if we can in the time available. I refer the minister to evidence given in Senate estimates recently by the government’s lead negotiator for the Australia-China free trade agreement, Mr Ric Wells, first assistant secretary of your department, Minister. He conceded that negotiations with China are going nowhere because ‘the Chinese government does not want the FTA’. He also revealed that China has no interest in having a comprehensive free trade agreement and would prefer to exclude chapters on education, telecommunications and financial services. Mr Wells went on to say: The Chinese also have reservations on including a chapter on competition policy. They have reservations on including the sort of chapter that we want on investment. They have reservations on including a chapter on electronic commerce. They have reservations on including a chapter on government procurement. It is quite a long list … Minister, do you share the view that China does not want an FTA? If so, why has the budget allocated a further $12.7 million to this set of negotiations? Is the government going to insist on the chapters the Chinese want excluded being included? Does the government now accept that conceding market economy status to China without getting anything in return was a flawed strategy? In the interests of transparency, has the government undertaken and made public any hard, comprehensive study which shows what Australia will actually gain from an outcome in the free trade agreement? My final point on free trade agreements goes to the US free trade agreement. Can the minister confirm when the mid-term review on the free trade agreement with the US, which should be taking place around now, is to take place? What items will the Australian government be pursuing in that review? tions will have to be referred to the Minister for Trade, and any detailed questions on the Export Market Development Grants Scheme should certainly be put on notice for the trade minister. Let me just make a point about the FTA negotiations with China. I was in China a couple of months ago, and while I was there I spent some time talking about the FTA negotiations with China. There is no doubt that these are difficult negotiations. There is just no question of that. They are difficult negotiations. The reason these negotiations are difficult is partly that within China there is a lot of sensitivity about agriculture. Why? Because there is a lot of poverty, particularly in western China, and there is a growing wealth divergence between the urban parts of China-particularly in the coastal fringes of China, where there are high rates of economic growth and very substantial increases in income-and the rural parts of China.

281,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (11.32 am)-Some of these quesgovernment is very concerned about that. That means that the issue of agriculture is inevitably going to be a very sensitive issue. Equally, given China’s history-you find this, by the way, with most developing countries-they are quite sensitive about the services sector. Of course, the very big gains that Australia could get from an FTA with China would not just be in agriculture; they would be in services. So that is difficult. There is no question of that. Equally there are sensitivities here in Australia, in the textiles, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. We have always said-and I think this is the point that Mr Wells was trying to make-that these negotiations are inevitably going to be very difficult. They will have their ups and down. We offer no guarantee that these negotiations will be successful. The Prime Minister has said that, I have said that and the trade minister has said that on many occasions. But they could be successful. We could achieve an outcome in these negotiations which would be very beneficial to Australia. I think the wise thing for this country to do is to try its best to get a good outcome. I think it would be unwise just to tank the whole negotiations, to abandon the whole negotiations, on the grounds that they were difficult. That is not my approach to life. Just because something is difficult, I do not abandon it if I think it is potentially very beneficial. IfI could say this to the honourable member: I think that is the perspective he needs to look at this FTA through. It is difficult; there is no doubt about that. It is very difficult, but worth trying. We have a chance of achieving a successful outcome, so we should stick at it. These are going to be protracted and difficult negotiations. I am not sure of the exact timing of the mid-term review-that could easily be established-but the point is that the FTA with the United States has worked well so far. As the chamber knows, the government is much in favour of it. I think, particularly over the years, you will see very great benefits flow from the integration of the Australian and American economies, particularly bearing in mind the dynamic nature of the American economy in areas such as R&D and technological development and innovation. It is a most impressive component of the American economy. There were obviously aspects of the agreement which we would have hoped would have been better. We said so at the time, in particular in relation to sugar. We will always have a look at and talk with the Americans about ways we could improve the agreement over the years ahead through mid-term reviews and other processes. But I think it has got off to a good start. We are pleased, in general terms, with the way it is working, and there are at least no high-profile problems with the FTA that have necessitated my direct involvement with my counterparts in America. to be taken on notice, but I ask the minister to confirm that since 1995-96, when the government came to office, the real value of the EMDG has been halved. I ask the minister to confirm that, earlier this year, Austrade advised him that, if funds for the EMDG were not increased, funds to be received by eligible businesses would have to be rationed and that the first tranche guarantee limit of $70,000, for example, would have to be reduced to $50,000. That was the advice we understand the minister got from Austrade. We understand that, in turn, he wrote to the Prime Minister before the budget seeking additional funds for Austrade. WhatI would like to know is why the Prime Minister refused to support Australian exporters MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Aciar I Welcome The Fact That It Is Looking At Some Of These Issues But Let Us Be Realistic
282,Mr Crean (Hotham) (11.36 Am),"Some of the second grouping of questions might needwith additional assistance. I say that against the background of the government’s target set back in October 2001 when the then trade minister, Mark Vaile, announced, ‘The government will aim to double the number of exporting Australian companies by the year 2006.’ He further stated that 28,000 Australian companies exported in the year that he made the commitment. The facts are that, far from doubling the number of exporters from 28,000 to 56,000 in the time frame now past, there has only been an increase to 42,000 in the number of exporters. In other words, the target is only halfMr Downer interjectinglongest resource boom in Australia’s history and some 14 years of economic prosperity? The government has failed dismally in terms of the exporters of this nation. One of the points I am trying to make is that part of the reason we are not doubling but only meeting half of the target is that we are halving the funds going to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Exporting is about a partnership, and this government does not understand or accept its obligation in relation to that partnership. I ask the minister: why has the government failed so dismally in meeting its target? In the recent Budget Paper No. 2, page 287 shows that the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources is getting $122 million over five years to facilitate Australian SMEs to participate in global supply trains. Why was Austrade, with all of its expertise, excluded from this program? Why has the government not sought to re-establish a business input into the activities of Austrade, having abolished the industry board that used to advise Austrade? I talked before about partnerships-partnerships with government and with business. If we are to support our exporters, they need resources and input. They need to give direction to the way the department and the agency, which are there to service them, oversee functions. I am disappointed again that the minister responsible is not here to directly answer these questions but I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take them on notice and ensure that we are supplied with the appropriate answers. notice; I will answer them. I understand that our exports have reached a record level. We have never exported more than we export today. The proposition of the Labor Party is that there should be a massive increase in government spending on exporting, apparently. At the end of the day we believe in the private sector economy. I suppose this is what has historically differentiated the Labor Party from the Liberal Party and the National Party. This is a blinding revelation to some people, but we are not socialists. We actually do not believe in the government conducting all of these activities. We do provide assistance. We had to cut the EMDG, I seem to remember, in 1996, when we were left with an $11 billion budget deficit. The Labor Party had scheme after scheme-the government will do this; the government will do that. The government will set your alarm in the morning and make you a cup of tea, the government will drive you to work and the government will export your goods and services-the government, the government, the government.

284,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (11.41 am)-I will not take them oninto socialism than it is today, but over the years the Labor Party has realised that just about everything it ever stood for was wrong. Imagine spending your whole life arguing for something and then admitting you were completely wrong. This is the Labor Party at its worse: why isn’t the government spending more money here and more money there? We know what the Labor Party’s point is: like the state governments, if Labor became the Commonwealth government it would blow out the budget and go into massive debt. The ordinary people of Australia would pay the price, through higher interest rates and a weaker economy. We know that. The Labor Party wants to spend more on this and more on that. That is all we have heard from it today. I will not take the questions on notice because they are the usual sort of rant about how we should be spending more government money-and not pursuing responsible budget policies. Yet we have the highest level of exports we have ever had in the country’s history. I think that statistic answers the question very fully. Proposed expenditure agreed to. that the order agreed to by the Main Committee for the consideration of proposed expenditures be varied by the Main Committee so that it next considers the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio and then the Defence, portfolio, the Veterans Affairs’ portfolio, the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio, the Attorney-General’s portfolio, and the Finance and Administration portfolio. There being no objection, that course will be followed. Department of the Treasury Proposed expenditure, $3,688,304,000. haps answer for us, is on an issue that came up in a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing in The blame game report that was produced earlier. It is about the lack of PBI status, or public benevolent institution status, of certain institutions. Recently, submissions were made to the health and ageing committee’s inquiry into health funding. One of the issues that came up when we visited the IMVS in South Australia was that they had lost PBI status. People were working, perhaps side by side, in the same institution-medical staff and all sorts of people in diagnostic laboratories, pathology, and in-patient and outpatient clinical services-and were treated differently by the ATO. Consequently, the IMVS was unable to offer some staff the same salaries that other staff were getting in institutions that still get the PBI status. They were finding it hard to recruit and retain staff in such an important area, especially in regional areas, where we have huge shortages. There was a recommendation in The blame game report, which I am sure would have been brought to the attention of the minister at some stage, that the Australian government amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. It also affects aged-care facilities that are operated by local governments. The recommendation reads: local governments operating aged care facilities are able to qualify for fringe benefits tax exemptions granted to public benevolent institutions for employees involved in the aged care facility; and fringe benefits exemptions applying to public employers delivering health services in hospitalbased settings also apply to public employers providing health services in other settings.

I appreciate the detail of his question, but I will have to take it on notice. I would be happy to do that and come back to the member for Hindmarsh. government and nursing homes. Because nursing homes are not benevolent societies and are run by local governments, they are affected by this ruling in a big way. In my electorate of Hindmarsh, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get nursing home beds in the western suburbs, but to be losing staff as well makes it even harder for us to recruit and to get the nursing home beds that are required in the area. With a bit of incentive, as was recommended by The blame game: report on the inquiry into health funding, we might be able to retain staff by offering better facilities in one of the oldest electorates in the country. This would ensure that we had enough aged-care beds for those people who need them. Currently, because land is fairly expensive in the inner western suburbs, new nursing home beds are being provided in outer suburbs. This is making it very difficult for people to stay in their community with their loved ones and others whom they want to remain close to. If staff in these nursing homes are not getting the same tax breaks as other employees in the health industry, they will be attracted by ‘sweeteners’ or packages to leave these institutions to work in other areas. This will cause a loss of employees in the sector. There is a shortage of nursing home employees. This sector has one of the highest turnover rates of staff. We want to maintain those staff and the good facilities offered by the nursing homes that are run by local governments in my electorate and all around Australia. One of the recommendations of the report into health funding was that the government take this issue into consideration. Recently in parliament we tabled a petition with over 1,000 signatures which called for that recommendation to be taken into account by the government. Perhaps the minister could look at this area and let us know where we are heading with it so that we can at least maintain some of the staff who are already working in these nursing homes and also maintain some of these good institutions and their facilities. These institutions do a lot of good work, not only in my electorate in South Australia but all over Australia.

291,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (11.53 Am),"I would like to raise the matter of withholding tax,was heard from significant players in the financial services industry that the rate of gearing for investments in managed funds in Australia is very high. Under thin capitalisation rules, the rate can be as high as 75 per cent. Evidence was also heard from the Department of the Treasury that it assumes a gearing rate of zero per cent in relation to these investments. This obviously has a big impact on the costing of any policy proposal. My question is: will the parliamentary secretary ensure that the Department of the Treasury sits down with key representatives of the industry represented by various peak groups, including IFSA and others, and obviously some of the big players in the industry such as AMP, Barclays et cetera-but particularly with the peak groups-and discuss those costings? Considerable evidence has been put to the government that the gearing rate is actually very high. Treasury say, ‘We do not get tax returns.’ Considerable evidence has been put in response that investors are using an Australian subsidiary company to avoid their withholding tax and are paying Australian company tax instead and with gearing rates bringing that down. Therefore, if the withholding tax were reduced from 30 per cent to 15 per cent and gearing were abolished, those companies would no longer have the requirement to do that and would be paying withholding tax, and the Treasury’s costings would be substantially different and, under some analyses, it would actually result in an increase in government revenue. I ask the parliamentary secretary to respond on behalf of the government to ensure that what is a very worthwhile policy initiative is not rejected by the government on the basis of poor assumptions and incorrect methodology. member for Prospect for his question. I am not sure what he is getting at. As he knows only too well, since we assumed government in 1996, we have gone out of our way to consult with industry stakeholders, unlike our predecessors. The Department of the Treasury is always consulting with industry stakeholders on a whole range of ideas, suggestions and proposals. In terms of asking whether the Department of the Treasury is prepared is to consult industry stakeholders, it is business as usual. They do that each and every day. In terms of the comment he made about a very worthwhile policy, you would expect that from him, wouldn’t you? But that is for others to judge, isn’t it? from the parliamentary secretary, can I confirm that he is not willing to ensure that the Treasury takes new evidence on the costings of this policy and that the Treasury and this government will take into account the substantial sworn evidence that was given to a Senate committee of this parliament-that the government is going to completely reject that evidence and not consider that evidence in relation to a policy change? encourage the member for Prospect not to verbal me today. I understand that he enjoys being negative, but I am a positive person. As I said before, the Department of the Treasury consults more than any other government department, I am sure. That is why I am glad to be in this portfolio. They do a marvellous job of consulting with stakeholders and they will continue to do that.

Will they consult further with those experts on this very important policy to make Australia the financial services hub of Asia? indicated, the answer is that the Treasury will consult with industry stakeholders. and I am sure they look forward to their meeting with Treasury officials. This raises a very important matter. This government has adopted a policy of giving Australia an uncompetitive tax regime. This government has adopted the policy, despite the fact that the tax regimes of the United States, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Ireland and most other countries have a withholding tax rate equal to or less than 15 per cent-and they are flat and final withholding tax rates-and says it is acceptable to have a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent. Australia has the 53rd highest population in the world, yet we have the fourth highest level of funds under management thanks to the superannuation reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, which the Liberal Party opposed. We have the fourth highest level of funds under management and yet other countries are overtaking us when it comes to encouraging overseas investment in Australia. In Ireland, where the government has taken the approach of encouraging financial services investment and financial services exports from Ireland, they will soon overtake us in terms of funds under management and investment into this country from overseas nations. That is going to happen because we are being left behind with our tax regime, which is uncompetitive, and because this government, this Treasurer, refuse to adopt the policy or at least to talk to industry about the policy of reducing Australia’s withholding tax rate. I heard the Senate debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 the other day. I heard a particularly vacuous presentation from Senator Ronaldson, who chaired the hearings of the Senate economics committee into this bill and-I will not say he misunderstood the arguments, because I think he understood them very well-clearly gave a completely different version of those arguments to the Senate. That shows the lack of foresight of this government in relation to the financial services industry and funds under management in this country. I call on the parliamentary secretary and the government generally to review this policy and give the Australian funds industry a chance and to get out of their way and give Australia a competitive tax regime-not to pick winners-which gives them an even chance in competing with their competitors overseas. comment I would like to make is that we really do not need anybody from the Australian Labor Party to tell us how to manage tax in this country. I think the difficulty that the member for Prospect-from his remarks just now-has been listening to Sharan Burrow much too much.

The member for Prospect talked about the Hawke-Keating government and tax. I remember the Keating government in relation to tax, as you would, Mr Deputy Speaker Secker.

He might want to check whether he has the authority personally, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, to give the direction himself.

He may not choose to take that opportunity, but I ask him to confirm whether he, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, has that capacity. In 2005 the Chairman of the ACCC, the watchdog of motorists and consumers, said there was something funny going on with petrol prices. Two years later, in January this year, he was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph saying that oil companies were not passing on reductions in petrol prices from overseas and he was very concerned. He said the same thing last authority that he has-but under this government’s changes to the Trade Practices Act he cannot formally monitor petrol prices, which means getting behind petrol prices, seeking documents, talking to witnesses, ensuring that there is no price gouging and ensuring there is no collusion, unless he has a formal written directive from the government to do that. I am asking the parliamentary secretary to confirm to the House that he, as an individual, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, has that personal authority. cated to the member for Prospect, the Treasurer, as the portfolio minister, has the ability under the Trade Practices Act, and naturally anybody else that is a sworn federal executive councillor in the portfolio under the delegation of the Treasurer would be able to do that. to the Treasurer. Given that the Treasurer has the powers to direct or request the ACCC to investigate fuel prices, can you tell me how many times the Treasurer has actually exercised that power in the past 11 years?

It is already happening. I am not sure what the Australian Labor Party is on about. The ACCC undertake informal price monitoring. It is used to provide information to consumers.

It is already happening. toring. Let us be clear. The parliamentary secretary is taking the opportunity to use a terminological inexactitude which he very well knows is misleading the House. The ACCC does an internet search of petrol pricing. The ACCC puts petrol prices on its website. It does a good job at that. The Australian people do not need a website to tell them that petrol is expensive. What they need is the ACCC to have the power to get documents to examine petrol pricing and to have the power to formally subpoena people to provide evidence on petrol pricing under section 95ZE of the Trade Practices Act. The parliamentary secretary has confirmed that he has the personal authority to do it; can he confirm that he declines to write to the Chairman of the ACCC under section 95ZE of the Trade Practices Act? Chairman of the ACCC and direct him to formally monitor petrol prices, as provided for under section 95ZE of the Trade Practices Act? And, no, it does not happen at the moment; at the moment there is no formal petrol price monitoring. not I write to the ACCC is a decision I will make. I will not make it based on an invitation from the member for Prospect, with the greatest respect. But, as I have already indicated, the ACCC does monitor petrol prices throughout Australia. I also remind the member for Prospect that, as he knows only too well, there are other provisions in the Trade Practices Act where the ACCC can actually oblige people to provide information. So, far from me misleading the House, I suggest that the member for Prospect was being a little too cute in some of the comments that he made earlier. able talking about petrol prices, so I will move on to a broader matter.

321,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.14 Pm),"I have a series of questions I would like to ask the minter for Defence) (12.15 pm)-I thank the member for Oxley for his interest in this subject. I am sure he will assist me if I have overlooked any elements of his question. I am aware of the meeting last Thursday. In fact, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs hosted, arranged and funded the participation of people in that meeting. That has been our process each year because we are very supportive of ProgramASIST. In fact, the Howard government is the government that provided the resources and the commitment to actually see ProgramASIST established. It is a program that we think is important. It helps to build knowledge of suicidal behaviour and build the confidence in people who might come in contact with a member from the veterans community at risk of self-harm. It looks at a number of mental health issues. It encourages people who feel that someone is at risk of self-harm to contact proper mental health professionals and the comprehensive program of support that is offered by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs for mental health and self-harm concerns. For the member for Oxley’s information, I am aware that the opposition has made some claim about putting some funding into ProgramASIST. It was an interesting announcement that, I think, was made at the Queensland congress of the RSL. It implied that, even though the call for funding was, I think, $1.6 million over four years, the opposition indicated a willingness to contribute $1 million over four years and implied that the department would need to find the rest from its own resources. That is rather odd because I think earlier in the day there were accusations that the department was cutting back its resources and that there was not enough to do its work. Yet, here, the Labor Party was insisting that some magical $600,000 of help could be found. One thing that needs to be recognised is that the department has an open-ended willingness to support participation in ProgramASIST. What happens is that the department funds the training scheme. I cannot remember the name of the provider, but the provider of the program does a terrific job. Where there is a veteran member willing to participate in that program, we fund the program participation fees, which are about $200 per attendee. We have developed and distributed a package of ProgramASIST promotional material, and we partner with the veterans community to make sure any willing member of the veterans community keen to participate in this program is able to do so. That is an open-ended, ongoing, multiple-year commitment that the government has made, and that stands. What we have also supported is the work of the coordinating committees with two meetings each year as well as face-to-face meetings and teleconferencing, and ongoing financial and administrative support for the national coordinator. We are very supportive of the program. What also needs to be recognised is that in 2006-07 there were 56 veterans who participated in this program and we funded their participation. In fact, over the years tens of thousands of dollars have gone towards that. The opposition seems to think there will be thousands and thousands of veterans participating in this program, and that is the assumption on which their funding commitment is made. As if the only constructive thing that the community can do to support veterans at risk is to fund participation in the program when clearly there is not that level of interest. There were 56 participants in the last financial year. We have made an open-ended commitment. If there were 556 participants we would finance that contribution.

322,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the MinisBut to suggest that it can be fixed by throwing more money at the program-recognising that we have been supportive of it since 2001, that there is not the take-up that we anticipated and that it has the support of all the major veterans organisations who also promote it, yet there is still not the take-up of the program-I think highlights just how unwise it was of the Labor Party to simply stick its sticker onto an email, which I also received from the promoters of this program, and claim it as policy. They did not do the hard work and recognise that selfharm and the mental health and wellness of our veterans community requires a comprehensive strategy, one the department is continually putting in place and improving. We are working on Operation Life, which is also a comprehensive program that recognises that we need to promote resilience, mental health and well-being across the broader veterans community. We need to look at what those protective factors are that reduce risks. We need to involve families and those supportive in addressing self-harm, deliver support through the veterans and veterans’ families counselling service, develop the know-how within the veterans community and continue research. That is the comprehensive strategy that the veterans community is looking for and that is what we are delivering. digenous veterans’ graves. I have been approached by a Mr John Schnaars from Western Australia as to the provision of greater support in terms of Aboriginal servicemen and Indigenous members of the defence forces where their graves can be identified. He expressed some frustration at the ability to gain further funds for this worthwhile cause. I ask the minister: what funds are currently available and are there any proposals for the future? ter for Defence) (12.21 pm)-Thank you to the member for Canning for his question. The area of Indigenous veterans is a significant priority for the department, for the government and particularly for me. There are estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 Indigenous veterans who have served our nation with great honour. Those veterans and their dependants are an important part of the veterans community. But what we know is that we are only engaged with about one in 10 of that group. What we have, and this has been in place since 1999, is a communications strategy to reach out to the Indigenous veterans community, to emphasise that the benefits and support including the proper commemoration of graves is an entitlement to which they are eligible, as are non-Indigenous veterans, and to make sure that we have systems in place to reach out and engage the Indigenous community. I have put on a staff member, a veterans policy officer called Rob Nobel, who is an Indigenous person himself with experience in the military area. Right across the country, we have Indigenous contact points and awareness raising as part of our work. I would be more than happy to pursue that matter further with you and put the individual that you have spoken to in touch with Mr Nobel and our team, who are very focused on the needs of our veterans community, particularly those Indigenous members of the veterans community who are not fully engaged with the benefits that are available. I know the member for Canning, representing the great state of Western Australia, would also understand that even for remote communities that have a member of the veterans community within them, my department funds that person’s health needs directly. These are additional resources on top of what may be already available in the community through the Indigenous health or community health programs.

The benefits are as they are for non-Indigenous veterans, but what we do recognise is that there needs to be a different method of engagement and outreach to contact them, and to develop trust and good working relationships as part of our effort. I would be more than happy to get the name of the individual you have mentioned and make sure he is part of that work. ous question, seemed to mix his metaphors and confuse his concern-perhaps he could at least acknowledge this. Labor are going to bring the assistance program formally under the control of the veterans and the veterans’ families counselling service, the VVCS, and we will also provide new and additional funding of $1 million over the four years. There would be other costs that would be absorbed. The proposal that we put forward keeps the control of the service with the ex-service community while relieving them of the responsibility of resourcing it. That was the point I was trying to make. I think the minister agrees and we can perhaps move on. Could the minister answer as to whether he would join with Labor and index the whole of the special rate, the TPI and TTI, the immediate rate and extreme disablement pensions, to movements in the MTAWE-male total average weekly earnings-or CPI, whichever is the greater? If not, why not? Can the minister also explain the comments he made in the House on 23 May when, in relation to our policy, he said: … what is understood by thinking members of the broader veterans community is that the policy he is bringing forward is discriminatory, it is unprincipled and it vandalises and undermines some of the key principles and key foundations that allow governments-successive governments-to implement a proveteran beneficial system that is characterised as being responsive, sound and principled against the veterans’ experience. Will he join with Labor on the indexation-the whole of the special rate issue that I raisedand explain what he actually meant by those comments? ter for Defence) (12.25 pm)-I thank the member for Oxley for his second question. I am more than happy to talk about this subject. My point is, no, I will not join the Labor Party in their cobbled together, hastily put together, media stunt on the eve of the budget. I made those points quite clearly. What we have seen right throughout my time as minister, and ministers beforehand, is that the Labor Party do not come forward with the hard work. They do not put in the effort to get policy proposals right. As was just mentioned regarding the ASIST program, a simple Labor sticker has been stuck on top of a memo that I also received via email. I have emphasised-and perhaps the member for Oxley overlooked the point-that our support for the ASIST program is part of a comprehensive strategy. There is no single solution to self-harm. Veterans, serving men and women of the Defence Force and the broader veterans community all live full lives. There are other influences on their wellness and emotional well-being, and that is why a comprehensive strategy is required, not simply putting more money into a program that is currently unconstrained by the budget that supports it-that is, more people want to participate. We have more resources to accommodate that. The simple reality is that in the last financial year there were 56 people.

326,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minising the program, it would be simply naive, superficial and lazy to suggest that that is all that is needed to tackle the mental health issues of the veterans community. I go to the second question that was asked of me. In terms of the indexation of payments that are made to the veterans community, the indexation principles are very sound. They are entirely defensible. They recognise the special place of our veterans community and take account of the basis upon which the payment is made. The cobbled together, hastily put together, announcement that Labor made was the same announcement that the shadow minister, at the Queensland RSL congress, fessed up about when he said that smarter minds than his had put this idea together. It emphasised his lack of understanding about the program. He was quite open about his own confusion. Labor are actually proposing a method of indexation that is not used for any other payment within the Commonwealth. He and the Labor Party have confused the methods that are used for service pensions, where payments are adjusted against either a benchmark of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or movements in CPI. What that says is that if the CPI movements over time do not maintain that 25 per cent benchmark then the adjustment is made back to the benchmark. The Labor Party, not understanding this, have said they will have an indexation method-a cobbled together, either/or, whichever is greater, method-that does not exist anywhere in the Commonwealth system. It again emphasises the lack of work that the Labor Party constantly display in just badging someone else’s idea, and then, when it is highlighted to be unprincipled, unsustainable and unsubstantiated, they say, ‘Brighter minds than mine came up with this idea.’ I am highlighting-and the member for Oxley may be very interested to know this-that 100,000 veterans receive injury compensation payments and, in fact, may have exactly the same condition as the people that the announcement of the Labor Party was focusing on, and they will potentially have exactly the same condition indexed differently for no other reason than it is a political stunt of the Labor Party. What you saw in the budget is real money payable now, not some promise on the never-never, not some idea that the Labor Party have brought forward, where they will come up with some entirely new method of indexation and think about implementing it in late 2008 that may produce a benefit in 2012. You see local members of parliament running around saying, ‘Labor promises to increase benefits.’ That is not accurate. It is unprincipled. It does not reflect the quality of the work that the coalition puts in place and it also does not address the simple fact that, when you are putting in place a repatriation system that recognises the special status and the particular needs of our veterans community, you do not junk those principles. The last time. I stood in this place the member for Banks said, ‘Why are veterans different from pensioners?’ They are very different from pensioners. We need to understand why that is the case and not junk the principles that have seen our system develop and evolve over many years and many governments. That is why I made those remarks. If the member for Oxley and particularly the shadow minister who has fessed up to his ignorance about them wants to have this explained to them again, I am more than happy to do that, because their vandalism of the veterans’ affairs system will stand as one of the great negative contributions Labor has made to veterans’ affairs. At least up until recently they just did not care; now they just do not bother doing the work and they are indifferent to the consequences of that recklessness. MAIN COMMITTEE than the minister. But, in the context of that, could he briefly explain which other indexation system that is used now and which other payment by the Commonwealth is indexed in the same way that they currently do special rate pensions-not the formula; the split rate, the whole system. ter for Defence) (12.31 pm)-Again the member for Bruce is asking me to explain Labor’s policy. One of the things that is very clear is that, for those people that are receiving special rate benefits, there are two elements to that benefit. One relates to the injury compensationthat is for the pain and suffering of the service related condition for which they have been recognised and they are receiving compensation payments. This is where the people in part of the general rate table of injury compensation receive those payments, and they are indexed against CPI. That is consistent, that is principled, that is the manner that is used in civil awards for injuries of this kind and in other fields where people are being compensated for injury, pain and suffering, such as elements of workers compensation. The special rate pension reflects the fact that, as a result of those injuries, someone has been denied the opportunity to participate in the workforce. That is why there is a very special provision made for those people who, as a result of their service, are injured or impaired or have an illness that denies them the possibility to be engaged in the workforce. What the Howard government has done is recognise that where you see a buoyant labour market with real growth in income-and it is an issue the Labor Party has never had to contend with-it is appropriate to reflect that real growth in income in a payment that reflects the fact that an injured, impaired or ill veteran cannot participate in the workforce and is being compensated for it. So it takes account of that very particular characteristic of the payment. It is sound; it is principled. it is a unique system used only for this particular benefit and not used elsewhere in the Commonwealth? questions and answers. who might have a different view. I was quite amazed and it is still happening now. Interjection, interjection, grievance, grievance, grievance, looking at life through a straw-that is all you can expect from the Labor Party. They are an absolutely appalling disappointment to so many people in the veterans community. What you are seeing today is another example of it-like at the Queensland congress where the opposition gets up and verbals the RSL as if they somehow endorse their proposal. The RSL said nothing of the kind, but never let honesty and integrity get in the way of a claim. When the opposition jump up and say, ‘Oh, we’ve got this indexation sort of slippery, slimy plan that doesn’t actually start until 2008 and might amount to $30 by 2012,’ they then run around saying that there will be a big increase in income. tion and answer the question.

332,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"The minister will come back to the quescipled answer to a question, the opposition wants to rumble it together and run off and make it something it is not. The basis of these indexation methodologies is sound, it is principled and it is understood by the veterans community. But, above all, when we are taking $11 billion from other taxpayers to make special payments and special provisions for those for whom we have a special duty then we need to be clear on why we are taking that money, the basis on which it is being made available and why the veterans community is entirely justified in having these special provisions available for them. I have explained the indexation methodologies. A number of people have explained them to the member for Bruce but, as he said at the Queensland RSL, he is not quite sure what is going on here because wiser minds than his have put forward this proposal. Perhaps he should come to terms with the foundation principles that have seen our system evolve over many generations to be world class and admired by many. Those who are not in the veteran community wish they were, because it is so admired. The benefits that are provided are principled, entirely justified and can be explained soundly and with a measure of integrity to those who are providing the money.

Public Benevolent Institution Status an issue which I raised earlier here today, in the consideration in detail, with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer: the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing and its report The blame game: report on the inquiry into health funding. Submissions to this inquiry are concerned with the problems experienced by certain health service providers and aged-care facilities in attracting and retaining staff as a direct result of being labelled by the ATO as non-public benevolent institutions. The experience of South Australia’s Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science is highly worthy of consideration. The petition from 1,021 citizens, which I presented to this parliament on 21 May this year, directly concerns the issue. It will come as no surprise that by far the majority of petitioners are employees of South Australia’s IMVS. The ATO’s ruling concerning public benevolent institution status, or the lack thereof, gives or denies organisations the ability to offer fringe benefits tax-exempt salary packages.

338,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12.36 Pm),"I would like to make a special mention ofcost of these sweeteners or packages is effectively picked up by the taxpayer. Potential health service employees are offered substantial dissimilar incentives to work for PBI versus nonPBI organisations in order to aid certain service providers, and providers of recruitment of staff. You would ordinarily expect health organisations with delivery centres in regional South Australia, for instance, to be a targeted beneficiary of the public benevolent institution tax regime so as to better attract suitably qualified personnel in sufficient numbers. One such organisation, the IMVS, is actively penalised by the ATO’s ruling on PBI status. I will quote the IMVS directly and give you a sense of their frustration. They said: The IMVS operates laboratories in all major regional centres in South Australia. Attraction and retention of qualified and experienced staff in rural areas is problematic across a number of professions. It is exacerbated in pathology by the fact that a qualified scientist can receive a higher rate of pay for essentially the same level of work by working for another metropolitan employer and this has exacerbated the drain of staff from rural and regional laboratories for the metropolitan area. The impact on staff replacement in regional areas from the loss of its PBI status is that the IMVS has severely damaged its ability to attract staff to rural areas as the hospitals in both rural and metropolitan settings offer a higher salary package for undertaking identical duties and classifications. This has a significant potential to reduce services to those rural services and it has impacted on the ability to provide the services to the Indigenous communities, which the IMVS serves through its northern laboratory network. Another consequence of the current PBI tax regime is the current situation where one health service provider located within a hospital setting and responsible for many of the same functions as hospital units, including diagnostic laboratories, pathology and in-patient and outpatient clinical services, is treated differently by the ATO and whose staff are consequently unable to offer salaries comparable with staff doing identical duties within the same hospital setting. The Royal Adelaide Hospital utilises medical registrars to undertake their training program incorporating treating inpatients, undertaking outpatient clinics and laboratory work. Some of these staff are employed directly by the RAH and some are employed by the IMVS. The Royal Adelaide Hospital enjoys classification as a public benevolent institution while the IMVS does not. So we have health professionals with the same credentials working side by side on the same patients in the same wards but receiving substantially different packages. You can imagine what this does for the recruitment and retention of IMVS staff-hence the petition from approximately 1,000 employees of the IMVS which asked the House to: Amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 so that: local governments operating aged care facilities are able to qualify for fringe benefits tax exemptions granted to public benevolent institutions for employees involved in the aged care facility; and fringe benefits exemptions applying to public employers delivering health services in hospitalbased settings also apply to public employers providing health services in other settings. I ask that this petition be taken into consideration by the parliament and that the objective of both the petition and the recommendation of the report on the inquiry into health funding be made a matter of urgent government business. Queensland: Toll Roads for finding, buried in the Queensland government’s recent budget, the fact that the governMAIN COMMITTEE",171,Adjournment
339,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.41 Pm),"I am indebted to the Courier-Mail newspaperment is increasing tax on south-side residents. It seems to typify Labor governments that they want to increase tax and increase debt. There is, around Australia, $58 billion of increased government debt at the state level, at a time when we are building a Future Fund of $50 billion over the forward estimates. Labor governments are not good at these things. Fuel prices are bad enough, but local residents and motorists in my electorate have the only toll road in the entire state of Queensland-the Logan Motorway and the Gateway Motorway extension. Tolls are going to go up by 10c at each tollbooth, and that means you will pay 20c for a trip starting at the Ipswich Motorway and completing at the Gateway Motorway at Wishart. You might think 20c is not much; that is what the Queensland government are hoping. But add it all up: given that the Gateway and Logan motorways actually have more cars on them than the Gateway Bridge, which is also putting up the toll by 10c a trip each way, with 33,000 motorists travelling along those motorways every day, if you do the simple maths you will see it is $1.1 million a day extra that the Queensland government are going to rip off south-side residents-$1.1 million extra a day. They are never afraid to take money in stamp duty for new homes and new land and so forth, projects that are very evident in my area; but, when it comes to getting rid of the only toll road in Queensland, what do they do? They increase the toll. Residents are writing to me-I have had hundreds of letters in the last couple of daysMr Gibbons interjectingSunnybank has written and said that he is a courier and he uses both toll roads every day. Marjorie from Runcorn has written and said that trucks and other heavy vehicles are using Warrigal Road in increasing numbers; they are going around the tollbooth at Persse Road in Runcorn. John from Calamvale says: ‘For years I have complained about the unfair treatment to south-side residents who have always been hit by tolls; north-side road projects never attract a toll-example, the Nundah bypass and the northern city bypass. It’s totally unfair.’ Terry from Eight Mile Plains said: ‘The trucks speed up Padstow Road doing 80 kilometres plus in a 60 zone. People live in that street-trying to get in and out of driveways.’ There is MacGregor primary school, the biggest primary school in the state of Queensland. These sorts of local roads are suffering as people go around the Beattie government’s toll. The Beattie government’s toll on the Gateway extension and the Logan Motorway, the southern Brisbane bypass-a purpose-built road, a freeway standard road, the only toll road in Queensland-means that south-side residents are paying a regional tax that no-one else in Queensland is paying. they do that in Hinkler-I hope. But why are they doing it to the residents of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn, Calamvale, Stretton and Algester? Why are they confronting people with heavy vehicles, B-doubles, using these side streets? If it had not been for the Australian government’s $1.7 million vote of support to residents’ sleep patterns, which has taken 221,000 trucks off the road between 10 at night at five in the morning-a toll-free truck trial MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Adjournment

342,Mr Hardgrave,"It is disgraceful, Member for Hinkler. There is no way on earth thatover the last couple of years-there would not have been any change. The only change under the Beattie government has been to increase tax. Let me tell the Main Committee the names of the people on the board of directors of the quango-the quasi-autonomous non-government organisation-that the Beattie government hides behind when it comes to tolls. David Gray is the chairman. He used to be the managing director of Boeing-terrific. The deputy chairman is a bloke called Robert Grice. He is a former chair of the South East Queensland Water Corporation. What a complete disaster he has been. Peter Lynch has been the chair of a variety of legal organisations, including the HIA. Don Muir is a former deputy director-general of the Queensland Department of Main Roads. Alan Tesch is currently the director-general of Main Roads. Rob Wensley QC is a Brisbane barrister. There are two people from the private sector. Then there is Tim Spencer, a chap who is the deputy under-treasurer at Queensland Treasury. They are the ones rubbing their hands together with glee as the money flows in. I would like to be proved wrong, but I do not reckon even one of them lives anywhere near these toll roads. Not one of them lives in the electorate of Moreton, according to my records. If they want to put their hands up and tell me they are a local constituent and they are paying the toll then I will actually go a little softer on them. But, as it currently stands, they inflict on people in my area a toll no-one else in Queensland is paying, and the Beattie government stands condemned. (Time expired) Melbourne Ports Electorate: Jewish Schools Jewish schools in my electorate is an issue that I wish to raise today. My colleague the member for Perth, the shadow minister for education and training, visited several schools with me in my electorate last month with a view to getting a first-hand appreciation of the differing needs of these schools, which have been disadvantaged by the prevailing socio-economic status, or SES, formula that is used by the education ministry to determine the funding to schools. Successive Howard government ministers of education have promised these schools in my electorate that this formula would be reviewed. The promise comes before each federal election. They were first made by education minister Kemp and then by education minister Nelson. And, of course, after each minister is re-elected they have failed to do anything about this inequitable funding. This issue transcends party politics in my electorate: improving access to quality education at these schools will affect the futures of a great many of my constituents long after the outcome of this election is decided. The schools that the member for Perth and I visited were the Gandel Besen campus of Mount Scopus, Yeshivah-Beth Rivkah and Adass Israel School. They are subject to the same funding assessments by postcode as schools which are far better endowed, and yet those other schools do not provide substantial fee reductions or waivers for large families or have families of 14 or 15 kids attending, as with these particular schools. It is to their credit that these schools and other schools adopt such an inclusive approach to education within their community, and nothing should happen to disadvantage them. Above all they should not be penalised for finding themselves cash-strapped because the present funding arrangements are predicated on the assumption that, being schools in wealthy postcodes, they must of course be wealthy. The visits to these schools with the member for Perth resulted in a number of announcements reflective of my commitment and that of the Australian Labor Party to enhancing acMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Adjournment
343,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.46 Pm),"The systemic inequity in funding of somecessibility to education generally and, more specifically, to ensuring that parents are able to access the education they choose for their children. The member for Perth hit the nail on the head in an article on the front cover of last Thursday’s Australian Jewish News when he said: “Because of historical factors determining the location of synagogues, there is often no relationship between the socio-economic status of the area in which a Jewish school is located and the financial capacity of parents whose children attend these schools …” With the member for Perth, I met two little girls at one school and we asked them, ‘How many kids are there in your family?’ One had 14 kids in her family and the other had 15 siblings. As the member for Perth said in his media release, the tendency of these families to have large numbers of children often makes even modest school fees a financial burden, when they are multiplied by each child. This is particularly the case when they live in an area because of its proximity to a synagogue or to kosher food, not because they want to live in a wealthy postcode. It means that they are being disadvantaged by the formula that is a catch-all for that area and that does not effectively reflect their interests or means. With the member for Perth, I visited all of these schools and we looked at another issue that disadvantages them, and that is the issue of security. As was established in a recent Sunday program that I participated in, these schools have a terrorist target rating equal to that of the US embassy in Canberra. This is the situation as presented to them by the relevant Australian government security agencies. Parents at these schools have to make substantial efforts to see that their children are protected. There are armed guards at practically all of these schools. The amount that is paid for security by individual parents is in addition to their school fees and often amounts to 10 or 15 per cent. The member for Perth said that it was his aspiration to provide assistance to all schools so that expenses no longer have to be covered by a school budget that would be better put toward teaching and learning. I understand that this is a suggestion the shadow minister for education is going to be making to all Australian schools that have a similar problem with security. It is a non-partisan thing that will be done for any school from any background having that particular problem. Funding security is something that I strongly support. In his short but highly productive stint as shadow minister for education and training, the member for Perth has grasped the need for the further funding arrangements for schools in my electorate for which I have long campaigned. (Time expired) Duyfken lica of the Duyfken or ‘Little Dove’ set sail on a 12,000-kilometre voyage around Australia to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first documented European contact with Australia. Member for Hinkler-around southern and eastern Australia, including Fremantle, Cairns, Hobart and Sydney, sailed by a combined volunteer-professional crew of 16 people. One of those fortunate enough to have been selected for a leg of the voyage was Frances Clements, who hails from Gilmore, my part of our island continent. Frances is a ranger with the Marine Parks Authority at Jervis Bay Marine Park and I was lucky enough to have her share the story of her experiences with me, which I now want to share with this House. MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Adjournment

345,Mr Neville,And came to my electorate!,175,Adjournment
346,Mrs Gash,"Yes. During that voyage the Duyfken visited many ports-including yours,Frances is a qualified coxswain and this enabled her to meet the requirement to have completed a mandatory sea safety course, which would have otherwise scuttled her chances to volunteer in the time frame available to her. She joined the Duyfken at Newcastle in late October last year and over the next week, until she disembarked at Wollongong, was busily involved in fast-tracking the skills needed to crew a square-rigged sailing ship. The Duyfken is a very small craft, only some 24 metres long, with a shallow draft of 2.8 metres. Anyone who had first seen photographs and then viewed the real thing would have been very surprised at the real size. According to Frances, there were plenty of jobs to go around and if sails were involved then plenty of ropes as well. At sea, crews stood watches of four to six hours day and night and all took turns on the lookout duties and at the helm. Adjusting the sails was an exercise in coordination. The crew focused on working in unison and responding quickly to the captain’s and mate’s orders to ease this rope and haul that one to avoid damaging the rigging. Frances says she now understands how sea shanties originatedfrom the need to maintain a rhythm when drawing the anchor or doing other hard work requiring a team effort. Incidentally, it took all free hands to raise the anchor, using a wooden ratchet-and-pulley device. Each time the crew pulled on the anchor rope, a plank was wedged into the wooden ratchet, devised to stop it slipping back. Living on board, one gets absorbed in the sense of the history of the Duyfken and what it must have been like for those living on board. In keeping with the atmosphere, the use of mobile phones was discouraged and limited to offshore opportunities or moments when there was the least intrusion into the atmosphere of the ship. Frances slept in a hammock, which she found surprisingly comfortable, but she did say that when it rained or the deck was awash, the water leaked through the deck, dripping onto anyone sleeping below. Her head space on the hammock was only about 18 inches and the upper part of the hull became warm and humid overnight. So, whilst her trip in spring was relatively comfortable, a journey through the tropics such as the original voyagers took would have been an entirely different proposition. But there was a comforting feeling at the same time, no doubt encouraged by the cosiness below decks and the timber and rope that formed the world of the crew. I hasten to add that she described below decks as small but not claustrophobic, and the creaking of the ship was a comforting, pleasant sound. Speaking of rope, Frances described how waste rope would have been recycled into functional pieces of equipment such as mats to buffer against surfaces that rubbed together. Washing up was done in a wooden bucket using a fat, frayed rope end as a scrubbing brush. Of course there were some mod cons, such as safety equipment, but overall the presentation stayed fairly true to the period, with hand-sewn flax cloth sails and tarred hemp and manila ropes. Much of the journey involved stays in various ports and engaging in promotional activities-typically spanning a weekend, with a further two days for visits by school groups. It has to be appreciated that the volunteer crew constantly changed during the nine months of the voyage as people came and went. This was a challenging dynamic to the full-time crew, who virtually had to retrain people on a constant basis. It must have been very much like groundhog day for them. Frances describes the lure of the sea as seductive and said that, if the opportunity was again offered, she would jump at it, particularly for a longer voyage. Despite some trying moments, MAIN COMMITTEE her experience was memorable, enjoyable and a personal challenge. She felt as if she participated in living history and was enriched by the experience. I am grateful for the funding provided by the federal government because it allowed the cost of volunteering to be kept down, thereby making the experience accessible to far more people than would otherwise have been the case. I urge any young or older Australian to consider the experience, if offered to them, for it illustrates a path of history like no other way. I endorse Frances’ words to encourage any young person or older person from the electorate of Gilmore to apply for this experience. Gorton Electorate: Medicare Office have a Medicare office. It did have a Medicare office in Deer Park but that was closed down by the Howard government. In February this year I wrote to the minister requesting he consider locating a Medicare office in Gorton. On 22 May the minister wrote in response to my letter that he did not believe there was a need for a Medicare office and explained there was new software that would provide access to a rebate if constituents in my electorate had expended moneys that went beyond the normal costs that would be covered by bulk-billing. In the consideration in detail stage of the budget bills this week, I inquired of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, who was representing Senator Ellison, why there was no need for a Medicare office in my electorate. He indicated and stressed that, because of this software, there would be no need at all for a Medicare office in my electorate. I have two ministers now on the record indicating there is no need for a Medicare office in Gorton. Indeed, he suggested that the software now would make Medicare offices obsolete. I then asked: if that is the case, is it the government’s intention to close every Medicare office in Australia? If because of the software there is no additional benefit in having a Medicare office, wouldn’t it be a waste of taxpayers’ money to have Medicare offices across Australia? First of all, he indicated to me that he was not aware of any intention to close any Medicare offices and then he was advised by the army of staff sitting behind him that the government was not looking to close down any offices. SoI have to conclude from the comments made by the minister that either he believes that taxpayers’ money is being wasted on Medicare offices or he believes that there is a use for Medicare offices, except for in Gorton. I consider the government’s response to my request for a Medicare office in the fastestgrowing area in Melbourne to be contemptuous. This government has to consider looking at the marginalised-not just the marginals-people who are in need. A large number of residents in my electorate have lower levels of income and lower levels of assets, and they find it very difficult not to be able to receive their rebate instantly after outlaying money on medical costs. I accept the view-and I have said this to the ministers-that the software should assist. But the minister did indicate to me that all doctors’ surgeries would have this facility, the Easyclaim facility. That is not true. There are only two participating doctors or pharmacies in my electorate that are looking to use this system. There is still some mistrust about the system and whether in fact people will want to use EFTPOS or credit cards to have payments rebated to them. SoI have to conclude, based on the government’s answers to my request, that there is no real concern for the constituents of Gorton or that the offices across the country are unnecMAIN COMMITTEE",175,Adjournment
347,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (12.56 Pm),"My electorate of Gorton does notessary. I do not believe it is the latter. I do not consider that constituents want to see closures of Medicare offices. The fact is that I have the fastest-growing electorate in Victoria. There are two transport spines in my electorate. One is the Calder that goes all the way through McEwen to Bendigo, as the member for Bendigo knows. There is an enormous amount of growth in that particular area; there is exponential growth in those communities. There is rapid growth along the Ballarat Highway towards the seat of Lalor and towards Ballarat, and there is a greater need for Commonwealth services. In fact, I know that my electorate is the fastest-growing area. The state of Victoria has more than 60 Medicare offices; we have 39 seats. You would think that there was a chance for the fastest-growing area of Victoria to be in receipt of the next Medicare office. Indeed, the departmental staff did indicate that to me earlier this year. I would hope the government reconsiders its position, realises that Gorton constituents are as important as anybody else and provides the Commonwealth services that they need so they can have their Medicare costs rebated as quickly as possible. Budget 2007-08 its strong, positive impact on regional Australia. My region of Braddon, as with other regional areas, has received considerable benefit from the 2007 budget. From an Australian economic, social and business perspective, this budget has been a winner for all sectors. The financial outlook includes a strong cash surplus of some $10.6 billion, the 10th consecutive surplus. This is accompanied by a forecast of continued economic growth and by a 30-year low in unemployment. The opposition has repeatedly said that our entire economic well-being is a result of the mining boom and not of good government and economic and social management. I challenge this. For example, in my own state of Tasmania, economic growth averaged some 3.7 per cent between 2004 and 2006. Nationally, industry grew from 2.7 to 2.9 per cent between 2004 and 2006, while the exports of particular note from my region of Braddon-those of agriculturenationally have grown an average 23.7 per cent over the two-year period 2004-06. I argue that such growth is not based on a mining boom but on a well-managed economy that allows all sectors to grow. For regional Australia this support will continue during 2007-08 due to the initiatives announced in the budget, not just with the new programs launched but also with those continuing to drive benefits into regional Australia. Very close to all of my constituents’ hearts is the issue of personal income tax reform. The Australian government has delivered to Australia some $31.5 billion in tax cuts which go directly into the pockets of all Australians, including my local constituents. Other personal relevant initiatives such as superannuation bonuses, increases in pensions and the one-off payment for our aged and less economic sector are all possible due to good governance and good economic management. If a good budget only required placing additional cash in an individual’s pocket then producing a budget would be very easy. However, it is far more complex than that. In regional Australia alone there have been specialised initiatives developed and delivered in such key areas as agriculture, business, industry, communications and society, culture and heritage, economics and finance, education and training, employment, environment and naMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Adjournment
348,Mr Baker (Braddon) (1.01 Pm),"I rise this afternoon to speak on the 2007 budget andture, government, health and safety, information and communications, law and justice, science and technology and transport. Regional Australia has been tremendously supported by this budget. The Australian government have also committed an additional $314 million in exceptional circumstances assistance, which brings it to a total since 2002-05 of $1.6 billion, some $342 million for improved rural services and $205 million to help primary producers through extending the Agriculture Advancing Australia initiative. From Braddon’s perspective, such programs add to the total investment in my region, contributing significantly towards sustainability and a strong economic advantage for Braddon. That builds on, over the last two years, over $70 million in road infrastructure funding to duplicate the Bass Highway between Penguin and Ulverstone and some $15 million for the upgrading of the notorious Sisters Hills section between Wynyard and the Circular Head region. The Circular Head region is well renowned for its great agriculture, producing close to 40 per cent of Tasmania’s milk. It has great abalone-processing facilities. It has a flourishing forestry industry. It is one of those areas that certainly has and is in the process of having very good road infrastructure. From Braddon’s perspective, such programs are important to the growth and development of the community. They demonstrate the balance in this budget, in which there are also substantial initiatives to assist our environment. Braddon has secured substantial projects which will assist our community enormously with this precious resource. There has also been significant assistance nationally to our most vulnerable and ill, with $772 million for improved detection and treatment of chronic and complex conditions and $1.6 billion for aged-care initiatives. Our youth have also been well supported with initiatives assisting obesity and childhood illnesses that increase the uptake of sports activities by our young during after-school activities programs. There are programs for youth diabetes and, especially important for our region, there is over $1.2 million for the treatment of youth with mental and social issues.

Murray-Darling Basin (Question No. 4908) Mr Georganas asked the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 27 November 2006: Since receiving information on the condition of the Murray River from the Murray-Darling Water Crisis Management Council on 1 November 2006, what action has the Government taken to ensure that the Murray River will not run dry in 2006-07. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) is currently experiencing unprecedented conditions; rainfall in some catchments over the nine months March to November is the lowest on record. However, operating at the current level of reduced allocations, the Murray River will not run dry in 2006-07; there is sufficient water in storage, including weir pools, to ensure the river continues to flow until next winter. Nevertheless, record low inflows in 2006-07 coupled with minimal water reserves in storages constitute a very real threat to water users and communities in the Basin and further afield in Adelaide and South Australia should dry conditions persist in 2007-08. In response to this unprecedented situation, the Prime Minister convened a Summit on the MDB with the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and Acting Premier of Queensland on 7 November 2006. At the meeting it was agreed to: ‘establish a group of high-level officials drawn from First Minister’s Departments and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to examine contingency planning to secure urban water supplies during 2007-08.’",178,Adjournment
349,Mr Turnbull,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,180,Questions In Writing
350,Mr Turnbull,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Senior Officials’ Group submitted the MDB Contingency Planning Report to the Prime Minister, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia on 20 December 2006. Governments have agreed to the recommendations of the report and progress has been made on implementing many of the priority measures. To date, the key outcomes of the report are – South Australia has commenced additional pumping into Mount Lofty storages from the Murray River to ensure water supply for Adelaide. Certain wetlands have been disconnected and work on lowering off-takes in pumping stations will commence in March 2007. The target end of season reserve in Lake Victoria has also been lowered. Preliminarily preparation for the construction of a temporary weir near Wellington on the Murray River has begun. A decision on whether to complete construction of a weir will be made by the South Australian Government later in 2007. Consideration is being given to the role of the Snowy in 2007-08, should dry conditions continue. Senior officials are examining the role of Snowy Hydro Ltd, balancing the provisions of water with the important role the Snowy plays in electricity supply in the national electricity market. Contingency planning of ‘at risk’ towns are being finalised by State Governments and resources will be available to put them into place should the need arise. The Senior Officials’ Group is overseeing ongoing preparatory work and will provide regular reports to First Ministers, the next report will be provided to First Ministers in mid March. The approach taken on contingency measures is designed to manage the risks of low inflow of water into the Basin. The probability of there being sufficient water to meet critical needs is higher than the probability that there will not be. If seasonal conditions improve then plans will be modified as the situation develops. With proper preparations, the critical demands of urban areas and towns, and other households relying on the water supply systems of the southern MDB, will be able to be met even in the face of another very dry year in 2007-08.
