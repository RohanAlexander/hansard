There is no objection to the course indicated, and the correspondence will be tabled. 2. It is suggested that the honourable member might address the Public Accounts Committee direct on the subject, but it is assumed that the Committee's action is determined with regard to the public interest, and irrespective of the remarks of witnesses appearing before it. 3. Thc Government has carefully considered the correspondence and repudiates the suggestion contained in thc honourable member's question. 4.

The person immediately concerned was Mr J. T. Caldwell, who mentioned that he had some important correspondence. He was asked, during the course of his examination, why he did not produce it, and he said that it was un possession of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). ' After some little difficulty, the Committee obtained it from that gentleman. It was examined 'by myself, the Secretary to the Committee, and, probably, by individual members also, for it was made available to all. It consisted, for the most part, of a series of letters addressed to various members of Parliament, and containing somewhat rambling and wild statements of the character that honourable members receive by the bushel from people with alleged grievances. There was nothing in the .letters that we considered worth placing on record. The Committee followed up some of the suggestions made by Mr Caldwell in, certain directions, but found nothing whatever to justify the slightest idea of corruption or irregularity in regard to the whole transaction. So far as the Minister (Senator E. D. particularly to question No. 3, asked on behalf of tire honourable member for Corio to-day-the Committee wish me to say that throughout the whole of this business the attitude and action of the honourable gentleman was correct and honourable in every regard.

The Senate has resolved to press its Requests for amendments Nos. 11, 31, 32, 33, 34, 56, and 85, and again requests the House of Representatives to make such amendments, as shown in the annexed Schedule (No. 1). Requests for amendments Nos. 26, 41, 43, 82, and Ol, which were not made or were modified by the House of Representatives, have been dealt with by the Senate as shown in the annexed Schedule (No. 2), and the Senate requests the House of Representatives to further amend the B ill as now indicated in such Requests. son) -i l desire to direct the attention of the House to the constitutional question which the Senate's message (No. 97) raises. On receipt of a message from, the Senate the formal question usually proposed from the Chair is ""that the consideration, in Committee of the message be made an order of the day for tomorrow;"" bub as the matter is one of great importance, affecting the constitutional rights of this House, I will not submit any question until one has been moved on the floor of the House, as I am of the opinion that the Senate, in pressing certain requests for amendments in the Customs Tariff, has exceeded the rights conferred on the Senate by section 53 of 1 the Constitution. The right of the Senate to press requests for amendments in connection with the Tariff has never been admitted by the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives, ""having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff,"" on two previous occasions ""refrained from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations,"" as stated in its message to the Senate dated 4th September, 1902, and again in its message dated 28th May, 1908. I therefore leave it to the House itself to determine what action shall be taken regarding the Senate's message. Trade and Customs) [3.12] I was not aware until I came into the House that you, Mr Speaker, proposed to take this action, but I admit the-great importance of the issue you have raised, and, in the circumstances, I move That the consideration in Committee of the Senate's message be made an Order of the Day for to-morrow. I suggest that that will be a suitable time to discuss the constitutional issue. understand that the Senate's message raises the constitutional issue to which you, sir, have referred in a different way from that in which it has arisen on any former occasion, and I suggest to the Government that the legal advisers of the Crown ought, for the assistance of honourable members, to reinforce the Prime Minister, or the Minister in charge of this Bill, with information on precedents before the House is called upon to decide so important an issue. I make that suggestion to the Government in all good faith, because I believe that there is at stake in this matter one of the most important constitutional issues that has been raised since we have had a Federal Union. adjourned.

When' I moved an amendment to the Budget with a view to instructing the Government to reduce the expenditure by £2,817,108, tlie amount of the estimated deficit, the Prime Minister( Mr the returns for the corresponding period Hughes) and the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) said thafc ample opportunity would be given to members of the Committee to deal with the individual items of these Estimates, aud that the Government would gladly welcome suggestions for economy in respect of either statutory or ordinary expenditure. carefully perused .the Estimates, and T intend to move for a reduction of expenditure in certain Departments, but I agree with the contention of the Prime Ministeithat economy should begin with ourselves, and we should be prepared to show the public that we do nob wish to economize at the expense of the other fellow without making any sacrifice ourselves. to the estimated national income this year have been already home out by tlie figures that have been published. According to fche Budget speech, the ex-Treasurer expected to receive in Customs revenue in fche first four months of the year £8,710,333, but the collections actually amounted to £8,277,672, disclosing a shortage of £432,661, and for the last month alone the revenue was £904,346 lower than in the month of October, 1920. According to press reports and statements made in the House later, the Government are still optimistic regarding the Customs revenue, but I am unable to share in their optimism I reiterate what I said to fche Committee previously-that our importations, upon which the Customs duties are levied, have decreased by nearly 40 per cent. It is notorious that last year huge shipments came to this country which were the result of delayed orders, and it stands to reason that the volume of the imports will be smaller this year; but, even if the volume were the same, the value would be smaller, and by a simple sum in arithmetic we arrive at the result that we must get less Customs revenue this year than last. Further evidence is not wanting that the limit of [24 NOVEMBER, 1921.] 1921-22. 13209 the purchasing power of our people has nearly been reached. The postal revenue is not coming up to expectations, there being, so far, a shortage of £91,000. ber take the estimate for the whole year and divide it by three, or is he quoting figures given by the Minister? the figures of the Minister, and am using la3t year as a guide.

The Committee can do nothing ih the matter, and I deprecate attempts to deal with a subject of such importance as the parliamentary allowance by a side-door method. I do not know whether a motion for the reduction of the allowance would be carried; but .members who desire to vote for an allowance of £600, £S00, or £1,000 should have a direct opportunity for doing so. to vote for an allowance of £1,500? ber and his party were on the other side of the chamber they might have such an opportunity; but I do not think that, sitting where they are, their chance is worth much. members have already had an opportunity of dealing with this subject. have second thoughts, orable member is not in order in discussing a measure now on the business-paper. stand the honourable member for Balaclava to be discussing the Bill of which the honourable member for Swan has charge. should be pursued in order that members might have an opportunity to discuss the parliamentary allowance. He correctly pointed out that the business-paper is under the control of the House, not of the Committee. If the Order of the Day is to be discharged, it must be done by a vote of the House. I am powerless in that regard. I am empowered only to obey the Standing Orders, administer them, and interpret them to the best of my ability. Standing Orders forbid the discussion of an Order of the Day being anticipated by any motion in a Committee of this kind. In the House the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) could secure leave to remove the Order of the Day from the business-paper or to discuss the matter in any other form. It would be entirely a matter for the House, ancl in any case it is not a question for decision by this Committee. avoid the merits of the question, and confine my remarks as best I could to the question of procedure raised by the motion of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory). I suggest to that honourable member now that he will get a suitable opportuniy of having the question dealt with in the House. If the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) seeks the permission of the House to withdraw his Bill and the House consents, well and good. If not, honourable members will be no worse off than they are now.

It is, of course, for the honourable member to determine his own line of conduct. vote to be taken on the question of whether the items shall be dealt with seriatim, or as proposed by the Government. That really is the object of my motion, and it seems to me to be necessary, in support of my proposal, to refer, not in detail, but generally, to the growth you, sir, rule that I am out of order in pursuing that line of argument, I shall at once resume my seat so that a vote may be taken on my motion and the temper of the Committee ascertained in regard to it. is very difficult to deal witli this motion in the absence of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), but I desire to assure the Ministry that it has not been submitted with the object of embarrassing the Government in any way. Every honourable member, I am sure, is anxious that efficient administration shall be secured, and that every division in these Estimates shall be carefully scrutinized. May I ask, Mr Chairman, that the Estimates shall be dealt with in divisions, instead of the total vote in respect of each Department being put from the Chair? I understand, for instance, that although the Estimates relating to the Parliament comprise some nine or ten divisions, only three questions were actually put by the Chair. I had intended to move certain amendments, but in the confusion of' voices was not aware that the divisions to which they related had been declared passed. I hope that each division will be put separately. In asking that there shall^be a change in the administration of the Prinie Minister's Department we have no desire to embarrass the Government. We think it impossible for the Prime Minister, having regard to his multifarious duties, to give to all the administrative functions of his Department the attention which they demand. I am satisfied that many of the items covered by the Estimates relating to his Department should be dealt with by other Ministers.

Will any honorahle member say that Commonwealth shipbuilding should be under the administrative control of the Prime Minister, or that he should have to deal with matters relating to the Port Pirie wharf ? We also find in the Prime Minister's Estimates a branch relating to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. We know that the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton) is attending to most of the work relating to that dockyard, and its administrative control should be in his hands. wish to know whether the honourable member for Dampier is entitled to discuss questions of policy on a motion for the postponement of the consideration of rhe Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department ? ter) -The honourable member has not, so far, been discussing any question of policy, but has simply been giving reasons why the consideration of these particular Estimates should be postponed. I may say, in answer to the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), that if the Committee so desire, the Estimates can be put item by item. In the absence of any such expression of opinion, they certainly will be put in divisions. In resprung up. There is expenditure I have gard to the Estimates relating to Parliament, I followed the ordinary course of calling on the first item, and of allowing upon it a general discussion. That general discussion having been concluded.and the first item agreed to, I put the remainder of the division separately. Honourable members had, therefore, a f u ll opportunity to submit any amendment that they desired to bring forward. Every item in the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department will he open for discussion. Prime Minister is not here, as 1 should have liked the Committee to receive from him some assurance that the suggestions we have been making in regard to the administration of his Department will be taken into consideration. Our desire, at this stage, is not to deal with individual items, but merely to secure an alteration in the system which has grown up since the war, and to relieve the Prime Minister's Department, as far as possible, from [527] the administration of the big working activities of the Commonwealth. The Minister in charge of the Committee ( Mr Groom) knows that in all the State Governments the Premier is relieved of administrative work of this character. The same policy was adopted in the earlier history of the Commonwealth. Thc CHAIRMAN -The honourable member is now discussing the merits of these Estimates. He must confine his attention to the motion for their postponement. I am fortified in that ruling by a decision given hy Mr Speaker in 1914, that "" on a motion to postpone business, the business which it is proposed to postpone cannot be discussed."" Motion, by leave, withdrawn. moveiThat the vote he reduced by £1. I submit this motion as an instruction to the Government to arrange for the placing of various activities at present conducted by the Prime Minister's Department under the Departments to which they most properly belong. I should like, however, to draw attention to the increased expenditure in the Prime Minister's Department during the last ten years, quite independently of the new activities that have called "" unaffected,"" expenditure by the Prime Minister's Department that would be incurred whether that Department was in existence or nofc.

I suggest that Mr Shepherd was deliberately moved out of his position as head of the Prime Minister's Department in order to make a herd was given an increase of 100 per cent, in his salary to induce him to go to London. It is said, indeed, that when he was first approached with the offer of the London position he was quite unwilling to accept it . He was offered £1,500, and he refused the position. Then he was offered £2,000, and he agreed to accept that with certain additions, such as an allowance for loss on the sale of his furwas second in command of the Prime niture, though he certainly sold the furniture to very considerable advantage owing to the circumstances of the market. I believe that if Mr Shepherd had asked for some remuneration to compensate him for deprivation of the use of the Government motor car in which he travelled to and from the golf course every Saturday, he probably would have received that also; in fact, he would have been given anything so long as he would agree to vacate his position, and enable the Prime, Minister's protige, Mr Percy Deane, to step into the vacancy. Here is a remarkable thing about this appointment: The closing day for all applications is usually Thursday, and some little time elapses between the closing date and the filling of the appointment. It is significant that the applications for the posiit will be necessary for me to move that tion of Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department closed on a Wednesday, a Cabinet meeting was held on the following day, and an announcement appeared in the press on the Friday morning that on the Thursday the Cabinet had appointed Mr Percy Deane to the position. I suggest that the Prime Minister has been guilty of gross nepotism. Not only was Mr Percy Deane appointed to this position in this particular way, but he was Under-Secretaries. The Ministerial head appointed at the maximum salary of £1,250, instead of at a commencing salary of £1,000. A young man with practically no experience, although probably with ability of a certain kind, having made himself useful to the Prime Minister, was appointed over the heads of a large number of permanent members of the Commonwealth that the officer who was second in charge of the Department was a gentleman whose abilities were recognised by the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence Administration in 1918. In recognition of the exceptional abilities he possessed, he was actually selected to fill the position of permanent head of the Navy Department, but he was not apE ointed. Honourable members will, peraps, recollect why; it was not through any lack of qualification on his part. I refer to Mr J. D. Maclaren, who is now permanent head of the Department of Home and Territories. He is an experienced and highly capable oflicer, and Minister's Department, but over his head a young and untrained individual was appointed at the maximum salary. I am perfectly certain that the position of Secretary to the Department could have been well filled and the work efficiently performed by Mr Maclaren, but the Prime Minister makes no secret of the fact that he is good to those who serve his purposes. Mr Percy Deane had served his purposes well, and the consequence is that the Commonwealth is saddled with him for all time, and he is appointed over the heads of a large number of men who I believe were quite as capable, if not more capable, of filling the position. I think I am entitled to ask for an explanation of this appointment. If it is not forthcoming, this officer's salary be reduced, at any rate, to the ordinary commencing amount. -Quite likely the suggestion I am about to make will be criticised by the press, but that prospect does not worry me. I think that, iin this Parliament, we should follow the practice of the British Parliament by having Parliamentary of every important Department should have a lieutenant in this Parliament who would act as understudy to him, and share his work. I make that suggestion without proposing any increase in Ministerial salaries.

I put forward as worthy of consideration the suggestion; that, without any increased cost to the country, there should be a further division of Ministerial labours. There comes a time in the history of every man, be he ever so great, when he cannot keep pace with the work he has to perform; the feat goes beyond human intelligence and endurance. say without egotism that had the then Prime Minister accepted a suggestion made by me in 1914 that the two Houses of Parliament should be divided into Committees to assist the Government to keep an oversight over the vast war expenditure, the country would have been saved millions of pounds. No single man could possibly keep absolute control of the public funds at a time when such vast sums were being expended. For a long time one Minister presided over the Department of Defence and the Department of the Navy. It was absolutely impossible for one man to intelligently and thoroughly control both Departments. He had to depend absolutely on the advice of his experts, and accept it whether it was good, bad, or indifferent. Without wishing to disparage officers of either Department, I remind the Committee that, during war time, hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted in connection with defence and war expenditure, and no doubt in other Departments, too, very considerable sums of 1 money were thrown away. course, happens to every country in war time. Even in Germany, whose whole population was under regimentation, vast scandals occurred during war time, and millions of pounds were lost by fraudulent practices on the part of members of a supposedly honest public. present time we have in the Public Works Committee and the Committee of Public Accounts two bodies that are rendering valuable servioe to Parliament Those Committees should have been in existence long before the time when they were established, and a further dividing up of the talent of the House into Committees for the exercise of certain functions would be of advantage to Ministers and to the taxpayers. A stricter oversight of the expenditure is required than it is possible for individual members to give. The Department of the Prime Minister has grown to dimensions which no one anticipated, and we have all been looking for a reduction in it. I do not wish to be disrespectful to the members of the Government, or to any member of the Ministerial or Country party, but I say that for several years we have had practically a one-man Government, and members opposite could have altered that I state of affairs had they seen fit to do so. A change has been long overdue. Without proper oversight of the finances we cannot have true economy; and, further, we shall never get real economy until there has been a revision of the Commonwealth and State Constitutions.

The man never will be 'born who can have every item of departmental administration under personal supervision. because this is impossible that the intentions of (Ministers are often not carried out.

By doing this we should benefit the country. ister and Attorney-General) [4.41] I hope that the Committee will give favorable consideration to the suggestions of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton); but, chastened as I am by many rebuffs and disappointments, I am afraid that reasons will be found why his salutary, though belated, counsel should not be followed. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has drawn attention to the growth of the Prime Minister's Department; and had I known of his intention to do this, I could have arranged to supplement his speech in regard to the many omissions which were due to his lack of intimate familiarity with the working of the Department. I agree with a good deal that was said by both honourable members, though iu the position which I hold, I am largely the creature of circumstances. It is all very, well to say that in 1909, or on some other arbitrary date, the Prime Minister's TJepartment was of small and humble proportions, and went about its business ordering itself lowly and reverently towards its betters. That time is past. During the six years of war we were swept along on a whirling tide of circumstances that not only changed this Department, but overturned financial institutions that seemed as though they might last for ever. Honourable members must look at my Department in the light of what happened during the war. Certain responsibilities gravitated naturally to The honourable member for it, because, with all due deference to my honourable colleagues, there was a singular readiness on their part that the work should come to me. I have done it as well as I was able. Now that the war is past, many of the activities of the Department exist, but in a rudimentary or vestigial form, which serves to mark It is things that are gone. Yet, as it stands, the work of the Department is far too much for one man. Let me state my own experience, and ask the Committee what is to be done in order that the Prime Minister, whoever he may be, may have freedom to study the course of the ship of State, without being pressed down with a weight of details. The war is no longer being waged, and it is within the discretion of honourable members to determine whether certain activities which were then assumed shall be retained. For instance, shall we retain the Commonwealth Shipping Line? If honourable members say not, one of those activities will disappear. The administration of that business has not given me, so far as details are concerned, one-fiftieth of the work that has been imposed on me by less ambitious ventures. The control of the Line has been left in the hands of its manager. I have had, of course, to defend it on the floor of the House, and to answer questions about it, and it is fortunate, in one sense, that I have been connected with the business from its inception. A man who was compelled to meander practically through to the beginning to understand the reason of this or that development would be at a great disadvantage. Commonwealth shipbuilding has been handed over to the control of the Minister for Home and Territories. For a number of years I have been nominally Attorney General; but for three or four years my colleague, the Minister for ""Works and Railways, has been doing the work of the Department.

The lionorable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) said that the direction of external affairs should, by reason of its nature, be in. the hands of the Prime Minister, and that he should do nothing else but that and the ordinary Prime Minister's work.. I entirely agree with that view. It is impossible that any one else should have access to those highly confidential matters, some of which are not disclosed to any one but the Prime Minister. They come to me and are not handed to my clerks, but are put away in a safe. Other matters, of course, fall into a different category; they are certainly confidential, but are not so dangerously confidential that the disclosure of their contents would imperil the safety of the State. These documents pass along a narrow channel, and are seen by two persons other than myself. It would be almost impossible for a man to be Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and not control, or practically control, a Department of External Affairs. To the responsibilities of such a Department have now to be added the activities that come from the Mandated Territories, which, of course, are matters for an External Affairs Department. I am nominally Attorney-General, but the -work of that Department is done, as I have explained, by my colleague the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom). that in a week I spend ten minutes on any activity other than those covered by the Prime Minister's Department and those which would be covered by a Department of External Affairs. As honourable members know, owing to the resignation of my right honourable colleague the member for Parramatta ( Sir Joseph Cook), the Ministry will have to be reconstructed, and in the re-allotment of portfolios I intend, with the approval of the House, to allot to myself the portfolio of Minister for External Affairs, and was here while my Estimates were under to confine my attention to the work attaching' to that office and to the work which ordinarily attaches to the office of Prime Minister. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has suggested that under-Secretaries should be appointed to enable MinMr Hughes. isters to take a general survey of their Departments and consider matters of policy, and so relieve them of the necessity to attend to that multitude of details which oppresses them. Take a day in the life of a Prime Minister. It is made up to a very large extent of interviews with a hundred and. one people. This afternoon,, by the grace of God, I am to see two representatives of the aborigines of Australia. Just now I have had to put off a big deputation which has come from all over the country to see me in regard to anti-dumping. In a moment or two somebody else will come along to see me. Erom early morning till evening that is the way in which most of my time is occupied, but it is work that has to be done in a democratic country. Lf the head of the Government is not accessible to every citizen, it is a negation of democratic government. It is the worse charge that can be laid against one who claims to be the head of a democratic Government to say that he is a recluse who .surrounds himself with a guard and an entanglement of red-tape, through which those who wish to enter his sanctum must meander. Honourable members come freely to see me at my office'.

I am very glad to find that I have this power of soothing people. I was endeavouring to point out the work a Prime Minister is asked to do. While he is expected to be in his office receiving deputations, it is also' his duty to be in the Chamber. I had to tell both deputations this afternoon that my place consideration.

How can a man do all these things if , in addition, the detailed work of an. intricate and difficult Department is thrust upon him ? I have to communicate with a l l the State Premiers on a hundred and one things that are inseparable from the office of Prime Minister, and are quite a p a r t ' from those matters which properly come under a M in ister for External Affairs. I complained some littl e time ago-althoug h my complaint fell upon stony ground-that tlie manner in which the Commonwealth treated its Prime Minister was a reflection upon itself. It is the office and not the man that has to be considered. The man is a passing quantity; the office remains. I do not think that the salary paid to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is anything like sufficient. . Honorable MEMBERS -Hear, hear! dining with four men, one of whom controls a big soft goods warehouse in Flinders-lane and another of whom owns a newspaper. The warehouseman asked me, "" What salary do you get? "" I told him as well as I was able, that is to say, I told h i m what I actually received, and not what I was supposed to get. He said, "" Each manager of m y .sub-departments gets more than you are p a i d . "" And the newspaper proprietor said, "" My editor receives a higher salary than y o u . "" My reply could only be, "" I agree that that ought not to be In every other Dominion the Prime Minister is provided with an official residence. That is not provided here. I do not mention these things by way of complaint; I do not care two straws whether any aotion is taken in the matter by Parliament 'Or not. The mere question of the amount of the salary does not affect me one way or the other. But it is wrong in principle not to pay the Prime Minister a proper salary. 0 As the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has said, it is physically impossible for any Minister to do the work of the Prime Minister's Department without assistance. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) spoke of tlie Secretaries of the Department of the Prime Minister, first Mr. Shepherd, and later Mr Deane, and what he said was not precisely commendation. He suggested that I have erred grievously in appointing a young man, who had not grown grey in the service of the Commonwealth, over the heads of older -and better men. and come down here and urge that it is because I have men under me who are not competent, although the length of their public servioe may be very great, will honourable members accept thab as a valid excuse? A b i l it y is so rare, and men of first-class capacity are so difficult to obtain, that when I see one, it matters very, l it t l e to me whether he is in the Service or not I want h i m . It is not possible to carry on administration in any other way. If a Minister must not get the best man available, but must put' up with one who has passed through the Public Service machine in a certain well-ordered procession, his Department cannot be expected to be carried on in a business-like way. Mr. Deane has been appointed as Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister because he is well worthy the appointment. To-morrow, he could get a position outside at a far higher salary than we are paying him. Indeed, he has been offered such a position. I do not propose to say a word about what the honourable member for Perth said, when he suggested that Mr Shepherd had been appointed to the London office in order to make room for the case."" Mr Deane, except to declare that it is quite untrue. Mr Shepherd carried oat his duties as Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister absolutely admirably. Mr Deane is of a different type, and also his services have alw.as been and remain, invaluable. In a few days I shall be in want of a private secretary. I have been looking for one all over this country, and I cannot 1 get one. In this regard I 'appeal to the honourable member for Franklin( Mr' McWilliams), and to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). I appeal particularly to the former, because at the time.

Eor instance, I should say that the Executive Council is propertly included in the Prime Minister's Department, but that the A u d it Office is not. The Audit Office should be controlled by the Treasury. The Public Service Commissioner probably should be controlled by the Prime Minister's Department, and so should the votes relating to the Governor General's Commissioner's Office, and the Australian Commissioner in the TJnited States of America; b u t "" Shipping and mail servioe to Pacific Islands"" should be under, the Postmaster-General's Department. Then, again, immigration should be dealt with by the Department of Home and Territories, and Commonwealth Shipbuilding should be controlled by the Department of Works and Railways, or some other suitable Department. The Commonwealth Line of Steamers ought to be controlled, not by the Prime Minister's Department, b u t by the Department of Works and Railways, and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard should be directed by the Ministerf o r the Navy. Why all these services should be, as at present, under the control of the Prime Minister's Department I am unable to say. I am pleased that the righ t honourable gentleman has admitted that some of them should not be. The head of the Government of the day is too important a man to be held directly responsible for the efficient administration of such services. Under a proper system of government he is, of course, indirectly responsible for all public services; but he cannot reasonably be expected to give to all such matters the personal attention which they should receive at the hands of some responsible Minister. I shall support the motion. I agree with the Leader of the Country assistance he gave me in that matter.

One of the gentlemen to whom I refer has a European reputation, and his name is known in the Statistical Department of every country. No one can question his intellectual attainments. Then there is the Auditor-General, grown grey with the honours of years of service. Neither of these officers is in the immediate sunshine of the Prime Minister's presence. I suppose shame alone compelled the Government recently to increase the salary of one of them.

Surely the Government is capable of dealing with such -a matter as that of the uniform railway gauge, by means of some arrangement with the States? As to taxation, clear views have been expressed in this House, and we, as elected representatives, together with. the members of the Government, ought to. take the responsibility of coming to a decision. I sincerely hope that in the future ""there will be lewer Royal Commissions; the cost seems to be growing enormously. MT. GREENE (Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.35] I understand that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has moved a reduction in this division by f l . I understand that that was done with a view to obtaining from the Committee an expression' of opinion upon the question of taking from the Prime Minister's Department a number of those activities which at present are congregated in it. The Prime Minister has made a statement as to the intentions of the Government which, I believe, is entirely satisfactory to the Committee, and I presume, therefore, that it is not intended to press the amendment to a division. Committee is such that it does not appear likely that a division will be taken. I am the only member of the Country party present, and I shall not call for a division. sume that the item of £50 for "" Historical memorials of representative men "" refers to the portraits in the Queen's Hall. I might suggest, with all due respect, that some of them are not exactly portraits of representative men in any sense, but my object in referring to the item is to draw attention to what I regard as a very grave omission. One of the most representative men that Australia has ever produced was the late Lord Forrest, and up to the present time there has been no attempt to place his portrait in the collection to which I refer. the law to the full extent that is reThe Government might very well spend to> much worse advantage the sum necessary to place a good portrait of the decesased statesman among those already hung on the walls of Queen's Hall. I think the collection would be quite incomplete without such a portrait. notice that £7,429 was expended last year on the Royal Commission on Taxation, and that an amount of £6,000 is provided for the current financial year. I do not know how long we shall have to wait for the final report of the Commission, but the Government should do something to expedite it. A good deal is dependent upon that report. Both the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) have told us that the Government were waiting the receipt of the final report before attempting to draft an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Throughout Australia there is a demand for the amendment of that Act at the earliest possible moment. The amount of exemption is far too low, the allowance for each child is not sufficient, and cooperative societies and other' bodies are paying double taxation. We have had an interim report from the Commission, but it appears to be considered not sufficiently complete to form a basis for an amendment of the Act. If Parliament goes into recess before amending the existing law not only the taxation for the current year bufc also that for the following financial year will be collected under fche present Act. Parliament will probably not re-assemble until late in fche year, and, before amending legislation can be passed, returns for the year 192223 will have been sent in, and taxpayers will have been assessed on the present basis of taxation. It is not fair fco the people that the present anomalies should be allowed to continue. I do not know what the Government mean by providing another £6,000 for the Royal Commission.

I impress upon the Government the necessity for taking early action to give relief to taxpayers. Another item relates to unification of railway gauges. The Government expended £6,287 last year, and anticipate expending £10,000 in the current year. What work has been performed I do not know, but I understand that a Royal Commission of experts has been investigating the problem. If all this money is being used solely in connection with the investigations of an advisory committee, it seems a very big preliminary expenditure, and it is about time that we approached the practical part of the problem. We should decide whether we are able to proceed w i th the unification of the gauges or allow it to remain in abeyance until such time as money is more plentiful. There may be some good reason fox the expenditure proposed by the Government, and I rose only for the purpose of eliciting information concerning it . The Prime Minister invited honourable members to express their opinion as to how far he ought to proceed with his proposals concerning a re-adjustment of the office of Prime Minister. If we do not accept his invitation he will be left in doubt as to the opinion of honourable members. office of Prime Minister is overloaded. A great deal of the work performed by the Prime Minister now is in connection w i th activities which have been imposed upon the Department by the war. During the war period the Prime Minister was practically a dictator. I think that was the case in the United Kingdom also; and indeed it is necessary during war time that the Prime Minister of a country like Great Britain or the Commonwealth should be practically a dictator. special knowledge made it possible for him to be so. member regard it as a necessary evil] I think it is merely an evil. and I think even the honourable member Minister? ' for Batman will admit that the Prime Minister, with all his faults, has carried ter with the honourable member privately, out his duties in a remarkably successful bufc I have no doubt that I could get way. and I need only quote the speeches of the honourable member for Capricornia to prove the contrary. may be able to quote such speeches in relation to a period during the war, but I must say that since the war we have learned a very great deal, which indicates to us that there were times of which we then had no knowledge when the Empire was in very grave danger, and when the Prime Minister had to take certain action, which proved afterwards to be very necessary, and entirely in the interests of the Commonwealth. My opinion is that the Federal Parliament has undertaken certain activities which properly belong to the States and should remain with them, and we shall never f u l f i l our duties successfully and properly u n t i l .we shed those State activities and confine ourselves to the Federal idea. I am quite in accord with the Prime Minister's proposal that the Prime Minister shall confine his attention to external affairs. There is no doubt thafc the righ t honourable gentleman receives a great many despatches and documents which are confidential. Therefore the office of External Affairs should belong to the PrimeM in ister's Department, and I believe that the right honourable gentleman will have enough to do if , in future , he attends fco external affairs without attempting It is indisputable that the to carry on certain other activities, such as the Commonwealth Shipbuilding Department, if Parliament should decide to continue it .

It would be preposterous to expect that each new leader of the Government should be expected to repose in a man, passed on from one Prime Minister to another, that confidence which is so essential in regard to the conduct of intimate personal correspondence. A prominent member of the Public Service approached me, when Mr Deane was appointed, but I said to him what .1 am now saying, that it would be undesirable to force on the Prime Minister a man in whom, perhaps, he could not repose confidence, to do his private work. In the same way, the official secretary of a Department may not always be of that type of man to whom a Minister could entrust his confidential work; but, i u the circumstances, I think that Ministers should be left to choose their own private secretaries. able to select a suitable man in a Department. there is already in a Department a man who would suit the Minister he should get preference, but discretion in the matter should be left to the Minister. The statement made by the Prime Minister to-day has entirely altered the direction of this discussion. There were some honourable members who were strongly of opinion that it was high time some of the activities of the Department of the Prime Minister were shed; for example, it was thought that all matters relating to shipping should be transferred to the Department administered by the Minister in control of shipping. On several occasions, when I have been about to submit a question in the House, I have gone to the. Minister in control of shipping and asked him whether I was to ask my question of him or of the Prinie Minister. The same difficulty has been experienced in regard to the administration of the various pools It is absolutely impossible for any man to give to all these matters that surround these Government activities that attention which is so essential for their success. When Mr Fisher was Prime MinisterI remember the late Mr Batchelor, who was at the time Minister for External Affairs, feeling a little hurt when I suggested that the Prime Minister was the only man who could deal effectively with external affairs. It was upon my remark the discussion arose which eventually resulted in the transfer of the conduct of external affairs to the Department of the Prime Minister. It is absolutely essential that all matters relating to diplomacy and all the correspondence that passes between our Government and the Imperial Government, or the Governments of other countries, should be filed in the Department of the Prime Minister. I am glad to hear that the Prime Minister proposes to transfer the various activities under his control to the various Departments to which they are more closely related. When the Prime Minister went to England his departure must have created a considerable amount of chaos in Cabinet among the various Ministers who had to take up the different threads, and carry on the work of administering the various concerns, of which they could not be expected to have that intimate knowledge which a Minister administering them from beginning to end would have at his command. The distribution of these activities should Dead to considerable economy. Overhead charges must be enormously reduced by attaching these activities to tlie Departments to which they rightly belong. The total increase in the cost of administering the Department of the Prime Minister is becoming alarming, and must be considerably reduced; and if the re-adjustment of the different activities does not effect savings other steps must be taken to bring about reductions. The expenditure on Australia House is absurdly large for the return we get from it. Many of us read recently a statement made by a member of the Victorian State Parliament who has just returned from a visit to England.

Accordingly the Government appointed a gentleman as Acting Public Service Commissioner, and as a consequence all those under him have moved up a step, and have become acting officers in their several positions. years have we had an Acting Public Service Commissioner? had an Acting Commissioner for about five years. aware of the tremendous pressure under which the Parliament and Ministers have been working, and although we have been trying to push on with the Public Service Bill as rapidly as possible, it has not yet been passed by another place. Proposed vote agreed to. Division IS (Governor General's Office), £6,277, agreed to. Division 19 (High Commissioner's Office), £63,588. In a previous reference to the High Commissioner's OfiiceI drew attention to the large increase that had occurred in its personnel in the course of the last eight years. In 1913-14 there were thirty-four permanent employees, and temporary assistance cost £1,100, while salaries amounted to £8,445, contingencies to £13,412, and cost of cables and telegrams to £1,650. This year it is estimated that there will be ninety-two permanent employees, and no provision is made for temporary assistance. We are asked to vote £12,338 in respect of salaries, £48,000 for contingencies eliminating temporary assistance, and £1,000 for cablesand' telegrams, as against £4,107 expended on cables and telegrams last year. would direct the attention of the Committee to the wide discrepancy between the estimated and actual expenditure, and particularly to the item of contingencies. Last year £47,557. was expended on contingencies, and this year, under that heading, we are asked to vote £48,000. In the financial year 1918-19. when one would have expected that the High Commissioner's Office would have more work to do owing to the fact that so many of our soldiers were then in London, the amount expended on contingencies was £32,046, as against the estimated expenditure of £48,000 this year. A review of the figures discloses that the expenditure of the ofiice has been steadily increasing. The first striking increase is in the salary of the Secretary to the High Commissioner, which has been raised from £1,150 to £2,000, while, in addition, there are other commitments ih respect of compensation for furniture, to which the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) has already referred. I intend later on to submit an 'amendment that will deal with not merely the salary of the Secretary to the High Commissioner, but the whole diviHonorable members are sion. Before doing so I wish to draw special attention to the growth of "" contingencies."" From the figures which I quote in reference to that item the cost of temporary assistance is eliminated. It would appear that a certain number of temporary employees have been appointed to the permanent staff, so that the number of permanent ofiicers has risen from twenty-three in 1920-21 to ninety-two. In 1913-14 the amount voted for contingencies, eliminating temporary assistance was £13,412; in 1916-17, £12,192; in 191819, £32,046; and in 1920-21, £47,557. In reference to these items the Economies Commission, obtained from Major-General Ramaciotti a report in which he summarized his opinions regarding the High Commissioner's Ofiice. In this he stated thatThe organization of the High Commissioner's Office and staff must necessarily depend upon the activities of the Commonwealtli Government, particularly as to immigration and trade. Until the policy which is to guide these activities is settled the organization cannot be placed upon a definite and satisfactory footing. He added that at the time of making his report there were sections and officials, the justification for whose retention, from I the point of view of the then existing requirements, had ceased; but that they were being kept on in expectation of an imminent policy which would demand their knowledge and activities. This was an expensive course, and could not be followed indefinitely. Judging from these Estimates, it would appear that that policy is not only being followed, but has noAv been definitely adopted. A number of those who were previously on the temporary list have now been added to the permanent list, so that the staff, as I mentioned a few moments ago, has been increased from twenty-three, in 1920-21, to",51,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises

It is simply proposed to put all the temporary employees on the permanent staff. It is apparently proposed further to expend money in sending those persons to Australia from time to time for the purpose of obtaining information and knowledge of local conditions. temporary officers in the H i g h Commissioner's Office at the time of this report were niot mjeirely not Australians, but had not been to the Front. them were quite ignorant of the conditions which obtained in Australia. is reasonable to assume that a considerable proportion of the temporary officers who have now been added to the permanent staff have never been in Australia, and we ought to consider whether it is not desirable that, as f a r as possible, the H i g h Commissioner's Office should be staffed only by Australians. the other day that interchanges were to be made. to ask whether such a policy ought to be adopted. charge officers who have knowledge of Australian conditions, surely it would be better to send men from here to Australia House rather than to engage men in London and pay their expenses to Australia in order that they may gain knowledge of local conditions. Sitting Dr. EARLEPAGE return furnished by Major-General Ramaciotti, it appears that the cost of the H i g h Commissioner's Officei n ' London is made up as follows:-Salary 'and allowance of the H i g h Commissioner, £5,000 per Major-General Ramaciotti annum; staff, £ 7 1 , 2 0 9; contingencies, £ 5 7 , 9 5 6; interest on Australia House at 5 per cent., £41,663, or a total of £155,828. If from this be deducted* He recommended £7,582 collected as rent, we have a net expenditure of £148,246. The Economies Commission stated in their reportThe information supplied by Major-General Ramaciotti in regard to the manner in which the building is occupied indicates that economy is not considered. He says that too many rooms (each of a high rental value) are occuI t would appear pied by the staff, too many occupied by one person in each room, and too many rooms de luxe. He recommends that the staff, which is now scattered over eight floors, should be concentrated, if possible, on two floors. Such action would avoid the loss of time now taken up in travelling Witbin the building, and would render supervision less difficult, and would also make availaible for other purposes what must be some of the most valuable floor space in the world. Major-General Ramaciotti has furnished a return (AppendixB ) , which accompanies his report, giving particulars of the Many of the space occupied in Australia House. A perusal of this return is sufficient to show that his remarks under the heading of accommodation are justified. Many of These figures are taken from Major Ramaciotti's report as at 22nd May, 1920; b ut It there are others for the present year. The capital cost of Australia House as at 30th June, 1921, was £969,373, and we have voted £34,000 on these Estimates, making the total cost at the end of the present nnancial year £1,003,373. In terest on this sum at 5 per cent, is, approximately, £50,000. The salary of the Comptroller is £ 2 8 6 ; municipal and otE'er rates, £ 1 2 , 2 5 0; and upkeep, £15,250, making a total of £77,786. That sum, less £23,395, now estimated to be collected as rent, leaves .the actual charge at £ 5 4 , 3 9 1 . That is what it costs I should like per annum to provide accommodation for the Australian representation in London. The above statements of If it is necessary to have in fact show that very littl e attempt has been made to carry out the recommendations of the Economies Commission. The rents have been increased during the last year from £19,176 to £23,385, but whether that is accomplished by saving in space by concentrating the work or by increasing rents is not known. suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. This sum of £54,391 practically represents the rent we pay for the building in In the light of a London.

I do not know to what particular item the honourable member directed the attention of the Committee, or in what particular he desires information. Taking the H i g h Commisisoner's Office as a whole, I should like to make a few general observations. I have read some statements quite recently made, not by honourable members in this House, but by people outside, in regard to the H i g h Commissioner's Office, ' and the work done by that official and his Department. It has been said that both, the building itself and the work carried out therein are unsatisfactory-that the expenditure is excessive, and that we suffer by comparison with other Dominions -and it has been sought to show that the expenditure can w i th advantage be reduced. First of a l l , let me say a word about the H i gh Commissioner himself and the building called Australia House, of which I speak with some knowledge. I have had recent and ample opportunities of refreshing my recollections of London, and of seeing the building and comparing it w it h others, and I say that there is not a finer in London. It is incomparably the best Dominion building in B r it a in ; there is none to challenge comparison; it is in its architecture, and in its construction, a building in which we may take a legitimate pride as worthy of this great country. It was in it self the best advertisement Australia ever had u n t i l our Army advertised this country in a manner which produced a profound impression on the .nations of the whole world, and particularly on Britain. The upkeep of this noble pile of buildings necessarily involves a considerable sum of money. For some time after it was opened much of its floor space was unused, and every effort has been made from time to time to secure the co-operation of the States, and gather should be done. In those efforts we have succeeded to a very large extent, and fche majority of the States now have their (Hon. J. M . offices there. The convenience of this arrangement to Australians visiting London is obvious; the effect of fche building as an advertisement is heightened, and consider ably. The new Secretary to the H i g h Commissioner, Mr Shepherd, has introduced, since his arrival at the beginning of the year, many valuable re-"" forms. The administration has been put on a business-like footing, and the rentals received for the various parts of the building not used by the Commonwealth itself are very considerable. The advantages of Australia House -as a showroom are as obvious as they are unrivalled. I have read some flippant and silly observations about the building, and those vast galleries in which people are supposed to lose themselves. I may say, however, that when in LondonI had the advantage of seeing there an exhibition of Australian f r u it , an exhibition which was of the greatest possible value to the primary producers of this country. There is nofc a better means of displaying the resources of Australia than is offered by that vast ground floor of Australia House. If we had notfchafcbuilding ifc would be necessary for us to hire afc great expense some other building suitable for displaying our products. There is not too much floor space. Recollect that this building has only become available in its entirety during the war. Little by little we have put it on an organized footing, and we are now beginning to reduce the expenditure by letting offices and shop sites that are not used by the Commonwealth itself. Mr Shepherd has done a great deal in that regard. In addition, he is re-organizing the staff, and he has made many important improvements. He has, for example, laid down the policy, as a result of a consultation with me, that employees who have been for more than three years absent from Australia must return to the Commonwealth and be replaced by other officers from this country. The education that young men in the Commonwealth Service will receive",53,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises
215,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nia this way will be most valuable. There was a very great danger of the officials of Australia House becoming anglicized, and looking afc everything through the eye-glasses of Great Britain rather than through the spectacles of Australia. As to the expenditure on the maintenance of Australia House and its staff, let me first of all deal with the High Commissioner. High Commissioner it has been customary for honourable members, when dealing with bhe Estimates, to rise and make disparaging remarks about that officer, whoever he happened to be. He fell very far _ short of that lofty standard of excellence which in their own minds the critics conceived by seeing the halo of the High Commissioner about their own heads. But such excellence is beyond the capacity of ordinary men. The advantage to Australia of being properly represented cannot be measured in terms of money. effective representation would be reflected in diminished those opportunities that from day to day are open before us, and loss of prestige. When we compare the representation of Canada with that of Australia in England we are struck at once with the manner in which the Canadian advertises his country in contrast to the manner in which we do not advertise ours. The Canadians realize, as all Americans do, that the way to get business is to advertise. of advertisement is hard, and it is not for the poor to travel successfully along that road. The Canadian has his High Commissioner and his Trade and for every £1 that Australia on its representation spends £3 or £4. sioner receives a salary of £3,000 and an allowance of £2,000. experience of what it costs to live in London, I say, without hesitation, that no man can do justice to Australia, this country as it should be and move in those circles in which it is necessary that he should move as an equal amongst equals, on the salary that is allotted to the High Commissioner at present. That payment was fixed in the days when £1 would buy as much as 36s. will buy now. A man cannot on the money we pay live in London at the present time and occupy the position that the High Commissioner, should occupy if he is to effectively represent Australia. information of honourable members, let me Mr Hughes. sketch a little picture of what it cost me to live in London, and I may do this with greater readiness because this country had hot to pay I d . for my upkeep. My general expenses in London, including the rent and maintenance of a house, & c , were defrayed by the British Government, and I think I am stating a very conservative figure in saying that from Ever since we have had a £100 to £ 1 2 0 a week would be a fair estimate of my disbursements for those ordinary expenses that are included in the household budget. I say nothing at all of those other expenses which are incidental to the life of a man moving in good London society. How is a man to meet those costs on the salary we pay the H i g h Commissioner ? He will have to entertain as I had to entertain. I gave two or three luncheons, which cost fro m £ 5 0 to £ 7 0 each. My staff was quartered at the Savoy Hotel, where their expenses were Lack of about £ 4 0 per week. Food alone, without including the cost of a room, cost trade, inability to seize from £ 2 to £ 2 10s. per day. TheH i g h Commissioner must entertain, because in London most business is done as the result of luncheons or functions of t h e , kind. I am not at m y best on such occasions, hut I ate luncheons to the glory of God and the honour of Australia to the best of my ability, although my achievements fell far short of what could probably be done by some of those The way gentlemen of rotund abdominal capacity whom I see before me. If the H i g h Commissioner is to be censured, pay h i m a decent salary. If he fails in his duties, turn Commissioner, him out and appoint some other man; spends but no man can serve Australia as it in London Canada should be served and move as a figure Our High Commisworthily representative of this great country at the salary which we pay. If Speaking from an I were not a member of the Government I would move that the salary of the H i g h Commissioner be increased by £3,000 to advertise commence with. It is one of the curses advertised, of government that one is hampered continually by convention, and is unable to burst through the coils of red-tape that hamper him. I come now to the staff at Australia House, apart from the H i g h Commissioner. Isi t contended that the salary paid to Mr Shepherd is too high? Ifnot, what are the items of expenditure For the that we are to cut down? I desire the Committee to tell me. I have come fresh from London, where it was my unpleasant duty to reduce tlie expenditure in one Department by £3,000; I did it by a summary announcement that the number of employees should be reduced by 50 per cent., and the salaries of the remainder by 50 per cent., before 2 o'clock. And it was done. work like that, I found I had exhausted the possibilities. One cannot continue all day "" sacking "" people in that reckless fashion, and if I am asked what items of this expenditure are to be cut down, I say frankly that I do not know. But I have every confidence in the ability of Mr Shepherd to administer that Department. We are sending to London as High Commissioner a man who has been amongst us for a lifetime, and, as an indication of his capacity to administer his Department, honourable members propose in anticipation of his arrival to reduce the estimated expenditure by £10,000. no doubt, they will censure him if he does not succeed.. That is not the method to adopt. If we are to have a High Commissioner at all, let him be paid a salary compatible with his position. We hear a good deal about reducing salaries. No doubt that is a very fascinating pastime when it is applied to other people. have known lawyers to denounce extravagance, but I have never heard them say one word about reducing their fees. That comment applies not only to the profession of the law, but also to that of medicine. We are waiting for those halcyon days when the doctor will lie down with his patient-no , I withdraw that-whe n medicine shall be without money and without price, but that day. is not yet. Let me point out to the Committee that the cost of living in London is much greater than it is in Australia. A public servant in this country is much better off than a public servant in Australia House at the same salary. Indeed, a man can do better on a salary of £1,500 in Australia than he could on a salary of £3,000 in London. If honourable members see an item in regard to which they desire information, and that information when given is not satisfactory, let them deal with that item; but when they tell me to cut down this proposed vote by £10,000, I say candidly that I do not know where to start. the responsibility of interfering with a Department over which the High Commissioner presides. If we have confidence in the appointee we should allow him to administer the Department and make such suggestions for a reduction of expenditure as he thinks proper. If he But having done a morning's is not capable of doing that, he certainly ought not to have been appointed. are ninety-two persons employed this year, as against twenty-three last year? sons fewer this year than there were last year. cost of living bonus as much this year as it was last?

The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has referred fco My chief complaint is against the fact thafc money authorized to be spent last year has been exceeded, and for this Indeed it seems reason he says he will support an amendment to reduce the total vote for the to reduce the vote by Office. But there are many causes which have led to increased expenditure during to the last few years. There is, for example, the high cost of living. Last year we Last year we voted voted £7,000 to pay the cost of living bonus in London, but our expenditure in expendithis direction was actually £11,973.

In respect of those two items we have additional expenditure amounting to £8,000, which no GovernIf ment could have avoided.

258,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nthat has now been done. Mr Shepherd states that, generally speaking, the result of the re-organization will be the grouping of the staff of the High Commissioner's Office proper on the entrance floor, with the administrative staff on the first floor. I turn now for a few moments to some remarks made by the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell). The honourable member directed ' attention to two items on page 30 of these Estimates. The first of these, item 7, "" Cost of living bonus, £10,700,"" is in excess of the amount voted last year, but is £1,273 less than the actual lump-sum reduction. We have just apexpenditure for last year. It has already been explained that although there is a reduced staff the Whitley scheme is now in force, and, consequently, the living bonus covers a wider range. The honourable member went on to point to an item in the same subdivision, "" Temporary assistance and typists."" in respect of which £1,000 was voted for 1920-1921, whereas the amount actually expended was £10,677. The honourable member asked what guarantee we had that the same thing would not occur again. The explanation is that the item, as originally submitted to the Treasury, provided for an expenditure of £10,000, but that a. prudent Treasurer cut it down to £1,000. That vote did not enable us to pay the salaries of the officials, and, therefore, £10,000, as originally estimated by the Department, had to be expended. The answer to the honourable member's inquiry as to whether the same thing may not occur again is to be found on page 29 of these Estimates, where we have the item, "" Clerks, typists, storemen, messengers, telephonists, and assistants (salaries under £300 per annum), £7,910."" We bave taken that item from the bottom of the subdivision on page 30 and added it to tlie subdivision relating to salaries on page 29, so that the answer to the honourable member's inquiry is that we shall live well within our means, so far as that vote is concerned. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Eenton) asked how many State Agents-General now had their oflices' in Australia House. of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania now occupy offices there, and I am in communication with the Government of Queensland and Mr Hughes. the Government of Western Australia, who I hope will also come in. I do not know that there is any more, information that I can give the Committee. If there is I shall be pleased to supply it. I hope the Leader of the Country party will accept the suggestion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If there is any item to which he wishes to direct our attention let him do so. We shall look at it carefully, and if we can effect a' saving in respect of it we shall; but we cannot take the responsibility of making a pointed a new Secretary to the High Commissioner, and a still newer High Commissioner. Both these gentlemen Ave must assume to be competent. We know them very well. Something has been said about Mr Shepherd, but nothing against his capacity as an administrator. He is a very capable administrator. I do not know any one who can administer a Department better than he can,. He produced to me, while I was in .London, evidence of very substantial reforms in Australia House. The discipline, for instance, is far better. I dp not profess to be a martinet, but I like discipline, and want to see every one working. On many occasions I went through Australia House at most unearthly hours in the morning, and I was going to say that, to my horror, I found all the ofiicers at work. I think honourable members may safely leave these Estimates as they stand. I give them the assurance that the High Commissioner will be ready to supply Parliament with an annual report which will set out fully information on those points upon which they desire to be informed. I shall supply him with a copy of the speeches made during this debate, and will ask him to take particular note of the wishes expressed by honourable members.

Personally, I have not seen Australia House, and, like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), I do not like, in such circumstances, to talk too freely; but if I had seen it, and had' travelled from the top to the bottom, I sliould certainly be able to say how many stories there were, even if I had viewed the building at an "" unearthly"" hour in the morning. Australia House is too elaborate; but, with the faith I have in the future of Australia, and knowing full well the importance of our being well represented and advertised overseas, I think that it should be elaborate and worthy of this great Commonwealth. Certainly, the kind of representation that we have had in the past, with a number of "" tin-pot"" Agents-General scattered about Victoriastreet, is not the right kind of representation. These Agents General compete one J against the other, not only in the matter of immigration, as I mentioned last night, but in other matters. competition in London amongst the States in the sale of their primary products; Victoria competes against New South Wales, and so it goes on all round. That state of things ought to have been swept out of existence long ago. Australia should do as Canada does-spea k with one voice in London. Whilei t is not within the province of this Parliament to sweep the Agents-Generals' Offices out of existence, I believe that if the peoples of ' the various States knew what has gone on, they would take that step now.

At the same time, I hope the proposal of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) will be agreed to, leaving the details to those administering Australia House.

We have learnt from the Prime Minister that one of the essential qualifications for the There is Australian representative in London is that he shall be a great gastronomical expert. Apparently, the reason for doubling the salary of the Official Secretary is to compensate him for the impairing of his digestion, as a result of his representative duties. The discussion, so far as it has gone, has shown us that those representatives of Australia who are most intimately concerned with Australia House know least about it . We had an illustration here to-night in the guessing competition as to how many stories there really are in the building.

We now can understand the resentment with which the Prime Minister cabled to h i m of the resolution carried by the Country party urging his immediate return, even if it be true, as the right honourable gentleman said, that in Australia £1,500 is worth more than £3.000 in London.

If Australian representation in London is to be made effective, the expenditure must be increased rather than decreased. are parsimonious in dealing with* that office, we shall derive no benefit from it ; relying upon a Pelman-frained memory, but if it is to achieve what this Parliament desires it to achieve, we must face the prospect of it becoming more costly. I hope the amendment will be withdrawn; but, if it goes to a division, I shall vote with the Government. fact that I have recently been in London, and have had an opportunity of seeing Australia House and what is taking place there, compels me to say a few words in regard to the amendment. In the first place, I should like to clear up a little misconception as to the actual load of expenditure we are carrying in respect of Australia House. The actual cost of the building has been. £1,000,000, and I think the Committee is under the impression that Australia is at the present moment carrying a dead-weight debt of £50,000 in respect of interest on the capital cost. But the Prime Minister has correctly pointed out that ah income of £23,000 from rents goes a long way towards offsetting the interest bill. borne in mind that Australia House accommodates a great number of the activities of the Commonwealth. Attached to it is a very large Customs Department, which occupies a certain amount of space; a buying branch for all the different Departments in Australia, particularly the Department of Works and Eailways; a branch of the Defence Department, engaged in clearing up war records, graves, and other matters; and a branch of the Navy Department. These different branches inside Australia House occupy a good deal of floor space, and by a bookkeeping entry they are assessed as paying £33,000 per annum in rents. I i we had not Australia House and bhese branches sought accommodation elsewhere, we should still have to bear the greater part of that expenditure for rents. We are carrying some dead-weight debt from year to year in respect of interest on the capital expenditure of £1,000,000, and the cost of upkeep, but it may be fairly estimated as being not more than £20,000, and possibly less. I went all over Australia House, and I think I can clear up the uncertainty which seems to exist regarding the number of floors. I do If we not speak with the same confidence as did the honourable member for Wimmera, who, or something of the sort, said that if he were shown tlirough the building he would be certain as bo the number of floors, but my recollection is that there are six floors above ground and two below, making eight in all. The actual activities of Australia House are very great, and it is well to remember the detail work that has to be done. There is, for example, a branch of the Customs Department. We have passed a new Tariff, and very stringent provisions have been made in regard to invoices, the declarations that are to be made on them, and the details that must be given to enable goods to be cleared into Australia. * That throws a very big burden of work upon the London end of the Commonwealth Administration. The greater number of the clerks employed at Australia House' are engaged in clearing up the aftermath, of the warfinalizing war records, the identification and marking of graves, and other matters affecting the Australian soldier. The third big department in the building is It must be the buying branch of the Works and Railways Department. That department carries out very big works in accordance with the Estimates approved by this Parliament, and a great deal of the purchasing of material has to be done in London. That, and the buying for the Department of the Navy, is controlled from Australia House. These activities must involve a certain amount of expenditure, and absorb some of the money which the Committee is asked to vote.",63,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises

273,Mr Brtjce (Flinders) [9.35],"Th eIn regard to the representation of Australia in London and the benefit likely to accrue from it, it is a little difficult for me to deal with this question, because, in my opinion, there is only one factor that counts in the least, and that is the personality of the High Commissioner. Commissioner, a man who can appeal to the imagination of the English people as the Ambassador of Australia in the heart of the Empire, he will become known from one end of England to the other, and will have a great influence in forming British opinion of the Commonwealth. Another side of this representation is in respect of the city of London itself. Por the future development of Australia we shall require to raise money, and to that end make people interested in the Commonwealth, and have such faith in its future as to invest their money in it. Apart from that, there is the fact that many of Australia's war loans and other loans fall due between now and 1930. If we have a really good, strong man representing us in London, one who can state Australia's case, conwnce the British people of this continent's unrivalled potentialities, and assure investors that a good investment is offered to them,, and that their money will be safe, we shall have no trouble in renewing our loans. say that a really first-class representative in London during the next few years could probably save Australia millions of pounds in connection with the renewal of loans, underwriting conditions, and, conceivably, also the rate of interest. If we have a really good High Commissioner, the advantages of Australia House and the importance of its activities cannot possibly be over estimated. other hand, if we have a weak man who, does not truly represent Australia, every House other for the detailed work I have mentioned, would be absolutely wasted, but I venture to suggest to the Committee that with the possibilities we have in Australia, it is worthwhile to take the risk. right man now-in regard to him, I say nothing and that in future also we shall have the right man. If that should be so, Australia House will justify itself, and be well worth the expenditure we are incurring in regard to it. Mr Bruce. Turning now to the detailed management, there must be economy if we are to have true efficiency, and there are considerable signs that the affairs in Australia House are being put in order. Reference has been made to the scattering of the offices over If we have a first-class High the whole of the floor space. That is a bad way to work any office, but the more serious aspect of it in this case is that in this way floor space which has a very great rental value is unnecessarily occupied. Rents from such space, if occupied by tenants, would contribute considerably towards a reduction of the standing charges. I went through Australia House, but I was not one of those who went there to reform it , although I think the occupants had rather a grim suspicion when I first appeared that I was another of those people. I may tell any honourable member who may be thinking of visiting Australia House that he may expect to be looked upon as another visitor sent to put the place in order. I had noi such task, nor have I the ability which some persons seem to possess of knowing whether a place is efficiently managed by merely putting one's nose in at certain doors. I do not know whether Australia House is or is not properly run, though I understand that they are drawing the DepartI am prepared to ments closer together, and are doing away with much waste space. I had ? many conversations with Mr Shepherd, then Acting High Commissioner, who went to Geneva with pie. He is undoubtedly very desirous of putting the place in order, and of organizing it on an efficient basis. For the comfort, of the economy party here, I may add that the impression left on my .mind by my conOn the versation with him was that they need not fear reckless expenditure or over staffing, but that it is more likely that penny spent on Australia he may carry his instructions too far, than that necessary and stint the expenditure needed for the proper discharge of the functions that Australia House is established to perform. It has been suggested that part of the Let us hope that we have the saving of £10,000 might be made by reducing Mr Shepherd's salary. The, question of personality should not be introduced into the consideration of this proposal. I am clearly of the opinion that to get the sort of man we need for the job with which the Secretary is faced, which means the controlling of all the detail work under the High Commissioner, leaving that functionary free to give his mind and attention to matters of general policy and the larger questions of administration, we must pay afc least £2,000 a year. may nofc be thought from what I have said that I cast any reflection on Mr Shepherd. I had close personal relations with him during a period of five weeks at Geneva, and as I said the other day, no one could have given me more loyal and continuous support than he gave. He did everything in his power to assist me in the work to be done. His position in regard to the Geneva Conference was an extraordinarily difficult one. nofc ask to be sent to Geneva, but was told to go there, and, being a civil servant, he had to go. When I met him in London after I had received my appointment, he greeted me Avithout the least sign of offence; indeed, I can say that he seemed extremely pleased that I had been appointed, and he did everything he could to put me in .touch w it h the questions with which we had to deal. As to the suggestion thafc this vote should be reduced by £10,000, I say that it would be grossly unfair to the new H i gh Commissioner to let him arrive in London to find thab he must at once set about reducing his expenditure by that sum. I do not think that the reduction could be made without completely destroying the present organization. The total vote for Australia House is just over £60,000, of which more than £27,000 goes in upkeep, leaving about £33*000 for financing the various activities of fche place, including those of the various Departments that I have mentioned. vide for fche Navy officials, the Works and Railway officials, and the Military officials, all of whom are paid for out of other votes the subject before commencing these remarks, and was told that that was nofc so, though having seen something of the activities there, I am inclined to think thafc they can not all be charged against Australia House. Indeed, I cannot conceive how these activities can be carried on for an expenditure of £33,000, and therefore I am a l it t l e doubtful of ' m y information. Certainly, if fche amount available were reduced to £23,000, the [52S] position would be hopeless. Eveni f the staffs that have been mentioned are charged to other votes, which I am inclined to think must be the case, notwithstanding the answer given to my question, I am still of opinion that £33,000 I hope that it odd is not too much for the running of Australia House generally. If it is properly run, every penny of the vote we are discussing w ill be needed. Amendment negatived. Proposed vote agreed to.

Division 23 (Immigration), £88,000. stated last night when, speaking on the item in the schedule to the LoanB ill for providing for the passage money of immigrants, it is my intention to vote against the amount now before the Committee. I do not intend to repeat the able arguments which were used then by members of the Labour party for opposing expenditure on immigration at the present time. I have only to say that we are of the opinion that, as the number of unemployed in Australia to-day is so great, and as land is not being made availaible for those who desire to settle on it , it is not in the interests of this country that we should spend money on immigration. [9.56] -This vote is to be spent not on a scheme for settling immigrants, or for providing for their absorption, but merely to pay salaries, office accommodation, publicity costs, and the like. Last night we were asked to vote £162,000 towards the cost of passage fares for immigrants; and, comparing this vote with the item in the LoanB ill that we were then discussing, it w ill be seen that for every £ 1 spent in assisting immigrants to come here we are asked to pay l is . for publicity and administration, a disproportionate amount. I say again to the members of the Corner party, who' appeaT to be on a campaign of economy, that this is expenditure which cannot be justified. I have no objection to the bringing out of the proper kind of immigrants, if provision is made for settling them when",64,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises

I would like some information in regard to the exact way in which this money is to be spent in Londoni n connection w it h immigration. I believe in immigration, but only in accordance wibh a settled and well defined policy. A year ago, Lieutenant-Colonel Amery, who was then Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, pointed out that the proper place for the expenditure of money upon immigration was in Australia in making preparation for the thousands of ex-Service men who would be available to come Instead of here if that work were done. In fact, he said very definitely that, unless this preparatory work was undertaken, the Overseas Association would, not be willing to recommend the despatch of immigrants to Australia. In the circumstances, I would like the Minister to explain what is to be done with the £83,000 we are needs immigrants of the asked to provide on these Estimates for Some such system must attracting immigrants. I would like to if we are not to know the exact nature of the London the end at which we are activities.

278,J3ut I Am Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [10.3],"ister and Attorney-General) [10.8] When we were discussing the provision of £162,000 on the Loan Estimates, for passages for approved immigrants, I spoke at some length on the immigration' policy of the Government and explained that, as the result of an agreement arrived at between the State Premiers, a year or so ago we had substituted unified control for that futile heptarchy that governed, or misgoverned, this important activity to which the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) referred last night. It was agreed that the Commonwealth should take control overseas of immigratftm, and he charged with the duty of advertising Australia and securing and selecting suitable immigrants and providing for their transport to Australia. In their turn, the States were to deal with the immigrants at this end. The Commonwealth agreed that it would only accept as many immigrants as each State indicated it could absorb. I said yesterday that the numbers which the States had expressed their willingness to receive was so disappointing that the Commonwealth Government felt it their duty to point out the need for doing something more. The difficulty to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr He is a most competent man, and honCharlton) alluded last night-the question of what is to be done with immigrants Avhen we get them here-wa s considered at the last Conference of Premiers, and it was agreed that the remedy would he to deal with the whole question in a comprehensive way. Hence the resolutions to which the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has referred. So much for the policy. I now come to the machinery by which we are endeavouring to give effect to it. We have created in England an organization which is most efficient. There is now only one authority representing Australia and advertising it. It appoints agents all over the United Kingdom, and canvasses among likely immigrants, determining their suitability and arranging for their transport. When I was in England, I satisfied myself that the Department was carrying on its work efficiently. We are providing £48,000 on these Estimates for salaries, administration, and other expenses in London. We are also providing £40,000 for salaries, administration, and other expenses in Australia, the complementary half of the complete organization. The London office is under the control of Mr Percy Hunter, a most competent man, with wide experience of immigration under the New South Wales Government, a journalist of great experience and a man of tremendous energy, possessed of great powers of organization. Mr Hunter has a competent staff under him, and is carrying on his work well. If we are not getting more immigrants it is not because we cannot get them, it is because the States are not in a position to absorb any more. We could double, treble, or even quadruple, the stream at any time; but it would be useless to bring out people unless the States were ready to receive them. On that account a new agreement has been arrived at with the States, aud it is hoped that this will enable us to receive that great stream, of immigrants which is only waiting the opportunity to come here. The organization at the Australian end is under the control of Mr Gullett, a man with wide experience, who was a journalist and afterwards a war correspondent. orable members can satisfy themselves as to what is being done by going to him direct ancl asking him for information, which, I am sure, he will be glad to give to them. There has been established a New Settlers' League. The movement has been taken up by representative citizens all over Australia, the object of the League is to prepare the way for settlers, to welcome them, to assure them they are not strangers in a strange land, and that they ""have come amongst friends, to aid them to secure employment, and generally to create in this country an. atmosphere favorable to the immigrant, and to get into touch with employers, particularly those in the country districts, who need labour. I am satisfied that the work of immigration has been carried on well, and I invite honourable members who have any criticism to offer of the organization in London or in Australia to let me know that to which they take exception, so that I may be able, if possible, to answer it, and if not, to put matters",67,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises
279,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minright. I can give the Committee, if it desires, a statement of the items which go to make up the expenditure of £40,000 on the Australian organization. In the first place, we have salaries amounting to £6,500. The principal salaries are those of the Superintendent, Mr Gullett, £1,500, and MrE . N . Robinson, £ 7 5 0. This officer is responsible for the preparation of samples, advertising matter, cinematograph films, lantern slides, photographic plates, articles for. use abroad, and so on. Then we have the salary of the Immigration Officer, Mr Fullagar, who receives £ 6 0 0 a year; and the Secretary and Clerki n charge of records, who receives £ 3 4 5 a year; £1,300 is provided for temporary assistance, £256 for office requisites, and £1,457 for travelling expenses. There are also items relating to records, postage, telegrams, furniture, telephone services and petty cash, an item of £5,000 in respect of organization for the New Settlers League, and £2,200 for freights and charges on material forwarded overseas for exhibition purposes. All these go to make up the total of £40,000. In London there is a very extensive organization and a numerous staff. Honourable members' may think thafc a man and a boy oughfc to be able to do the work. On one of my bad mornings I perhaps expressed the same view, bufc I have satisfied myself that it is wrong. I am convinced that the ofiice is carrying out its work well. Much depends on the success of the scheme to secure immigrants, and we must be prepared to pay for ifc. The amount of fche proposed vote is small compared with the immense sum that w i ll be spent if the Premiers of the States agree to the scheme I have suggested. All have expressed their willingness and anxiety to fall in with it . A l ready we are negotiating with the Premier of Western Australia, and fche honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) is acting as an intermediary. I am hoper f u l that before long we shall have a concrete scheme, so that we may be able to bring in new settlers in a steady and ever-increasing stream. of the Immigration Officei n London come out with each ship-load of immigrants? I am informed that it is proposed that that shall be done. reason why I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) whether an accredited immigration agent came out w i th each party of immigrants was that in 1911, when I had fche good fortune to visit London at fche time of fche Coronation celebrations, I visited the Crystal Palace, where the various Dominions were then making what showing they could to in duce people to emigrate. Canada, South Africa, and our sister Dominion of New Zealand made a splendid display. I , with other Australians, was naturally interested in ascertaining what Australia was. doing in this respect. To our dismay we found that the exhibit in the Australian building was f a r from what it ought to have been. As a matter of fact, 'so little of its floor space was utilized by fche Commonwealth exhibit that one of the largest furniture houses in London was given permission by the officer in charge to place its exhibits of f u r n it u r e in that building in order fchafc the empty space might be filled up. I felt keenly on the subject, and in company with several other Australians waited on Captain Collins, then Secretary to the H i g h Commissioner, and told h i m what we thought of what had been done. H is excuse was that the High Commissioner had only a limited amount of money placed at his disposal hy the Australian Government, that there was a wool exhibition at Roubaix, and that such money as had heen made available had largely been spent there in proving to the French and other Continental wool-buyers what we could produce in the way of wool. it is regrettable that Australia should have been so poorly represented at Crystal Palacei n the great year of 1911. There was a scenic railway running around tbe grounds, its object being to give tbe people an idea of what was to be seen when travelling through the Dominions. I boarded the train, and remember well what I saw when T reached that portion of the route that was given over to Australian scenery. There was a mural painting depicting Burke and Wills dying in No t at. present; but the Australian desert!

284,Mr Bayley,"An excellent one, butshowed the landing of Captain Cook. That was an historic pageant showing a number of Australian blacks mingling with a crowd of British marines. Oh the vessel by which I returned to Australia in 1911 there were about 250 passengers in thc third class. One day the captain informed me that some of the passengers had suggested that I would be a suitable person to tell them something of Australia. I agreed to do so, and repeatedly after dinner I would go to the third-class dining saloon, and, standing on the table, would speak to these men and women of things Australian. They were very anxious to know what sort of a country it was to which they were journeying. They had been handed pamphlets such as were so aptly described last night by the honourable member for ""Wimjnera, but of the actual conditions obtaining in Australia they knew little. They wanted to know, amongst other things, wha,t was the cost of clearing land. tioned, me on that subject, and I pointed out to him that we had mountain, plain, and scrub lands, and that it was necessary that he should be more specific. Strange to relate, he then asked me whether I knew anything of the district of Cooyar, where the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) had a farm at the time. I knew the country, and could give him some idea of the cost of clearing the land there. Honourable members will now understand why I asked the Prime Minister whether on each vessel bringing immigrants to Australia an accredited agent of in o'ne or other of our great cities, and the Department would be placed. It may not be feasible to send an officer all the or its possibilities, but information such way out from England, and possibly an officer of the Department in London would not be in touch with conditions existing here. that the Australian Immigration Office should co-operate with the London office, and that officers should travel from Capetown to Fremantle, or, in the case of vessels coming out vid Suez, from Colombo to Fremantle, and should be provided «with the latest infordeavour to make it a country where immation. tions existing in the various States, and should be able to advise an immigrant whether he should land at Fremantle or come on to Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane.

I hope that if the matter has not previously been considered, attention will be given to it by the Prime Minister and those who are connected with the Immigration Department. ister and Attorney-General) [10.27] I quite agree with the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley). The information I have obtained from Mr Gullett is that it is proposed to do what the honourable member suggests. A great deal will depend upon the officer who is sent out with immigrants. When I was returning from the Old Country a few weeks ago, I had an opportunity of speaking to 1,100 men, women, and children in the third class. They asked me to talk to them, and I was glad to tell them what I knew concerning this country. I told them, not of the Australia of which we read in books, but of the real AusOne man questralia. I told them that a man could be very hard up here; I told them how hard up I had been, and what, in my opinion, were the opportunities for a person who was prepared to work. I found those people were very ready to listen, and I think it did them good to be told the facts concerning this country. I shall take an opportunity of discussing this matter with Mr Gullett. My own opinion is that everything depends on the officer who is selected to travel with the immigrants. There are men who have lived in Australia all their lives, but do not know Australia. They have lived only know nothing of the country's vastness as the honourable member has referred to is invaluable, and I shall do what I can to see that it is supplied. I object to the proposed expenditure of £88,000 on advertising Australia for immigration purposes. If we were to devote our activities to an effort to make this country what it ought to be for those who live in it to-day-if we were to enThey should know the condimigrants on arrival would have reasonable opportunities-ther e would be no need to spend £8,000, to say nothing of £88,000 on advertising it.

We have no guarantee, however, that the arrangement contemplated will ever he finalized, and I have no doubt that if we vote this money, all of it, or some of it , will be spent before the end of the financial year. My attention has been called to the fact that £162,000 is to be spent in assisting immigration at £38 for each immigrant, which means 4,200 persons, and, in order to obtain these, we are going to spend £88,000 in advertising. I am sure that if an advertising agent went to a business man with a proposition of that kind he would be promptly turned down. I rose more particularly to protest against one phase of immigration. The Prime Minister has told us that there is an organization known as the New Settlers League in Australia, which is being subsidized by the Government to the extent, I believe, of £5,000. Does the Government exercise any authority over the personnel of the League? Prom what I see in New South Wales and other States, it is mainly comprised of gentlemen whom I suspect to be anxious for cheat) labour. I notice that some in New South Wales are advocating a scheme of immigration on the Canadian system, that is, to give a company authority to construct a railway and to take alternate blocks for immigrants along the route. used to get cheap labour here, in view of our Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. ing the Government of assisting any movement with a view to cheap labour, but status is being given by the Government to people who advocate such schemes. I remind honourable members that Sir Joseph Carruthers, in New South Wales, has a wild scheme for the immigration of 1,000,000 farmers, who are to be placed on farms at £32 each. That is not the sort of proposition to put before immigrants. I men who comprise the New Settlers League being permitted to dabble in our immigration policy, because I suspect that they are only acting in their own interests. The Prime Minister mav talk of the Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts; but if the labour market becomes glutted, aud we have tens of thousands, instead of hundreds, of unemployed, these Boards and Courts will prove to be of very little avail. I wish it to be clearly understood that whatever my suspicions are of the New Settlers League, I do not accuse the Government of any desire to participate in any sinister movement. For the reasons I have given, I shall oppose the spending of every penny on immigration until the people already in Australia are given employment, and those who desire land have it provided for them. I cannot allow the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) to go unchallenged. There is no idea of bringing immigrants and putting them on land costing £32 per acre. any such idte; I was speaking of a. scheme in New South Wales involving £32 a farm. have 419,000,000 acres of land, of which no less than 400,000,000 is still Crown lands. It is not as if these lands were held by large holders, for much of it is not utilized at all. When I was in the Queensland State Parliament I asked how much land there was in Queensland untenanted, and I was told that there was then 137,000,000 acres. It was only by inducing squatters, whose tenure had just ceased, to go on to these untenanted lands further out at a small rental on thirty or forty years' terms, that the land could be utilized; and the land these squatters left was cut up into 10,000, 20,000, and I am not accus30,000 acre blocks, which were quickly taken up on lease by others. There are large areas of land in Queensland the leases of which are nearing termination, and there are millions of acres the leases of which have already terminated, and are held under occupation licence. Years ago in Queensland, 20,000 and 30,000 acres, and in some instances, 100,000 acres, were cut into farms, and reserved for immigrants, who were given at first object entirely to the gentleassistance up to £800 each, but which was subsequently increased to £1,200, on the basis of £1 for £1 on. the first £200 they spent on improvements, and, after that, 15s. in the £1. The men who took up those lands all did well. In my own electorate there are 13,700,000 acres, large areas of which have been selected by the second and third sons of Victorian",70,Poster Th E A U D I T To The Unsatisfactory Position Which Arises

291,Mr Gorser,"In Queensland wefarmers, whose efforts are meeting with great success. There is oue country industry in Queensland of which very little is known in other parts of Australia. The Queensland Government have distributed sufficient seed to plant 40,000 acres of cotton alone, and at the present time there are over 20.000 acres planted. The cotton crops in America and elsewhere are practically a failure, largely beCommonwealth Lino of SteamersI ask cause in America they are attacked by a kind of worm; and I may say that the wages paid in America for picking cotton are just as high as the wages paid for agricultural work in Australia. I am sure that in Queensland large numbers of immigrants could find employment in cotton and maize growing, and dairying, if . a proper arrangement were made by the Commonwealth Government with the State Government, to throw the land open for selection, and have it ready for the new arrivals. Canada people cannot work on the land foT five to seven months out of the twelve on account of the snow, whereas in Queensland work can be carried on from one year's end to the other. If thc plan adopted years ago in Queensland were now followed, and experimental farms established, the new farmers would be able to get all the necessary instruction, including the purchase of stock. There is room in that State for thousands and tens of thousands of people in the dairying industry, and' in ootton and maize-growing. On the Upper Burnett thcro are 4,000,000 acres available, and this years for settlers. quired is a reasonable arrangement . with the State Government. The great drawback is that for the last four or five years the State Parliament, instead of granting freeholds, _ have insisted on the perpetual lease' system, which is greatly objected to, because it means periodical revision of rents, which may be based on the return a man ia making out of his hind, so that those who work the hardest might be the most penalized. This has retarded the progress of Queensland; but, as I say, all that is necessary is some arrangement with thc Governments on terms acceptable to both vendors and purchasers. Proposed vote agreed to. Progress reported. [529]2 Thut the House do now adjourn. regard to the next items on the Estimates Commonwealth -Shipping and whether it is proposed to go straight on with them, or whether it will he possible to proceed with the other Estimates, which it is urgently necessary we should pass. I suggest that honourable members ought to have time to fully debate the difficult shipping matters without holding up the rest of the Estimates. The request that has been made means a lot to very many workmen. Two ships are to bo built at Cockatoo Island, and In many parts of the Prime Minister said recently that he did not feel inclined to prooeed with them until the House had come to a decision with regard to the policy of shipbuilding. stances, it is not fair to the men employed at Cockatoo Island, to tie up these works indefinitely. The shipbuilding policy should be discussed at onoe, and a decision reached thereon. I think I may fairly ask that this discussion be proceeded with to-morrow, so that if the House decides to proceed with the construction of these ships the men concerned may have employment. All that is reister and Attorney-General) [10.46] There is something in what the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) says. I suggest that we compromise by postponing the consideration of the shipbuilding proposals to-morrow, and proceeding with those of the Treasurer. We can then discuss the shipbuilding policy on Tuesday. The discussion of this matter could not be concluded to-morrow; it will probably occupy more than one day. Mimster promise definitely that the discussion on shipbuilding w ill be reached on Tuesday?
