Adermann) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. the Prime Minister with regard to the recent increase of the basic wage decided upon by the Pull Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I understand the position to be that the matter may come before the Court again in the event of delays occurring in the fixation of a date for the application of the general principle to particular oases, and that under the present law it oan only be dealt with by the three judges who comprised the Full Court. In view of the fact that leave of absence has been granted to Chief Judge Kelly owing to his regrettable illness, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Qovernment is considering what steps can be taken to enable tbe court to exercise its jurisdiction as a Full Court until Chief Judge Kelly resumes duty? right honoraible gentleman has mentioned has already engaged the attention of the Government. I had a preliminary discussion with the Attorney-General last night, and my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, has been in touch with the Solicitor-General on the matter. Tihe necessary steps, one way or another, will be taken. asked the Treasurer whether under his budget proposals he would consider allowing the cost of surgical boots as a deduction for income tax purposes. Do the deductions which he proposes to provide for in respect of amounts paid for medical and surgical appliances include amounts paid for surgical boots? the surgical boots are prescribed by a legally qualified medical practitioner. 1",8,Setup

If so, can he give any reason why such .an inquiry should not be held in public seeing that a similar inquiry in the United States of America was held in public? If he agrees that the inquiry should be held in public, will he ensure that the date and place of any inquiry regarding any particular station, or group of stations, shall be adequately advertised so that the public will be apprised of the matter? sinister, as the honourable member appears to have suggested in the question that he has asked, about the inquiry that is being conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board into the power of commercial broadcasting stations. The inquiry was in progress when the Labour party was in office, but it had not proceeded very far when this Government came into power. I instructed the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to continue the work. The matter is completely open. Certain broadcasting stations want to increase their power but certain others do not want to go to tbe expense of installing tbe transmitting equipment that would be needed if their power were increased. The board has its technical advisers on the job. The inquiry is of a completely technical nature and there is no need for a public investigation. However, I hope to make a statement to the House about any power increases that may be granted and about the general situation .as soon as the inquiry has been concluded. tion to the Prime Minister concerning a leaflet that I received yesterday. In fairness to His Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament, and in particular to the honourable member for Melbourne, will the right honourable gentleman have inquiries made ahout the author of the leaflet and its defamatory character? The leaflet is headed, ""Labour' Leaders' Drop the Mask "", and it goes on to sayA few secret conferences, a few fl,000's changing hands-bi g business tycoons promising rich rewards . . . and the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party meets again to prepare a sell-out on the Communist Party Dissolution B ill , about which it had already made a decision only a few weeks ago. . . . But in order to serve tlieir wealthy masters, these men must continue to deceive the workers. Hence their mouthings about "" Labour principles"", "" Socialism "" and "" freedom "". understood, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, you had ruled previously that honourable members must not give information under the pretext of asking a question but must seek only to elicit information. point of order is correctly taken. I have allowed the honourable member for Riverina to quote sufficient of the pamphlet to explain his question but be may not proceed any further with the quotation. Minister have inquiries made about the author of the leaflet and its defamatory character? not know whether I will do so or not, but if the honourable member will let me have a copy of the pamphlet I may perhaps add it to my large and growing collection. the Minister for Supply to make available immediately a substantial quantity of .303 cartridges for the destruction of emus in tbe Northampton, Yuna and Upper Chapman districts in Western.Australia? For the benefit of the Minister, I point out that this area is on the fringe of the agricultural belt and repeatedly at this period of the year it suffers from an influx of emus, which cause great destruction in crops. Residents of the area are suffering from such an influx now and have no means at their disposal to destroy the pest.

The honourable member brought this matter to my attention some time ago, and I certainly shall do what I can to help. There are stooks of .303 ammunition that are not suitable for ordinary military use because the cartridges are some years old. Those stores are under the control of the Minister for the Army, and I shall confer with him with a view to ascertaining whether it will be possible America or from other parts of the dollar to make some of that ammunition available for the purposes that the honourable gentleman has mentioned. I shall inform him of the result of those discussions as soon as possible. Health inform me whether the Department of Health is at present engaged in the production for the medical and pharmaceutical professions of (1) hypnotics, (2) narcotics, (3) anaesthetics, (4) analgesics and (5) anthelmintics? If it is so engaged, will the right honourable gentleman inform me of the extent of its operations? What biological research is being carried out by the department into the cortone and cortisone groups of medicine ? that information for the honourable gentleman. Health inform me whether it is a fact that pensioners are entitled to free medical attention as well as the provision of free drugs? Is it also a fact that many doctors who administer free drugs to pensioners charge 2s. 6d. for each injection? I am pleased to say that all doctors are not making that cbarge. Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House and the public of tbe true position regarding the supply of drugs and the provision of medical attention for pensioners ? sioners are entitled to receive only the same benefits as those available to the rest of the community, but negotiations which are now heing conducted and which will, it is hoped, be concluded in a week or two should result in free medical treatment and medicine being provided for pensioners on a generous scale. reply to a question which I asked him a few days ago, said that no funds for our dollar loan would be used tc pay for the importation of additional quantities of newsprint from the United States of area. Will the right honourable gentleman now inform me whether it is a fact that quite a number of articles which were formerly purchased from Australia's ordinary dollar allocation are now being paid for from the dollar loan, and whether our normal dollar allocation is being used to pay for the importation of increased quantities of newsprint from dollar sources ? ber's question is based on wrong premises, because no part of the dollar loan bas yet been used, and the Government does not intend that such funds shall be expended on the purchase of other than capital goods. answer the question which has been asked by the honourable member for Yarra. honourable member had asked whether any funds from the dollar loan were being used for the purchase of goods that had previously been bought with funds from our ordinary dollar allocation. able gentleman whether additional dol-' lars were being used either from the dollar loan, or from our normal dollar allocation for the importation of newsprint. commodities in the dollar area come within the ordinary dollar budget that was determined by the previous Government. the Minister for Supply is prompted by a statement that has been made to me by the secretary of the Taxpayers Association of New South Wales in which he",14,Ammunition

It was reported that this transfer would be made after the successful conclusion of the United Nations' action in Korea. If the statement is correct can the Minister say whether the military commitments of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific sphere will be increased as a result of the American decision, and, in particular, whether Australia and New Zealand will he called upon to assume a larger share of responsibility for security in that region? MrM c BRIDE I have not received any information of any plan made by President Truman and General MacArthurf or the transfer of American troops from the Pacific, but the Government is in constant consultation with the British and American Governments concerning the over-all position of world defence, ancl I have no doubt that the matter mentioned by the honourable member will be discussed at a later date. requested by an association of blind persons in Victoria to inquire from the Treasurer whether, under his budget proI am grateful for the posals, blind pensioners, whether married or single, will continue to be granted the concession that now applies to them in relation to permissible income.

It is clear, therefore, that any reflection that was intended to be made on the primary producers of this country by the statement of the honourable member for Yarra is refuted by the statistics of production that I have cited, particularly as the big increase of production disclosed in those statistics was accomplished with approximately 58,000 fewer men on the land. for Works and Housing say whether any provision has been made, in connection with the importation of prefabricated houses, that will enable ex-servicemen to obtain such houpes under the war service homes scheme, or whether it will be necessary for ex-serviceto adopt 405-line definition for the promen to othain such homes through a State authority? If no such provision has been made, will the Minister examine the possibility of having such homes imported so that ex-servicemen will have the same opportunity to obtain them as other people have? fabricated houses are being imported by and for the State governments, and come within the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, under which a minimum of 50 per cent, of them are to beallotted to ex-servicemen. apply to South Australia ? to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, but does not operate under it. In actual fact a considerably greater percentage than 50 per cent, of houses is allocated to ex-servicemen. That figure applies to South Australia just as it applies to every other State. The majority of the prefabricated houses being imported by the Australian Government are being made available to the armed services and public servants who must be provided with accommodation by reason of their particular occupation and location. The bulk of the houses are made available for the bousing of essential officers, instructors and other personnel of the permanent armed services. The honourable gentleman will realize, therefore, that ex-servicemen generally will share to a great degree the privilege of being able to obtain prefabricated houses. Postmaster-General a question relative to television.

It is very difficult to answer a question without notice when one is being interrupted in the deliberate fashion practised by the honourable member for East Sydney. In reply to the honourable member for Moore, I might say that the Governnient is very concerned about the jute position but the situation is not yet desperate. The Jute Controller, Mr J. A. W. Stevenson, arrived in India on the 10th October, I. think, and is negotiating directly with the Indian jute mills. Large shipments of jute are on the way to Australia. Further quantities will be consigned within the next few weeks and it is anticipated that Mr Stevenson's efforts will result in the supply position being very much eased and in the requirements of the growers of Australia being fulfilled. degree of their fault or negligence.

In the past the Auditor General had a discretionary power to surcharge, but owing to an unfortunateand apparently mistaken amendment of the Audit Act by the Chifley Government in 1948, he is now obliged to surcharge the whole value of the damage or loss to the persons responsible, regardless of the absurd position is recognized by the Auditor-General himeslf.

He said that some of those ships ran in ballast and not in cargo on part of their trip, and he suggested that, in the light of information that had heen supplied to him, there was evidence of an attempt on the part of shipping companies to injur e the government shipping activities. A t my request, the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and On the 12th OctoTransport (Senator McLeay) has inquired into the matter, and I am now able to inform honourable members of the circumstances. The reason why such vessels carry so little cargo on the outward run from Melbourne is that whereas "" E "" class vessels and two vessels of the Union Steamship Company make, between them, from eight to ten trips a month, approximately only 800 tons of cargo is available for shipment each month from Strathan to Melbourne. Vessels engaged in this trade cater primarily for the carriage of pyrites that are used in the manufacture of superT h e recent accident to phosphate, and the vessels are worked so as to give the maximum possible movement of that cargo. Pyrites is discharged at Yarraville and the "" E "" class vessels frequently complete their discharge in one day and are able to commence the return journey the same evening. In order to load return cargo they would be obliged to wait t ill the following day. In that event the ships would have to proceed up river to a new berth to load the cargo, or shippers would be required to send the cargo to the Yarraville berth. Shippers are not always prepared to do that. An important factor which influences the carriage of cargo to Strahan is that comparatively large quantities of explosives must be lifted. As navigation regulations prevent the "" E "" class vessels from carrying explosives they must be lifted by Union Steamship Company vessels. Those vessels have no magazines",19,Royal Australian Navy

The vessels then proceed to the explosives anchorage in Port Philip Bay where the explosives are loaded. Where circumstances warrant, the "" E "" class vessels carry small quantities of general cargo but they, and also Union Steamship Company vessels, on most occasions sail empty from Melbourne owing to the limited cargo offering for Strahan. Cargo is carried in about three vessels each month and for the reasons I have given one Union Steamship Company vessel lifts the bulk of the cargo offering. The Australian Shipping Board is well aware of the position, and in appropriate circumstances it arranges for some cargo to be carried on the Commonwealth "" E "" class vessels. This practice is the same as that which was in force when the previous Government was in office, and I am glad to be able to inform the honourable member that the anxiety of his informants is not justified. WOOL SALES DEDUCTION (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1950. That leave be given to bring in a bill for Provision will be made in the regulations an act to provide for the collection and recovery of amounts payable under tlie Wool Sales Deduction Act (No. 1) 1950, and the Wool Sales Deduction Act (No. 2) 1950, and for the application of those amounts. Bill presented, and read a first time. [11.12] -by leave I move That the hill be now read a second time. This bill is introduced for the purpose of providing the machinery and procedure for collecting amounts which will be payable to the Commonwealth in respect of wool sold or exported after the 28th August, 1950. A proposal now before the House provides for producers of wool to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation an amount equal to 20 per cent, of the sale value of wool sold by them. It also provides for producers to pay to the Commissioner 20 per cent, of the appraised value of wool exported by them after that date. The purpose of this bill is to set out the method by which those amounts should be paid to the Commissioner. It is proposed that in any instance in which wool is sold to-morrow, or after to-morrow,, through a wool selling broker, the broker should deduct 20 per cent, of the sale price from the proceeds and pay that percentage to the Commissioner and not to the producer. On and after to-morrow,, when wool is sold by the producer to a dealer, the dealer will be required todeduct 20 per cent, from the sale priceand pay the amount to the Commissioner.. Amounts that are paid to the Commissioner in this manner will be regarded ashaving been paid to him on behalf of the producer. The bill, therefore, provides that when sucb amounts have been paid to the Commissioner by a broker or a dealer, the producers concerned will not be required to make a direct payment to the Commissioner. In the case of a producer who exports wool for sale abroad he will be required to make a direct payment to the Commissioner of 20 per cent, of the appraised value of the wool. The appraised value of the wool will be fixed by the Australian War Realization Commission. whereby a producer may make an arrangement with the Commissioner to defer payment until he receives the proceeds from the sale of the wool. The producer will receive a wool deduction certificate from the wool-selling broker or the dealer for the amount which has been deducted from the proceeds of his wool. He will receive a wool deduction certificate from the Commissioner for the amount which he has paid to the Commissioner in respect of wool which he has exported. Wool deduction certificates will be forwarded by the producer to the Commissioner with his income tax return for the yea in which the subject ,> wool was sold or exported by him. These certificates will be applied by the Commissioner in payment of tbe income tax which is payable by the producer on the income of the year concerned, and the Commissioner will refund to the producer any excess over the amount of tax payable. In other words, the procedure to be followed by producers and by the Taxation",20,Shipping

76,Mr Fadden (Mcpherson,"Treasurer )Branch in relation to wool deduction certificates will be precisely the samo as the procedure which has been followed for many years in relation to group certificates which employees receive for deducto administration and other provisions tions made from tlieir salaries or wages. A producer who has sold his wool since the 28th August, 1950, and has already received the proceeds will be required to make a payment of 20 per cent, direct to the Commissioner. Likewise, a producer who has already exported wool for sale abroad since the 28th August will be required to pay the Commissioner 20 per cent, of the appraised value of that wool. In these cases, also, the producers will receive wool deduction certificates from the Commissioner and will be given credit for those certificates in the manner that I have already explained. Provision has been made in the bill to exempt any sale of wool where the sale price does not exceed £20, This has been done to avoid collecting amounts from a person who sells the wool from a few pet lambs. The bill makes provision for cases of hardship. not be another tax on the producer. I Where the Commissioner is satisfied that hardship exists, he will he empowered to permit a producer to use his wool deduction certificates to pay any tax already due by hini instead of holding the certificates to pay tax which will be assessed to him at a later date. There is a further provision under which a producer may appeal to the Land Valuation Board established under the Land Tax Assessment Act against any decision of the Commissioner under this hardship clause. It is proposed that the Commissioner shall register every person who buys wool frpm a producer and every person who sells wool for a producer. Thus, all wool dealers and wool-selling brokers will be registered. A registered person will make deductions and will be authorized to issue I commend the bill to honourable memwool deduction certificates. He will not, however, be required to make any deduction wben purchasing wool from, or selling wool for, another registered perexcess of a taxpayer's obligations? son. In this manner, the procedure proposed in the bill will ensure that, when an amount has been paid to the Commissioner in respect of any wool, no further amount will be deducted from the sale of that wool. A registered person will, after assessment. the end of each month, remit to the Commissioner the amounts deducted during the month and will send with the remittance a copy of every wool deduction certificate issued by him during the month. The bill also contains provisions relating which are to be found in the various acts wbich provide the machinery for the collection of amounts payable to the Commissioner of Taxation. This measure is part of the legislation designed to give effect to the intention of the Government, as expressed in my budget speech, to restrain the effects which the excess purchasing power flowing from higher wool prices would have on the national economy. The extent to which those higher prices will affect the economy will be evident to honourable members when I say that the taxable income of wool growers in 1950-51 will approximate £380,000,000, an increase over the 1949-50 incomes of approximately £157,000,000, and no less than fifteen times the incomes of 1945-46, wbich were £25,000,000. As I have already explained, this will emphasize that fact because the Government's proposal has been misinterpreted in some quarters. The amount which a producer is required to pay is merely a nayrnent towards the income tax and provisional tax that he will be required to pay under the existing laws. The laws relating to income tax and provisional tax are not affected by these proposals. The bill will give effect to an arrangement for earlier payment of taxes, and will apply to wool producers a principle that has been applied for the last nine years to 2,500,000 salary and wage earners. The measure is not intended to be permanent. It will be continued only so long as the economic circumstances of the country render it either necessary or appropriate. bers. me what will become of deductions in funded. adjourned.",21,Second Reading

The first reference that this Government has decided to give to the Public Works Committee is in respect of a work in the constituency of the honourable gentleman who happens, for the time being, to be the Postmaster-General. The statements by the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar) about the provision of increased telephonic facilities in his electorate are equally true of every electorate in the Commonwealtli. The Postmaster General's Department, over the years, has had a big programme of works which it has attempted to complete within the limits of the man-power and materials available. However, quite a number of places are equally as important as Lismore, and the House is entitled to know how many more proposals of a kind similar to the one now under discussion are to be referred to the Public Works Committee. I s there a list of such works, or are the extensions to the telephone exchange building at Lismore tbe only project that is contemplated? If there is a list will it be made available to the Parliament? If the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Casey) decides to withhold it from honourable members, the present proposal must be regarded as peculiar and it is not to the credit of the Government that it is pushing the interests of one member of the Cabinet who, apparently, is not expected to be a member of the next Parliament. The expenditure of public money in particular electorates for the purpose of trying to popularize an honorahle member or a Minister, and to assist the fading fortunes of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party, is not in the best interests of the nation. I hope that the Minister for Works and Housing, who has submitted this proposal to the House, w ill give us more information about it , and will not expect the Parliament to register its approval without the fullest discussion. One Minister has already won an unenviable reputation for refusing to give information about his policy. The honourable member's remark is quite outside the terms of tbe motion. comment is germane to the terms of the motion. The Ministerf o r Health( Sir Earle Page) has refused Works and Housing is following in the footsteps of the Ministerf o r Health in refusing to give to honourable members all the information that they require about a governinent proposal. I hope that the House w ill not agree to the motion until it is given all the details that have been sought. [1.1.30] -The Minister for Works and Housing (M.r. Casey) has merely submitted a motion the purpose of which is to refer a proposal for extensions to the telephone exchange at Lismore to the Public Works Committee. The attitude which has been adopted by the Opposition members to the proposal makes it necessary for me to remind them that the three political parties in this chamber are represented on that committee, which has to submit its findings to the House. I believe that it is proper that the Parliament should be asked to refer the proposed work to the committee. The time for Opposition members to make complaints is when that committee furnishes its report to the House. Their suggestions that the proposal is sinister and underhand because the proposed work would be carried out in the electorate that is represented by the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) arecompletely without foundation. Opposition members should have sufficient f a it h in their own representatives on the committee to believe that its report w ill be proper and in the public interest. oppose the motion. It appears to me to be sinister indeed that the Ministerf o r Works and Housing( Mr Casey) should submit it , when the work is definitely a part of the programme of the Postmaster General's Department.

The matter under discussion comes properly under the administration of the Minister for Works and Housing. and more important than Lismore have been waiting for many years for improved post office buildings, and the provision of suitable telephone exchanges. I have made representations to successive Postmasters-General for 21 years for a modern post office at Maitland, which is a big centre. The post office of the important town of Cessnock, which has a population of 25,000 persons, is located in an old cottage. The population of Maitland is even greater than that of Cessnock. Newcastle and the surrounding districts have a population of approximately 250,000 persons, and various centres in that area urgently require improved postal facilities. Some sense of proportion should be observed in the allocation of works by the Postmaster-General's Department. The little one-horse town of Drysdale, in the electorate of Corio, which was represented by a former Postmaster-General, has a. post office that is considerably larger than proposal to enlarge the telephone the Newcastle post office. Why has Lismore been awarded tbe honour of having a larger telephone exchange building? Does"" L is "" want ""more""? I do not know. Evidently she is going to get more. It is tragic, that the electorates of Newcountry areas, I point out that the resicastle and Hunter, and the new electorate of Paterson, which includes Maitland, are denied adenuate postal and telephonic facilities. Maitland still has a pre-federaPostmaster-General's Department as they tion post office. Whenever honourable members have made representations to successive Postmasters-General they have received, regardless of their political views, a stereotyped reply that has become so familiar to us all. The writer, the letters invariably state, regrets very sinchance of obtaining telephone communicerely that the applications for the installations of telephones cannot be granted. That remark is quite outside the terms of opposite. tbe motion. able member for Darling that this important subject should be referred to the Public Works Committee for a complete investigation. motion is to refer the proposal to the Public Works Committee. quiry should be made into the whole subject before this particular proposal is approved. I know of many towns with larger populations than Lismore which have post offices that are much more inadequate for local requirements than is the office at Lismore. Eor instance, although Newcastle has high civic status and its city council is presided over by a lord mayor, it cannot obtain a new post office, or even adequate postal or telephone facilities. I oppose the proposal to erect an extension of the telephone exchange at Lismore unless the Public Works Committee inquires into other localities where the need is probably more urgent. I deplore the remarks made by tbe honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) and the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) concerning tbe exchange building at Lismore. Although the honourable member for Darling had something to say concerning the provision of better postal and telephone facilities for people in remote dents of the far-flung electorate of Leichhardt, wbich I represent, have never received such excellent service from the are now receiving. Metallic telephone circuits-have been discarded and replaced by new copper lines, and new post offices have been built or are in course of erection.

Although the honourable member for Corangamite McDonald), who is a member of the Public Works Conimittee, said that the committee would scrutinize the proposal most carefully, he did not furnish any information to enable the House to compare the postal needs of Lismore with those of other large towns, such as Maitland, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). People in the electorate that I represent, in common with people in all other electorates, are demanding better postal and telephone facilities, and whilst I am anxious that more capital expenditure should be undertaken by the Postal Department than has been undertaken so far, the Government should make a fair approach in assessing the relative merits of the large number of projects before it. I remind the Government that many thousands of people are anxiously await-* ing telephone connexions, and many of them have been waiting for years.' I know one applicant wbo has been waiting for six years. ment was in office J Government was in office during the greater part of that time, but it had a programme of postal works to implement.

In particular, I desire to know whether the proposal to extend the telephone exchange at Lismore, which is in the electorate of the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), was included in the programme prepared by Labour and approved by the Parliament. Will the Minister inform the House whether the Lismore project is being undertaken in its proper order in the approved programme, and also whether the expenditure of such a large sum of money as that proposed will interfere with the provision of facilities that are more urgently needed in other parts of Australia. Is it proposed to expend similar large sums of money on major works projects for the department in otber towns, or is the Lismore project merely an isolated one? After all, the expenditure of approximately £150,000 on the extension of the telephone exchange for a town the size of Lismore suggests that the new building will be somewhat palatial.

WhilstI have no detailed knowledge of the works priority list for the Postal Department, I should imagine that the proposal to enlarge the telephone exchange at Lismore has prohably been "" on the stocks"" for some time. Apparently the sole cause of all the criticism that has arisen is that the new building will be erected in the electorate of the Postmaster-General. I should imagine, however, that any suggestion that this project is being expedited by the present Minister so that he might obtain some improper political advantage from it . is negatived by the proposal to refer it to the Public Works Committee in the ordinary manner. Honourable members are aware that all political parties are represented on that committee, and that the report and recommendation of the cominittee on this project will be placed before the House in due course. Apparently members of the Opposition have not much confidence in their representatives on the Public Works Committee, and perhaps their lack of confidence is the result of the unhappy situation in which the Labour party finds itself to-day. Notwithstanding its endeavours to "" oust the Government"", to borrow a phrase from the honourable member for Melbourne should get back to the motion. the motion, and I hope that the honourable member is enjoying what I have to say. All that the motion proposes is that the project to enlarge the telephone exchange at Lismore shall be referred to the Public Works Committee. That is the procedure normally followed with any projected work, and, as I have said, I am amazed that members of the Opposition should endeavour, by innuendo, to impute ulterior motives to the Postmaster-General. I say emphatically that the present Postmaster General is a worthy successor to Senator Gibson, who held that office some years agoand did more to improve the postal facilities of this country than any other holder of the office has done. register my protest in connection with this matter. I do not intend to do any backslapping. I contend that at this particular period, extra postal facilities should not be provided at a country town called Lismore, when there are large industrial areas in this Commonwealth, particularly in New South Wales, that contain huge factories that employ large numbers of men, yet lack any telephone facilities. worry about Maroubra or Botany. members opposite calling day after day for more production. The honorahle gentleman must confine himself to the subject of the motion before the House. He will not bc allowed to discuss the merits of every other place in Australia. The question before the House is whether this proposal regarding postal facilities at Lismore shall be referred to the Public Works Committee . or not. for the very reason that this matter is to be referred to the Public Works Committee. The lack of telephone facilities in other parts of Australia is great. Botany, which is one of the biggest industrial areas in New South Wales, is suffering from a lack of telephone facilities and for that reason men will not work in factories in that area, I am sticking to because they know that in case of accidents there would be no means of communicating rapidly with doctors and ambulances. Factories in that area which employ 60, 70 or 80 men are without telephone facilities, and it is a public scandal that the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has a colleague who was willing to submit a motion connected with a proposal that is designed to aggrandize the Postmaster-General in his own electorate and thus ensure his re-election at the next general election, which, incidentally, will not be long in coming. It is scandalous that a country town should be given precedence over huge industrial areas. That is why I",26,Committee

The proposal to extend that aerodrome could have been interrupted as an attempt to improve the position of the honourable member for Maribyrnong in his electorate. would have been on all fours with the interpretation that the Opposition is placing upon the proposal to extend postal facilities at Lismore. I say to honourable members opposite that it is a bad show that, when a proposal is submitted by a Minister, inferences of some sinister intent are drawn from it. I consider that if the tone of debate in this House is to be improved the employment of such tactics should be taboo. -When the honourable member for honourable member for Canning( Mr of the function of this Parliament. The Hamilton) advanced as a defence in this matter, the argument that the proposal that is the subject of the debate will be referred to the Public Works Committee, as if that were a sufficient answer to the questions asked by the honourable member for Darling( Mr would be allowed to pass unnoticed and Clark), they were endeavouring to pull the wool over our eyes. Nobody is arguing, so far as I am aware, that extensions to the telephone exchange building at Lismore may not be justified. Quite likely they are completely justified. The very essential point that is being made by the Opposition is that telephones and postal works are justified in every part of this continent. In every part of our rural areas there is an urgent need for telephone works to be carried out, and the answer continually being given by the Postmaster-General's own department is an admission that these works are necessary. An answer signed by the Minister states that, unfortunately, because of the shortage of materials, labour and essential equipment, it is not possible to carry out those works, which he admits are urgently necessary in many parts of Australia. The Public Works Committee has no opportunity to decide what ought to be tbe priority in the carrying out of works of this character. That matter is decided by the department that is presided over by the Postmaster General himself. Therefore, is it not legitimate to inquire whether works of this character are urgently required in every rural area in the Commonwealth and to seek to learn how it comes about that this, the first work of its kind proSucli an interpretation posed hy the Minister, is to be in his own electorate? The honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) said that it was bad taste to raise a matter of this kind. He said that matters of this kind should be taboo in bhe Parliament of this nation. I suggest that exactly the reverse is the proper parliamentary practice. Any action by a member should be open to the most searching public inquiry in this House. It is proper that when there is a question that affects the administration of a Minister which requires an answer it should be raised in this place.' That is not bad taste. It is a proper evercise honourable member for Isaacs is, therefore, completely off the line when he says that considerations of this kind should be taboo in the Parliament. If they were taboo any act of maladministration or favouritism by a Minister in his own electorate unquestioned and that would leave the administration of this country open to the very gravest abuse. No charge has been made against the Minister. A question bas been asked and, on the facts submitted, there is a definite case for the Mimster to answer. On the facts submitted there is definite evidence that favouritism is being extended to the electorate which the Postmaster-General happens to represent. The Postmaster General may haye a complete answer. If he has, the House is fully entitled to ask him for it and to put forward, as the honourable meniber for Darling has done, the facts in relation to the matter, particularly as this is occurring at a time when the Postmaster-General, through his departmental officers, is tightening up all expenditure on postal and telephone services throughout Australia.",28,Committee

I could take up the time of the Public, Works Committee by referring to it for investigation aud report works proposals in relation to dozens of post offices in all parts of Australia but, in the meantime, the people who need those facilities would be left without them and the cost, would be going up. In this instance, I have asked fche Minister for Works and Housing to present to the Parliament the Only project that I have submitted out of scores and, because it is in my own electorate, these innuendoes have been made. As the honorahle member for Isaacs asked, is it to be expected that, because an honourable member happens to be raised to the position of a Minister, his department should do absolutely nothing in the electorate that he represents? The Postmaster-General's Department has a schedule of hundreds of works which are listed in an order of reasonable priority. not whether a particular work should be number 51 or 52 hut, insofar as it is possible to determine the relative urgency of those works, they have been listed in order of priority and this project at Lismore has had the highest priority in the documents of the Postmaster General's Department for a very long -time. When all is said and done this matter is being referred to an all party committee, the Public Works Committee. It is for that committee to decide whether any undue favouritism is being accorded and whether the work is justified. It will report to the Parliament when it has reached a decision on the matter. I oppose the reference of this matter to the Public Works Committee because of the very reason suggested by the Minister, namely,-that it is only one proposed major work out of many hnndreds required throughout the Commonwealth. I believe that the motion should be amended to provide that all works of a major character shall be referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report before being carried out by the Postmaster General's Department. know Lismore perhaps as well as any honourable member here. Lismore has a population of approximately 14,000 and has as good a postal service as has any other town in Australia. That service may be improved by making minor extensions to bhe telephone exchange building, but when the industrial value of Lismore is compared with that of Wollongong and the great industrial areas of the Newcastle district, such as Cessnock, Maitland and Kurri Kurri, one will understand why Lismore should not be given priority over such industrial districts. The executive officers of major undertakings in the Newcastle area for years have been unable to get telephones. Why should this matter be referred to the Public Works Committee when other matters are so greatly in need of attention in the Newcastle district? There is a great co-operative organization in the Newcastle area which has a turnover of £1,500,000 a year. The general It is manager of that organization has not possible to determine exactly been able to get a telephone for three years. The member for Hamilton in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly has also been unable to get a telephone. The bonorable member cannot discuss all postal activities in this debate"".

I propose to moveTliat the following words be added to the motion:-""and such other proposed extensions included in the programme prepared by the Postmaster-General's Department for increased poet office facilities in every part of Australia "".

If the Public Wr^rki Committee is to inquire only into tha Lismore work, the industrial development of this country will be retarded. Onr. hoi-anse people cannot get telephones. An example of that may be found among transport workers. Men living from 10 to 20 miles from their work must be ready t.o attend for work at an hour's notice. It is necessary for such people to have telephones, but it is not so necessary for the people in the Lismore district. For years the Merewether area has. been promised a telephone exchange, but sis yet there is no sign of its being built. The Minister should amend the motion to provide that the Public Works Committee's investigations shall be so extended as to embrace the whole of Australia, and he should ensure that the work that is most important and necessary shall be carried out first. If the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) had had available to him the time properly to consider the terms of the amendment that was handed to him and which he moved, he would not have moved it . His amendment completely negates thc.case that he and other honourable members of the Opposition have been attempting to sustain in this discussion.

The Government deserves commendation for the work that it has done since it has been in office. During that brief period it has discontinued the rationing of petrol, butter and tea, increased child endowment benefits to the advantage of many families, arranged a dollar loan that will greatly benefit both primary and secondary industries, instituted a health plan that bas been accepted and is helping many citizens, and pressed on with anti-Communist legislation which, although it bas been a contentious measure, is now about to be written into the statute-book. An outstanding measure that was foreshadowed by the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) in his budget speech will increase pension rates. This will be the largest increase that has ever been granted in the history of pensions in Australia. It will involve additional expenditure of approximately £8,775,000 a year. ' The time has come for this Parliament to deal with the subject of pensions on a proper basis. All pensions should have a fixed relationship to the cost of living. Having established the proper ratio, we should declare that there must be an annual review of pension rates for the purpose of maintaining that ratio. Pensions should be divorced from party political issues. We have too often heard political candidates promise the pensioners that, if their party is returned to power, it will increase pension rates. N'o member of any party should use pensions merely for the sake of party political advantage. Tliis Government is endeavouring constantly to stabilize our economy and to assure the people of safety. The basis of increased economic stability must be increased production. National safety is dependent uoon the taking of adequate defence measures and the prosecution of an effective immigration programme. from the Opposition in its efforts to the Government achieve those ends? expect? ber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) could be regarded as one of the "" best-red"" men on the Opposition side of the chamber. We have read in the newspapers that production must be increased if our economy is to be stabilized, but the trade union movement has refused to co-operate. The federal president of the Australian Lahour party, Mr J. A. Ferguson, M.L.C, has declared that that party's help will be absolutely nil. Defence is vital to our security. Yet the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) has refused to help the Government in its recruiting campaign! The point that I wish to emphasize is that the establishment of stability and the protection of the nation are not matters of individual party responsibility. Everybody in Australia is entitled to protection and the benefits of economic stability. Therefore, every member of the National Parliament has a responsibility to work for the implementation of an adequate defence programme and the enactment of such measures as will place the national economy upon a sound footing. Those objectives can be achieved only if all honourable members co-operate. Much has been said in this House recently about inflation. We have been told that we are living in an era of prosperity, but many lionorable members are attempting, without the slightest justification in fact, to convert it into an era of fear and panic. We should have faith in our Government and faith in our ability to help this young country to attain the state of peace and security that is the entitlement of every citizen. Panic and pessimism must be supplanted. Let us take advantage of the many opportunities that are available to us. Members of the Opposition have talked loudly about putting value back into the £1.

The result is that this Parliament has become merely a debating assembly instead of a body working quietly and efficiently for the welfare of the nation. Australia is prosperous and, under wise guidance, it can become more prosperous still. The task of restoring value to the f l must be shared by every bonorable member. This is a National Parliament; it is not a sectional body. The responsibility for -increasing production rests upon every citizen. Certainly it is not the responsibility of the employee alone. The employer also must share in the work of developing the nation, and members of this Parliament must help both worker and management to the best ti their ability. industry and other modern developments that enable us to progress as a nation must be fostered wholeheartedly. Consideration should be given to exempting from income tax all earnings that accrue from overtime work. Great possibilities are inherent in incentive payment systems, which have heen discussed at great length in this House. The all-important point for us to remember is that we must not be sectional in our outlook. Memhers of the Opposition, instead of being destructive in their comments, should do their hest to convert the present era into a lasting condition of true prosperity. They should not try to secure political <rains at the risk of sacrificing the nation's opportunities for development. The health of the nation is of great importance, and the Government could well devote a great deal of its attention to the work of assisting hospitals in all States. Defence, of course, is essential to the protection and upholding of our democratic way of life. importance to defence is health. We should strive to save as many lives as possible. The work of building new hospitals and expanding existing hospitals is being considerably retarded by high costs. Most of our hospitals are suffering from a serious shortage of funds. State governments are not, able to make generous grants to hospital organizations, and therefore a more generous view of their problems should be taken by the Australian Government. parties can find common ground in promoting work of that character. Ifr. Pittard. Another field of activity in which the Government should take a keen interest is that of local government, which is carried on in an honorary capacity by publicspirited citizens in all parts of the Commonwealth. During the last fifteen years, local government organizations have been obliged to undertake, responsibilities that are far too complex and far-reaching to be handled efficiently with the funds at their disposal. At one time, local government bodies were expected merely to look after roads, footpaths, drainage and similar works. Now they are expected to provide kindergartens and similar establishments, carry out survey work, solve health problems and do 1,001 thing? Mechanization of that they cannot do efficiently because of the lack of finance. This Parliament has been generous in its allocations of funds for the' construction and maintenance of main roads and feeder roads. But greater generosity is needed if local government is to carry out its honorary work in a fair and reasonable manner. We should not look upon local government bodies merely as poor relations. We should take them into partnership in the tasks of governnient. If we do so. we shall find that the burden of national administration will be considerably lightened. Both this Government and the State governments will benefit. The Minister for ""National Development ( Mr Casey) is in charge of a vast programme that provides for the expenditure of £250,000,000 on developmental works throughout Australia. Under that programme consideration should he given to the establishment of machinery pools to be administered by eountry roads boards and other recogNext in nized instrumentalities from which machinery could he issued on loan to municipalities according to their most urgent, needs. This would facilitate the carrying out of essentia] works at a minimum of cost. Members of this Parliament can learn a great deal from the administration of local government bodies. Party political dissensions are divorced from their activities. Each local government body has a continuing policy. <This is largely due to the fact All that one-fourth of the number of members of each council must face the voters every year. That system has a great deal to commend it, and it deserves the attention of members of this Parliament. I see no reason why any Government should remain in office for the full life of a parliament without referring its policies to the electors. Each year, a proportion of the membership of the Parliament could go before the public in order t'o liave the policies of the government either endorsed or rejected. I believe that such a system would expedite the enactment of progressive legislation and would have a generally beneficial effect upon the nation. The honorable member for Grayndler (Mi-. Daly) occupied the time of this House last night with a dissertation that lasted for about half an hour and during the course of which he read the election pledges of various political parties. The honourable gentleman would have been much more usefully occupied if he had devoted his time to the reading of excerpts from the various local government acts of the States. I am certain that, if he had to face the electors' once a year instead of at three-yearly intervals, he would devote himself much more assiduously than he does at present to matters of national importance and would be a better servant of the people whom he is supposed to represent. I firmly believe that there is much to commend the system of submitting the policy of the government to the people every year in order to obtain an expression of their opinion. All of us would then be obliged to live up to our responsibilities. Sitting suspended from 12Ji5 to 2.15 p.m. ment has faithfully fulfilled a number of its pre-election promises. It has abolished the rationing of petrol, butter, and tea, and has instituted the payment of endowment at the rate of 5s. a week for the first child of a family under the age of sixteen years. Last May, the Government introduced the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950, and I await with keen expectation the day when its provisions will be enforced against the Communist disrupters of our industries. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party, in their joint statement of policy during the last general election campaign, promised that if they were returned to office, they would sympathetically review pension rates. That promise has been honoured in the Treasurer's budget speech. I advocate that pensions should be reviewed annually and should not be made a subject of party politics for the purpose of seeking to gain votes during an election campaign. I have already emphasized the importance of increasing production, of strengthening our defences and of maintaining the flow of migrants to this country. I deplore the fact that the Government is receiving such little support and co-operation from the Labour party. In these prosperous times, a spirit of optimism should replace the spirit of pessimism that pervades the speeches of many Opposition members. Expressions of fear and even of panic about the value of the f l reflect the wrong outlook. The value of the f l should be treated as a matter of national importance and concern, and should not be discussed on party political lines. In tbe drive for greater production, employees will need to exert greater strength and willpower in their jobs, ancl employers must also play their part. However, production is not wholly dependent uponl their efforts. Every member of the Parliament should share in that drive. By supporting constructive legislation that is designed to meet the position, we shall play our part in that all important matter. A more practical kind of partnership of Commonwealth, State and local governing authorities is necessary. In my opinion additional assistance should be granted by the Commonwealth to the States for the maintenance and equipment of hospitals. Last, but by no means least, I deplore the endless .slurs against character, and the destructive criticism, that emanates from senior members of the Opposition. I am generous enough to believe that their criticism and slurs against the characters of other people are spoken, not with intent, but from habit. However, it is a bad habit, and I hope that the new members of the Opposition will not develop it. We should remember at all times that a large audience listens to the broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament,",34,Deputy Speaker Mr C F
151,Mr Pittard,"The Menzies Governand, unfortunately, many people, when they are asked to describe their reactions to the debates, often remark that they greatly enjoy them. That comment is not flattering. When listeners speak of enjoying the debates, they mean that they derive amusement from the repartee, the interjections and the smart sayings of honourable members. Actually, the general public should get education, and a preview of legislation from listening to the broaddisappointed, because my speech, unlike casts of these proceedings. When all is said and done, honourable members are the repi^esentatives of the people, who should derive, from listening to the broadcasts of the proceedings, a clarification of the details of legislation for the betterment of the community. The purpose of this bill is to grant Supply to the Government for the months of November and December in order to enable it to meet the costs of administration and the other commitments of the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House, and express the hope that it will be passed without delay. I shall now refer to another matter which has become most noticeable in this chamber. Opposition members frequently begin their speeches, not by offering constructive sugduces a photograph of the present Prime gestions, but by decrying the statements of a previous speaker from the Liberal party or from the Australian Country party. They often tend, not to offer cooperation, but to utter thinly veiled threats. They do not speak in optimistic terms, but utter a dirge that falls drearily upon the ears of their listeners. I hope that experience will prove that my assessment of the position is wrong. If the next Opposition speaker makes laudatory references to my speech; if he puts forward a constructive suggestion; if he offers co-operation to the Government and speaks well of our defence programme; if he, having accepted the direction of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, endorses the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950; if he does not make comparison between the membership of the proposed Commonwealth Bank Board and that of other boards, mv statement will be wrong. But if he voices only destructive cr'ticism which is not helpful to the NationalParliament, and if he flouts tbe will of the people hy not assisting the Governor. Pittard. ment to place worthwhile legislation on the statute-book, my assessment of the position will be justified. Having regard to what I have just said I shall wait expectantly to hear the remarks of the next Opposition speaker. [2.24] -The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pittard) will not be his address to the House, will be constructive. is beginning his speech very nicely. begin a speech nicely, and I always end it nicely. I propose to develop a theme that the honourable member for Ballarat hopes I will avoid. I hope to expose some of the false promises that were made by the Liberal party and by the Australian Country party during the last general election campaign. The Government has not even attempted to honor those promises. At the outset, I shall read an advertisement that was inserted by the Liberal party in the daily newspapers in South Australia at that time. It reproMinister( Mr Menzies) and tbe letterpress is as follows:Chifley Government's fake excuse for high prices exposed by actual facts. The biggest single factor in bringing about price increases was the Chifley Government's abrupt and unwarrantable withdrawal of price subsidies and its refusal to grant funds to the States to replace the subsidies. Tlie Liberal party, as soon as returned, w ill take prompt steps along essentially practical lines to remedy the present disastrous position, and will,"" by the encouragement of incentives to increase produetion, stabilize and progressively reduce prices. Vote for the Liberal party and put more value into the £1. I invite members of tbe Liberal party to inform the House whether the Government hag yet taken any action to put more value into the £1. The people are demanding a statement on that matter. One of the main reasons why so many of them voted for the Liberal party or for tbe Australian Country partu at the last general election was that they believed that promise. The people are now keenly awaiting an opportunity to register their",36,Deputy Speaker Mr C F

Prime Minister may ask the Governor General to grant a double dissolution whenever he likes. makes that provision when the Senate has rejected a bill submitted to it by the House of Representatives twice w it h in three months. I believe that the sooner we have an election the better it w ill be for the country. people are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to register their disapproval of this rabble of a government, which has promised to put value back into the £ 1 , and has made no effort to do so. Of course, the Government's hands are tied in that respect, because its masters, who paid its election expenses, w ill not permit it to take the only steps that w ill improve our present economic condition. The Government's political masters, the private banking interests and the capitalist monopolies, which control its purse strings, prohibit it fro m taking the only action by which value can be restored to the £ 1 . The situation has become so bad since this Government assumed office that it will be impossible, in my opinion, for a succeeding government to put value back into the £ 1 . The best that could be expected would be that a new government would prevent a further decrease in the purchasing power of the £ 1 . But this Government cannot even do that, and under its administration the £1 is continually losing value. Stern measures should be taken against those persons who are profiting from the present condition in society. Those measures should include the control of prices and the pegging of profits. However, the Government cannot even consider the reintroduction of prices control by the Commonwealth, because the Liberal party and the Australian Country party persuaded the people to reject the Labour Government's referendum proposals Commonwealth to continue prices control. The Government does not desire to control prices and to peg profits, and therefore, the inflationary difficulties in Australia w ill be aggravated. The Government has not sufficient courage to combat them. Only a Labour government can deal w i th give my reasons for expressing that opinion. A Labour government is the The Constitution only administration that the trade union movement is prepared to co-operate with, and to trust. The Ministerf or Labour and National Service( MrH o l t ) made a statement in the House to the effect that the president of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, Mr Monk, had called upon employees to work harder. I took the trouble to telephone the office of yesterday, and I spoke to the secretary of that body, Mr Broadby, who denied that Mr Monk gave any assurance that the workers would co-operate with the present Government or that his organization would call upon the workers to work harder. The actual text of the statement made by Mr Monk, which was misinterpreted by the Ministerf or Labour and National Service, is as follows:The Federal Government must accept responsibility for preventing an upward, unnecessary increase in prices. Without reflecting on the price-fixing machinery of the States, it is clear that this machinery has nnt. been effective since the abolition of federal price control, and there should now be no doubt of the absolute necessity for the re-introduction of federal price control. This will not be the only measure necessary to he taken by the Government, and either complementary legislation or administrative measures will be essential to meet the economic position of Australia for at least the next twelve months. .Employers must endeavour to re-adjust themselves to the new circumstances, and by improved industrial technique, better handling of supplies, transportation of raw materials, &c, reduce the waste element of time operating in many industries at present in order to alleviate the cost factor in these directions. To workers as a whole we urge that increased production is essential to prevent undue inflation, and to ensure that, :is far ns possible, the increase granted by the court will be n real increase and not a nominal increase.

Furthermore, it would be a traitorous act on the part of any union leader to give any semblance of co-operation to a government such as the present one, which has set itself out to .destroy the trade union movement. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) stated that any worker who hung back in the traces was cheating not only himself but also his fellow workers, and with that statement. I entirely agree. honourable gentleman did not say that a worker should be condemned for adopting that attitude under existing circumstances. Aft e r all, every worker knows that under the existing circumstances any extra effort that he puts forward will result not in any improvement of the standard of himself and his fellow workers but will merely increase the profits of the masters who control industry. that there is a small minority of workers who are not pulling their weight in industry to-day. But is it any wonder that there are a few individuals who adopt that attitude, when they know that the only result of increased effort on their part will be to increase the profits of those for whom they work? ' It is all very well for the Minister for Labour and National Serviee and the silver-tails opposite to speak in this chaniber of the need for increased production, but I should like to see members of the anti-Labour parties go into a shearing shed and ask the shearers to work harder, or into a stone quarry and appeal to the quarrymen to work harder. I should like the right honorahle member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes), who was at one time a Labour Prime Minister, to have the courage to go into the cement works in the electorate that I-represent and tell the workers that they reason why the Liberal party tolerates should work harder. I challenge any honourable member opposite to visit the Nullarbor Plains and tell the fettlers working on the railway line there that they ought to work harder I could name half a dozen other occupations in which the workers are doing a magnificent job. In fact, I point to the production of all heavy industries as proof of the effort put forward by the workers. Consider the output of the men who man the 'blast furnaces at Whyalla. Has any honourable member opposite the courage to go to Whyalla and tell those men that they are not working hard enough? In fact, I should like to see any member of the Liberal party go to Whyalla and work there.

The same position exists in Victoria where a little group of thirteen Country party members is in office, but it is doing a good job in Victoria because it has the support of the Labour party, which is forcing it to enact Parliament is entitled to that some decent legislation.

Another promise that tbe Government parties made at the general election was that if they were elected to office they would reduce the strength of the Public Service. Tbat promise appeared in almost every election advertisement that I saw during the campaign. shortly after the Government assumed office the number of Commonwealth public servants increased by 5,000. When the general eleotion was held in December last year tbe Public Service provided employment for 196,000 persons. The number so employed bad increased to 201,000 in April of this year. Here is what the Melbourne Herald had to say about the dishonesty of the Government parties in this matterI n season and out, while in opposition, the members of the Government were among the most outspoken critics of the extravagant policies of thc Chifley Government which built up Federal activities to drain man-power and money from private undertakings. Prompt reform was promised, but the promise has not been fulfilled. The Commonwealth payroll has grown since the election at much the same rate as it was growing under the Labour party. It has gone up by another Its representation in this 5,000 since the Federal election. I am even given to understand on tenacious, brutal and ruthless reliable information that the Prime Minister's personal staff has been increased by five employees, one of whom receives a salary of no less than fl,000 a year. The Prime Minister needs that staff to do half the work that the Leader of the Opposition did when that, right honourable gentleman was Prime Minister, because he not only administered the Prime Minister's Department but he also carried out, very efficiently, the work of Treasurer.

He is too busy preparing polished and flowery speeches that mean nothing, and too busy doing nothing. Why does not the Prime Min ister, instead of writing out lengthy speeches in flowery language, do something to keep some of his election promises and get down to the job of putting more value back into the £1 so that the working man will be able to enjoy a decent standard of life? Why does he not do something to stop this terrible spiral of prices which will lead to the economic ruin of Australia? Why dees he not do something to prevent another depression? If he does not do something there will be another depression and it will be caused by his own -ineptitude and his failure to solve the problems of the day? Why does not the right honourable gentleman tell his political masters, who control the purse-strings of the Liberal party, that he is prepared to govern in the interests of the whole of the people and not merely for the benefit of the big city interests who pay his election expenses? Until we have a governinent with the courage to stand by its convictions, this country will never get out of the morass in vvhich it now is. Until we get a Labour government with which the trade union movement will co-operate, this country has not » ghost of a chance of avoiding the headlong dash to economic destruction with which we are now faced. I agree entirely with the general president of the Australian Labour party, Mr Ferguson, and with Mr R. A. King and all the other Labour leaders who say that they are not prepared to co-operate with this Labourhating Government which is pledged to destroy the great trade union movement and is out to negative the workers' right to strike. Why should the workers cooperate with this Government? Any trade union leader, or trade unionists who, as an individual, would be prepared to co-operate with his political assassin would be a traitor to the great Australian Labour movement. Lt is patent to me that honourable members opposite are using the debate on this measure as a means to obscure what is happening in another place. They had such a terrible set back last Monday, when the unholy twelve gave them their instructions, that they are finding it most difficult to convince the people that they are still working together in the greatest harmony. 1 lieard one person say to-day that .Labour party members must be very pleased that at least they still have a party. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde. Cameron) referred to the Government as a hater of trade unions, meaning, of course, a hater of the workers. I shall deal with that later. He began his speech by saying that the Government was elected on the main issue of putting value back into the £1, although he knew full well that that was a deliberate misstatement. just a few of the matters mentioned in the policy speech for the edification of the honourable meniber. I hope that he will listen. The Government was elected on three main issues, which were, first, opposition to nationalization and socialization ; secondly, abolition of petrol rationing which was strangling production in this country; and, thirdly, tbe control of Communists. Other issues ware, child endowment, a revised system of taxation, and a dollar loan to assist, national development. What has happenned since the Government was elected?

The honourable member for Hindmarsh has made statements, his authority for which one cannot hazard a guess, to the effect that this Government wants to destroy the trade union movement. I have never heard such claptrap in all my life. If the Government wants to destroy the trade unions, why did the trade unionists put it into power on the 10th December? They put it into power to destroy the Communists. Honourable members of the Opposition are running away. They do not know what to do. The honourable member for Hindmarsh stated that the employment of civil servants by the Commonwealth has increased over the last few months. The total number of employees in the Public Service in May was 157,500; the figure for June was 156,300; and for July it was 155,400, so that the number of Commonwealth public servants is decreasing. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has taken, as the basis for his allegation, the figures for Government employment throughout Australia, including semi-governmental and State bodies. The ranks of Commonwealth civil servants have been reduced over the past few months. On the 17th October, when speaking on this measure, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) said that he had told trade union leaders that it was tbeir talked about co-operation. duty to encourage every worker to do his best because if any member in the community, irrespective of his calling, was not doing his best, he was cheating his fellow countrymen. Since then, the Calwell), who was a Minister in tbe previous Government, has said that he will not encourage co-operation with this Government in the production of goods. enable the Government to check the inflationary spiral and make goods available at something akin to reasonable prices. As his reason for making that statement, the honourable member for Melbourne blamed the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) for coming into this chamber and talking about "" squibbing"" the issue on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and for using some other word such as "" guts"". That word is in the dictionary but the honourable member for Melbourne said that if the Prime Minister used the language of the gutter to honourable members of the Opposition it would be of no use his asking for their co-operation. On the 23rd February of this year the honourable member for Melbourne is reported, on page 70 of Hansard, to have said the honorahle member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) in order in reading from Hansard of the present session? This session started in February and I do not think that we can say that we are in another session yet. -The point of order is well taken if the quotation in question comes from Hansa,rd of the present session. I presume that it does. quoted the page so that honourable members can check for themselves to see whether I am speaking the truth.

He saidWe on this side of the Honse w ill lead their protests in this place, on the streetcorners and in public .places . . . the workers of Australia are not going to be fooled by the flapdoodle and nonsense that has been The honourable member for Canning has said that we should use proper language.

208,Mr Hamilton,"Colin Clark to whicli I have referred. That graph shows that the tonnage per man shift of coal produced in New South Wales mines dropped from 3.51 tons in 1938 to 2.91 tons in .1949. Coal is the hasic commodity in the production of the goods which we require. Honourable memhers of the Opposition, and I am thinking particularly of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), have attacked the Government on the street corners, in the gutters and everywhere else. Instead of attempting to galvanize the people into action to oppose this Government and destroy it, as they said they would do last February, they should go amongst the people and urge them to increase coal production so that steel can be made to enable industry to produce the goods which this country so urgently requires. Only in that way shall we be able to manufacture the goods which the honourable member for Yarra complains are in such short supply. New South Wales is in a somewhat different position .from that of the other States because of recent disastrous floods. Those floods have added to the troubles of the people of New South Wales. It ill becomes honourable members opposite to say in this Parliament, as responsible leaders of their constituents, that they are not going to co-operate with the Government in a drive to increase production. The Postmaster-General has made it abundantly clear that with a force of 58,000 fewer able have wage pegging. bodied workers than before the war, the primary producers are producing moro than they did in the pre-war years and each year their figures are increasing. The primary producers increased the production of sugar from 740,000 tons before the war to 940,000 tons last year. Other comparative figures are-Meat 934,000 tons in 193S to 1,000,000 tons last year; milk 11,000,000 gallons in 1938 and 12,000,000 gallons in 1949.1 say to Opposition members who represent city and suburban electorates, that if there is such a shortage of food in the cities as they claim, then it is up to them as leaders of the people to see that more materials are provided for the men on the land so that they can produce the food required.

The motion was moved by that very dear friend of the honourable member for Melbourne, Mr Lang, who was at that time the honourable meinber for Reid. took the increased salary. the honourable member for Melbourne.

It is the duty of the honourable members opposite to co-operate with the Government, and yet they are doing their best to destroy goodwill among the people and to destroy all possibility of this country being led into better times. draw attention to the fact that the measure before this committee is designed to provide for two months' Supply fro m the end of this month. I take exception to this procedure, because this measure will authorize expenditure on items for which provision has been made in the budget, which has yet to be considered. This procedure is completely unnecessary. Parliament could have been called together a good deal earlier than it was, and the budget could have been introduced and the debate on it completed by the time Supply already granted ran out at the end of this month. action taken by the Government in presenting this SupplyB ill has been quite unnecessary. A good deal of protest should he made about the matter because a good deal has been wrongly assumed by those in authority in order .that they might achieve a certain result. When the Minister for Labour and National Service( MrH o l t ) was addressing the House a day or two ago he made it clear that the SupplyB ill was being presented because of circumstances which have not. materialized. He told us that the Government's plans have been completely upsetHe said that the Communist Party Dissolution B ill was to have been the keystone of government propaganda at an The honorahle election designed to be held before the close of this year. The Communist Party Dissolution B ill has been so much linked up with inflation, and excuses for it , that members on tbe Government side of tbe chamber seem deflated by what has been said hy the Opposition this week. The Communist Party Dissolution B ill was to be used as the keystone of government propaganda at the next election. The budget was to have been presented as another act in the window dressing of government policy to be placed before the people at an election which was to have been held before the end of this year. The present budget may now be implemented before another election can be held. The Prime Minister( Mr. Menzies) has informed the country, through tlie radio and by other means, that he has no intention of allowing the Gommunist propaganda to drop from hi? plans. He has found it too profitable. He said that he has a right to adopt that I attitude beca.use of a statement which was supposed to have been made on behalf of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party. The Communist Party Dissolution B ill now presents a good many difficulties, and honourable members on the Government side are finding them somewhat embarrassing. The measure which has been discussed in relation to inflation i? likely to result in a challenge to the Government through the High Court. If the measure proves to be invalid that w ill greatly embarrass the Government because it w ill lose a lot of prestige.

Now, if the nieasure is held by the High Court to' be valid, the Prime Minister will have his hands full, because he will haye to prove to the people that communism has mighty little to do with inflation. He will also have a lot of selecting to do if the proposed law is held to be valid. That, of course, is a matter of indifference to me. If it is held to be valid, the Prime Minister must determine which union leaders he will select, and then, with the co-operation of the electorate, he must make 9ure that no industrial disputes occur through the application of the measure. Therefore, the passing of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill would cause a good deal more embarrassment to the Government than to any honourable member on this side of the House. The Government, like the man with the wheelbarrow, has the whole job in front of it. The Prime Minister is anxious to use communism for propaganda when he goes before the people, but he will find it most difficult to prove that it has anything ing that the Government should revalue to do with our inflationary trend. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) went to great pains to impress upon his listeners that he has the utmost, disgust for honourable members now supporting the Government who, during the last general election campaign, informed the people that they had a cure for inflation and would be able to put value back into the £1. He said that they hacl acted irresponsibly in making such promises. That is because no plan has yet been produced by the Government which has any likelihood of curing inflation or putting value back in the £1. Apparently, the Government has not even made an analysis of the factors that are contributing to inflation. In view of the promises that the present Government parties made at the last general election, the people expect that the Government will at least provide evidence that those promises were made sincerely and with every intention to honour them. However, we have not yet had any evidence that the Government has formulated a plan to carry out those promises in relation to the two matters to which I Ilr. Andrews. have just referred. Occasionally, as happened when substantial increases occurred recently in the price of wool, we hear panic-stricken cries from Government supporters. In their panic they talked a lot about revaluation of the Australian £1. However, apart from such instances, we have had no evidence that the Government is really concerned about devising a plan to curb inflation. As I said earlier, the Government has merely presented a vote-catching budget in which no indication is given of the methods that it contemplates adopting in order to afford the relief which many people have been led to expect under its proposals. The Government could have indicated that in order to curb inflation it was prepared to follow one of the several courses that have been mentioned during this debate. For instance, it has been suggested that it sbould revalue the Australian £1. member's leader is opposed to revaluation. the £1. I mentioned revaluation as one of several courses that have been suggested as a means by which the Government can curb inflation. At the moment, I am not advocating revaluation. However, it is obvious that the Government should have re-established capital issues control. Supporters of the Government remain silent about that matter. I also raise the question whether the Commonwealth Bank is failing in its responsibility to implement its charter to maintain a stable economy, for we know that luxury industries are being established to the detriment of our economy. Supporters of the Government might give serious attention to that matter. vernment which the honourable member supported do about it? the promises that the present Government parties made at the last general election to put value back into the £1.

227,Mr Andrews,"I am dealing witheconomist, Mr Colin Clark. Has the Government attempted to act upon any of the practical suggestions that he makes in his book entitled Principles of Public Finance and Taxation"" . Dealing with 1 proposals that were, discussed at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers that was held recently in Canberra, Mr Clark said that it was easier to think up attractive ways of spending Commonwealth money than to devise sound projects for which the electors would have been willing to pay. He was referring to the allocation of refunds of income tax revenue to the States. At that conference did the Government seriously consider the schemes that the various States submitted in order to ensure that the money would not be expended in circumstances which would aggravate present inflationary conditions? If the Government failed to examine those schemes thoroughly in that light, it adopted a very casual attitude towards its responsibility. When the Minister for Labour and National Service was replying to the Leader of the Opposition last Tuesday night, he emphasized the degree to which costs were rising, particularly in the building trades. He went to great pains to indicate that the blame for that trend should he placed at the feet of employees, but when he dealt with the responsibility of management he was most casual. He said that the reduction of the working week to 40 hours had contributed substantially to rising costs and that increases granted in respect of holiday pay and sick pay had had a similar effect. He singled out the building trades for criticism because of the acute shortage of houses. He also said a great deal about the alleged unscrupulous attitude of the workers, which he claimed was also responsible for the increased cost of building homes. Significantly, he was guilty of certain omissions which converted his criticism into a grossly unfair attack upon, the workers. Altogether too little has been said about the attitude that management has adopted towards its responsibilities. Very little evidence is available that management is taking its responsibilities seriously. For instance, whilst absenteeism present are such that tradesmen and among employees has been cited as a serilabourers are now taking the initiative in ous factor in increasing costs, supporters smashing inflationary tendencies in the of the Government appear to take the view that absenteeism on the part of managerial personnel is not so serious: Until management stands up to its bargain with the workerswe shall never succeed in increasing production. Appar rently, management is not very much concerned whether that objective is achieved. It is not uncommon for managerial personnel to spend much time on golf courses and race courses, leaving businesses to carry on as best they can. Another contributing factor to inflation for which management must be held responsible is the remarkable degree of competition that has developed between firms and companies for labour. Pirating of labour is so rife to-day that it has led to blackmarketing in wages. Ridiculously higher wages are being offered in more industries than any public man has yet been prepared to admit. In addition, management has made very little effort to introduce labour-saving devices or to perfect business organization in order to offset loss of production due to shorter working hours and the conditions that have been granted under awards by Commonwealth and State arbitration courts. That lack has become most noticeable in recent years. Those who control industry could do very much more than they are doing to stimulate production. Therefore^ those who go to such pains to blame employees for the present inflationary conditions should pause and ask themselves whether they are not placing the blame on the wrong shoulders. When a union secretary refuses to ask employees who are already working to their full capacity to exert still more effort, managements 9eize that fact just as a drowning man will clutch at a straw as one of the causes of under-production. It is clear that if luxury industries are permitted to expand as they are expanding at present, our economy will meet with disaster. When the Government appeals to employees to increase their production, it should be very careful to indicate specifically in which spheres greater efforts can be made. Conditions in the building industry at construction of homes. I know of hundreds of men who have commenced to build their own homes because they cannot afford to pay a contractor to build them at ruling prices. They are doing so in their leisure hours, and in that way they are making a contribution of substantial benefit to the country's economy aa a whole. It is common for bricklayers, tilers, plumbers and carpenters to co-operate in the building of their own homes. That is not an isolated practice. It is being followed in dozens of instances in my own electorate. Those tradesmen and labourers find that they can build homes for themselves more cheaply than they can have homes built rhrough a contractor. Tn most instances tliey can carry out the work at half of what the cost would be on the basis of ruling prices. I am glad that that practice is extending, because those employees, in satisfying their own individual housing requirements, are helping to satisfy the economic needs of the country as a whole. In that way. they are contributing very substantially towards checking t.he inflationary trend in the building trades. I repeat that we have had no evidence presented to us that the Government has examined any specific plan with a view to curbing inflation. What does the Government propose to do in order to stabilize prices? Isi t in favour of prices fixation? Doesi t intend to seek power to control prices? that admission fro m a Government supporter. W ill the Government attempt to control prices before efTect is given to the declaration of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court which w ill have the effect of increasing the basic wage by f l a week? taken to stabilize prices in order to ensure that those entitled to that wage increase w ill really gain some benefit from it? W ill prices be stabilized in order to ensure that pensioners of all classes w ill receive real benefit as the result of the court's decision? Unless the Government is prepared to stabilize prices, the increases for which it has provided in the budget will be more in the nature of a back-handed g if t than a. real g if t . Economists have informed us that ournational income should be doubled, and I assume that supporters of the Government are in agreement with them,, especially in relation to income from primary industries. I think that there was some misunderstanding of the statements that were made on this subject by the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Keon). The honourable gentleman was challenged and asked to name any commodity of which there was a shortageof production. The Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) said this morning in reply to a question that the output of tliree primary products had increased considerably. I do not contend that there is a shortage of primary products now; but we must think of the future.ancl of the demands of our export markets. 1 contend that the challenge of the honourable member for Yarra can be sustained. Figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician show that, although Australia, produced 13,908 tons of butter in 1936-37, our output in 1948-49 amounted to only 13,433 tons. Tbat does not necessarily mean that fewer cows are heing milked or that less work is being done in the dairy industry. However, the facts demonstrate that there is ample scope for an increase of production at least until the output of butter reaches the level of 1936-37. I know people are drinking more milk to-day than they were drinking in 1936-37. Another important, primary product is mutton. Whereas we produced 16,006 tons of mutton in I am glad to have 1936-37, our output in 1948-49 was only 1.4.435 tons. However, the increase of lamb production has offset that decrease. Pork produetion decreased from 3,601 tons in 1936-37 to 2,851 tons in 1948-49. I do not suggest that there is a shortage of those commodities, but the figures supW ill any steps be port the assertion of the economists that we must increase production. I am f u l ly prepared to accent their estimate thnt production ought to be doubled. Satisfactory results can be achieved only if we transfer labour from one place to another. Thousands of immigrants are being huddled together in ho.=tels and camps adiacent to our already overcrowded big cities. I see no reason why",49,Cameeon Mr Acting Yet The Need For Such Co Operation Is To

229,Mr Andrews,"we should not prepare a plan for the -settlement of new Australians in rural areas, where they would have a very much better chance of becoming good citizens quickly than they have when they are herded together near our big cities. Such a. scheme would contribute materially to the establishment of economic stability and an all-round increase of production. It sbould be possible to settle immigrants on blocks of land ten or fifteen acres in area on which they could engage in primary production and in which most of them have some skill. would help to bring about decentralization of industry as well. By implementing such a plan we should be discharging our common responsibility to the nation in three important ways. We should be helping, first, to absorb new Australians into the Australian way of life; secondly, to increase primary production; and third, to give effect to a reasoned plan of decentralization, which all parties consider to be essential to the establishment of economic stability. That is merely one of the plans that the Government could adopt. The suggestion is sound and I hope that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) will be willing to act upon it. It would help him to develop the plan that already has the general approval of the people and it wonld also help the national economy. -We are engaged in a discussion of the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1950, which provides for the allotment of £61,189,000 for the nation's housekeeping. In such a debate we are permitted to speak of many subjects, but I shall refer chiefly to the pronot present before the quorum was formed posed vote of £230,000 for "" the Department of Works and Housing. By comparison with the proposed votes of £27,325,000 for Defence Services and £.10,226,000 for Business Undertakings, that amount appears so small as to give the impression that the Department of Works and Housing is of slight importance. However, that relatively small figure merely serves to cloud the true position. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the Department of Works and Housing is responsible for vast undertakings throughout the Commonwealth, which it performs on behalf of other departments. The amounts proposed to be set aside for those works appear in the Estimates of expenditure for those departments. The amount of £230,000 relates mainly to the salaries of officers and other administrative costs. The department has the responsibility of doing a vast amount of work for the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Air, and business undertakings, such as the Postal Department. This is a young Parliament composed Such a procediire largely of young men with high ideals who are eager to build Australia into a great nation. Most of them have creditable war records and some of them have even been prisoners of war. We are charged with the responsibility of examining the proposed expenditure of government departments with great care, keeping in mind, particularly, the legacy that has been bequeathed to us by the Chifley Government. Therefore, I propose to tell the House of some of the scandalous facts that I have discovered in connection with the Department of Works and Housing since I moved into the COTIIm on wealth sphere from the New South Wales Parliament. The money that is expended by the Department of Works and Housing is provided by the taxpayers of Australia. We must supervise the expenditure of that money with great care, especially at this time of inflation when nny unnecessary governmental expenditure would have a marked efTect upon the cost of living and the value of the £1. \Quornm formed] I am sorry that many members of the Opposition were because I was discussing the scandalous state of affairs in the Department of Works and Housing that was bequeathed to this Government by the Chifley Government. If anything constructive is to emerge from this debate, we must examine all items of proposed expenditure with the greatest care. That duty falls equally upon members of the Opposition, who hope to take over the reins of government again, though it will undoubtedly be at some remote date, if at all, and honourable members on this side of the House. The Opposition has properly expressed anxiety about the cost of living. The",51,Cameeon Mr Acting Yet The Need For Such Co Operation Is To

That is the duty of all governments. I suggest that the Lahour party has helped to cause thc situation with which we are now confronted. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) has said that, according to his ideas, budgets should be planned so that we can pay as we go, meet our commitments as they arise, and put something aside for the future. I am very glad that the Minister for the Interior because his department and the Department of Works and Housing are involved in some of the matters that I shall discuss. irrespective of its political beliefs, toI am sure that all honourable members will wish to scrutinize the Estimates of expenditure for both departments, particularly iu relation to day labour costs.

If I have time between calls for quorums, I shall make some interesting disclosures. A private citizen expends his income with considerable care, and perhaps denies himself some amenities in order to finance the purchase of his home. But the Commonwealth, over the years, has established a system of spending that has produced an impossible situation. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) has referred to day labour, a method of employment adopted by the Commonwealth many hundreds of miles from Canberra. The Commonwealth expects to get a good return from day labour, but fails to provide adequate supervision. Many foremen, engineers, architects and works officers are not delegated sufficient authority by the Government because Government expenditure on public works draws man-power and materials from the common pool, and increases the difliculties of private citizens, who are endeavouring to build their own homes, or of industrialists who are trying to produce the goods that we urgently require.

If the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) discharged his parliamentary responsibility f a it h f u l l y he would endeavour to assist the present Government to clean up the mess into, which Labour got the country. The present unsatisfactory and dangerous economic situation was brought about because, when Labour was in oflice, it thought that it could extract an unlimited supply of money from the people with which to finance its unsound proposals. It thought that the Treasury was overflowing with nioney, and that it could hand out the money as largesse.

I realize that the Department of ""Works and Housing contends that it must erect buildings for other departments, irrespective of whether it can obtain tenders for the work, because the departments exercise pressure on it to undertake construction. But tbe Department of Works and Housing should not allow itself to be pushed round by other instrumentalities of the Government, and if it cannot obtain a satisfactory tender for a particular job it should certainly not proceed with the work by day labour. The employment of men on day labour jobs merely means withdrawing men from the reservoir of labour and worsening conditions generally. If the department finds itself impelled to proceed with certain constructional work it should do its utmost to obtain tenders for that work. If tbe -Government does not clean up the mess in the housing situation left to it by the previous Government, the present deplorable situation in which every one is competing for building materials must continue.

I took the trouble to in the 'United Kingdom, Canada and the check the allegation that the men were Communists and that their names had appeared on a list supplied by the services.

Tbe honourable member's time has expired. Having listened to some of the statements made by tbe honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), I think that I should say something concerning them. He accused the previous Government of having been responsible for the acute shortage of workers' homes that exists to-day. Obviously, the honourable member cannot be as aware as be should be of what has happened in Australia in the last ten or twelve years, because the fact is that since 1930 there has been a tendency on the part of those engaged in building construction to decline to build workers' homes. That tendency was particularly evident from 1932 to 1939, and during the war the construction of home dwellings ceased almost entirely because of the priority given to defence requirements. In fairness to the Curtin and Chifley Administrations, it should be said that in 1945 Labour made agreements with the State governments for the provision of housing, under which the National Government made available the necessary finance and gave every encouragement and assistance to the States, which were the only instrumentalities that could build workers' homes. It is clear, therefore, that it is not the fault of the previous Labour Administration that workers' homes are not as plentiful in this country as they should be. In fact, it can be said with truth that similar difficulty is being experienced United States of America. Some reference should be made to the somewhat startling allegations made by the honourable member concerning certain jobs carried out by the Australian Government with day labour.

275,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [4.20],"happenings on the job, which was being carried out at an undisclosed location. In support of bis allegations, the honourable gentleman said that statutory declarations had been made to him by certain persons who were dismissed from the job. I have had a good deal of experience of workers who have been dismissed from jobs and bave subsequently applied to their unions to bring pressure to bear on their employers to have them reinstated, and I have learned that in many instances dismissed employees make malicious and incorrect allegations about happenings on their jobs. From my experience I know that it is unwise to accept such ex parte statements without first hearing what the other side has to say. There are invariably two sides to every dispute, and it is exceedingly unfair to condemn one side without hearing its case. If the story given to the honourable gentleman by the dismissed employees in the instance mentioned by him is found after proper inquiry to be true then undoubtedly the supervisor concerned deserves the most severe condemnation. However, he should not be condemned until he has had an opportunity to put his side of the case. I listened attentively and with much interest to the speech made by the honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne) last night. In the course of that speech he made some assertions that were so extraordinary that I took the trouble to check the accuracy of tbe information on which they were based. The honourable member said, probably in good faith, that the Australian Labour movement had not attempted to combat communism to the same degree as the British trade union movement had combated it. He inferred that the British trade union movement had completely rid itself of all Communist influence, and complained that the Australian trade union movement had not done likewise. If the honorahle gentleman had taken the trouble to investigate the present position of the British trade union movement he would have discovered that three of the largest trade unions in Great Britain are dominated by Communists. dence that three of them are Communistr.38] dominated, but there are probably more. I have not yet had time to make further inquiries. Tbe secretary of the miners' union, the secretary of the electrical trades union and, I believe, the secretary of tbe Amalgamated Engineering Union are all Communists. Tbe British trade union movement has waged a similar struggle with the Communists to that waged by the Australian trade union movement. The fight in the Australian trade union movement has gone on for years and it has been exceedingly bitter. In fact, the struggle to remove dommunists from office in the trade unions is still going on. In fairness to the trade union movement, it should be pointed out that until the depression occurred, with its tragic unemployment and destitution, there were no Communists in control of any trade union in Australia. The frustration, hopelessness and despair which afflicted hundreds of thousands of our people during the depression disposed them to accept the leadership of those who promised them decent living conditions. Of course, we knew that that promise, like the undertakings given by the dictators in the fascist countries, could not be fulfilled. The fact remains, however, that thousands of unfortunate people were influenced to join the Communist party, and in the circumstances of the time they can hardly be blamed for having done so. The honourable member for Evans also cited Mr Colin Clark, the Queensland Government economist, as his authority for the statement that the increased production per man-hour throughout industry in Australia from 1938-39 to 1948-49, the latest period for which figures -are available, was only 3 or 5 per cent. I think that he said that production increased by 5 per cent., although an article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a few days ago, on which the honourable member's statement, was probably based, stated that the increase was only 3 per cent. The honourable gentleman also made two further statements that are so mutually contradictory that I am forced to the conclusion that either he misunderstood the information on which they were based or that Mr Colin Clark must have completely reversed the views which be held until recently.",57,Cameeon Mr Acting Yet The Need For Such Co Operation Is To

277,Mr Clarey,"I have positive eviThe honourable member alleged that although production in Australia had increased by only 3' per cent., productivity in the United States of America had increased by 70 per cent., in .the United Kingdom and Scandanavia by 25 per cent, and in New Zealand by 50 per cent. If those figures were correct, then certain economic conditions that prevail in Great Britain, Scandinavia, the United States and New Zealand could uot possibly exist. Economists generally have productivity per capita normally increases by 2 per cent, per annum. Obviously, if production in America increased by 70 per cent, in ten years, and the population did not also increase by an equal percentage during the same period, there could be no possibility of inflation in America because the production of goods and services would vastly exceed the capacity of the community to consume. aid? the population a rise of 70 per cent, in production in ten years would not only enable Marshall aid to be given, but also improve the standard of livin g of the American people by almost double in that period. Yeti n that same period when this 70 per cent, increase of productivity allegedly occurred, prices in the United States rose by 68 per cent. It is obvious, therefore that, that greater production is not the complete cure for inflation. As I believe that great production does help to curb inflation despite Colin Clark's inference that an increase of it cannot help us at all, I considered it necessary to check the figures. The first thing that I discovered was that although Colin Clark had stated that productivity had increased by 3 per cent, or, as was given by the honourable member, 5 per cent., in the last ten years, he made an entirely different statement in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court during the hearing of the basic wage case last year when, I understand, he gave sworn evidence. The statements that he made to the court are entirely at variance with the article published under his name in the Sydney Daily Telegraph last Tuesday. I shall quote now from a statement by Professor Benjamin Higgins, Ritchie Professor of Economic Research at the University of Melbourne. He saidNo wholly satisfactory figures of productivity are available for Australia. In fact, it can be said that no country in the world is able to supply wholly satisfactory figures in that regard. The statement continuedHowever, the availahle figures indicate a significant increase of productivity per. manhour over the past two years. The estimates held for many years that of Colin Clark (Table HI ) indicate an increase in real product per man-hour of approximately II per cent, between 194548 and 1947-48, and : an increase of approximately 8 per cent, between 1937-38 and 1947-48. Preliminary figures calculated on the same basis for 1948-49 indicate a further increase in productivity per man-hour during 1948-49. Professor Higgins went on to say-and I consider this statment to be very importantHowever, for the purposes of the present inquiry, the reasons for the measure in productivity are of secondary importance. The main point is that this sample study confirms the general conclusion to be derived from Colin Clark's more comprehensive figures, and from W it h the increase of the figures presented by Professor Copland, which have already been discussed by the Court. Labour productivity, while virtually stagnant during the war, has shown a marked upward trend during the post-war period. The sworn evidence given by economists indicates that an 11 per oent. increase of productivity occurred in two post-war years, witb further increases of productivity being clearly indicated. The increase of productivity in the ten years between 1937-38 and 1947-48, which included the war period, was only approximately 8 per cent. Having demonstrated that, it was a question of ascertaining to what extent the actual productivity had increased in the countries that he had named. He said that productivity had increased in America by 70 per cent., in GreatB r it a in and Scandinavia hy 25 per cent., and in New Zealand by 50 per cent. It is exceedingly difficult;-and I make this statement quite frankly-to secure authoritative figures regarding the production of any country, but it is generally conceded that the productivity figures and other reports on social and economic matters that are issued from time to time by the International Labour Organization are as reliable a guide as can be secured from any part of the world.",58,Cameeon Mr Acting Yet The Need For Such Co Operation Is To

279,Mr Claeey,"1 shall quote now from the report of the to guess to what extent they can be Director-General of the International Labour Organization given to the 33rd session of the International Labour Conference held at Geneva in 1950. In the preface to this report the Director General indicated very clearly to the conthe honorable member has just cited ference that he believed that the major problem confronting the world was that of productivity. A very large part of the report is devoted to that important matter and the Director-General also makes a number of suggestions which he considered might be of assistance to the various affiliated nations in overcoming the diffiattention to productivity. The recordculties of the productivity rate in their own countries. I shall quote from page 79 of the report, from the section headed The Productivity of Labour, in which a table is given on the average output per manyear in industry. That table give3 some idea of the productivity of the various nations that are associated with the Interand group together the hours of producnational Labour Organization. It takes the average production for the period 1935 to 1938, and gives it an arbitrary index number of 100. The latest figures available are for 1948. The table does not accord with the statements that are attributed to Colin Clark. According to the table Denmark lost 2 per cent, of the productivity in the ten years between 1938 and 1948. The productivity of Norway, which is one of the Scandinavian countries, fell by 13 per cent, in the same period. On the other hand, Sweden's productivity increased by 15 per cent. were occupied by the enemy during the last war. honourable member that because of occupation by enemy forces there was possibly very large destruction of productive enterallots to it an index number, then prises, and as a result there would be great difficulty in rehabilitating those countries. That fact probably accounts for the reported decrease of productivity. tivity in the United Kingdom in the same period was 16 per cent., whilst the comparable increase in the United States was 30 per cent. In the article published by the Daily Telegraph Colin Clark gave no indication of the sources from which he had obtained his figures, and we are left regarded as reliable. tralian increase or decrease of productivity according to the table from which figures ? not contained in the table, but I shall cite other figures from sources that are available to us in Australia. The Commonwealth Statistician, over a long period of time, has given a good deal of ing of productivity in terms of manhours or man-years is extremely difficult because the labour factors are constantly varying. It is also difficult because of broken time and because of industries closing down. It becomes particularly difficult to compare tion of different articles, such as pianos, motor cars and groceries. The best that can be said of productivity figures in this or any other country is that they give an indication of trends; hut that indication cannot be taken as absolutely accurate. Eor many years the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics has given, in its labour reports, some idea of the production per person engaged in industry. For some reason or otlier that particular table has not been published during the last two years, and the last report in which I can find it published is Beport No. 35 which covers the years 1945-46. Any honourable member who wishes to check that table to ascertain how it is compiled will find it at page 38 of that report. It takes into consideration the number of persons engaged in production, gives the actual production and equates it to retail prices so as to give some indication of the real value of production. The figures show that the value of production in Australia in 1938 The increase of producwas £481,000,000. In the year 1945-46, following which the greatest increase of production has taken place according to Professor Higgins and Colin Clark, the increase of productivity according to value, which is not a very reliable method of calculation, was 44 per cent.

Rut when the figure relating to the value of production is equated to the "" C "" series index figures, we find that for this year's production; and canned meat the year 1938-39 it had an index number of 124 and for the year 1945-46 an index number of 144, which indicated approximately a 7^ per cent, increase of production per person engaged in industry. That result coincides very closely with the figure of 8 per cent, given by Clark in his evidence to the court. the prices of the "" C "" series figures, which is the retail purchasing power of money. That in itself is not the best guide, because the goods that are manufactured in Australia are in the main, not originally sold on the retail market. They are generally sold on the wholesale market and, as a consequence, it does not truly reflect every increase or decrease of value. The"" C "" series figures are the best guide. The Commonwealth Statistician indicates that even during the period when the great bulk of our manpower was withdrawn from the production of goods and commodities for civilian purposes, production was still steadily increasing in Australia. In the two years from 1946 to 1948 there was an 11 per cent, increase of production. It is possible consistent but instead of its being slightly more accurately to measure the value of production per person in rural industry because it is possible to examine the various items of production such as wheat, wool or sheepskins in reasonable quantities and to equate the man-power engaged with the production of those things so as to see whether the physical volume of goods produced has increased. A table that I have secured from the Commonwealth Statistician indicates that between 1938-39 and 194S-49 the production per person engaged in rural industry increased by the considerable degree of 26 per cent. All the figures available show clearly that productivity in Australia increased by much more than the 3 per cent, mentioned by the honourable member. of individual items in respect of which very substantial increases of production are shown. According to the .figures available for the ten years concerned, the production of jam increased by 50 per cent.; preserved fruits by 33^ per cent.; canned vegetables by 700 per cent., taking into consideration by 400 per cent. The honourable member for Evans also made a statement which no doubt will be made also by other speakers. It was, that in the first six months of the present Government's term of oflice the cost of living had risen to a slightly less degree than it had during the last six months of the preceding Government's term of office. I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician figures which show that the reverse is the case and that the increase of the cost of living during the first six months of this Government's term of office has been slightly greater than was the increase that took place during the last six months of tlie preceding government's period of office. The index number of the "" C "" series issued by the Commonwealth Statistician for the June quarter of 1950 was 1,403; for December of 1949 it was 1,466; and for June of this year it was 1,533. In actual fact, in the last six montbs of 1949 the cost of living increased hy 4.49 per cent, whilst from December to June of this year it increased by 4.64 per cent. It may be said that the increase has been less for the first six months of-this year, it has, in fact, been slightly more. member say volume or price? level shown by the "" C "" series figures. That is the best guide to the purchasing power of money as it affects the consumers. If the honourable member for Evans wishes to ensure co-operation and assistance from this side of the House he should realize that the best way to win friends and influence people is not to attack their views or to make statements of the kind that he has made but to pursue a policy based on friendship There is a large number instead of antagonism and hostility.

289,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"liouse and many officials of the trade union movement are genuine opponents of the Communist party, and that among them is the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey). It is disappointing to find that these people, when faced with the dilemma of having to do something that may not be to the advantage of the Labour party if they are to avoid helping the Communist party, generally temporize. They do and say things that are helpful to the Communist party because tbey do not want to hurt the Labour party. I was shocked at some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Bendigo. He saidand I could scarcely believe my ears when I . heard him-that until the depression there was no real Communist influence within the Australian trade union movement. Has he never heard of Jock Garden? Has he never heard of the Red Internationale of Labour Unions? Let me read to him the list of the office bearers in that Communist subsidiary before the depression. There was Comrade Clifford, of the Carpenters Union; J. A. Ferguson, of the Australian Railways Union, who is now federal president of the Australian Labour party; R. J. Patterson, of the Printing Workers Industrial Union; A. Doyle, of the Boilermakers Union; P. G. Hannett, of the Electrical Trades Union who had recently returned from Vladivostok and Moscow; Wilson, of the Seamen's Union; Dodd, of White Bay power house, a well known Communist; T. Docker, of the Carpenters Union, another well-known member of the Communist Central Committee; W. Orr, another Communist whowas Moscow delegate and later the organizer of war-time turmoil in the Australian coal trade in 1940; Mitchell, of the Painters Union; Douglas, of Eveleigh Railway Workshops; Pettit, of the Tramways Union; E. Knight, of the Australian Workers Union, a well-known professional Communist, and others. That list is clear proof of the fallacy that the honourable member for Bendigo was guilty of uttering. When the honourable member tried to persuade the House that communism in the trade union movement and the Labour party was merely a product of the depression he said what was untrue and I am greatly astonished N 2 1141 that he does not know it to be untrue, because be was one of the delegates to the 1921 conference at which the Communist party foisted the socialization objective on to the Labour platform. In 1926, in New Soutb Wales, the Communist trade union conference under the sponsorship of Rubanoff had, as its office-bearers, Mr A. C. Willis, who was, at the same time, chairman of the rules committee of the Australian Labour party conference; Mr W. Seale, vice-chairman, who was president of the Australian Lahour party conference; and Emile R. Voigt, minute secretary, who was also minute secretary of the Labour party conference. At that time there was almost complete identity between the officials of the Labour party and the officials of the Communist party. I assure honourable members that there is a great deal of quite incontrovertible evidence of the truth of what I say and the untruth, unfortunately, of what the honourable member for Bendigo said on a subject on which he should have expert knowledge. As bonorable members 'know, the economic situation presents two main problems. The first is the prevalence of Communists in the industrial machine, and the second is the critical shortage of coal. It would not, I think, be appropriate for me to discuss the details of the bill now before the Senate; but I think that I should direct attention to some of the remarkable circumstances that have arisen outside the Senate, not in regard to the details of that measure, but in regard to the consideration that it received from the Labour party. Tbe Labour party's attitude to the bill was determined not by caucus but by outside bodies. First, to a minor degree, it was determined by what is known as the Federal Advisory Council. Secondly, to a major degree, it was determined by tbe federal executive of the Australian Labour party. It is the second body that is important. Somewhat high constitutional questions are involved in this matter because, in another place, the Labour party controls legislation and the Government of the country is, therefore, in the hands of an outside body. It is important to analyse what has happened. Let me recapitulate facts with which I think all honourable members w ill be familiar. When the federal executive of the Australian Lahour party considered the bill it instructed the Parliamentary Labour party to insist on certain amendments. Then, more recently, when the Government re-introduced the measure and it came again before the federal executive, the voting was even and the ruling given was that the previous decision must stand. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) would not allow honourable members of the Opposition to discuss the ruling or even to vote upon it . he could not. When the federal executive clear.

What happened in 1942? A t that time the late Mr Curtin, who was then Prime Minister, found it necessary to extend the area in which the Australian M i l it a r y Forces could be allowed to serve. He made his first proposal in that respect, to a special interstate conference of the Australian Labour party that was held in Melbourne in that year. I cannot do better than quote words which Senator Oameron wrote in an article describing what happened at that conference. He saidI consider that, while any delegate at the Federal Australian Labour Party Conference had a perfect right to bring forward any proposal or subject if he could obtain the sanction of the otlier delegates to do so, Mr Curtin, as a delegate for Western Australia, had no authority from the Western Australian branch Hulme.

I am prepared to say that the Labor Call was lying and that the right honourable gentleman was telling the truth. Those facts are relevant to any attempt to find out whether, in point of fact, that conference altered the decision of the then Prime Minister. I find that it did not. I remind the House of certain words that the right honourable member for Macquarie used on that occasion. He saidThe Prime Minister's original proposition was received with acclamation by a great num'ber of people and a majority of honourable members. He hae not deviated one point from his original proposition. In spite of the majority view of Labour members of the Parliament at that time, Mr Curtin went on his hands and knees to the Australian Labour party conference, which did not give h i m a decision, but referred the matter to the federal executive of the party which ultimately, by the narrow majority of one State, graciously gave him the permission that he sought.

319,Mr Wentworth,"The members of the Labour party consist of members of affiliated trade unions and persons enrolled as members of the party. There is a saving provision that no Communist, shall be a member of the party, but the important fact is that members of affiliated unions are included in it . A t the annual conference, whicli elects two delegates to the federal executive, the basis of representation is such as to give control to the union representatives. Those representatives are elected by unions, which in many instances are controlled by Coinmunists, in ballots which frequently are conducted in a way that would not satisfy any reasonable person.

He can smell a Communist under every bush. He has studied the political situation from one point of view for so long that his mind has definitely become warped and he cannot give a reasonable or sensible opinion on anything that he hears or reads in connection with communism. Apparently he has examined the rules of the Australian Labour party from the same biased point of view. He has devoted a great deal of time this afternoon to his own special explanation of the constitution and rules of the party, but his hide-bound attitude has prevented him from arriving at a reasonable conclusion. He has been unable to discover how the Australian Labour party is controlled. As a member of that party, I am proud of the system under which its members work. We do not give to any secret juuta the right to declare our policy. We do not ask the private banking institutions what policy we shall adopt in relation to finance. We do not ask the graziers to formulate our policy in relation to the wool tax. We do not go to the wheat-farmers to ask them what we must do. Instead we have a democratic organization which works in the open. Our rules and constitution are open to the .world. We hold our conferences in the open and we announce our decisions to tlie world.

My experience of parliamentary procedure has been that the budget has been adopted on previous occasions in time to provide Supply for that period. This did not happen last year, or for many years previously. Therefore, we are obliged to look for a reason for this procedure, and tbe reason is not hard to find. This House went into recess for the winter about the 22nd June, and we were informed unofficially then, I understand on tbe authority of the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), that it would re-assemble during the first week of September in order to debate the budget for 1950-51. Later we were told that there had been some delay in the preparation of the budget and that we should not meet to consider it until the second week in September. However, we were not called together until the fourth week of September and, wben we arrived here to debate the budget, we found that the Government did not have a budget to present. The budget was not presented until the 12th October, and because of that unnecessary delay member heard about the war in Korea? deal about the war in Canberra, which delaj'ed the preparation and presentation of the budget. delay, we have to occupy a week or two of our time in discussing the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1950, the object of which is to provide finance with which to carry on the government of the country until the budget has been passed. We could have been dealing with the budget a month ago if the Government hacl been business-like. happened? The Cabinet met day after day aud week after week for tbe purpose of drafting a budget. Certain members of the Cabinet hit upon the idea tliat the first step necessary to put value back into the £1, a process which the Government has discussed at great length without taking definite action, was to revalue the currency in order to bring it to parity with sterling. Although the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), that noble, strong man, and the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey), wanted to revalue the £1, and the Cabinet decided to do so by twelve votes to seven, the project was defeated. Government supporters talk about secret juntas! What secret junta enabled seven members of the Cabinet to decide the Government's policy against the opposition of twelve, of their colleagues who wanted to revalue the £1 ? We have been told that the Treasurer and the members of his hill-billy party,who are keeping the Government in office, were responsible for the decision. They are levying blackmail on the people of Australia while they are keeping the Government in power. There is a wonderful example of so-called majority control! The imputation that blackmail has been levied is disorderly and I ask the honourable member to withdraw the statement. Nobody objected to my use of it. Chair objects to its use. to it, I withdraw it. I come now to the next step in the the honourable preparation of the budget. A meeting of the Liberal party was called, and over $0 par cent, of the members voted in favour of revaluation of the £1. The small coterie of Australian Country party Because of that mernbers also met and they voted against revaluation of the £1. When the votes of both parties were counted, there was a substantial majority in favour of revaluation. But what happened ? I am addressing the new chum back-benchers on the Government side of the House now. I ask the honourable member to withdraw But what that remark. honourable member does not keep on the track, he will have to sit down. to stay on the track and I am keeping as close to the subject as many previous speakers did. Although a majority of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party decided that revaluation was necessary, the final decision was, ""We will not revalue the £ 1 "" .

The situation is entirely different in the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in which majority decisions are reversed. One member of the Australian Country party, the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Charles Russell), advocates revaluation, and he is a man of independent thought and action. decision of the combined parties. He wanted the majority decision to be put into operation. What did he do? With the advice of his then leader, the Treadelayed, and, for that reason, the Parliasurer, he wrote out a resignation and quitted the ranks of the Australian Counvember and December.

The honourable member for Canning( Mr gramme by what they describe as Hamilton) has a weakness for doing that sort of thing. We are a democratic organization. We believe in, and carry on under majority control. We do not adopt the methods that have been adopted by members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party. As a result of shilly-shallying, members of tlie Government parties are not ""game"" to carry out the decision of the majority, and that is the reason why the House is debating the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1950-51 to-day.

He complained that because of the tactics that had been pursued by the Labour party's majority in tbe Senate, the Government's business bad been ment was asked to grant Supply for Notactics in the Senate could not have delayed the Government's administrative chambers were in recess during that period. No other reason has been given in response to our requests for informavented from giving effect to their prothe obstructionist tactics of the Labour party.

I am endeavouring to discover, and I hope that a Government supporter will be kind enough to enlighten me in the course of this debate, the real reason why the duties. I have certain ideas about that matter. I believe that the principal reason is that members of the Government are incompatibles, and, as is well known, incompatibles do not mix successfully.

339,Mr Bryson,"Oppositio n membersi n double harness in the past, they failed lamentably. I notice tliat the Treasurer smiles at that remark, but he probably recalls more clearly than I do that not so many years ago, he made scathing comments about the present Prime Minister and used such expressions as, "" A dagger driven into my back "". He w ill recall those matters even more vividly tlian I do, because, at that time, he was endeavouring to lead that leaderless legion, the Australian Country party, and the Liberal party, which was then known. as the United Australia party. The change of name has not meant the abandonment of ultra-conservative prin ciples. As both right honourable gentlemen were 'unable to work amicably in double harness in the past, it is natural for us to expect that there w ill be more trouble between them in the future. The Prime Minister has not the loyalty of even the members of the Liberal party. He is being posed as a strong man. and the leading lights of the Liberal party, are tryin g to give him a big build up in the hope that the people w ill regard him as a great Prime Minister. Those efforts will not be successful. ber is making a great mistake. ber for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) sbould remain silent. I am afraid that white ants have got into his head. The Prime Minister is not such a strong man as the leading lights of the Liberal party and the capitalistic press pretend that he is. Other people who are supposed to be his friends are not giving h i m their wholehearted support. The Melbourne Argus is a newspaper that sees f a i r play to-day, but it was a conservative newspaper in 1941 when it published the following report of a statement by the then PrimeA frank discussion with my colleagues in the Cabinet has shown that, whilst they have personal goodwill towards me, many of them feel that I am unpopular with large sections of the press and the people and that this unpopularity handicaps the effectiveness of the Government by giving rise to misrepresentations and misunderstanding of its activities, and that there are divisions of opinion in the Government parties themselves which would not or might not exist under any other leader. The right honourable gentleman hadto resign as Prime Minister. The Treasurer will recall those facts, because he stepped into the Prime Minister's shoes, with conspicuous lack of success. H is reign for 40 days and 40 nights is still remembered. The Ministerf o r Health( Sir Earle Page), who, allegedly, is working harmoniously with the present Prime Minister, made the following statement about the right honourable gentleman on one occasion:I was compelled to cousider the qualifications of the new leader of the United Australia Party, and to ask myself whether his public record was such as to inspire the people of Australia to the maximum unstinted effort in a time of national emergency. 1 am afraid that Mr Menzies will not be able to get that maximum effort from the people. The honourable member for Mackellar, who now supports the Government, was reported in that ultra-conservative newspaper, the Sydney Morninq Herald, on The capitalist press of Australia, the 13th A p r i l , 1943, as having saidMr Menzies can neither call nor command as a leader. TJnder his leadership the party broke up, and yet he refuses to co-operate under the leadership of anybody else. In those circumstances, the greatest national service he can render the party nnd Australia would be to quit politics. Those of us who stand for a The honourable memmore vigorous policy are anxious that Mr Menzies' inevitable failures should not block thc path of future progress. That ultra-conservative newspaper probably would not misrepresent the views that were held by the honourable member for Mackellar at that time. I believe that the introduction of the budget has been delayed for six weeks because members of the Government are incompatibles. not logical. tion than the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service has given to the House for the delay in introducing the budget. Government supporters have appealed for mercy in their speeches, and have made all kinds of excuses, but they have failed to give any valid reason why the majority decision of the Liberal party in favour of revalua'tion has not been given effect in the budget.

344,Mr Bryson,"It is a better explanathe general public. ""What is that inference? The position is obvious. The Liberal party is strong numerically, the Australian Country party is weak numerically. The tail sometimes is wagging the dog, but at other times we are at a loss to know whether the Australian Country party or an outside juntaa word that Government supporters like-is calling the tune. The Liberal party and the Australian Oountry party were returned to office as a result of a series of misrepresentations. Their candidates told the people on the hustings, and in newspaper advertisements, that, if they were elected to office, they would put value back into the £1. Their words have, been quoted innumerable times, and I do not propose to repeat them now, other than to remind them that they promised to make the £1 worth a £1. What has the Government done to fulfil that promise? The answer is simple. It has not done anything to put back value into the £1, and it is now endeavouring, by all kinds of excuses, to distract the attention of the people from those untruthful promises. Government supporters knew that those promises could not be fulfilled, and, indeed, they had no intention of even attempting to honour them. The Government is in. office to-day because the supporters of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party misled the people into believing that they had evolved a solution of our economic problems, particularly in respect of rising prices. The people are beginn ing to realize that they fell for misreprethose financial institutions are collecting sentations, and it will not be long before the Communist red herring will smell to high heaven, and the Government will be obliged to find another red herring with which to distract the attention of the people from its failure to put value back into the £1. The prices of all commodities are continually rising. The housewife, who has to buy tbem, is perfectly well aware of that fact. Day after day, the poorer section of the community is discovering that the propaganda of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party during the last general election campaign was complete misrepresentation. They are beginning to realize that the private trading banks did not spend more than £1,000,000 on Sfr. Bryson. the election campaign for the benefit of the small people. Indeed, the private financial institutions are now obtaining their pound of flesh. The poor, are also beginning to learn that the people who paid to put the Government into office are issuing their instructions to it from day to day. Honorahle members opposite, regardless of their personal opinions, are blindly following tbose instructions, because they are merely the paid servants' of those financial institutions and capitalistic concerns. Mr M'oCor.M I rise to 'order. I object to the statement that I am a paid servant of private financial institutions and capitalist concerns. It is offensive to me, and I submit that the honourable member for Wills should be required to withdraw it. The honourable member for Bowman( Mr McColm) has objected to certain words wbich the honourable member for Wills has used, and I ask him to. withdraw them. that have offended the honourable gentleman. I am sorry if 1 have hurt his feelings. I found, from niy own observations during the last general election campaign, that the financial institutions expended a large sum of money, none of which was made available to the Labour party. I also have knowledge, from my own observations of the methods that are being followed by this Government, that their pound of flesh. I see that Government supporters are dancing according to the way in which the strings are pulled by 'the private financial institutions. PerhapsI expressed myself a little crudely a moment before the honourable member for Bowman rose to order. I also notice that the great newspaper barons of Australia, which played their part in securing the return of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party to office by misrepresentation, false statements and deliberate lies in the press day after day, are demanding their pound of flesh. They advocate the revaluation of the £1 in order to save them a few million pounds in the cost of newsprint from the dollar area.

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedThat Mr Fadden and Mr Francis do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. read a first time. [8.4] I move That tbe bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to increase the salaries payable to holders of certain statutory offices, the salaries for which are determined by legislation. It has become apparent that, despite the adjustments made hy the previous Government in 1947, members of the judiciary and omcers in the higher executive position? of the Public Service are not being remunerated at present on a scale commensurate with their responsibility. The salaries of justiceships of the High Court and other judicial offices cannot be compared with the earnings of leaders of the legal profession at the har. This Government is firmly convinced that such salaries should he adequate, and accordingly has provided for increases in accordance with the principles of similar legislation enacted in 1947. The salaries that are attached to the other statutory positions included in this bill have been determined in relation to a recent general review of the salaries of permanent heads and other high executive first division ouicers of the Public Service. None of these salaries is subject to variation in accordance with increases or decreases of the cost of living. The Government is conscious of the necessity for a reasonable remuneration to cover tae responsibilities and complex duties of a head of a department. In order to attract and retain men with the necessary qualifications and experience, salaries must have some relationship tc) the emoluments available to such men in private industry. Since the 1947 review, there has been a substantial movement of salaries in the levels immediately below those mentioned in the bill, through reclassification, cost of living margins and arbitrator's awards. The salaries of officers below the first division are subject to determinations by the Public Service Arbitrator, and his recent awards have considerably narrowed and in some cases eliminated ihe margin between the salaries of tbe head of a department and his next senior officer. Honourable members wili find details of the proposed increases in the schedule to tbe bill. In assessing the increases which it proposes to make, the Government has borne in mind the general trend of salaries for professional and high executive positions both in Australia and overseas. It is convinced that the proposed increases aro not only reasonable but also necessary to retain, in the Commonwealth's service, the best men available. Provision for these increases, in common with increases of the salaries of permanent heads, had heen made in the Estimates for 1950-51. but it is now deemed desirable to provide the additional emoluments hy means of this bill. I therefore commend the bill to the House. adjourned.",71,Speakee The Corrupt Little Junta Which Has No Basis

352,Debate (On Motion By Dr. Evatt),"Debate resumed. orable members sbould be reminded that we are debating a Supply Bill which proposes to provide approximately £61,000,000 for the current year's services out of Consolidated Revenue. I mention this fact because during the debate honourable members seem to have roamed over a number of subjects, unlike the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), who confined his remarks to discussion of the economic situation. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson) who preceded me in this debate, indulged in more.gymnastic feats during the course of his speech than I could have imagined possible. In fact, he had more gymnastic exercise in the course of ten minutes than I have had in the whole of my parliamentary life. It consisted of jumping to conclusions about subjects which do not concern this. chamber. The first matter to which he referred was most interesting to students of democracy. He asserted that the rank and file of the Australian Labour party, to which he belongs, have a voice in. framing the policy of that party. I invi„e honourable members generally to -compare that statement with the manner in which the Labour party has dealt with the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. Is the attitude they have displayed towards that measure in accordance with normal democratic processes? My view of democracy is that the people elect repretread "". sentatives to this Parliament to exercise their free and independent judgment on all matters that arise for discussion in the Parliament. Consider the attitude of the Labour party towards the measure that I have mentioned. After having expressed the most forthright condemnation of that measure, they accepted dictation from a junta of outside individuals, who are unknown to the Australian people. Under compulsion from that junta they were compelled to change their minds. They are now prepared, against the convictions they have expressed on the floor of the House, to vote for the bill. If that is a fair example of the operation of parliamentary democracy, it involves a conception of democracy quite different from any that I have ever heard before. The procedure adopted by the Opposition appears to me to conform more accurately with the practice followed by the political bureau in Moscow, which endorses its own candidates at elections, and then dictates to the people how they shall vote at those elections. The next conclusion to which the honourable member for Wills jumped concerned the subject of currency revaluation. He asserted that some months ago a vote of the Cabinet was taken on revaluation, and that on that occasion twelve members of the Cabinet voted for revaluation and seven voted against it. If that were correct it would imply that nineteen Ministers were present at the meeting. The fact is that when the meeting was held only seventeen Ministers were in Australia. I admit, of course, that the matter of revaluation was discussed in our party room. At that discussion I formed a very definite impression about the sincerity with which my colleagues spoke and of the common sense .with which they supported their views. WhilstI might have gone to the meeting with somewhat firm convictions on the subject, I cannot say that after the meeting I held my views so firmly. So much for the attitude of Government supporters towards revaluation. I think the attitude of the honourable member for Wills on the subject, compared with that of his Leader in this House, might be expressed in the paraphrase, "" Let Wills rush in where Macquarie fears to Undoubtedly many members of the Opposition believe, in common with the Leader of the Opposition, that appreciation of the currency is not in the interests of the people. The next point made by the honorahle member was that the banks and financial institutions generally have poured money into the funds of the non-Labour parties. of that. I know that they did not pour any money into my election funds. However, in reply to the honourable member's observations about party funds, I ask him whether it is not a fact that",72,Second Reading

355,Mr Mcmahon,"I am not so surethe Communist-controlled iron workers union paid large sums of money into the funds of the Australian Lahour party? controlled unions also pay money into that party's funds? Of course, memhers of the Opposition know that a numher of Communist-controlled unions did pay money into their funds, and that they continue to do so in order to obtain the' protection of the Australian Lahour party. I have no compunction in telling members of the Opposition about the source from which they obtain their funds. Beturning to matters more directly related to the bill being discussed, I shall touch upon one or two matters that were very ably debated by tbe Leader of the Opposition. The principal criticism that he directed at the present Government was that whilst his Administration had succeeded in balancing its budget and had bequeathed to the present Government a substantial surplus, the Menzies Government has failed to stabilize the national economy or to restore the value of the £ 1. T cannot perceive any great virtue in balanced budgets. I know that we can do a. great deal with figures if we juggle with them. However, I think that it is more important to point out that during the tenure of the Chifley Administration production in this country did not increase by more than 1 per cent, per annum. Although Labour was in office for eight years, and during that long period failed to materially increase production, the Tjnited States of America increased its production per man hour during the period by 70 per cent., Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries increased their production by 25 per cent, and New Zealand increased its production by 50 per cent. Yet members of the Opposition indulge in cant, humbug and hypocrisy ancl tell us that we are not doing our best to restore the value of the £1. They know very well that prices in Australia have risen steadily at the rate of 10 per cent, during the last four years, and that during the short time that the Menzies Government has been in office the rate of increase has not accelecreased, which is perfectly true. He also rated. It cannot be contended, therefore, that, in the difficult position that confronts the Menzies Government, it has not taken strong measures to stabilize our economy and to deal with the problem of increased production, which is a much more important matter. Did not other CommunistThere are two other matters that arise from the right honourable gentleman's speech which I should like to deal with although they are technical. Both he and the honourable member for Wills complained that the Government had brought down two Supply bills. It might be desirable for me to explain at this point that our financial year runs from the 31st July of one year to the 30th June of the next year, and that usually the budget and the Estimates are brought down in either August or September. It frequently happens, however, that the budget is not passed until much later in the year. During the intervening period it is usual to introduce temporary financial measures that are known as Supply bills. The complaint has been made that the Government has been dilatory and that it is most unusual to have two Supply bills during one session. I have studied the position for a number of years between 1937-38 and 1950-51 and have found that, far from its having been unusual for two Supply bills to be brought down in one session it is quite usual in this House. In 1937-38 two Supply bills were brought down, in 1940-41 three, in 1941-42 three, in 1943-44 two, in 1946-47 two, and so on. During the Chifley Government's regime one hill was introduced in three different financial years and was quickly "" guillotined "" through this House. It is unfair and unrealistic for honourable members opposite to argue that the bringing clown of two Supply bills constitutes either dilatoriness or unfair budgetary practice. . I now turn to certain items that were challenged by the Leader of the Opposition. He said that he could not understand certain of the items in the budget. He obviously did not try to understand them, because any person with even a moderate knowledge of accountancy would understand them. He claimed that the expenditure on certain items had inin°de the charge that we had included additional items of expenditure, contrary to the normal practice. What happened was that we increased certain items purely and simply because they were related to tbe salaries of public servants. We had to do so because the Public Service Arbitrator, Mr Castieau, increased the salaries of Commonwealth public servants by an award. If the right honourable gentleman wished to argue that our action was wrong the proper course for him to bave taken was to argue that the Castieau award should have been rejected, and he should have had the courage to tell public servants that he disapproved of the increase given to them under that award. Another criticism was that we had transferred from the Supply (Works and Services) Bill to this bill some allegedly capital items which are of a current expenditure nature. Those are mainly items that relate to defence and do not contribute to the country's productive capacity. At this point I wish to pay a tribute to the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) for having adopted what I regard as unorthodox methods of finance. He is s!owly trying to get us out of the mess that the Chifley Government got us into during its eight years of office. Yesterday he introduced a bill to simplify the taxation laws of this country. Any one, after even a casual perusal of that bill, wil] agree that it is urgently necessary, -.ispecially so that taxpayers will underof the Public Service generally, if that stand what the taxation laws are about and, when preparing their taxation returns, will know in advance how much tax they can expect to have to pay. The Leader of the Opposition criticized members of the Cabinet have made the Government in respect of certain strenuous efforts to overcome that probitems that are not of a capital nature lem, which at present appears to be and do not add to the productive insuperable. I urge that still more resources of the community, and stated strenuous efforts be made in this that they involved a transfer from capital direction. account to current account. I regard that procedure as fiscally correct, and I am glad to see it incorporated in the bill. deal, however briefly, with the subject. I consider that there is no good reason of production in this country. The why the budgets should not be introduced Leader of the Opposition, during his by about March or April of each year, tenure of office as Prime Minister, and and passed by the beginning of the finanmany other persons, have stressed the fact cial year. I know that in the beginning that if our standard of living problems are such a procedure would mean a lot of to be overcome we must produce more. Thp work, but it would be worthwhile in the right honourable gentleman has many very long run. That system is adopted in statesmanlike utterances to his credit, but Great Britain and in other parts of the I cannot say that his performances world, and could be followed here. I have measured up to his promises. I take hope that the Treasurer will give that my hat off to him for having the suggestion some consideration. If r . IfoSf.ohon. I ask the Minister for the Interior( Mr McBride), who is now in charge of the House, whether it would not be possible to abolish completely taxation on musical instruments, which I regard as taxation that is levied on cultural activities and on discriminatory taste. He would do a service to the community if he urged his colleagues to agree to such a change. The present bill deals mainly with the salaries and wages of members of the Public Service, which are items that constitute an interesting and vexing subject. If we break down the figures relating to the strength of the Publie Service into those for administrative staff and for public servants generally, we shall find that the administrative services of all government instrumentalities, federal, State and local, increased from 2 per cent, in 1939 to 5 per cent, this year of the total working force. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) have told ns about the strenuous efforts that the Government has made to reduce the proportion of administrative employees, and the Treasurer recently informed us that it. was intended to reduce the strength could be done, by an additional 20 per cent. Personnel in administrative services must be transferred to productive work to assist in the output of consumer goods. The Prime Minister and other My main purpose to-night is to courage to tell the Australian people that if they do not produce more then they cannot eat or have as much as they wish. Recently we have seen some statistics of production in Australia compared with similar statistics from other parts of the world, which are very revealing and interesting. Eveni f we take the most favorable figures that it is possible to obtain, it must be admitted that we in Australia are not producing more than 5 per cent, per man-hour in excess of what we produced in 1939. That is not a very high percentage and does not permit us to improve our standards of living. member obtain his statistics? MrM c MAHON "" from figures supplied by Mr Colin Clark. If we compare those statistics w it h thc comparable figures per man-hour for other countries, Ave find that on the base period 1932-35 production has increased in New Zealand by 50 per cent., in the United States by 70 per cent, and in Britain and the Scandinavian countries, which were ravaged .by the war, by well over 25 per cent. Those figures show that our problem in Australia is one not of inflation but of under-production, especially when our production is compared with the production of our democratic neighbours. The problem is not so much how many pounds we have, as of increasing the size of the cake so that everybody can get a bigger and better share of it . That is the problem to which every person in Australia must face up. There is no cause for hysteria, because our productive capacity has increased tremendously, although our actual production has not greatly increased. We liave a tremendous production potential and all we have to do is to tap it so as to improve our standards of living to a point at which they w ill be unparalleled in our history, and at which, I believe, we shall have left every other democratic country in the world f a r in the rear. An Opposition back-bencher, whose name ancl constituency I cannot recall, directed attention to the increase of production or lack of increase of production in our primary industries, so I took the trouble to examine the relevant figures, and I was never so astonished in my l if e as when I found that over a period the general increase of production in primary industries, including the dairying and pastoral industries, measured in international units of purchasing power, had been more than 30 per cent., despite the fact that employment in these industries has fallen substantially and that they account for only one-sixth of the working force of the country. industries pay to rural workers? MrM c MAHON I do not know. I am not interested in money. If the I obtained them honourable gentleman had listened caref u l l y to my remarks he would not have made that irrelevant interjection. I am interested in the size of the cake, and in how much of it each individual w ill get. Primary industries have increased their production by 30 per cent., yet the total increase of production over the whole of our industry is only 5 per cent. Those figures show how indebted the community is to tbe primary industries. Evidence was given before a tribunal only recently that the average number of effective hours worked in coal mines is 23.2 hours a week. It was stated that if the number of effective hours worked werp 35 a week we could obtain all the coal that we need. Production in the brick-laying industry has fallen by 33 per cent, u man from its 1939 level. So the story goes on. P r i m a ry production and other industries are pulling their weight, but som5 other industries, particularly the basic industries, still require to increase their production. An improved standard of living w ill result from a better productive effort from our people. I am not arguing for one moment that the problem of a better productive effort is one that this Government alone can meet. I do nof consider that it can even think of facing up to the whole problem, because it is a problem for attention by individual workers, managements, the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I do not ask members of the Labour party to give their fullest co-operation in a production drive. All I ask them to do is not to obstruct the efforts of those who are",73,Supply Bill No 2 1950 51 Second Reading

It is for us to make up our minds whether we want to do better. If we do, we most certainly shall. What is the Government doing? I have said that it could not do very much except to take the role of leadership. The Prime Minister, on the two occasions on which he spoke on the air on rising prices, gave an example of inspiring leadership to the Australian people. It is all right for honourable members opposite, having failed the Australian people, to jeer. If they want to jeer, let them jeer at their own failures. What is the Government doing? I suppose that the most spectacular achievement of the Opposition was to prevent the passage e ' the Communist Partv Dissolution 1 Bill. Honourable members interjp.ctina. H . DEPUTY r Il^n^rahle members of the Opposition are continually interrupting. I ask them to be quiet. party is hindering production and is the greatest impediment to full production in Australia. Get rid of these Communists and you will see that the 30 per cent, increase of production which is so urgently necessary will rapidly become a reality. As I have said, in other parts of this Parliament there is still an intention to obstruct and delay. While that continues, standards of living will remain depressed. I believe that the next most spectacular Minister, who went abroad and, off his own bat, obtained a loan of 100,000,000 dollars to put this country back on its That is very feet, with a promise of a further 150,000,000 dollars in two or three years' time. That money was borrowed for the single purpose of obtaining the heavy mechanical equipment that is necessary to eliminate the bottlenecks in Australian production. That was a singularly spectacular achievement and one which will tremendously increase productive capacity in this country. Recently, London funds-dollar s and gold held in London for the Empire countries-hav e been considerably increased. I think that the equivalent of about 2,750,000,000 dollars is held in dollars and gold. That may mean that Australia will receive a further allocation of dollars in addition to the amount already borrowed from the International Bank. So our prospects of obtaining more dollars and of buying more goods in the international market will increase as time goes by. Those are two measures of fundamental importance. There have been others, such as those covered by the statement that was made by the Prime Minister and repeated by the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), that it is hoped to cut down local works services by 20 per cent, and the statement that each department was compelled to cut down its estimates by 20 per cent., so that labour could be transferred from government businesses to private enterprise. Those measures will have a considerable effect in increasing productive capacity and the prospects of this community. Whilst",76,Supply Bill No 2 1950 51 Second Reading

It is of no use for the Opposition to harp on this problem, day in and day out, ad nauseam, unless it is prepared to let the Government help to solve it. Honourable members on this side do not ask for their willing co-operation. We only ask them to drop obstruction. We ask them to forget that they are in Opposition and must maintain an Opposition complex. We ask them to think, as Australians, that Australia is more important than their efforts to cling tenaciously to seats, the representation of which enables them to draw their salaries, and that they are expected at the same time to act in the best interests of the Australian community.

He said, first of all, in the course of remarks reflecting upon the party to which I have the honour to belong, that the Communist-controlled unions poured money into the Australian Labour party election funds during the course of the last general election campaign. That is a deliberate untruth. Although it is true that offers of assistance were made by those Communist-controlled unions, the Labour party rejected them wholeheartedly and unanimously and relied upon the sinews of war being provided by those who believed in Australian democracy.

It is of very great importance, and should be approached in the proper spirit because it is difficult to deal with. It comes within the scope of the Postmaster General's Department. I shall not preach a sermon to this House, but that this is an important subject honourable members will agree after they have heard of it. The business of this House is not only to debate political and economic subjects, but also to safeguard and raise the moral tone of the community. The business of the Parliament can be divided into three sections, namely, the economic, the social and the moral. If any one can bring to the notice of honourable memhers anything which may help to raise the moral tone of the community, it is the right and duty of this Parliament seriously to consider it. During the course of last week I received this letter from a Presbyterian minister, who wishes to remain anonymousThere is another matter to which I desire to draw your attention. Only to-day my wife gave me tliis week's copy of Woman and asked niy opinion on the article by Dr. Wykeham Terriss entitled "" Surgical Sterilization"". AfterI had read it you may be sure that I gave my opinion in no uncertain terms. An article such as this undoubtedly is constitutes n deliberate attack on public morality and apparently is an open invitation to sexual porvcrsion. T believe, Mr Cremean, that similar articles appear regularly nnd are read with the keenest enjoyment by adolescent girls and boys. If such is thc case cannot something be done by the Federal Parliament to curtail thc pernicious activities of the miscreant who calls himself Terriss but who probably uses this iis a nom de plume to hide his real name. I shall be interested to learn the result of your ventilation of this matter in the Federal Parliament. To the letter was attached the issue of the 9th October, 1950, of a periodical known as Woman. The article referred to is headed"" A doctor looks at life "", is entitled "" Surgical Sterilization"" and purports to quote a letter sent to this Wykeham Terriss by a lady who had signed it ""Miss A.P."". She asked for certain information. Her letter was as follows:Dear Dr. Terriss: article of July4 dealing with an operation on Mr Cremean. the Fallopian tubes, to prevent pregnancy. age, and intending to be married soon, so you can readily understand, at my particular age, that I do not wish to have a family.

Could you please tell me if this particular operation is popular, if it is a minor operation, and if all doctors recommend it? Yours truly, Miss A.B. This Dr. Wykeham Terriss, whose history I shall relate to honourable member's later, replied is giving him a cheap advertisement. proper place in which to ventilate a matter of this kind? Why does not the Postmaster-General, who has the power to do so, prohibit the transmission of such publications through the post? able member take up the matter privately with the Postmaster-General? my duty to ventilate it in this House. In reply to that letter Dr. Wykeham Terriss wrote as follows:This letter betrays a complete misapprehension of the issues involved.

I mentioned it . Then follows a long story giving various details of how the desired result is to be achieved. I shall not read that part of the article, but I direct the attention of honourable members to the concluding portion of it, which is as follows:Unfortunately, there are still many doctors who are unfamiliar with the method, since, at most medical schools, no instruction at all is given about contraceptive methods, and at the few where any instruction at all is given, it is quite inadequate. In England and America there are plenty of birth control clinics to which women may go for instruction, but that is not tlie case in Australia. Even where birth control clinics exist, a woman who goes to one of them for advice and instruction may be lucky enough to find one of the regular staff who is experienced in contraceptive methods; but, if she is unlucky enough to be attended by a doctor who has only recently received training in contraception the attention she gets will not bc so skilled.

For that reason, I ask the Postmaster General to give urgent consideration to my representations. Articles of this kind are a regular feature of the publication that I have mentioned, I shall now give some details about this Dr. Wykeham Terriss. His real name is Norman Haire. He was the subject of a discussion in this House on two previous occasions after he had participated in a Forum of the Air session entitled "" Population Unlimited "" on the 23rd August, 1944. He then made the following remarks, from which I suggest we can gauge the mentality of this cur:I am the youngest of eleven children and I know, too, tlie disadvantages of being one of a too large family. I know, too, whatmy poor mother hacl to endure for eighteen years . . . A t the age of 40 years she, who had been an exceptionally strong and healthy young woman, had through her excessive and uncontrolled fertility, become a devitalized, irritable, cantankerous and prematurely old woman. That is how that gentleman spoke about his mother. AmI not entitled to direct the attention of honourable members to the nature of articles that he is now writing? So. foul did Smith's Weekly consider the remarks that he had made in the course of the broadcast to which I have referred that it headed an article dealing with themMaking the air unfit to breathe. The air is unfit to breath when men like be very careful not to indulge in Terriss, or Haire, are allowed to broadmisrepresentation in the course of cast rubbish of the kind that I have remarks that we make in this House. quoted and to publish it in widely read We should be certain that figures journals.

In the course of his defenoe on that occasion he admitted that he was Dr. Wvkeham make that statement? Terriss, the author of articles of the kind that I have read. If the Parliament tioned the figure of 661,000 employees, is to assist in the maintenance of decent moral standards in the community, the Australian Government, or State governments, must take appropriate action to restrain men of the character of Wykeham Terriss from promulgating their filtb.

I doubt whether he has made any contribution towards that end by dealing with the matter that he raised in the manner that he adopted. I suggest rather that by airing such matter in public in that way he gave the individual whom he attacked a cheap advertisement. I am sure that as the result of the honourable member's remarks the circulation of the publication concerned and the number of letters that will be written to that contributor will immediately increase substantially, for the same reason as the banning of a book immediately increases the demand for it.

The honourable member could have ascertained that fact, if he was not aware of it, by reference to the figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician, Dr. Roland Wilson. Those figures also reveal that the number' of Commonwealth public servants has actually decreased. able member's leg. pulling the legs of all honourable memhers and deceiving the people; but, of course, that is not the case. The official statistics show that the number of Commouwealth male employees decreased in June last by 1,200 and in the following mouth by 900. If honourable members opposite wish the House to believe that they are sincere when they speak about the responsibility of the Parliament to maintain a decent moral tone in the community, it is ahout time tbey ceased to misrepresent facts, purely for party political purposes, in the way that the honourable member for Hoddle has done. Of the total figure of 661,000 public servants throughout Australia, only 155,400 males are employed by the Australian Government, the remainder being employed by State governments, semi-governmental bodies and local government authorities. The honourable member for Hoddle had the temerity to suggest that the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) was literally a liar when that honourable member cited certain official statistics. Honourable members opposite have misrepresented the facts with respect to housing since the present Government assumed office. The official statistics show that during the quarter ended the 31st December last, for a portion of which period the previous Government was in office, the construction of 17,348 houses was commenced, whereas during the quarter ended the 31st March last, wbich included the close-down period of three weeks at Christinas, the construction of 17,405 houses was commenced. That figure discloses an increase during the broken period. The total number commenced during the June quarter of 1950 was 18,368. The numbers of houses actually completed during the respectivequarters were 15,219, 12,169 and 14,873. The smallest figure, of course, reflects the effect of the broken working period. The number of houses under construction during the first of the three quarters that I have mentioned was 56,759. By the end of the next quarter the total had increased to 61,999. The new Government was really in its stride by the June quarter of 1950 and, notwithstanding the fact that it had been prevented from eliminatinghindranees to production, the total number of houses under construction increased then to 65,508. Those statistics give the lie to the Opposition propaganda to the effect that the Government has done nothing to improve the housing situation. They constitute the perfect answer to the charge My examination of the bill has indicated to me that there is probably a great deal of overlapping between various departments. The Government appointed a committee to examine the organization of the Public Service with the object of providing greater efficiency at a lower cost to the people. The figures that I have already cited show that it has enjoyed a considerable measure of success. Nevertheless I consider that there is still room for improvement and I hope that the committee is continuing its work. The duties of the various departments should be more clearly defined in order to prevent overlapping. It is extremely difficult for us to express definite opinions on finance based on recent governmental activities unless we are in possession of the Auditor-General's annual report. Unfortunately, the practice has heen to present the Auditor General's report each year after the Parliament has considered the budget. The same practice is followed in the States. That procedure is morally and legally wrong. How can the Parliament express a considered opinion on the budget unless it is fortified by the report of the Auditor General and his comments upon the conduct of business during the preceding financial j'ear?

I suggest that the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) should ask the Auditor-General to -expedite the preparation of his annual report so that it may be available to honourable members while the budget is under consideration. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. -Chifley) talked about the financial nestegg that the Labour Government had bequeathed to this Government. The truth is that the Chifley Government left a nest-egg of dishonest finance to its successor, a perfect example of the misuse of trust moneys. For example, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Labour Government had set aside £37,000,000 of the £67,000,000 that must be found for war gratuity payments in 1951. cash! It has gone. The money was used to redeem treasury-bills. Chifley Government made use of that fund when it should have raised loans or drawn upon revenue instead. It had no right to u3e trust money in that way. Any private individual who adopted the same method of finance would soon find himself in trouble. What would happen to a lawyer who appropriated money handed to him to be placed in trust and afterwards told the rightfu l owner, "" I have invested it in my business""? He would be liable to drastic penalties. Yet that is the sort of procedure that was followed hy the Ohifley Government! The nest-egg of which the Leader of the Opposition boasts does not exist. Certainly there is a credit entry on the books, but the money is not there. The same fate befell the £130,000,000 of the National Welfare Fund. I agree that the Chifley Government reduced the nation's treasury-bill indebtedness, bnt it did so by using funds that should have been left intact. It redeemed It has not changed the treasury-bills with war gratuity money, national welfare money, and other trust moneys. It used those funds in order to pay the ordinary accounts of government, wrote credit entries in the books, and then told the people, "" The money is invested. It is waiting to be used "". The result is that this Government is now faced with the task of finding £67,000,000 for war gratuity payments and, if it were called upon to do so, it would be required also to produce the whole of the £130,000,000 that is supposed to be in the National Welfare Fund but is not there. There has been a grave misuse of trust moneys. The Chifley Government set aside all the standards of conduct that the ordinary man applies to the handling of trust funds and frittered away as petty cash the so-called nest-egg of which the LeaderI know that it is true. of the Opposition has spoken. Having disposed of the money, it merely made a credit entry in the books. This Government now has the responsibility of finding funds to replace it . The Leader of the Opposition also spoke of incentive payments and increased production. In an attempt to bolster his argument, he asked what would be gained if engine-drivers increased the travelling speed of the Melbourne to Albury express. That was a The ridiculous illustration. It was a silly line of argument for a man who has been Prime Minister of Australia to advance. The right honourable gentleman completely ignored the fact that we need to increase production in our basic industries. The Melbourne to Albury express could probably travel faster if it used more coal. We need more coal. If the speed of the train were increased by that means, fares and freight charges could he reduced, with the result that the cost of goods over the counter would f a l l as well.

I invite the honourable member to come with me and plead with them if necessary. Let us talk to them about the profit motive, that parrot cry of the honorof explaining to him. These economic able member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). Is not the honourable member for Hindmarsh actuated by the profit motive ? individual in the community is actuated by the profit motive. The man on the basic wage, the man on a wage margin, the man in business for himself, and the man receiving a huge salary are all actuated by a desire to secure in return for their services a remuneration that will provide them with a surplus of money over their living costs. They want the extra money in order to purchase luxury or additional comfort and in order to provide security for the future. If they lacked the profit motive, they would never get anywhere and would be satisfied with a bare existence. Everybody is actuated by the profit motive because he wants to enjoy something better in life than a mere livelihood. The trouble with our economy to-day is that too many people are greedily seeking too great a reward for their services. I am speaking, not of the fellow who gains his profit from the goods that he sells, but of the fellow who gains his profit from the service that he gives. That man is not giving fair service. honourable member mean ? is not pulling his weight and giving sermember consider that the wool-growers vice equal in value to the money that he are able to expend their own money to receives. Members of the Opposition have had can expend it? something to say about the £103,000,000 that will provide for the pre-payment interjection by the honourable member for of income tax for wool-growers. The Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) is simple. attack was led by the honourable The prices of the materials that the woolmember for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley), growers require are inflated at present who suggested that the scheme would because of lack of productive effort on the not modify the effect of the inflapart of supporters of the Labour party. tionary spiral but would merely transfer They are not producing the quantum £103,000,000 from the pockets of the per man-hour that they should produce, wool-growers to the coffers of the Government so that the Government, instead of the wool-growers, would spend the money. The honourable member was merely voicing an opinion that was expressed in Western Australia by a professor of economics whose error I had the pleasure theorists do not get down to tintacks. They do not know the facts. For instance, the professor and the honourable member for Fremantle did not take into account the fact that the Government would have to find £103,000,000 elsewhere if it did not get it from the wool-growers and would thusadd to the inflationary spiral. There is some excuse for the professor's oversight. The honourable member for Fremantle may have heen aware of the fact but, if so, he did not admit to the knowledge. If the Government had to find £103,000,000 from another source, the result would be that a total of £206,000,000 would be thrown into the nation's spending pool. The Government is committed to certain definite non-recurring expenditure this year. War gratuity payments will amount to £67,000,000, and the nest-egg of £37.000.000 of which the Lahour party boasts does not exist. Therefore, the Government would have to borrow the money or tax the people more heavily. I am not arguing the merits or demerits of the wool prenavment plan, but I am analysing the fallacious idea that the Government proposes merely to transfer a certain sum from one source of expenditure to another. The Government will expend that amount of money, bnt its proposal will obviate the necessity to find another amount of £103,000,000 in this financial year. better advantage than the Government",84,Speaker Order

The Government will be doing the wool-growers and any other section of the community in similar circumstances a favour if it says to them, "" Do not expend your money on. materials at the inflated prices for which the unproductive efforts of supporters of the Labour party are responsible. ""Wait until prices are more reasonof our national economy. I refer particuable "". I , personally, favour a compulsory national savings tax to assist our economic position. I deplore the statement by the Leader of the Opposition that there is a limit to which a government can go in allocating money for defence purposes. I invite the right honourable gentleman to inform the House of his opinion of what that limit is. sition is right. Opposition, the honourable member for Cunningham and any other member of the Opposition prepared to put a price on Australia's liberty? If they are, will they state what that price shall be? I suggest that the statement by the Leader of the Opposition is tantamount to saying, "" There is a limit to which I shall defend my honour, my wife's -honour and the honour of my family "". The right honourable gentleman says, in effect, "" I shall put up my hands so high, but no higher "". Such a statement by a man who has held the responsible position of Prime Minister is shocking at this time. Another man said on another occasion, "" N ot a man, not a shilling for defence"". The Leader of the Opposition did not repeat that remark, but he said that there was a limit to which a government could go in allocating money for defence purposes. I disagree with that opinion. I believe that there is no limit in that respect. Those of my confreres and I who were in Tobruk did not say, "" There is a limit to which we shall go in making a sacrifice. We shall give a toe, but not a leg "". That attitude would be just as reasonable as was the statement of the Leader of the Opposition. We cannot count the price of safeguarding Australia's welfare and liberty. Opposition, members may be prepared to put a price on preserving the liberty of their own families, but I say N 2 1165 that no price is too high to pay for the maintenance of our freedom. I emphasize the need for urgency in undertaking defence works, and I suggest that the Government should call a conference of defence chiefs and of State developmental authorities with a view to making a list of major defence works that could also contribute to the development larly to road-making. There is a dire necessity for action in that respect in Western Australia, and especially to that part of the State that is north of Perth. There is at present an agitation for the construction of a coastal road through this area. I do not know whether that project would be wise from a defence standpoint, but I emphasize the urgent need for lateral roads. Eor a distance of 200 miles north of Perth, there is not a first-class lateral road that i? capable of carrying heavy traffic. A conference between defence authorities and local authorities in Western Australia should be able to reach an agreement on the most suitable routes for strategic and national developmental purposes. Should such plans be made, the Treasurer should carefully supervise the allocation of money under the Commonwealth Aid Eoads and Works Agreement to the State governments. The local authorities in all the States complain that they are not getting a fair deal from the respective State governments, which, it is alleged, are expending money unwisely, whilst the cost of their works is excessive. A. series of conferences between the defence authorities and local governing bodies in each State should be able to agree upon the routes of strategic roads that are urgently, required in various parts of the Commonwealth. We should be able to feel confident that we are well equipped to resist any danger that may confront us in future, and the advantage will be twofold if works for tbe purposes of defence can also make a contribution to our national development.

Actually, this bill is a part of the budget that provides for an expenditure of £73S,700,000 for the services of the Commonwealth and makes provision for revenue of £738,700,000. I feel that, when we are considering those vast sums of money in this cloistered seclusion of Canberra, there is a danger that we may adopt an unrealistic approach. In this rather delightful place, and sitting in this air-conditioned chamber, we are apt to get away from the realities of life, and to forget that the really important consideration in our discussion of this proposed expenditure is how our deliberations affect the ordinary men and women who live in tbe suburbs of Melbourne or of Sydney, or in the country, in their efforts to balance their family budgets. Perhaps some of the speeches that we have heard in this debate have furthered that air of unreality, and distracted our attention from what should be the true basis of our discussions. This afternoon, the honourable for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), man of great ability and knowledge, made a disgraceful speech. He should have dealt with matters of urgent importance, but he indulged in vicious character assassination, and a smear campaign, which are the usual technique of the Communists, dislike. He disgraced the Parliament devoting all his time to violent personal attacks upon memhers of the Labour party. I suggest that we should concentrate our attention namely, how do our decisions affect the ordinary people, the small people in the community? phically described the position, our £1 is bleeding to death. its value, and it is necessary that we effect some blood transfusions Australian £1 so that, if we cannot restore its purchasing power, at least we shall prevent it from drifting and prevent prices, and a decrease of our standard of living. affected in this matter is the average housewife.

It is an unfortunate but an undeniable fact that our womenfolk are showing the strain of the economic position, of trying to save a little money by buying here and there in order to make ends meet. As a result of that continual battle, their health is suffering, and they are showing signs of worry and of strain. One of the most alarming developments that has resulted from the inflationary spiral in this country is that many mothers of young families are being forced to go to work, not because they wish to do so, but because of sheer necessity in order that they may bring a little more money into the household with which to purchase the necessaries of life for their children. Whilst they are so engaged, their children are neglected to some degree. I have spoken to school teachers in niy electorate about this matter, and they say that the number of mothers of young families who go to work is really astonishing. The children member are left to care for themselves, and that who is a factor alone is laying the foundation of social problems, which are directly attributable to the fact that the Australian national £1 is bleeding to death and that the Government is taking no action to restore its purchasing power, and remove those whom he professes to causes that are affecting the health of by our womenfolk.

It is well known that the majority of the members of the Liberal party were in favour of revaluation and of the abolition of that artificial exchange rate whereby £1.25 Australian is worth only £100 sterling. However, the majority of the members of the Liberal party were prevented from giving effect to their views on revaluation by the veto that was exercised by members of the Australian Country party. The honourable member for Lowe said that there were no democratic processes in the Labour party. Yet we have witnessed the amazing spectacle of the coalition government considering a matter of vital importance to the country, the majority of its supporters being in favour of revaluation, and the minority exercising its veto power, thereby preventing the Government from taking that action. Yet they are the people who complain of the alleged lack of observance of democratic processes by members of the Opposition.

WhilstI do not subscribe higher than the national wool cheque to the point of view that there should be in .any pre-war year. However, this continual warfare between employers and year an additional £200,000,000 will be employees, I am driven to the conclusion placed in the hands of the wool-growers. that there cannot he any real and efTective Through them, it will find its way into co-operation between them until the circulation, and will undoubtedly aggraemployers display a new approach to vate very seriously tbe present inflaindustrial relationships. .1 believe in the tion. It is imperative that we deal private ownership of property and I do not believe that the State should attempt to take over industries, except public utilities or monopolies which are exploiting the community. However, if thu system of private ownership is to function in the interests of the people, the worker must not be regarded any longer as a mere cog in the machine, whose sole duty is to do what he is told, without having any responsibility other than to perform his task. In my opinion the present system, which precludes the employee from taking any responsibility for the management of industry, has a great deal to do with the unsatisfactory state of our industrial relationships. We need a new approach to the problems of industry, and we require from employers an expression of their willingness to enter into co-partnership with their employees so that their employees may have a voice in the conduct of industry. That principle of co-partnership should include a sharing of the profits between employers and employees. When that is achieved, honourable members opposite may appeal with confidence for greater ""speed-up"" sharing. I pass now to another matter that is aggravating the current now with this problem, which should be considered, in my opinion, from three aspects. In the first place, we must dispose of the extra purchasing power by freezing it in some way. Secondly, we must take effective action to ensure that the price of manufactured woollen goods iii. this country shall not soar beyond tbe small, so that the precentage of the divireach of the people. Thirdly, the problem should be attacked, not from the sectional angle of imposing some unfair or discriminatory tax upon the wool growers, but on some principle that will safeguard our economy while doing justice to them. I think that the plan propounded by Professor Copland is unsound. He suggested that the wool growers should be subjected to a special sectional tax of 33-J per cent, on their income. Whilst the imposition of sucb a tax would undoubtedly drain off one-third of the surplus money coming into the country from the sale of wool, it would discriminate most unfairly against one section of the community. Why did not Professor Copland include in his proposal all persons who are making excessive profits? I have in mind particularly the huge profits made by the distributors of motor cars. In the last fortnight I have noticed the balance sheets of two motor car distributing firms, wbich show that they are paying dividends of 110 per cent, and 60 per cent, respectively. Those dividends indicate that the firms have scandalously exploited the people. Why should such profiteers go scot-free whilst the wool growers are to be taxed so heavily ? will take care of the profiteers. Mr W. M . BOURKE -We shall be procedure would have the additional merit most interested to hear the details of the that it would not involve any unfair treatexcess profits tax. I will not permit the honourable member to make more than a general reference to the excess profits tax during this which that will have upon the local selldebate. of each of the companies which paid such was prepared to recommend to the Goa high dividend? Mr W. M. BOURKE I have not the be fixed for the sale of wool in this coundetails with me. Undoubtedly the firms try. I bad in mind that wool intended concerned cooked up their balance-sheets; for home consumption should be sold to hut, even after watering down their profits, they still paid those extraordinary dividends of 110 per cent, and 60 per cent. panies concerned might have been very dend may not be a fair indication of the profits that they actually made. Mr W. M . BOURKE I can assure the honourable member that his supposition is not correct. I have been forbidden by the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker to discuss the details of the proposed excess profits tax, therefore I shall make only one further comment on the manner in which I suggest the huge additional income from our wool should bedisposed of. There is a precedent for the suggestion that I am about to make in the action taken by the Government at the beginning of the recent war in respect of the surplus funds of the trading banks. At the beginning of the war the trading hanks had huge surplus deposits, and the Government considered that if that money were permitted to be circulated by the banks it would cause serious inflation. It therefore froze the surplus funds of the trading banks by ordering them to deposit those funds in the Commonwealth Bank. A low rate of interest was paid on them, and the trading banks now have deposits of £451,200,000 in the special accounts that were established for that purpose. It appears to me that similar action might be taken in respect of the surplus income received by the wool-growers. The money could be frozen in trust accounts, and so be prevented from going into circulation. That ment of the wool-growers. The second problem raised by the high price ofwool is concerned with the effect ing price of woollen goods.

399,Mr Bowden,"The capital of tbe comthe trade at 24d. per lb. instead of at the prevailing price of 63d. per lb. However, the Minister rejected my proposal contemptuously, and said that the Government would not consider it. . It is interesting to recall that similar schemes to regulate the home consumption price of certain products have already been operating in Anstralia for some time. For example, although lead and zinc are sold on the overseas market for £160 and £180 a ton respectively, they are sold on the home market for £65 a ton. A similar scheme operates in respect of wheat and other primary produce. Why, then, should not a similar scheme to regulate the home consumption price of wool be introduced? If no action is taken to regulate the home consumption price of wool the effect upon the present high cost of living will be most serious. I suggest that the wool-growers sbould adopt a national outlook in this matter, and should undertake voluntarily to make available for home consumption sufficient wool to meet our annual requirements for, say, 24d. per lb. on this basis. An amount of £20,000,000 a year would be sufficient to finance a scheme for a home consumption price for wool. I turn now to the position of the manufacturing industries in Australia. Our manufacturing industries have been built up under a system of protection. I am a firm believer in that system, which has, in my opinion, been responsible for tbe extraordinary development of our secondary industries and for the exploitation of the national resources of Australia, and I consider that a continuance of that policy is essential to the prosperity of Australia. However, it cannot be denied that any system of protection is open to serious abuses. The protection can be excessive, and tbe effect of excessive protection is to force up the cost of manufactured goods to unjustifiable levels, thus adding to our inflationary troubles. I shall quote from page 6 of the annual report of the Tariff Board for the year ended the 30th June, 1950, which states. . . excessive protection leaves the way open for inefficiency, wasteful expenditure on labour and materials and excessive prices and profits. Taken advantage of in this way, excessive protection would be a source of danger to our internal economy . . . [39] The report continuesThe board has encountered circumstances whicli suggest that, whilst the profit element in price is not unreasonable, cost elements have not been under effective control, and prices based on those costs have been unduly high. That statement of the. Tariff Board shows that there have been certain abuses of the protection system, and that as a result, costs and prices have become too high. The board suggests that in order to obviate those abuses it should make a sampling of the trading results of protected industries to enable some sort of periodical review to be made. I suggest to honourable members that it is very necessary that there should be some system of regular review of the operations of protected industries in this country, so that the community can be protected against exploitation through any of these industries taking undue advantage of the protection that this country has gladly and willingly afforded to them, but not for the purpose of exploiting the community or of taking undue advantage of the tariff barriers. We have to be on. our guard to ensure that, through the operation of our protection policy, we shall not allow great monopolies to develop here and exploit the public ruthlessly. In my opinion insufficient attention has been given by this Parliament to the development of monopolies in Australia. We have rapacious monopolies in this country, one of which J shall mention by name. I refer to Australian Consolidated Industries. Those monopolies have been developed under our protection system, and have taken advantage of tariff barriers in order not merely to develop legitimately the industry in which they are engaged but also to establish themselves in a position of monopoly so that they can eliminate all competition and, having reached that stage, they proceed ruthlessly to exploit the community. There is no doubt that the firm that I bave mentioned was entitled to protection, because it was very important that we should have a glass manufacturing industry in this country. That industry, however, is now in a state of monopoly. It has used the most ruthless and unsavoury methods to develop that monopoly. The housewives of this country do not realize how much tribute they pay into the coffers of that monopoly. Every time a housewife huys a bottle of milk or a jar of honey or tomato sauce, she pays tribute to the glass monopoly. If she were to ask her milkman how much be has to pay each week for milk bottles she would learn how much comes out of her housekeeping money to swell the profits of the monopoly. It seems to me that in the past the motto of this Parliament has been "" Bust no trusts"". I suggest that we change that motto to "" We shall bust those trusts "". I hope that in the course of the session we shall hear more of these monopolies and shall have an opportunity to examine their ramifications and the manner in which, as well as the methods by which, they have heen exploiting the people by forcing up the prices of essential commodities in a matter so concealed that the people do not realize what is happening. If we can tackle those problems we shall be making a contribution towards improving the standards of living o.i: the people, by reducing prices ancl costs. .BeforeI conclude I should like to make just one comment upon another factor which is contributing to the inflationary spiral. We have the evil of monopolies on the one hand, ancl on the other hand we have an evil that is closely associated with monopolies-the twin evil of communism. There is no doubt that the policy of the leaders of the Communist party in this country has been to sabotage industry ancl production so as to force up prices and to increase the inflationary spiral so that the standards of living of the workers will be depressed to a point at which the revolutionary situation that the Communists aim at will be reached. They hope, thereby, to be able to seize power in this country. There are methods whereby the menace of communism can bo dealt with effectively. I do not believe that the methods adopted by the Government will achieve success. The Communist Party Dissolution Bill about which we have heard so much will not make much of a contribution to a solution of the problem of communism. But there are methods which I hope that we shall be able to develop later, whereby we can deal with those twin evils that are Sir. TV. tt. Bourke. the curse of the community-monopolie s on the one hand and communism on the other. If we can get rid of those two evils we shall be on the road to making Australia a real democracy, not only in the political sense but also in the economic sense, so that we shall be able to raise standards of living to the level which every one in this country is entitled to enjoy. During this debate a number of different aspects of the present position have been discussed, but let us get down to some hard facts. On the 20th Deceniber last, ten days after the general election, the Priine Minister( Mr Menzies) made his first radio broadcast to the people as their political leader. During his speech he made the following statement:We hope to attack our tasks boldly. The greatest of them all, I am sure you will agree witb me, will be to arrest the present alarming rise in costs and prices and so put value back into the money tliat you earn and spend. Those last few words bear repetition. They areand so put value back into the money that you earn and spend. He continuedWe have just hud an election in which we have been given your votes, and therefore entrusted with your confidence. How he has betrayed that confidence! What has he done to carry out the tasks that he said he would attack boldly? What has he done to put value back into ""the f l ? First, in his vanity and selfassurance, he thought, having gained the confidence of the people, that he would set about lecturing those same people. So he preached up and down the country. He went on the air and launched a series of lectures on what the people should do. He said that they sbould do this and they should do that. But he said nothing about what he should do in the way of attacking boldly the task of putting value back into the £1. He just carried on the policy of deceit, untruth and inaccuracies that he subscribes to in common with all hi? colleagues. He and those colleagues have done nothing but attack organized trade unionism, thus insulting the real and only producers of this country. What has the purchasing power of the £1 amounted to since the Prime Minister",89,Speaker Order
400,Mr Curtin (Watson) [10.7],"made hia series of broadcasts soon after he was elected to office? It has almost vanished. In the confusion, the right honourable gentleman attempted, as cunningly as usual-the Prime Minister is very cunning-to raise a smokescreen to obscure the real issue that facet! the country. He thinks that by doing so he can delude the people again, but he has forgotten that the housewife has to go shopping every day, and that day by day she has found that his promises are, after all, like the promises that he and members of his party have made in the past-empty , hollow and valueless. Already one of his high-ranking Ministers, the Minister for National Development ( Mr Oasey) is alarmed about the position. In fact he is so alarmed that he made a broadcast in which he called a halt to the deception practised by the Prime Minister and, in effect, told him to get back to the policy that he had preached on the hustings prior to the general election. He saidInflation is our No. 1 problem. even, is only secondary. What an alarming statement for him to make! Defence is only secondary to inflation! That shows what the Minister for National Development thinks of the tralian Oountry party-Liberal party iniflationary spiral that threatens to enGovernment. gulf Australia. On top of that, we had another high-ranking Minister, the Mintactics to split the trade union movement ister for Labour and National Service assunder, but they are doomed to failure ( Mr Holt) making a remarkable statebecause the trade union movement to-day ment to the press. He saidWe are the victims of our own pre-election life. It could not be in better hands. propaganda. That statement should be enough to make movement by making allegations against all members of the Liberal-Australian Albert Monk and against Jack Ferguson, Country party coalition Government hide whose boots members of the Government their heads in shame.

Despite losses of production during the strike in June and August of 1949 the annual output of black and brown coal for 1949-50 was at the same level as was reached in 1948-49. However, our population is expanding and so are our induslong it takes them to shift cargo from tries. Industrial expansion has been remarkable during the last ten years under the able guidance of the gentleman who is now Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), so that the pressure of demand has been so intensified that the supplies of fuel and power are still far from adequate for the needs of the community. The report of the Commonwealth Bank goes on to state that the output of iron and steel, which rose steadily after the war until it had exceeded the pre-war level, again under the leadership of the right honourable member for Macquarie, but which fell below that level in 1948-49, rose again this year. So much for the venom and spite that honourable members opposite have hurled against the good members of the community, the miners who go into the pits never knowing whether they are going to come up again and who work under the most disgusting conditions possible. ber ever been down a mine? Labour has never been down a mine in his life. mines than has the honourable member. He should not talk such nonsense. anything about mines he would do something to alleviate the conditions under which the miners work. Many of those men live in shacks on a hillside. In stead of criticizing the efforts of the Labour Government, honourable members opposite would do something for the miners if they knew of their conditions. The only hope for coal production is production, employment, huilding and conState ownership. I hope that, in the struction and other investment as well as in near future, coal mines will be taken fulloverseas trade and in incomes generally. The from the coal barons and handed back still being impeded by shortages of labour, to the people to whom they belong. The waterside workers have also been criticized by the Minister for Labour and National Service for their slow turnround of ships. As usual, fools rush in where angels fear to tread. The Minister would not, of course, go to his masters, the shipowners, and ask them what equipment they have on the wharfs and how their unloaded ships which they store in the sheds on the wharfs so as to evade the cost of storing tbem in bond. That is the reason why ships are anchored in midstream and can be brought to the wharfs only at intervals. Modern equipment such as fork lifts can alleviate the heavy conditions of the waterside worker. Let the Minister inspect the wharfs in Sydney and other places and he may be able to do bis job in a fit and proper manner. The Minister for Labour and National Service is prepared to take notice of those advisers. How happy is the Government to get a team of experts and professors who would not know their way on to a wharf unless they went in a taxi-cab! The ship-owner cracks the whip and when he talks the Liberal party pales into insignificance and goes back into its shell, otherwise no finance would be provided for the next general election. "" What is to blame,"" the Minister for Labour and National Service asks, "" for this lack of production? The 40-hour week! "" Listen to this, workers of Australia! The Government wants to take from you the 40-hour week, holiday pay and sick leave-you r hard-won conditions which have been made possible over the I have been down more years only by Labour governments. This Government would make a man work even when he was sick. That is what it thinks of the average worker. I have seen sick men come to work for the simple reason that they could not afford to stay at home. That happened years ago when there was no provision for sick leave in awards. By means of determination and organization, sick leave came to be inserted in awards.

The trade union movement will not be bludgeoned into co-operating with an anti-Labour government. the problem of putting value back into the £1 is to return a Labour government. be given freely as it was in wartime when the workers sacrificed their hard-won conditions and allowed themselves to be conscripted. The trade union movement allowed itself to be conscripted in war-time and thus demonstrated the patriotic spirit that exists only in the working class. Honourable members opposite know that the trade union movement would co-operate freely with a Labour government. That is why they are trying to split the movement and obtain the support of sections of it. Fortunately the trade unions are wide awake and the people have realized that their legs are being pulled. I understand the uneasiness of honorahle members opposite. This is tbeir first stay in Canberra and it will be their last. Let them make the best of it because there is nothing surer tban that, at the next general election, there will be a landslide and Ministers who are grinning now will bite the dust. Honourable members opposite can see the writing on the wall, otherwise they would not whine about cooperation. Why do we not co-operate? Why do we not help this Government, the members of which stood on the platform before the last general election, backed by millions of pounds supplied hy the banks and otber exploiters of the people, such as the food racketeers and the black marketeers. to handle the situation. A minister of religion, the Reverend G. R. van Methodist Mission, has been reported as follows in the Sydney Daily Mirror of the 14th August:Around the Mission alone I have seen scores of children with malnutrition sores. In been criticized in this House. The the past few months irreparable harm has Labour party is accused of obeying been done to children. Their constitution has been undermined because their parents can only afford to give them bread and sausage or jam. The plight of old-age pensioners was probably the worse of all, he said. A large number had died as a direct result of starvation. I think that we would rather accept the word of the reverend minister who said that than the statements of honourable members opposite. ber's interjection is very offensive to the Co-operation will then religious section of the community. Miss Molly Baker, chief dietition at the Sydney Hospital, was reported, in the Sydney Sun of the 3rd August, as having saidA housewife must spend a minimum of 25s. a week on food for each member of the family, if they are to be normally healthy. She said also that thissum does not take into account, luxuries such as biscuits, bacon, sugar, jam, bread, tea and coffee. I ask honourable members: are they luxuries? Is that the state into which this great country has fallen through the incompetence and ineptitude of the Government? Honorahle members on the Government side can laugh; the company directors, bank managers, solicitors wbo hang on to the coat-tails of the bank managers, the stock and station agents and all the rest of them can laugh, but what I am saying is the truth. Ali those gentlemen on the Government side did not laugh on the day of our last general election when at the bidding of the bankers they were only too eager to swallow their pride and hand out how-tovote cards. The whip was cracked by the bankers and they had to obey. They knew that they would fall from their high positions if the banks went down. The banks wanted to remain in their position on top, irrespective of the feelI t has not the ability ings of their employees. One solicitor that I have in mind went to his brother, a manager of the commercial Eerde, of the South Sydney bank, and craved selection for what he thought was a certain Liberal seat.

413,Mr Curtin,"The honourable mema junta. The Labour party organization in a State, such as New South Wales for instance, consists of this so called junta that is composed of delegates from all the trade unions. All the electorate branches send tbeir delegates to the able member for Watson( Mr Curtin), annual conference and each State conference selects two delegates to the federal executive. The delegates from all the States of Australia assemble in the federal executive, which is the supreme body of the Labour party. I am proud to say that we all obey unhesitatingly the decisions of our executive because that is -how the Labour movement continues to be a 9trong and vigorous movement. Moreover, the Labour party never changes its name. For the 60 years that have elapsed since its formation it has remained for the benefit of the people of Australia. the Labour party. Within that period I can remember the anti-Labour parties changing their names on fifteen different occasions. themselves the Liberal party, the United Australia party, All for Australia party, the Protection Party, and so on. But they have remained throughout the exploiters of the people. Of course, tbey have their ""stooges"", just as Hitler had Herr van de Lubbe. I see such men opposite, who were prepared to sell their souls, irrespective of the welfare of the people of Australia, in order to gain selection from the bankers. There are no ballots in the Liberal party similar to those in the Labour party; at least there was not such a one in my electorate. Thirty gentlemen came from Ash-street to Maroubra Junction and selected a man named Card. He was manoeuvred out by a man named Osborne in a previous selection for the seat of Evans. The liberal party wanted Mr Card to discipline the members of his union into accepting inferior rates and conditions in their employment with the private banks. I was selected from a group of nineteen by popular ballot. Honourable members on the Government side have been castigating the Labour party because of its methods, but the methods of the Government parties are beyond redemption. In conclusion, I wish to say something about the honourable member for Mackellar ("" Mr Wentworth). He has a bit of a kink, but we shall excuse him for that Mr Curtin. The honourable member's time has expired. surer) [10.37] -in reply-The honorwho has just resumed his seat, has proved the consistency of the Opposition, because he, parrot-like, reiterated the cry which has been resounding throughout the chamber from honourable members opposite since this debate commenced. He referred to the worn-out charge of the Labour party that this Government is not putting value back into the £1. This Government has achieved comparatively more than did any other government in the short time that it has been in power, It has done that against the opposition of the most destructive methods that ever coufronted any government. The GovernThey have called ment realizes that the basis of putting value back into the £1 and of automatic price-fixation is production adequate to meet the industrial requirements of this nation. As a first act towards that end, we lifted petrol rationing to allow producers of goods to send their goods freely by road without the restriction and hindrance of a shortage of petrol. Our next act was to remedy something about which the previous Government had procrastinated. We subsidized the price of bread in this country by giving to the wheat-growers 7d. a bushel to meet the increased cost of production. Also left for us to do, as the result of procrastination by the Labour Government, was the granting of a subsidy for butter, based upon the cost of production. That had been artfully dodged by the previous Government. Then we set about getting basic materials into this country. We were confronted with the spectacle of the need to import steel and coal in order adequately to shelter onr people and to ensure that the migration policy of the Government should be carried out. It is hard to imagine the necessity for importing steel and coal into a country such as Australia, which has such vast natural resources with which to provide these essential materials. Not only did we import them, but we subsidized the importation of them by other authorities.",94,Speaker Order
414,Mr Deputy Speakeb,Order!,95,Speaker Order
415,Mr Fadden (Mcpherson,"TreaWc also subsidized the importation of prefabricated houses, timber and many other materials that are needed to expand the housing programme of this country. We revised, amended, altered and removed duties and restrictions so that materials for housing and other basic materials, the shortage of which was a legacy from the previous Government, could be brought into this country. We realized that production is the measuring stick for everything. The main factors retarding the production of this country were Communist interruption, Communist control and Communist sabotage throughout the industrial life and the trade union movement of Australia. We expeditiously brought down a bill to deal with Communists as traitors in any decent country should be dealt with. What cooperation and assistance from the Opposition did we receive in our attempt to deal with the Communist menace? When honourable members 'opposite talk about putting value back into the £1 they should remember that they would havo better"" served Australia if they had helped this Government to put the Communist disrupters into the poupid. The honourable member for Watson read a statement which he attributed to a reverend gentleman, directing attention to malnutrition in Sydney. He painted a very gloomy picture of circumstances which no decent government should allow to exist unobserved and unremedied. But where do those circumstances exist? The honourable member claims that they exist in Sydney. Sydney is in the honourable member's home State, and the Government of New South Wales is a Labour government undeith<j premiership of nutrition in Sydney, why did not the Labour Government long ago take steps to overcome it? Why did' not the Labour-governed States take advantage of the generous and sensible offer of my colleague, the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) of free milk to help remedy any possible malnutrition? Honourable members should also remember that if there is any such malnutrition it is a legacy from the previous Government. If there is malnutrition of the rising generation of Australians the State Labour government* should take immediate steps to remedy it, and one of the best ways in which they can start is by accepting the Australian Government's offer of free milk for, the children of those States. I advise honourable members opposite to clean their own floors before criticizing those of anybody else. They should look at their own record before they try to cast blame on the record of this Government. They should also consider the activity, or tbe lack of activity, of the Labour Governinent of New South Wales. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) asked me to explain what appeared to hini to be inconsistencies in the framing of the Estimates now before the Honse. As I explained in my second-reading speech, it has been the general practice in respect of Snpply hills to estimate the amounts required on the basis of the provision that had been made in .the Estimates for the preceding year. Under this measure, however, it has been necessary to make provision for the increases of salaries that have been granted under various awards, including the recent Castieau award covering public servants, increases of the cost of living during the last twelve months, and the higher rate of expenditure that has resulted from rising costs. Therefore, this bill has been prepared on the basis of requirements for six months as was set out in the Estimates that I submitted to the House last week, less the amount appropriated under the Supply Act that was passed in June last. Under that measure provision was made for a period of four months on the basis of last year's Estimates. Under the measure now before the Chair, no provision has been made for new services. The provision for salaries, pay ancl general services in the defence departments has been similarly calculated, but it has been necessary, owing to a technical difficulty, to make provision for six months, that is, until the 31st December next, in respect of defence works and equipment services that were in hand on the 30th June last. The transfer of those services in the Estimates for 1950-51 from works to ordinary services will render inoperative the appropriation granted to them in the",95,Speaker Order
416,"Mr Mcgirr. Therefore, If There Is Mal","Supply (Works and Services) Act that was passed in June last. The fact that that provision for defence works and services has been made in this Supply bill is the principal reason for the increases of expenditure in respect of the navy and army departments as compared with the estimates set out in the first Supply bill in respect of which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr vernment adjusted sales tax on certain Chifley) sought the information that I have just given. The Leader of the Opposition, with characteristic repetition, pointed with pride to the financial record of his Government. He endeavours to propagate the idea that his Government managed the national finances wisely and left them in a sound position. That is one of the myths that he is endeavouring to spread about the Labour Government and its achievements. His claim is completely baseless, and its exposure is long overdue. with pride the statement that Labour balanced its budget in tbe two post-war years. Rut how did it do that? The fact is that Labour financed the war and post-war expenditures by extravagant taxation During the Labour regime the public debt increased by more than £1,300,000,000. Interest and sinking fund payments on -that additional debt now represent a burden of approximately £45,000,000 a year. Labour managed to balance the budget in two post-war years mainly by keeping taxation rates too high for too long. But apart from those two years, 1947-4S and 1948-49, the Labour Government had a series of enormous deficits which it met by either raising loans or borrowing from the central bank; and it resorted to those means at a time when wages, prices and costs generally were controlled. finances very seriously out of balance. The Leader of the Opposition, in the last budget that he brought down when he was Treasurer, budgeted for a deficit of £35,000,000, but despite an increase of £35,000,000 in revenue over the estimates during the year, the result was an actual deficit of £25,000,000. It is clear that, had Labour remained in office it would have been obliged to budget for an enormous deficit in the current financial year. Mr Fadden. The honourable member for Eremantle' ( Mr ""Beazley) alleged that although, when I was in Opposition, I listed a number of items that should be exempt from sales tax, I have not made provision in my budget to reduce sales tax on any of those items. That statement is incorrect. In the first place, following representations by me, the Chifley Go.items. Secondly, in framing my budget I have given special consideration to the removal of the remaining anomalies about which I complained when I was in Opposition. TJnder the budget proposals .those anomalies will be removed in respect of such items as tractor-drawn trailers for use in agriculture, certain building materials including bath heaters and sink heaters, ice, certain foodstuffs closely connected with goods previously exempt from sales tax, and wedding rings. The honourable member for Fremantle at We are asked to accept least admitted, and I have been saying so for some time, that whatever paper provision the Labour Government may have claimed to have made for the payment of war gratuity, the hard fact remains that the present Government will have to find and enormous borrowings. every penny of the £67,000,000 that is still outstanding in respect of war gratuity and that it will have to be paid on the 3rd March next. The Government will have to meet that commitment either by borrowing or by imposing additional taxes, and it has made provision in the budget to honour the nation's obligation to ex-service personnel. However, the honourable member for Fremantle is still labouring under the mistaken impression that the Labour Government, in some way, stored up purchasing power. Nothing of the sort occurred, because, as I have already said, what the Labour Government did was to claim credit, both Labour left the national for making a paper provision for the payment of war gratuity and for spending the cash involved to reduce treasury bill indebtedness. The result is that the present Government must now find either by extra taxation or by borrowing the cash that will be involved in the payment of the gratuity. The honourable member for Fremantle also said that the effect of the Government's proposed expenditure on stock-piling to meet our defence needs [19 OCTOBEB, will have an inflationary effect. He was in error in making that statement because the bulk of the material on which that money will be expended will be imported, and, therefore, the effect of such expenditure will he not inflationary but deflationary. The honourable member further took the Government to task with respect to the provision that is being made in the budget for relief for pensioners. He claimed that when in October, 1948, the age pension was increased to £2 2s. 6d. a week it represented 36.64 per cent, of the then basic wage whereas to-day the proportion is much less. Tbe fact is that when the Labour Government was ejected from office the pension was still £2 2s. 6d. general administrative activities. Tbe whereas the basic wage was £6 9s. so that the percentage then had decreased to 32.9 per cent. When this Government proposed to increase the age pension by 7s. 6d. a week the percentage of the pension in relation to the basic wage which, at that time, was £6 18s., would have been increased to 36.2 per cent. That proposal was made before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court announced its decision last week to increase tbe -basic wage by £1 a week. Although the basic wage increased by 15s. between October, 1948,' and December, 1949, the Labour Government, which was then in office, made no attempt to increase pensions during that period. Yet honourable members opposite have had the audacity to take this Government to task and to claim that it has not dealt expeditiously with the age pension. The proposed increase of 7s. 6d. a week will be the largest single increase that will have been made in pensions since the inception of federation. Honourable members opposite have debate; report adopted. made respect to the number of public servants Puhlic Service. They have alleged that the Government has done nothing to reduce the number of public servants. The amendment. honourable member for Fremantle said that when I was in Opposition I contended that the most urgent problem was the reduction of the number of public servants and then went on to say that the number has since increased by 30,000. That figure is incorrect. Figures that the Prime Minister( MrI had intended to discuss two matters on 1950.] (No. 2) 1950-51. 1177 Menzies) cited on the 27 th September reveal that the total number of persons employed by the Australian Government and its agencies, excluding members of the defence forces, numbered 197,000 when the present government took office and that that number had increased to 201,000 as at the 30th June last. Thus, the increase was approximately only 4,000. That increase occurred abnost entirely in the Postal Department and in the number of employees engaged on building and construction work and in the provision of migration services. Actually, there has been a decrease of approximately 800 in the number of persons employed in Government has given urgent attention to this problem and so has honoured the promise that members of its parties made in this respect when they were in Opposition. As the result of action that the Government took, the growth of the Public Service was steadied considerably by the end of the second quarter of 1950. In June last, there had been an actual overall reduction of 1,200 public servants. The Government is taking further action in this matter. It has appointed a special committee to watch the position and to recommend adjustments in order that the taxpayers shall receive full value for their money. No doubt, we shall hear further criticism of the Government's proposals when the budget debate is resumed and I sball welcome tbe opportunity to reply to such criticism in that debate.

418,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.2],"the motion for the acljournment this evening. However, pending confirmation of certain facts, I propose to set one aside for the time being. I shall probably discuss it next week. The other matter arises as the result of recent developments in connection with the action that the Government proposes to take against the trade unions of Australia. The passage of legislation that clothes this Government with tremendous powers constitutes, in my opinion, a sorry event in the political history of this eountry. My opinion is that a grave error has been made by people who believe that the Governinent ought to be given those powers. Notwithstanding all the talk that we have heard about democracy ancl the need to preserve our democratic form of government, 1 am satisfied Deputy Speaker. I submit that the honourable member is not in order in discussing a bill which has already been passed by this House and which has been discussed during the current session. order. I direct attention to Standing Order 75, which statesNo member shall reflect upon any vote of tire House, except upon a motinn tliat such vote be rescinded. Adermann) I uphold the point of order of. the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth.) reflected upon a vote of this House, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am not questioning not said that the honourable member has reflected upon a vote of the House. He may continue his remarks. I shall listen to the discussion. est doubt in the world that a grave error of judgment has been made by those people who believe that this Government ought, to be clothed with the enormous powers that w ill be conferred upon it by the legislation.' It w ill be vested with power to establish a fascist police state in Australia. honourable member for East Sydney has had opportunities during recent weeks to discuss this matter, but has failed to record a vote against the measure thougii now he seeks to speak against it . He should not be allowed to speak any further in that strain. point of order is involved. ing, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that the attempt to raise a point of order was made deliberately for the purpose af Irving to prevent nie from saying what .1 want to say. I repeat that the Governnient will now be clothed witb power to establish a fascist police state. Furthermore, I am convinced that it intends to make a deliberate attack upon the trade unions of Australia. I want to make clear to memhers of this House the fact that, although the Government has thp against the trade union movement, it will not necessarily succeed. It s arguments in support of the bill were merely used as a smoke-screen to disguise its intention to attack militant trade unionists.

428,Mr Deputy Speaker,"The reGoverninent is to use the powers that have been conferred upon it by the legislapiece of legislation, within the constitution to attack the trade unions of Australia with the object of destroying them. There are members of this Parliament who even yet do not understand the full implications of the measure. The talk of attacking the Communist party was used only as a smoke screen so that the Government would be able to obtain wide powers that would enable it to deal with trade unions. I shall cite an illustration of the course of action that may be followed by the Government and I challenge any Government supporter to deny that such a procedure is possible. Railwaymen are on strike in Victoria to-day. The Australian Railways Union is controlled by a Communist secretary, a man who does not deny that he is a Communist. Under the new legislation, the Australian Railways Union can be declared to be an unlawful association or organization if it becomes deregistered because of its participation in the strike and it can be dissolved and its property can be seized regardless of the fact that a great majority of railway workers are not members, supporters or sympathizers of the Communist party. cause, as honourable gentlemen will know if they have studied the measure, if a majority of the members of tbe executive or the committee of management of a union are Communists according to the definition in the bill, the organization can be declared to be unlawful and can be dissolved. The Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) obviously does not understand the bill, because, under the wide definition of "" Communist"" in the measure, there is no militant trade unionist in this country who could not be declared to be a Communist-no t a member of the Communist party, hut a Communist. Therefore, by the declaring of a majority of the members of an executive or a management committee of a trade union, Ministers would have it within tlieir power to dissolve and destroy the trade union. I shall tell the House what my attitude will be in this matter. If , arising out of Hasluck, P. M . this legislation, the validity of which is already being challenged-bu t assuming that eventually it is declared to be a valid tional power of the Commonwealth Parliament-the trade unions decide to take direct steps to defeat the aims of the Government, to defend their trade union rights, to preserve their position in the community, to insist on the right to organize, regardless of whether this Government considers their action to be illegal or otherwise, I propose to / support the unions with all the power that I possess both inside and outside the Parliament, and there are many otlier trade unionists and members of the Labour party who will take the same course. The Government has made appeals for co-operation. It is rather interesting to note that this Government has never taken any steps to outlaw fascist-inclined organizations in Australia that everybody knows are being organized for the purpose of strike-breaking. They have been trained in military tactics and are to be used at the appropriate time to attack the trade union and Labour movement of this country.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. to record my protest about a member of the Opposition and an ex-Minister of the Crown, in the middle of making an important statement, being refused a further hearing by this House. ^he right honourable gentleman may not reflect on a vote of the House. a vote of the House. I am saying that the doing of such a thing by supporters of the 'Government, particularly by the honourable member for Bowman( Mr statements of that kind, it is a sorry McColm), was a sorry introduction to the coming into force of a bill such as the one that is being discussed. I am sure that that would be the view of every Australian, even if he did not support the bill. Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.20] I think it most regrettable that the learned right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) should make a pretence about one of the ordinary rights of the House. He knows that this legislation has been discussed in both Houses of the Parliament, and only awaits the Royal Assent to-morrow. It is indeed regrettable that one who professes to stand for parliamentary government would allow unparliamentary speeches which may incite people outside of the Parliament to riot. He has supported everything that the honourable member for East Sydney has said. Such an attitude, when it is taken by a man of his legal calibre, is most surprising. master-General) [11.20] -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) was not in the middle of his speech when he was interrupted. In exactly 30 seconds, his time would have expired, and he was interrupted because he was making declarations that he intended to Morgan, C. A. A. defy the law and would advise other Mulcahy, D. people to do so. If our democracy is Kiordan, W. J. F. to work, every one must respect the decision of the elected representatives of Tellers: the people in the Parliament. The Cameron, Clyde reason why the House took the stand that it did was that an ex-Minister of State had risen in his place, and had said, "" I am going to break the law, and I am going to advise others to do so "". honourable member for East Sydney said, "" If illegal action is taken by others, I shall support it and do my best did not say that. gentleman's statement is recorded in Hansard. If the former Attorney General, Dr. Evatt, sees fit to defend state of affairs for the once great Australian Labour party. Therefore, we offer no apology for properly silencing that kind of declaration in this Parliament during the last 30 seconds of the honourable member's speech. I register the strongest possible protest against tbe speech by the Postmaster General( Mr Anthony), who, after the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) bad been gagged, proceeded to attack him and actually to charge him with having deliberately incited people outside this Parliament to break the law. Whatever the views of the honourable member for East Sydney may be, he expressed them in this chamber and he was entitled, as a member of the Parliament, to say here what he thought. I listened to what he said. He was expressing his doubts and his concern about the possible actions that would flow from the administration of the measure to which he had referred, and, at a particular stage, the House decided that he should be not longer heard. I am not reflecting on the vote of the House, because it has the right to make that decision, and other parliaments in future will have a similar right if the Standing Orders are not amended.

442,"Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.22],","silenced, surely it was breaking the tradition of this House for two Ministers to rise and not only justify the decision of the House, but also to traduce the honourable member for East Sydney. We all are entitled to our views about the possible results of the legislation. Some people have very great fears about it. Other people's fears are not so great. But surely, in the National Parliament, an honourable member sbould be allowed to state his views, and express his fears. If he breaks the law outside the Parliament, and if anybody else breaks the law, they will be answerable under the law. I know that the honourable member for East Sydney will not break the law, whatever his views may be. He bas never broken the law yet. Government members interjecting, has said in this Parliament to-night can be construed as an incitement to people outside it to break the law, except by those who are so purblind and politically prejudiced that they want to say those things about him. The honourable member for East Sydney is a very forthright and rugged personality. He has his views, and he stands up for them. In a democracy, we all generally pride ourselves that we take our stand with Voltaire, who said, ""AlthoughI disagree wholeheartedly with what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it "" . There are such things as freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of assembly. The attitude of certain honourable members, including the honourable member for Bowman( Mr dignity of the House was being lowered McColm), who moved the motionI am only reflecting on his motive and not on the vote of the House-indicate s that there are persons in this Parliament who have fascist mentalities, and wbo do not believe in freedom of speech. moved that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) be not longer heard. Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) made a remark to-night about people with fascist mentalities. It was about the tenth time. I have heard him make such a remark. I suggest that if some Opposition members had spent half the time and half the trouble in fighting fascism fhat I have, they might be in a position to speak on that matter. bers fought against the fascists. The honourable member is not in order in interjecting, and the offence is aggravated when he interjects from a seat other than his own. the honourable member for Melbourne, who has been a Minister, make threats to a future Opposition to the effect that he was prepared to pre-judge an issue. His attitude was deplorable. I shall explain precisely why I moved that the honourable member for East Sydney be not longer heard. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he was making a very inflammatory speech. I should have had no particular objection to that, if he had made it at the right time. I suggest that, had the honourable member been honest and sincere, he would have made that speech when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 was being discussed in this House, and he should have had the moral courage to vote against it. But he failed to do so. It was one of the most deplorable exhibitions of hypocrisy that this House ever witnessed, and that was why I moved that the honourable member be not longer heard. I do not regret my action for one moment. I am an ordinary decent Australian citizen, and I thought that the when we had to listen to the tripe that was being spoken to-night. another decent Australian citizen, and a member of a family that has also sent sons and brothers to the front, not in one war but in two wars, and it just makes me sick to hear some honourable members opposite speak as if they ailone are The honourable member for entitled to wear the mantle of patriotism.

[11.31] -Tb e serious implications of some of the things said to-night may not be clearly realized. History may be repeating itself. The remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr regret that a good deal of heat has been Ward) regarding the illegal action that he is contemplating are not unprecedented. In 1940, after the National Security Act was passed for the defence of this country in the war against Hitler, when Hitler and Stalin were allies, and the honourable member for East Sydney was supporting Stalin, the honorahle member saidCandidly, I do not trust the Government with these powers. . . . And if this kind of law is going to he misused and abused as a means of smashing Australian democracy, I say quite frankly that some of us will defy the law. In otber words, the leopard cannot change his spots, and the dog returns to his vomit. What the honorahle member for East Sydney has said here to-night is in keeping with what he said in 1940, when he was in league with Stalin, who was an ally of our enemy, Hitler. Just as the honourable member did not hesitate to act in such a way as to injure the country's war effort in those days, s.» he is now quite seriously preparing the ground for treason, for the defence of the Communist party, and for the smashing of our defence preparations. honourable member is accusing fhe honourable member for East Sydney of treason, I ask him to withdraw his remark. There is an even more serious implication contained in the remarks of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who may be contemplating tbe same kind of action as he took in 1940-41, when be acted as legal adviser to a Communist organization, the Council of Civil Liberties, which was, at that time, actively engaged in treason-and I do down the not propose to withdraw those words. Just as it may well be that the honourable member for East Sydney is contemplating a repetition of his misdeeds of the early war years, so the even more serious inference may well be drawn that the right honourable member for Barton, who is backing him up, is contemplating a (MackeUar) repetition of his own more surreptitious, but perhaps even more serious misdeeds of that time. engendered in this debate, and that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has been prevented from making the statement that he desired to make. I regret the filthy attack by the Post"" filthy "". I regret the attack made hy the Postmaster-'General on a man who cannot reply in his own defence, because of the question being put, to the untruthful statements made about him. The Postmaster-General said that the honourable member for East Sydney said that he would support illegal action by trade unions. The honourable member for East Sydney made no such statement.

459,Mr Pollaed,"I withdraw the wordtreasonable statement. able member for East Sydney said on that occasion was that if democracy was attacked be would resist tbe attack, and he was entitled to say that. There was nothing treasonable in it . In any case when honourable members accuse the Sydney seditious, let me remind them that there are plenty of examples in English history of the defiance of laws found to be u ii just. I propose to quote a couple of examples. Mr De Valera was a rebel against the British Crown. He was an Irish Roman Catholic, and he was condemned for rebellion against what he considered to be unjust laws. Lesti t be suggested that I have sectarian bias, let me remind the honourable member for Mackellar that another famous character in British history, because he considered that an unjust law was about to be enactedI refer to Sir Edward Carson -sai d that he would arm the people of Northern Ireland to resist the law. That was when he learned that the K in g was about to assent to the Home Rule Act. Let honourable members think that over, and before they make accusations aboui other honourable members let them study their history. All the honourable member for East Sydney said was that if the trade unions found it necessary to resist the Communist Party Dissolution Actand he did not say by illegal or treasonable activity-h e would support them in the action they took. I resent the action of honourable members in preventing another honourable member from replying to accusations made after he had been gagged. National Development and Ministerf o r Works and Housing) [11.38] -The point of this debate, which will have an importance f a r beyond to-night, resides in the words used by the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ) . I believe that all honourable members of this House w ill scan those words as rewere circulated:ported in Hansard without amendment, because I believe that they will have great significance in the time ahead. I expect that it has not escaped the attention of the House that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has to-night All tbe bonoraccused the honourable member for East Sydney of being a Communist. He did so on previous occasions, and I believe it has not escaped the notice of the House that on no occasion lately, when that charge has been made against him, has the honourable member for East Sydney honourable member for East expressed resentment, or asked that it he of being treasonable and withdrawn. When a charge is made by a man whom I regard as a lunatic, I ignore it . If it is made by the Ministerf o r National Development ( Mr Casey), I say that it is a deliberate lie. honourable member must withdraw that statement. honourable member for East Sydney has not resented the charge, and has not asked for its withdrawal.

With these purposes in mind, explicit provision will be made in. the new Commonwealth roads legislation foT strategic roads and for roads other than main roads in rural areas. 2.

Road-making equipment is included among the categories of goods which may be financed under the recently negotiated loan from the International Bank for Eeoonstruction and Development. Since the loan was negotiated a survey has been made, in consultation with State Premiers, of total requirements of equipment of this type.

There is an unsatisfied demand for labour in provincial and rural areas, e.g., some 28,500 vacancies outside the metropolitan areas are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Of these, 1,280 are in the wool and sheep industry, 170 in beef cattle, 420 in dairying, 460 in wheat, 260 in sugar, 270 in f r u it aud vegetable and 400 in timber-getting and forestry, the total in primary industries, being 3,340. The balance of these provincial vacancies are in the following industries:Minings and quarrying, 2,060; manufacturing, 10,620; building and construction, 5,920; transport operation, 1,020; commerce, finance and communication, 1,610; public administration, health and education, 1,160, and other service industries, 2,770. The policy in relation to the placement of migrants has been specifically directed towards the channelling, so far as practicable, of as many migrants as possible to rural employment. So far as the placement of displaced persons in primary industry ix concerned, some 6,300 have been placed tn date, including about 4,000 in forestry, timbergetting and the like. More could have been placed i i i farming and grazing had suitab!accommodation been available to house the migrants. In addition to this, large numbers have been placed for primary seasonal operations. It is .hoped to negotiate an agreement for the migration of large numbers of Dutch migrants and these should include many sun able for rural work. Many more migrants have been placed in work in provincial arens, although not directly in rural employment. 2. Approval has already been given to establishing eighteen decentralized hostels in inland areas. Consultation has taken place witli Commonwealth and State regional development authorities as to the most suitable location ol audi ho&tels. 3.
