4,Dr. Evatt,"Recently, i asked thelook at the matter. I suggested to him that sooner or later the dispute would be settled by mediation, and that it would never be too early to make such an attempt. Will the Acting Prime Minister ascertain the position and endeavour to support the suggestion or, in his good time, allow it to be considered by the Government as a matter of policy and inform the House accordingly? directed the question to the Prime Minister because it obviously concerned the whole .Government rather than a particular Minister. Sir for External Affairs will answer the question -that is in Indonesia and AustraliaOpposition raised this matter about a week ago when the Prime Minister was in the House. As the Prime Minister, [ think, showed when making his reply, he is fully seized of the gravity of the situation. However, I do not think it is a matter that can prosper as a result of public discussion. Clearly what is behind the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is that some mediating influence should be brought to bear on the position. If mediation is to have any chance of success whatever, it must not be conducted from the housetop. The Prime Minister has. left Australia, having been fully briefed on the matter, but I cannot say what particular opportunity he will seek to try to exert his influence, which is very considerable, in the interests of peace and, as he said, security. As I have stated, he has gone overseas fully briefed on the matter and with a greater appreciation possibly than most of us of the potentialities of the present situation in Cyprus. I do not think that mediation can be conducted successfully in the open or by means of public discussion. I am quite sure that the Prime Minister will do all he can in the interests of peace and security, but I cannot inform the House of the methods or the procedures that he will adopt. External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to a statement by the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia in which that gentleman suggested that the Australian attitude to the Indonesian claim to Dutch New Guinea would in time weaken. Can the Minister, at the present time, see any weakening of Australia's attitude regarding the position? ment to which the honourable gentleman I has referred was made, not by the Indonesian Ambassador in Australia, but hy the Minister for Information in the Indonesian Government in Djakarta. I did see that statement and, if I may say so, I welcome the moderate tone of the hope that on both sides of this discussion an equally moderate tone can be sustained hecause I believe that the Dutch, the Indonesians and ourselves need a period of calm in respect of this West New Guinea problem. The more frequently that it gets dragged into the public gaze, the more frequently do representatives of one side or the other feel themselves compelled to state their government's case and stand, possibly in an everfirmer voice. That, I think, does not conduce to the eventual solution of this matter. I have no comment on the remark that has fallen from the Indonesian Minister's lips in Djakarta. It is a calming statement and I do not want to detract in any way from the obviously moderate attitude that the Minister has shown. advance any justifiable reason why Commonwealth compensation authorities should keep injured citizen militia force memhers waiting almost three months for compensation? Does the Treasurer know that although I made representafions concerning a case more than three weeks ago to the second secretary at Canberra, there is still no sign of compensation being paid in the case that I mention, although the militiaman, his wife and children are practically I ask the Minister for starving?

In view of the fact that the Government has agreed to send an all party parliamentary delegation to visit the Northern Territory, will the Minister see that, at the conclusion of the inspection of the Northern Territory, the delegation is provided with facilities to inspect the potentialities that exist on the Ord and Fitzroy rivers in the Kimberleys region of ""Western Australia? I point out to the Minister that this area is adjacent to the Northern Territory, and that the possibilities that exist there are very great. The great potentialities of the area have been discussed on many occasions both inside and outside this Parliament, and havo been the subject of articles in the press. I suggest that the extension of the delegation's tour to include the country that I have mentioned would be of very great benefit, not only to the Parliament itself, but also to the nation. SoI ask, in.all sincerity, that the tour will not be concluded when the delegation has finished inspecting the Northern Territory, but will be extended so that members of the delegation may see the. potentialities of the Kimberleys region of Western Australia. honourable member realizes that my",12,Compensation Payments To National Service Teainees

It all comes down to the division of responsibilities. The responsibility in relation to roads, bridges and other such installation is obviously a State responsibility. It is for the State governmentsespecially the Queensland Government, which has plenty of funds available for these works-to accept that responsibility. a question to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you consider the position of the two back rows of seats in the Speaker's gaUery? I have received complaints about them from visitors, who have told ine that any one sitting in those two rows of seats cannot see who is speaking on the floor of the House. Doubtless you can see the visitors from your position and they can see you from their seats. When the first row of seats in the Speaker's gallery is occupied, people in the second row can see what is happening on the floor of the House by looking over the shoulders of thc people in the first row, but people in the third row are, so to speak, shut out altogether. I understand that there is a rule that any one who is enjoying the privilege of a seat in the Speaker's gallery must not stand up. If you cannot do anything to overcome the difficulty that I have spoken about, I hope that you will be lenient if you see, as I have seen, visitors in the Speaker's gallery stand up to try to see who is speaking on the floor of the House. Proper provision has been made in the Senate to prevent inconvenience of this kind. But visitors to this House complain that they are so near, yet so far, because they leave the chamber without having seen the Leader of tb-'* Opposition or other prominent members seated at the table. of the limited space available in this chamber, obviously there is not much that the Speaker can do to overcome this difficulty. I point out that I have received complaints from honourable members wno occupy the back row of members' seats on that side of the chamber that visitors can hear every word that they say to one another and can even see their notes. They have complained that the front row of seats in the Speaker's gallery is too close to their seats. times, Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall see the honourable member for East Sydney walking out if he continues to defy the Chair in the way that he does. Because of the limited space available, there is certainly not much that we can do to improve the position. OF MAINTENANCE ORDERS. External Affairs explain to the House why he has decided that Australia should not be represented at the United Nations conference, to be held in a few days' time, on the enforcement of maintenance orders on an international basis? honourable member for raising this question, not only because of his own very considerable personal knowledge and experience of the matter, but also because I believe that misapprehension regarding the Government's decision may become widespread, In fact, I have already had indications that the Government's decision not to be represented at this convention is being interpreted as lack of interest, concern or sympathy with the subject-matter. The simple fact is that the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations set up a committee of experts to report on thc enforcement of maintenance orders on an international basis. As the honourable gentleman has mentioned, a conference will take place in New York, under the auspices of the United Nations organization, in a few days' time, and it is also true that I , on behalf of the Government, decided that Australia would not be represented at that conference. The point is that this is a matter almost entirely for the State governments.

Only four of them replied, and those four all said that they did not wish to be represented, because they believed that the enforcement of maintenance orders could very much better be carried out by bi-lateral arrangements between countries than on the suggested international basis. That was the simple reason for this Government's belief that we could not, with advantage, be represented at the conference. It was not, I repeat, because of any indifference on the part of this Government to such an important subject, f am grateful to the honourable member for bringing this matter up, because I hope that my explanation may stifle signs of indignation that are apparent in some quarters at the Government's decision not, to be represented. the Minister for the Army. I preface it by saying that the Army appears to be going through one of its recurring phases of departing as far as possible from the traditional uniform of the lst and 2nd Australian Imperial Eorces on public occasions. Photographs show that at the celebrations held in Sydney recently to mark the centenary of responsible government in New South ""Wales, the Army uniform was apparently blues with peaked cap. ""Will the Minister consider issuing an instruction to ensure that traditional features of the uniform of the 1st and 2nd Australian Imperial Forces, for example the slouch hat for infantry and the beret for armoured troops, and a well-made khaki uniform, shall be retained in the dress of troops when they turn out to represent the Australian Army in public ceremonies? was directed to me last week, immediately after the ceremonial parade in Sydney on the occasion of the opening of the New South Wales Parliament, during the celebrations in connection with the centenary of responsible government. It seems to me extraordinary that this mattnr has not been raised before, because it is well known that the No. 1 ceremonial uniform of the Army is a blue uniform, as worn on that occasion, and as has been used by the Army since before World War II . There have been certain recent additions to that uniform, which were decided upon on the occasion of the visit to Australia of Her Majesty the Queen. However, this is not a new question. 1 am having a complete investigation made of the matter of ceremonial dress. I cannot promise that any violent changes will be made. I repeat that this is not a new question, as some people seem to believe.

It would not be possible to extend the range of approved services to include phvsiotherapy without also including all sorts of services ancillary to medicine.

This is a bill to amend the States Grants (Coal-mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949-1950. The amendment relates to matters of procedure and is, I think honourable members w ill agrefc when they examine it , not of a contentious character. It w ill be recalled that in October, 1949, the Coal IndustryT r i bunal and the Central Reference Board made awards by which long-service leave benefits were granted to the miners' federation and certain other unions with members in the black coal mining industry. government of the day, and later accepted by this Government, that the substantial financial burden of these awards should be spread on an industry-wide basis so that particular employers would not have to bear differing burdens. It was decided, therefore, that if the States would undertake to reimburse to employers the cost of long-service leave, the Oommonwealth would assist the States financially, not only in relation to such reimbursements, but also the expenses of the administrative machinery which would have to be set up by the States. To meet the cost of all this to the Commonwealth, an excise was imposed on black coal produced in Australia after the l st March, 1949, the rate at present being Sd. a ton. To give effect to these decisions, Parliament passed the States Grants (Coalmining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 and the Coal Excise Aet 1949. The former act established the Coalmining Industry Long Service. Leave Fund, into wbich are paid thp amounts collected under the latter act as excise on coal or contributed by the Statesi n lieu of excise on coal produced in State mines. The former act, as amended in 1950, authorizes the payment, by way of grant, of amounts determined hy the Treasurer to the States concerned in this scheme. The purpose of this bill is twofold. It provides that income derived from investment of moneys held in the fund shall for m part of the f u n d and not. as at present, part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The second purpose is to keep alive the long-service leave entitlements of those mine workers who cross over from private mines under the joint Commonwealth-State scheme to State owned and operated coal mines which are not under that scheme. If the State concerned is prepared to recognize the entitlements for the purpose of its own long-service leave scheme, this amendment will make it possible for the necessary payments to be made from the fund.

50,Mr Drummond (New England),"working relations in the community. On the whole, whatever may be said to the contrary, there has been a very large measure of success, and Australia has no reason to be ashamed of its activities in this respect. I was rather struck by the fact that during the debate the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), I think, spoke in rather glowing terms about the system in operation in the United States of America. This country has much to learn from America that would be greatly to our advantage; but that is not true of industrial relations. We have never seen in this country, nor would I like to see, the kind of civil war that was waged in America in days gone by when people were fighting for the minimum requirements for their existence. In Australia, there has been one major clash-o n the occasion of the Eureka stockade. Any one who thoughtfully reads the history of industrial relations in the United States realizes the advances that have been made in that country, but I still think that the industrial structure of Australia is much sounder. In my opinion, there is no dispute oi difference that cannot be settled amicably or fairly if good intentions and good will are present on both sides. Without those essentials, no industrial, national or and the Court, but each of them separately international question is ever settled. Tf such questions are approached on either side in a spirit of avarice, or of personal or political ambition, lasting settlement is impossible. No only is our financial and economic welfare hound up in the success of industrial relations, but also there is the infinitely more important matter of the happiness of the women and children in many thousands of homes. It is of prime importance that our efforts should be directed towards that end. Having made those preliminary remarks, I now wish to offer some criticism of the bill and to speak to the amendment that has been moved hy the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I propose to add to some of the constructive suggestions that have been made both before and during the debate. It has been suggested more than once that until this Government disturbed the 1947 conciliation and arbitration legislation, everything went like love's sweet song. I think that is a fair summing up of some of the points that have been advanced by Opposition speakers. But1 hold in my hand the fourth annual report of the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, dated the 24th October, 1951. Time will not permit me to traverse the whole report, but I direct attention to the following statement of the Chief Judge, Sir Raymond Kelly, at page 7, which, to my mind, although it is applicable to a particular point, carries forward the general thought of the report:I have, nevertheless, thought it my duty to point out that the system of arbitration set up by the 1947 amendment does necessitate an artificial splitting of a composite dispute, even of claims advanced upon a basis of inseverability, into two compartments-that of issues determinable by the Court and that of issues determinable by the Commissioners . . . In another section of the report, hireferred to the almost impossible position that occurs when a question arises ahout whether a matter is one for the higher section or the lower seciion of the court. He said, in relation to similar difficulties that have been. encountered with the question of the hasic wage. . . both the Conciliation Commissioner and independently, are called upon to inquire whether the wage in question, current or claimed, (it may on its face, hut not conclusively, include a ""wav loading"" or an "" industry loading"") . . . I refer to the report because it was made after a period that would enable some assessment to be made of the working of the act. Indeed, early in the report, the Chief Judge saidThe general provisions of the amending Act of 1!)47, which altered the system of conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, have npw been given a suflicient trial to enable one to form conclusions upon the ""working"" ol the Act. I do not suggest for one moment that the Chief Judge was condemning the act, root and branch. That is not the point I wish to bring out, except, to a certain degree, in rebuttal of the assertion of honourable members opposite that the 1947 legislation was an almost perfect measure. However, that is only a side issue. What the report emphasizes is the complexity and difficulty of dividing industrial arbitration into watertight compartments. In March, the honourable member for to tread in advance on the ground that Bendigo( Mr Clarey), in another of his will be covered by the constitution comvory nxcellent speeches, to which the mittee, it is necessary to point out that Hmipp always listens with respect even the' evolution of satisfactory industrial though certain honourable members may machinery will be still far from simple. disagree with him in detail, suggested If the aim is to produce something that three remedies for our industrial ills. One will give justice to the employee and a of his suggestions was that steps should oe fair deal to the employer and the .comtaken to increase the powers of the munity, it is not, impossible that a satisCommonwealth in respect of employment factory conclusion can he arrived at. mid industrial matters. I note that the Assuming that the supreme industrial amendment moved by the Leader of the power is handed by the people to this Opposition is couched in the following Parliament, then the logical steps are, terms:The present bill contributes nothing to the interpret legislation; secondly, the testsolution of the problem of industrial unrest ing of the proper sphere of jurisdiction and chaos arising from decisions under the present system and the manner in which it of the courts in accordance with the three hns been operated. I do not agree with that statement beyond of detailed work, where practicable, on stating that I believe that no legislation State courts;'and, fourthly, the encourthat is introduced under the existing proagement of round-table consultations visions of the Constitution is capable of between employer and employee, to pregiving more than a limited application of vent disputes. the principles that make for the attainment of harmony. The honorahle member for Bendigo pointed'out that between they are very germane to the principle 1930 and 1946, three Lahour governments of the measure before the House. But and one Liberal government had tried to the real problem associated with this obtain an amendment of the powers apparently simple formula is, first of all, entrusted to the Commonwealth Parliato obtain uniformity of basic standards ment. He added. . . but until we have greater powers present vexations and irritations of difover the vexed matters ofemployment and ferent State and Federal awards operatindustrial affairs so that national matters may ing in the same industries; to provide lie determined on national standards in the more effective machinery and roundnational interests, we shall be continually vexed' with problems like those .we have before us table discussions between employer and to-day. I want the House to note the three economy are not ignored in industrial points that he made in that statement, agreements. because they are worthy of emphasis. He said that the Parliament should have the power to deal with national matters, lation is handed to the Commonwealth, national standards, and national interests. the question that we might reasonably Those three points, as stated by the ask ourselves is this: ""Will it remedy honourable member for Bendigo, constitute one proper and outstanding grievance of the criteria for the proper sphere of the working community-and that is federal industial jurisdiction. I do not undue delay in obtaining what is deemed think there can bc any serious complaint to be industrial justice-o r will it, in the about that statphipnt. Provided that one words of the late Sir Jonn Quick, uttered can determine what is included under some 35 years ago. ""merely lead to a that proposal, I think that one could get multitude of inconsistent regulations and a great deal more agreement on satisfactory machinery than obtains at the present time. At the same time, whilst I do not wish firstly, the conferring by the Parliament on the federal court of the power to points laid down by the honourable member for Bendigo; thirdly, the devolution I mention these steps because I think of wages and hours: then, to eliminate the employee; and to ensure that the overall rights of citizens and thp national If the power to pass industrial legislaws, operating through the different parts of Australia""? I think that we come to the crux of the problem there. I think that the formula laid down by rlie honourable meniber for Bendigo is a perfectly good formula. I think that if it could be applied, it would result in a tremendous step forward in industrial conditions, even though it would involve tin amendment of the Constitution. But Unless a system can be evolved whereby the Commonwealth courts merely deal with basic standards and leave the working out of the details in the hands of State authorities and other machinery associated with the State as well as the Commonwealth, I think that there may be a more severe congestion and a greater irritation than have ariseu in the past. liaving said that, I wish to pass on to a few facts in support of the points that T have made. The complexity of conflicting industrial jurisdictions is revealed in the publication, Auslralia In Facts nnd Figures, No. 48. This booklet states that, of the industrial task force, 44.3 per cent, of males and 37.2 per cent, of females are employed under federal awards and 44.3 per cent, of males and 5'4.9 per cent, of females are employed under state awards. Without going into any analysis of those figures, honorahle members can take it from me that there is plenty of room for overlapping and friction. It wotdd not matter very much if people working under State awards were operating in entirely different industries, but that simply does not huppen to any great extent because of tbe complexity of our industrial set-up. There will be an interminable state of industrial unrest while a large body of people work under State awards alongside au equaUy large body of people who work under federal awards. As a matter of fact, some years ago, when I happened to'have an association with the Government of New South Wales, at a favorable moment when State award rates were below thc federal rates, we deliberately brought the railways of New South Wales under federal jurisdiction in order tq bring about an end of this particular trouble. I think that the rash has broken out again since then, and it is likely to remain for some time to come. I should now like to comment on the suggestion that, somehow, in some way, the Government which I support, and its legislation, have been less successful than the legislation which was introduced by the previous Government. I point out that 2,200,000 working days were lost in 1945 j 1,900,000 Avorking' days in 1946 and 1,340,000 workings days in 1949. In the last of those years, the Labour Government's administration ended. In 1950, under the present Government, the figure was 2,060,000 working days; in 1951, it was 872,000; in 1952, it was 1,163,000; and in 1954 it was 901,000. The plain fact of the matter is that these figures, when analysed, are favourable to the side of the House on which I find myself. Quite plainly too, even under a Labour government in respect of which the figures were undoubtedly less favorable, the industrial machinery creaked so badly that the government was not able to handle it successfully, even to the extent that the present Government has handled it. The conclusion that we draw from those facts is that we must look elsewhere for the reasons which bring about the industrial disputes in this country. My time has nearly expired, and 1 just want to say this in conclusion: The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), in the heat of their arguments, developed two points which I think need a little, examination. The honourable member for Blaxland stated that the employers did smash the awards between 1929 and 1934.,' The honourable member for Yarra, speaking in the same strain, stated that the . tendency of awards was to protect the employer, not the employee. He quoted Mr Justice Higgins as laying.down theprinciple that if the profit is nil, tlie wages must still be paid. I think that., in the discussion of this particular matter, it would be far better if we confined ourselves to the application of. dispassionate common sense to something that so vitally affects the people. It was not the employers who smashed the awards between 1929 and 1934. It was the complete industrial and economic collapse-,, of. the .whole' world at .that, time that smashed awards. It was a complete breakdown. I , myself, was appointed to ministerial office in New South Wales at a critical time when there were. 150,000 people on the dole in New South Wales, when there were more than 200,000 unemployed in that State, and when we had only 600 people on relief work. I was one of those who were handed the task of trying to bring some order out of that chaos. It is futile, even in the heat of debate, to say that the employers smashed the awards. The employers themselves were at that time smashed in all directions. Before that period ended, at least 50 per cent, of men on the land were completely bankrupt, and the other 50 per cent, were hovering on the edge of bankruptcy. Had it not been for the rural reconstruction policy that operated, that position would drive and enterprise they put into it. It. have been aggravated to a point beyond redemption. I mention this matter simply because I feel that we shall get, nowhere byapproaching a measure of this kind with the sort of argument that the Opposition has been using. I do not agree, for instance, with the argument based by the honourable member for Yarra. on t.he statement by Mr Justice Higgins that "" if the profit is nil, wages must still be paid "". Of course, wages must be paid whether or not there is a profit, because they are a first call, not faced with a very serious dispute in that only on the profit, but on the assets of employers. That is the position to-day. Whoever else may go short, the employees must be paid before anybody else. And quite rightly so! But to argue that an employer can go on paying wages irrespective of whether or not a business the question of whether or not we shall "" makes a profit, is simply too futile. It cannot possibly he done. It is quite obvious that an employer whose business is verging on bankruptcy cannot go on paying wages any more than a person can get water out of an' empty pot. Just as the water is not in the pot, and so cannot be taken from, it, the money to pay wages does not exist in a business verging on bankruptcy. Consequently, there comes a time, if the community is to function soundly, when the various sections of industry must get, toppfher and agree to what is the reasonable thing. until such time as an agreement with the There has emerged, during recent years, a perfectly sound tendency in business -that is, that when a business is profitable, the employees should obtain a share of that profit; when it ceases to be profitable to the point where it cannot pay bonuses, the employees should recognize that fact and show a willingness to help the business through its troubles. I should like to refer at this point to two industries, one of them private, the other a State enterprise. At present, the transport system of New South Wales is losing about £10,000,000 a year. I think that one of the major factors in the difficulty of maintaining high efficiency in a State service such as the New South Wales railways is that it is not run on a basis which enables the employees to see whether or not they are getting results for the initiative, is not run on the same basis as is a private business, the employees of which are able to judge, from the balance-sheet, whether they have had results from the work, the loyalty and the co-operation that they have given to the business. Consequently, I think that until such government enterprises are put on the same basis as private enterprises, so that the employees can see the results of their work, we shall not obtain from them anything that is in the national interest. The private industry which I mentioned is the wool industry. To-day, we are industry, upon which depend, to a greater degree than they depend on any other industry, the stability and financial strength of this country. At, present, we have an appalling state of affairs in that industry with, hanging in the balance, go forward strongly in our development or whether we shall have to slow it down. The one industry, more than any other, which will make it possible for us to keep our overseas balances sound is being hampered. I am assured that hundreds of thousands of sheep in Queensland are now dying as a result of the. dispute in the industry. This could easily happen in New South Wales also. The most interesting thing about the dispute is a statement' by one official of the Australian Workers Union that, wool-growers is made, shearers are not employed, and, therefore, cannot possibly be on strike. He argues that shearers, instead of being on strike, are declining to work at a certain wage rate. That is something they are entitled to do; but they are not entitled to ask other trade unions to help them in what some of them say is a strike, but which the officials of their union say is not a strike, but simply a refusal to work at a certain wage rate. The men who are working in the shearing industry at an award rate are working according to trade union rules, and according to the arbitration system. The men who are not working are exercising their right not to work; but I suggest that there comes a time when we must have, right through the. whole of industrial relationships, either common sense or chaos. I believe that those who engage in industrial agreements, and those who use the arbitration machinery, or any machinery, must he prepared to accept the umpire's decision, with the right to try to have it altered later. The only alternative is a complete breakdown, which is something that we cannot contemplate with any degree of satisfaction. So, I support the measure, and put forward the plea that the system of conciliation and arbitration be placed on a more permanent basis than can be done under the existing provisions of the Constitution. I rise to support strongly the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Kearney) on his maiden speech, and particularly for the history that he gave us of the trials and tribulations that attended the development of trade unionism in this country. He told us not only of the development of our trade unions, but also of the parallel attempts by trade unionism to develop a system of arbitration. The strikes and industrial strife of the 1890's> showed very forcibly to the infant trade union movement in Australia that some steps would have to be taken, either in the State or the Federal arena, to get away from the law of the industrial jungle. So there was then formulated in the minds of some of the trade union leaders of those days something we have come to know as the first stage of industrial arbitration. The founders of the Constitution endeavoured to reach someagreement with regard to the question of the industrial powers to be wielded by the Commonwealth Parliament. As a result, there was embodied in the Australian Constitution a provision which gives to this Parliament a restricted iudustrial power. Then, in 1904, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was established with Mr Justice Higgins as president. At some date in the not-far-distant future, that court is to be superseded hy what the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) called a new system of arbitration. It is obvious that this 45-page measure has nor, been introduced by the Government with any desire to effect the improvements in industrial relations referred to by the honourable member for Ne* England( Mr Drummond). He stated thai we must have either common sense oi chaos. But this bill will not do anything to prevent industrial chaos. If the High Court of Anstralia had not decided in the Boilermakers case that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could not exercise judicial as well as arbitral powers, and could not enforce penalties, this measure would never have seen the light of day, and we should not be discussing it now. Therefore, it is just too silly for words for Government supporters to congratulate the Minister upon what he is doing, by means of this bill, to preserve industrial peace. It is true that Government members in this chamber, and those who support them outside the Parliament, have stated that industrial unrest exists. This bill is supposed to be the panacea that will eliminate this industrial unrest. It will do nothing of the sort, and, for that reason, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has moved the amendment, which is acceptable to trade unionists hecause it proposes measures to remove the unrest that exists in industry to-day. The Minister for Labour and National Service, in his second-reading speech, stated that the Government proposes to establish a Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration commission, which will have some presidential members, and some",20,Harol Dholt
51,Mr Eiordan (Kennedy) [3.53],"lay commissioners, and a Commonwealth industrial court. He then proceeded to make much of the streamlining effects that he alleged this measure would have on the administration of the' industrial law of this country. Although it wiil replace two instrumentalities by about four, as it were, according to the Minister this will have a streamlining effect on the industrial law! The sort of streamlining we should like to see is the expeditThis minimized delays and contributed to ing of hearings and of the making of decisions, because the principal cause of industrial unrest is the delays, not only in have already stated. I have already having applications heard, but also ""in obtaining decisions once the hearings have taken place. The 1947 amending nieasure introduced by the Chifley Labour Government haa already been mentioned by Opposition members. Its purpose was purely and simply to remove industrial unrest by streamlining arbitration-to use the Minister's own phrase-to minimize delays, and to establish the system of conciliation commissioners who could go onto a job where a dispute threatened or existed, deal with it forthwith, and give :i decision immediately. This would do much to remove the industrial unrest that is so manifest when men feel that they suffer from some injustice. They want decisions immediately, not twelve months hence. The Chifley Government streamlined the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the interests of industrial peace. producer, is permitted to withhold his But this Government sabotaged the 1947 measure by introducing appeals, thereby breaking down the system of straight-out decisions by conciliation commissioners, and accentuating delays in hearings and in the making of decisions. This is the principal cause of the industrial unrest that exists to-day. When the bill now under consideration was proposed, the workers hoped that, since delays are the principal cause of industrial unrest, the Government would introdnce a measure that would minimize delays and do industrial justice immediately it was demanded. But they have heen grievously disappointed in their hopes of advantage. Instead, the consequences will be only disadvantageous to them. The 1947 amending measure was introduced by the Chifley Government because it realized that, delays in hearings and iu Boland, the secretary of the Queensland the obtaining of decisions contributed largely to industrial unrest. It realized that the court was bogged down by legal formalities and technicalities, and it was deeply conscious of the heavy cost of proceedings, particularly to trade unions. With these factors in mind, it constituted the system of conciliation commissioners who could go onto a job where a dispute threatened and make immediate awards. tlie preservation of industrial peace through the system of arbitration, as I pointed out, also, that this streamlined system was destroyed by the present Government. Yet the Minister for Labour and National Service now has the audacity to say that this measure, which will constitute three tribunals, as it were, will have the effect of stream' lining arbitration ! He and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) have stated that many industrial disputes are caused by Communists. Every time the honourable member for Hume opens his mouth, he mentions Communists and communism. I could almost believe that before he turns in for the night, he looks under the bed to see whether a Communist is there. The honourable member for New England referred to the Queensland shearers' strike. The Queensland shearers have refused to offer their labour at less than a certain price. If a producer, whether he be a primary or a secondary product, why should a man be prevented from withholding his labour? The honourable member for Hume stated that the Communists have now taken control of the Australian Workers Union. I know something of the history of that union and its traditions. I know something, also, of those who have_ been responsible for formulating its policy in the past. Let us have a look at the men who are controlling the destiny of the Australian Workers Union now. Let us look at the Queensland branch, to which the honourable member for New England referred. Will he say that Joe Bukowski, the president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union, is a ""Com.""? Will he say that Harold branch, is a "" Cora."" ? I have known Harold Boland since I was a small hoy. He has been an omciai of the Australian Workers Union for a considerable period. He was an organizer, then a district secretary in various places, and to-day he is the secretary of the Queensland branch. He has heen a Labour man and anti-Communist all his life. That goes for Bukowski, too. He first became an official of the union in, I think, 1936. Take the federal secretary of the Australiau Workers Union. He was a sugar worker in Queensland. Then he became an official of the Queensland branch of the union, and now he is the federal secretary. Hc, too, has been a Labour man and anti-Communist all his life. Those are some of the men who are responsible for formulating the policy of this union. What has happened is that the members of the Australian Workers Union, like the members of many other unions, have become fed up to the back teeth with the way in which our arbitration system has developed, especially in the federal arena. Industrial arbitration and trade ous to blind Harry that it was introduced unionism iu this country developed alongpurely and simply to circumvent a deciside the national economy. But, unforsion of the court? tunately, since 1949, due to the retrogressive legislation of this Government, the developments that have taken place appearance of counsel before arbitration in the field of industrial arbitration have courts. Provision is made in the bill been somewhat akin to what this Gofor the appearance of counsel. The vernment wanted to foist upon the people Minister, in his second-reading speech, of Queensland.

Those who appear before those gradual speeding-up of arbitration processes that occurred, under the Chifley Government, after the end of the war. This measure-thi s thing!-ha s been introduced allegedly for the purpose of developing the system of industrial arbitration in this country. It is interesting to note that although the industrial commission which will be established under the legislation will have power to fix penalties, but not to enforce them, the proposed industrial court will be given power to enforce penalties which the commission imposes. If that is not a clumsy attempt to get round a High Court decision, I want to know what it is. The title of this measure ought to be changed. It should not be referred to as a conciliation and arbitration bill; it should, be called a lawyers' harvest bill. There is no doubt that, if any action is taken in connection with penalties, there will be immediately an appeal to the High Court. I have my own ideas about what will happen then. Do honourable gentlemen opposite believe for one moment that the High Court would uphold this legislation, when it is obviI turn now to the question of the There are in Queensland and other courts are laymen also. Every man is a specialist in his own industry. The heavy expense involved in a continuation of a system which calls for judges, with their wigs and gowns, and the retention of counsela system which creates employment, as it were, for men who charge high fees to appear before the judges-ca n lead only to the impoverishment of the trade unions of this country or to an increase of the contributions made by trade unionists to the funds of their organizations. We kuow that honourable members opposite wish to keep the trade unions hard-up. We know that they want to keep the unions' bank balances pretty low. They do not want the trade unions to develop in the way they should develop as our economy expands. They want to impoverish the unions by compelling them to employ highly paid lawyers. A layman who appears before an""indusrrial court does not present a case in a less emcient manner than would a lawyer, but. the proceedings are stripped of all the trappings of legal formalities and legal technicalities. I know something of the practical work done by the Queensber, 1953, until Friday last. During thai land industrial court. The president is a lawyera judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He makes decisions on legal matters. But he and the laymen deal with questions of fact. Practically every case of au industrial kind or practically every case coining within the industrial jurisdiction, if we want to use living brought about by the inflationary that term-involve s only questions of fact. Only on rare occasions do technical legal questions arise. If this Government really wanted to strip arbitration of all technicalities and legalism and to lower the cost of industrial arbiWhen the ChifleyGovernmentendeavoured tration, this bill presented it vvith an admirable opportunity to do so by wiping out. the necessity for the appearance' present Government were in opposition, of counsel.

The it proclaimed in September of last year Government had an excellent opportunity to indicate to the worker that it was prepared to lessen the cost to his trade union of appearances before the Arbitration Court. The Government has missed that opportunity, and it will be left for another government in the future to establish a court before which only laymen may appear, or before which counsel may appear only by consent of the parties. It will be left for another government to establish a court of first appearance, whioh will deal firstly with matters that are brought to its attention, and from whose decisions there shall be no appeal. Such provisions would expedite the processes of arbitration, and would remove some of the present causes of industrial unrest. I now wish to make a few remarks about wage fixation, and the tribunal whose duty it will be to fix wages. After the Arbitration Court makes an award and fixes a basic wage, the exploiters, profiteers and racketeers hav« a real party. Reference has been made to the freezing of the basic wage from Septemperiod Ave saw the cost of living rising steeply. We saw companies making fabulous profits, while tens of thousandsof workers had their Avages pegged, and had the mortifying experience of seeing their standard of living declining in proportion, to the increase in the cost of trend in the country's economy. Workers had the experience of seeing the standard of living of their families declining, while large shareholders in wealthy companies were making enormous profits. to. secure additional powers to control prices, the parties which now form the and their supporters argued that such matters Avere best left to the States, and tliat the country was facing a serious economic crisis because of inflation, Government supporters during the election campaign in December were at pains to point out the great degree of prosperity that the country was enjoying. This Government refused to use the weapon of an excess profits tax in order to keep u check on exploiters and on inflation, although it had promised in 1949 to institute such a tax. An excess profits tax has an important bearing on wage fixation by the Arbitration Court, because it is a sheer waste of time to fix a wage and then watch its value being reduced because of increases in prices and in the cost of living, such increases in prices being imposed by those who support the Government that now occupies the treasury bench. No wonder the Government is opposed to price fixation ! No wonder it has not introduced an excess profits tax in order to curtail thc exploitation that is now taking place! 1 submit, in conclusion, that the amendparty or intervener may be represented nient brought forward by the Leader of by various people. It then providesthe Opposition meets with the approval of trade unionists, and is designed to but, subject to the next succeeding subremove a lot of the causes of injustices section, rhat exist at present.

There is no doubt that a system which allows for So that there must be consent of all appeals from those decisions is a major parties as well as leave of the comcause of industrial unrest, about which missionthe Government professes to be so concerned. If the Government would accept this amendment, it would produce a far better industrial arbitration act, and it would do a lot towards the restoration of industrial peace in this' country. Supply) [4.22] I shall not guarantee to introduce as much heat into my speech as was shown by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan), who has just resumed his seat. However, I hope to introduce a bit more light on the subject than he did. I shall, first, refer to the honourable member's observations about lawyers. He said a great deal about lawyers, one of his criticisms beinsr that lawyers' opportunities to appear before the proposed courts were not being curtailed as they should he. ber thinks that it is true, then he, as well as the honourable member for Kennedy, has not studied the bill, because the matter is specifically dealt with in proposed new section 16AY. It is true that provision is made for the appearance of lawyers before the Industrial Court that it is proposed to establish. Quite obviously there must be such a provision, because that court will he dealing with legal matters. At. the other end of the scale is the third body, consisting of conciliators, who, of course, will not be lawyers. But between those two bodies there will be an industrial commission, which will be composed of lawyers and laymen. It cannot be said, therefore, that that body will be composed only of lawyers. On the question of appearances before the industrial commission I refer the honourable member and the House to proposed new section 16AT of the bill, which provides that in proceedings before the commission, a a party or intervener shall not he represented by' counsel, solicitor or paid (c) by leave of the Commission and with the consent of a l l parties; or Id) by leave of the Commission, granted upon application made by a party, on the ground that, having regard to the subject matter of the proceedings, there are special circumstances which make it desirable that the parties and interveners may be so represented. So far from the lawyers having a Boman holiday, as the honourable member complained, it can be seen that the lawyers will have a very limited sphere and scope. AlthoughI have spent some 27 years of my working life as a lawyer, I am hound to say that I agree with that provision, hecause I have felt for a long time that there is too much legalism about industrial arbitration.

He spoke, he said, as leader of the Australian Labour party and on behalf of all the trade unionists of Australia. Therefore, he was entitled to be listened to with close attention. I gave him that attention and even went so far -and this, after all, is straining human endurance somewhat--as to read his speech very carefully in Hansard the following day. I shall pass over the attacks that he made upon the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court because that gentleman had dared to criticize some aspects of the 1947 bill which had been brought down by himself when Attorney-General. was, by the way, entitled and obliged, by statute, to do so. The Leader of the Opposition made some further attacks upon thc methods of wage-fixation, upon the suspending of quarterly adjustments, and upon other action of judges of the court, some of whom, I remind honourable members, he, himself, selected and appointed.

We have appealed to the Privy Council because we have been advised that there is a great deal of doubt about the correctness of the High Court's decision. If the High Court is right-and in due course the Privy Council will tell us-it will be necessary to have separate tribunals to deal with these two respective functions. One tribunal will deal not only with appellate matters of a purely legal kind, but also with this matter of fines and penalties, exercising a purely judicial function. We propose to set up such a court. Then we shall need another tribunal which will exercise a purely The Chief Judge arbitral function and, whether or not the High Court is right, we have taken thc view that it will be a good thing for peace in industry, and for arbitration, to separate these functions. We have appealed to the Privy Council, but, as I say, whether we appealed or not and irrespective of the result of such an appeal, legislation would have been necessary. That is the legislation that we are now bringing down. I refer The second point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that there should be what he was pleased to describe as ""drastic amendment"" of the penalty",29,Harol Dholt

66,Mr Beale,"T h a t is so. Myif the Opposition, because he had it all ! limped together into the one court-a n arbitration court exercising, amongst other things, these very contempt powers to which he now objects. The third point made by the Leader of tbe Opposition is that, as provided in the 1947 act, there should be no appeal from the decisions of conciliation commissioners to the court. Gan any honest man say that the 1947 arrangements were satisfactory? Fifteen or sixteen conciliation commissioners were appointed. A great many of them had a very strong trade union bias, because they were nearly all drawn from that field. Nobody is saying that they were not honest men trying to do their best within limitations. They went on their merry way. Some of them, violently prounionist, were incapable of taking an impartial and balanced view of disputes. That statement is not intended to criticize their morality. They proceeded, very often, on different principles, so that in a year or two the arbitration system was approaching chaos. So it was that in 1952 this Government introduced the appeal provisions, which gave a right of appeal from the decisions of conciliation commissioners to the Arbitration Court itself, to try to get some sort of co-ordination and common principles running through the decisions. That is why that provision is retained in the present bill. The fourth thing that is said is that there is not enough conciliation in this bill. Conciliation has become a sort of blanket terma magic word. Nobody knows quite what it means. But what we do know is that we are all in favour of nipping disputes in the bud before they reach the litigation staee. Every one is agreed that there should be people moving throughout industry who will prevent a dispute from becoming so exacerbated that the parties are completely at arm's length and start _ to the Leader of the Opposition, and I read litigate in the court. But Opposition from the amendment that he has members say that there must be more movedconciliation. As the Minister himself showed in his between parties in dispute, whether under the second-reading speech, the fact is_ that .whereby there has beeu a decline of conciliation shall be certified since the 1947 act was introduced. The and shall be conclusive and binding on all reason for that is obvious. If the same parties . . . man is to be both conciliator and arbitrator, when the conciliation fails and there is a full-dress dispute, what is the result? The result was shown by experience to occur again and again. If , in a bona fide spirit of conciliation, one of the parties made an offer and that was rejected by the other party, the conciliator, who then became the arbitrator, did not start de novo and consider the original merits of the dispute, but naturally made the offer a sort of a springboard or a starting point for further concessions in order to get a settlement. Before very long, nobody was keen to conciliate. After all, parties were appealing from Caesar to Caesar, and that was no good to anybody. So, tliere was a decline in conciliation. It is exactly that defect in the legislation that we are trying to cure by having one group of persons as conciliators and an entirely separate group as arbitrators in the arbitration commission. It has been said, also, that conciliation should be compulsory. I have always heard that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink. It is equally true that there is no magic in words in an act of Parliament. Merely saying, "" Thou shalt do something"", does not mean that the parties will do it. Legislation can never go too far ahead of public opinion. Unless a Government proposes to introduce some Draconian laws of some sort, it has to make sure that its laws are reasonably acceptable to reasonable people. Merely saying, "" Thou shalt conciliate "", will not make people conciliate under an unsatisfactory system of conciliation. Therefore, confidence has to be built up and the system made more flexible in order to create trust not only between the parties, but also between the people appearing before the conciliator and the conciliator himself. I come to the fifth point raised by In all cases where agreement is reached act or otherwise, the making of provisions the agreement between the disputants by the appropriate authority ber says, "" Hear hear! "" Let us see where this would lead us. Thei'e is no longer to be any such thing as public interest. This is straight-out collective bargaining. Eor the rest of my speecb, 1 want to have a look at this very vexed and extremely important question of collective bargaining on th? one hand, and industrial arbitration on the other. There is not enough clear thinking about it, and it is time that we all had a look at it to see what are the merits of the two systems and where one system will lead if the other is abandoned. The original act of 1904, as everybody knows, was born of the industrial strife of the late nineteenth century. It was so bitter that it Jed to a sort of a social cry for peace in industry and for independent tribunals to arbitrate between capital and labour. After one or two State acts were passed, the fathers of the Constitution put in placitum (xxxv.) to section 51 of the Constitution, the.words of which are well known to us all. That was the foundation of the arbitration system, which, under placitum (xxxv.), provided for thc conciliation and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond tlie limits of any one State. It was under that provision that the 1904 act was passed. Since then, there has been a welter of decisions and struggles, many of which have been milestones marking the develop* ment, growth and expansion of the Anstralian arbitration system. Thc# Harvester award, in 1907, laid the foundations for the basic wage fixation system. The system has been vastly expanded, bnt that decision was nevertheless the origin of it all. The Whybroxu case, in 1.910, decided that there could not be a common rule in the federal arbitration system. That. I have always felt, waa a grievous short-coming vvhich has been partly overcome by subsequent decisions, but never completely, as we all know. In .1918, Alexander's case decided that the court did not have a judicial power. There was some scuttling around ancl that position was patched up in one way or another. hours, there was a gradual movement, first of all to 48 hours, then to 44 hours and, ultimately, after a long hearing, in 1947, to 40 hours. Nothing illustrates better the difficulties under which wo work in Australia with our federal arbitration system than the action of the New South Wales Government in passing legislation to provide for a 40-hour week right slap bang in the middle of thc Arbitration Court's deliberations on an application for a 40-hour week in federal awards which cover half of Australian industry. almost completely stultifying the proceedings in the Arbitration , Court. That was one of the tragedies associated with the system. One may say, if he is a Labour man, that it was all right, but from any long-range point of view of principle, or from any constitutional point of view, it was an utterly wrong thing to do. It illustrates the sort of difficulty which we are up against in the field of arbitration. We have had hundreds and hundreds of cases in the High Court, about placitum (xxxv.) of section 51 of the Constitution. We have had 31 or 32 amendments passed by this House at. various times and there have been six attempts to amend the Constitution. This builds up to a picture of our industrial arbitration system as a peculiarly Australian institution, which, whether we like it or not, is woven right into the national fabric of our life. It has become part of our tradition and an article of political faith with all parties. Undoubtedly, Australian arbitration has given very great benefits to Australians in the 50 years of its operation, and particularly to the workers of Australia. We hear only about cases that go to the court. We hear only about the struggles, bitterness, discontent, and strikes, but millions of Australian workers in thousands of industries have had their industrial-affairs satisfactorily regulated under that system over the last 50 years. Do not let us assume that because the system has weaknesses, which I shall deal with in a minute, it has not also given great advantages to this country. ThaiI n respect of standard it has great weaknesses, everybody musl admit.",31,Harol Dholt

The limitations of the words in the Constitution promote litigiousness altogether create the wrong atmosphere in which industrial relations between management and labour ought to be conducted and cleared up. The absence of rhe ability to create a common rule is another difficulty. ""We have attempted to make six amendments to the Constitution, and all attempts have failed. I am inclined to think that the seventh attempt may fail, but the gentlemen whom we have recently appointed to our all-party constitutional committee will no doubt be examining that matter. But there it is. Undoubtedly the constitutional position creates a weakness in our arbitration system. Legalism and technicality constitute another difficulty. There is a sapping of responsibility on the part of both management and workers because of the compulsory system and the temptation to throw everything into the lap of the court. These are all major mattersand there are others-and governments have been trying for 50 years to overcome rhem. To-day, from many people the cry is going out, ""Let us scrap it all. Let us have collective bargaining"". I entertained those ideas at one time. I made a trip to England in 1948-a t my own expense, honourable members will be glad to hear-to have a look at the working of the English collective bargaining system uud to see how it compared with our system. Undoubtedly, collective bargaining works well in England, and undoubtedly England would not have our compulsory arbitration system. That was made pretty plain to me. There are many reasons why the collective bargaining system works in England and why it would not work in Australia. There is a. long historical tradition there going back to the clays of the medieval guilds. There is a strong streak of reasonableness on both sides. There is a greater <ense of responsibility on the part of representatives of both management and irihour. which enables the system to work better in England than perhaps it would work here. For all of those reasons I have come to the conclusion that collective bargaining, as practised in England or the United States of America, is not by any means the same sort of collective bargaining as we would have here. The and artificiality, and system would not necessarily work here, and I do not believe that it would. We have a very heavily sheltered economic system in Australia. It is sheltered by high tariffs, which tend to minimize competition. Therefore, we can and do have a situation in which bargains made between management and labour, pressed upon management by labour, and agreed to by management, can be readily passed on to the community. If the amendment moved in this debate were accepted, and it became mandatory upon the court to register such agreements without consideration for the public interest at all, there would be a new spate of inflation, a new pushing up of the cost structure of Australia, and less and less ability in this country to compete in the world's markets. I should like to have more time to develop much further this argument of the difference between collective barsraining and compulsory arbitration. ""Wherever one looks, this point emerges: In this country what we need is not some doctrinaire system, but flexibility, reasonableness and more good faith. We dare not say, "" We will scrap all this and grasp at something new"", merely because at this time, as the Australian Labour party thinks, over-full employment and high demand gives the workers a great advantage. That can only result in inflation and injury to the workers themselve's. ( Mr Lawrence) -Order! The Minis-; ter's time has expired. The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) commenced his speech by condemning the criticisms of the arbitration law which have been made on this side of the House as criticisms of the judges, as they have hitherto been called, of the Arbitration Court. One would have thought that his legalistic horror at such criticisms would have been allayed by the decisions which are the ostensible reason for the legislation, because it is now found that the judges]",33,Harol Dholt
71,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker,,34,Harol Dholt
72,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [4.52],"of the Arbitration Court are not judges in the sense that our Constitution requires judges to be appointed or to fulfil their functions. This bill does not judges either, although it proposes to give them most of the privileges and emoluments of judges. There is nothing uew in regarding as different from other judges the persons who have been called judges on arbitration courts. I quote from some eloquent words used over twenty years ago on this subjectThese words ""conciliation and arbitration"" in the Constitutionnre, I believe, responsible foi much industrial mischief in Australia. They have popularised the idea tliat the settlement of an induscism as are the members of this legislatrial dispute is a judicial matteT and that it ought to be attended to by judges possessing the ordinary legal qualifications. Such a notion is, of course, absurd. Those words were used by the honourable B. G. Menzies, K . C , at that time Attorney-General and Minister for Bailways in the State of Victoria, at a school of the Australian Institute of Political Science in January, 1933, and are recorded in a text-book in the Prime Minister's alma mater, the University of Melbourne. Even he at that time, in his more enlightened and idealistic days, did not eschew criticism of men who were believed at that time to be judges. I quote further from the same work his comments on the first judges of the Arbitration CourtIn demands that one should recognize that Mr parts of the court, but it does not alter Justice Higgins, though a clear-headed and honest nnd courageous man, was too apt to consider industrial and economic problems in a sort of vacuum to make a good practical director of workaday affairs; and that Mr Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Justice Powers was possibly too much affected by .disturbance. The Minister for Supply may well have thrown up his arms and raised his eyes to the roof at such references if -we bad used them. If it was good enough for his leader to make that statement 23 years ago in a school of political science, surely it is suflicient for us to refer dispassionately and factually to the record of a much greater number of gentlemen over recent years who are now found not to be judges at all. If we are to consider the working of the Australian arbitration system, which has now been in operation for over half a century, surely we should"" remove from propose that they be called our minds the idea that one cannot criticize the system for fear of criticizing the judiciary. As the law, interpreted by the High Court of Australia, now stands, nothing oould be further from the truth, and if one is to deal intelligently with these matters, surely one should deal with them unfettered by such considerations. When Mr Menzies, as he then was, referred to the Arbitration Court, he pointed out that it was carrying out a legislative and. not a judicial function. The persons who carry out that function are as much open to crititure. The only difference is that we can he removed at regular intervals-or , as in recent years, at frequent intervalswhereas the men who are judges of the Arbitration Court hold office for life. Unless they break the cruder forms of the criminal law, they cannot be removed. The Minister for Supply, in one of his more eloquent flights, referred to the necessity to make the arbitration system more flexible and to create trust between the parties in industrial relations. The bill does not touch either of those things; it is merely a re-hash of amendments made by this Government to the 1947 act mischievous amendments, which have not achieved any increase of industrial harmony or production. The bill reviewing its past work, candour seeks to alter the names of the various the functions in any respect. The Commonwealth Industrial Court, which will comprise three of the present judges of the well-judged threats of industrial Arbitration, will carry out the court's powers to interpret awards and to inflict penalties for breaches of awards. The remaining judges, or other lawyers who may be appointed, will become presidential members of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The present conciliation commissioners will become the lay members of that commission. Every other feature of the arbitration system as established by this Government during its six and a half years of office will remain undisturbed. There will still he the same system of appeals from a commissioner to a commission composed wholly or principally of presidential members. Those men who are now judges of the court will alone sit as the commission in presidential session to determine standard hours, the basic wage for males and females and loug-servicc leave. There will not be the slightest alteration in substance. The personnel and the functions will remain the same, but the names will be altered. Some of the present judges will be judges of an industrial court in the true constitutional sense of the term, while the others will be presidential members of a commission, but will have the emoluments of judges. The conciliation commissioners will become the lay members of the commission, but they will be given a slight increase of pay. The honourable member for Bruce( Mr a complete dichotomy, the Court and ConSnedden) set out the anomalies which will occur in relation to the commission. Although it has not been manifest to the public, hitherto there has been a dichotomy, to employ a phrase used by Mr Justice Foster in presenting the report of the court in 1950 in the absence of Chief Judge Kelly, between the judges and the conciliation commissioners. They sat apart from each other, they gave separate decisions, and they had their respective spheres which did not overlap, although there were demarcation disputes between the judges and the commissioners just as there are in industry itself. That dichotomy will now be apparent every time the new commission sits to hear references or appeals from a commissioner, because there will be presidential members and lay members sitting side by side. The honourable member for Bruce well showed the difference between the two parts of the commission. A lay member will draw half the salary of a presidential member. Their emoluments will be different, their term of office will he different, and, although the honourable member did not say so. their retiring allowances also will be different. Whether they are sitting, whether they are travelling, or whether tbey are in retirement, there will be a continuing difference, this same dichotomy, between the presidential and lay members of the commission. That, surely, will not make for improved industrial relations or for the expeditious handling of affairs. One can see a trend, throughout this Government's term of office, towards three things in its handling of arbitration: first, towards introducing legalism; secondly, towards using the court for industrial discipline; and, thirdly, towards using the court to bring about economic restrictions. The trend towards legalism was advocated, once there was a change of government, by the Acting Chief Judge, Mr Justice Foster, and by the ChiefJ udge, Mr Justice Kelly. There were no criticisms by the Chief Judge in 1947, 1948 or 1949, but in November, 1950, Acting Chief Judge Foster used the word "" dichotomy"" for the first time. He saidThe present Arbitration system involves ciliation Commissioners occupying areas completely isolated arid independent. He pointed out that problems of jurisdiction frequently arose and were insoluble either by the court or the conciliation commissioner and, secondly, that an award was of uncertain validity because it might be challenged in the High Court by prohibition. His Honour's report was dated the Sth November, 1950. On the 4th December, 1950, the Chief Conciliation Commissioner, Mr Mooney, cracked back at His Honour in these terms. . . The division of power presents no practical difficulties and should and will present none if the. Judges and Commissioners accept the present position so long as it exists, each conceding that the other has and is performing an important assigned task. The Chief Conciliation Commissioner also pointed out that in any year subsequent to the passing of the 1947 legislation there had been fewer appeals to the High Court from the Arbitration Court or the commissioners than there had been in every year preceding the passing of that legislation. On the 24th October, 1951, Chief Judge Kelly again presented a report and returned to the attack. He saidAppreciating the many difficulties of the jurisdictional dichotomy, it can be said that excess of its jurisdiction by either authority is a matter of constant concern to each. The Chief Conciliation Commissioner, in his report of the 5th November, 1951, quickly repudiated that statement by sayingIt may be more difiicult for Commissioners, generally, than for Judges to determine the limits of their respective powers; Commissioners are in the main laymen, whereas judges are in the main lawyers AndI interpolate that I thought the act required that they should all be lawyersbut the difficulty is really not a great one to either and has not in fact, to any appreciable extent, delayed the completion of awards, certainly not to any greater extent than if a single Judge was invested with the powers now exercised by a Commissioner and three Judges with the reserve powers of Section 25. Pursuant to the claims by the judges and the repudiation by the commissioners, the Government yielded to the judges' wishes and, in 1952, amended the from the commissioners to the court. The Leader of the Opposition, the other night, cited some cases of delay and expense which were brought about by that process. He quoted the delay of five months iu the storemeu and packers' general stores award; of four and a half months in an award covering casual storemen on the waterfront; of six months in regard to the Brisbane meat markets award. He mentioned that a later award for tramway employees in South Australia had uot yet been finalized after a lapse of twelve months. He also cited some of the costs which had been incurred by the unions alone in appeal cases. He mentioned that the tramways union, in this last appeal, had already incurred costs amounting to £6,000. I am not suggesting that the counsel engaged were not worth every penny of that amount but the point remains, nevertheless, that the fact that there has been an a.ppea.l from the commissioners to a court, ever since 1952, has meant, first, delay and, accordingly, a denial of just claims and, secondly, a vast increase in expenses to the unions and the employers, and also to the Commonwealth, which frequently intervenes in these matters. The fact that, under this bill, there will still be an appeal from single commissioners to the commission w ill mean that that delay and expense will be perpetuated. There is nothing newthereto use the Minister's term-whic h would make the system more flexible or whicu would promote trust on both sides in industrial disputes. So one notices, first of all, the trend to legalism under this Government, in its amendments to the 1947 act, and one sees that that trend w ill be perpetuated in the new act. That trend has not promoted industrial peace in the country at all. One only has to look at the figures for industrial disturbances to see that is so. The number of men who have gone out on strike in every year in which thi= Government has been in office has beeu greater than it was in any year under the Chifley Government. I do not wish to weary the House with details, but it is useful to read these figures into the record, in view of the constant claims which are made of the successful term of oflice of the act to provide for appeals present Minister for Labour and National Service. I do not want anything that I say to spoil his chances of preferment in his party, or in this Parliament. I' concede that his record in industrial relations is just as good as his rival's record in international relations. I return to the figures. The following number of people went on strike in Australia in the years indicated:Year. Numhor of people. 1945 . -21I9.B41 1946 .. .. .. 331,805 11)47 280,718 1948 .. 301.02.5 1049 .. 200.720 The highest number, it will be noticed, occurred in 1946, when 331,000 people went on strike. Every year, under this Government, that figure has been exceeded. I shall read the relevant figuresYear. Numher on strlkn. 1950 .. .. 391,481 1951 .. . . 3S0.421 1952 .. .. 488.178 1953 .. .. 483.800 1954 . . 355.580 1955 . . 424.340 One can see, therefore, that the number of people who have gone on strike under this Government has increased to a greater extent than the population. In fact, the various amendments which have been made to increase the technicalities, to increase the discipline, and to increase the restrictions of the arbitration system, have not promoted industrial peace in the country as a whole. Concerning the trend to industrial discipline, I point out that it was as a result of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court's use of its power to punish for contempt increasingly in recent years that, finally, a union appealed on this very point to the High Court and successfully asked the High Court;-to use the words of the Minister for Supply, surprisingly-to hold that the Arbitration Court was not a court, and did not exercise judicial powers under the Constitution, and that, therefore, one did not commit contempt of the Arbitration Court when one disobeyed its decisions, awards and orders. The particular matter was probably the most trivial for which a court had ever held its honour and its dignity to be injured. It will' be remembered that some of the memhers of the Boilermakers' Society of Australia had sent round a hat at Mort's Dock for contributions for the dependants of other persons who were on strike. On the 2Sth Tune. 1955, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court statedWu tire not impressed by the description ot because the court had not been exercising the contributions as being to dependants of thejudicial power. Therefore, no contempt strikers although, even if they were intended was committed if its orders were defied for dependants rather tlian the strikers themor disregarded. selves, they would still amount to a subsidy of the strike. Such support of the strike by the defendant Society must constitute a serious, if not the main reason for the strike'shas the money, too. continuance. : The Arbitration Court, in the pasOne of the shabbiest features of the sage that I quoted, said, in effect, Government's conduct in regard to indus'-' Let the dependants starve. If you trial matters is that this fine, and the send around the hat to support the many other fines imposed by the Commondependants of persons on strike, the court wealth Arbitration Court in the last few will deal with you"". It was known to years, have gone into Consolidated Revenue the court itself that the amount of the and are still there. Although the High contributions to each striker's family Court ruled that the Commonwealth varied according to the size of the family. Arbitration Court had no power to inflict There is no doubt that the contributions those fines, that money is still in the Conmade from that collection in the hat solidated Revenue Fund and, apparently, went to strikers-according to the number will remain there pending a decision by of dependants that they had. It was, in the Privy Council. Even then, there is that sense, sustenance for their dependno guarantee that, if the Privy Council ants, not for the strikers. The Arbitration supports the High Court's ruling that the Court, in those. circumstances, found its fines were improperly imposed, the Godignity injured, and said, "" A contempt is vernment will refund the money. It is being committed"", and it proceeded to surely an extraordinarily cheap action on fine the Boilermakers' Society £500. of a handful of its members. a voluntary action by a handful of members. This contribution was not obtained by means of a deduction from pay envelopes. The union did not take up the collection. It was a spontaneous action on the part of a handful of the union's members and because those members were not expelled from the union, the union was held responsible. It is an example of the extent to which the present judges have held that the arbitration system must be used to discipline people who are subject to its awards. That was the last and, even if not the most notorious, the most trivial case in which the court had awarded the maximum penalty. Never was punishment in contempt, I venture to say, so contemptible and never was arbitration so arbitrary. Having come to the end of its tether, the boilermakers' society appealed to the High Court. This was the second fine that the union had incurred over this matter. The High Court-fou r of the judges at all events-held , last March, that the punishment was unconstitutional the part of the Government to Tetain",34,Harol Dholt

75,Mr Cukti,N -The Commonwealth still,38,Harol Dholt
76,Mr Whitlam,"That is very true.money that was paid as a result of fines which the court, as the interpretation of the law at present stands, had no power to impose. J turn now to the trend towards economic restriction. In Australia, very few powers repose in this Parliament, and still fewer in the State parliaments, to deal with economic matters. We have seen that in peace-time there is no power to regulate private investment-that is, no control of capital issues. There is no power, except in regard to hanking transactions, to regulate interest rates. Whilst we have unlimited powers in regard to currency, or taxation or imports, wide sections of the economy, particularly those in private hands covering matters such as investments and dividends and prices, are completely beyond the power of this Parliament, or any other parliament in Australia, to control. While that is so, the arbitration power vested in the Commonwealth has been nsed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the imposition of most extensive discipline, and most extensive economic restriction. At a time when profits, prices and incomes were completely uncontrolled, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court imposed, in respect of persons working under Commonwealth awards, a complete wage freeze. Employees under Commonwealth awards have been the first and most numerous casualties of the fight against inflation. The other night, my leader showed quite clearly that the conciliation commissioners, whose job it was under the 1947 legislation to adjust margins, did not, in fact, adjust margins from 1947 to 1954. They were first dissuaded by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court from dealing with margins, on the ground that the court itself was dealing with the basic wage. When the eourt did belatedly decide, in December, 1950, that, there should be an increase of f l in the basic wage, the conciliation commissioners were still deterred from dealing with margins because of the fact that, at the quarterly conferences between conciliation commissioners, the Chief Judge, who presides over these conferences, made it quite plain to the commissioners that they should defer dealing with margins to counter inflation. That is notorious. The results appeared in the Galvin award and all other awards by conciliation comtion Commissioner Findlay. When the court was given power to hear appeals from the awards of conciliation commissioners all questions of margins were further deferred. They were deferred until 1954, when the court itself held that there should be an increase in margins for those whose margins were 28s. a week or more, but that smaller margins should not be affected. That meant an increase of wages for 40 per cent, of thc employees under Commonwealth awards, and nothing for the other 60 per cent. At the same time there existed, from 1953 until last Friday, a complete freeze of the basic wage. Even last Friday's decision mitigates that to the extent of 10s. only. From now on persons under Commonwealth awards in every State except South Australia will still receive lower wages than persons under parallel State awards. Let me give the detailed figures: In New South Wales, wherfequal numbers of persons are employed under Commonwealth awards and Stnt.p awards, those under Commonwealth awards will receive 3s. a week less than those under State awards. In Victoria, where there are two persons employed under Commonwealth awards for every one employed under State awards, the persons employed under Commonwealth awards will receive l is . a week less than those under State awards. In Queensland, where only 20 per cent, of employees are covered by Commonwealth awards, those employees will receive 5s. a week less than those employed under State awards. In South Australia, where persons employed under Commonwealth awards are double the number of those employed under State awards, those employed under Commonwealth awards will receive 10s. a week more than those under State awards. In Western Australia, where a mere 12 per cent, of employees work under CommonAvealth aAvards, they will receive l is . Id., a week less than those employed under State aAvards. In Tasmania, Avhere 52 per cent, of employees work under CommonAvealth awards, such employees will receive 16s. a Aveek less than those employed under State awards.",38,Harol Dholt
77,"Missioners, Except Those Of Mr Concilia","At the same time, profits and incomes other than wages and salaries have continued to rise. I quote from the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure, which was supplied to us during the consideration of last year's budget. It shows that between 1952-53 and 1954-55 wages and salaries increased from £2,039,000,000 to £2,321,000,000 an increase. of one-seventh. In the same ppviod company income increased from £378,000,000 to an estimated amount of £505,000,000-a n increase of one-third. That is, company incomes increased at more than double the rate of the increase of wages and salaries. Company profits are not generally included in government publications, so one has to go to such a journal as the Financial Revieiv, an authoritative and well-informed journal, to find those figures. On the 26th of last month, reviewing the results of thu operations of 1,070 companies, it stated that between 1953-54 and 1954-55 the ratio of net profit to capital increased from 17.6 per cent, to 18.6 per cent., and the percentage of total dividends to paid capital increased from 9.5 per cent, to 10.5 per cent. Therefore, during the last three years, the wages and salaries of the greater number of employees in Australia -thos e under Commonwealth awardshave been frozen and have remained level, but the rewards for other persons, derived from company profits, have increased very greatly. That well shows the lopsided nature of the economy, and the provocations and injustices for whicli the Government provides no solution in the present measure. -Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) pointed out in his speech that a system of conciliation and arbitration had become an article of faith to all Australians, and that tion can of itself create an atmosphere we had endeavoured to make that article of faith part of our Constitution. This has been done in a most imperfect manner. The series of attempts that have been made over the years to improve an imperfect structure shows that, to some extent, Australians have now come to hold the belief that the root cause of all industrial trouble lies somewhere in the arbitration system. But it is perfectly obvious that, no matter what system is devised, there will still be industrial disputes and strikes, and that people will continue to try to make scapegoats of whatever system exists for the mitigation of such disputes and strikes. If proof were needed of that fact we have only to look at countries where there is no system of conciliation and arbitration, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. We find that the record of industrial disputes in those countries is not significantly different from ours, and the only conclusion we can draw from that fact is that industrial peace, by and large, depends not alone on the system which is provided by the Government for the mitigation or the solving of industrial disputes and deadlocks, but on other factors, either in themselves or in conjunction with that system. I think we have to keep that in mind. We have to look at this matter im a dispassionate way. I give full marks to Opposition members who are versed in the technicalities of the system of arbitration as it has evolved over the years in this country. The only criticism I would offer is that all Labour's amendments are designed to build up a system which will favour one party, or one side, in a dispute. If my thesis that industrial peace depends upon factors other than the machinery of industrial arbitration is correct, the system proposed by Labour will not promote industrial peace, and will not develop that essential goodwill that men in industry should have. I suggest that industrial peace depends first, on the general economic situation and on the strains and stresses that are being felt, and secondly, on the attitude of the parties to disputes so far as their goodwill helps towards a settlement. In those circumstances, we arrive at a state of affairs in which any system of arbitrain which trained advocates seek office in trade unions and determine to take the utmost advantage of the system to press their views, and, on the other hand, employers determined to take the utmost advantage of the system to press their views.

I suggest that the first and most important way to promote industrial peace is for the court to take that attitude. As evidence of that, I refer to the court's judgment in the recent Basic Wage case, in which it made it very plain that it regarded as fundamentally unsound the attitude of State governments and State industrial tribunals which had persisted with methods of adjusting wages on the basis of the cost of living. The Commonwealth court made it quite plain that it would have been able to award a larger increase of the basic wage if the State what the Commonwealth court regarded We have heard a lot of peculiar nonabsurd, because the prices of goods have no relation to the capacity of industry",40,Harol Dholt

If we adopted the principle that community as a whole. I think it is wages should be raised immediately prices increased, the workers would then be entitled immediately to claim higher wages. This would result in the ridiculous proposition that people should be entitled to be paid more and more for working less and less. It is clear that no economy could stand the strain of such that this legislation would tend to proa process.. Employment would break down and inflation and chaos would result. The Oommonwealth Arbitration Court has directed attention time and again to the danger of such a situation. That is why it now says-quit e soundly, I the decision were not favorable to them, suggest-that the capacity of industry to pay should be the determining factor in the fixing of the basic wage. In suption system do anything hut promote port of my contention that that is a sound principle, I quote an economist of no less note than the late Lord Keynes, who, in The General Theory of Employment specifically referred, in scathing terms, to Australian attempts to preserve the real value of wages rather than the money value of wages by these periodic cost-ofparty who was not suited by the decision living adjustments. He said that Australia was saved only by the inevitable inefHcacy of legislation designed to achieve that object. Legislation cannot achieAei t except in a closed economy. r Australia's economy is not a closed one. -We have to trade and live with the rest of the world. We now have in Australia a system of wage adjustment which tries to relate the guilty parties. the Australian economy not only to the productivity of the workers, which ber for Hindmarsh affects the capacity of industry to pay, Cameron) chooses to be facetious about but also, very sensibly, to our position a serious subject. I have not heard him relative to other countries. If we are make a serious suggestion about what enjoying prosperity, with good markets would happen if there were no powers overseas, that is a reason for increasing of enforcement in an arbitration system. our level of wages. Buti f things are Does he want a system of arbitration or tightening up and our level of costs is does he not? It is about time that some not keeping pace with levels of costs in honourable members opposite stopped other parts of the world, that is a very playing politics in relation to this matter good reason for refusing to increase our and made a serious effort to suggest a wage level further. So the criticism structure that will work in the interests of the honourable member for Werriwa of all parties, not only in the interests that the court is tending towards econoof the party they happen to represent. mic restriction seems to indicate that houorable members opposite advocate some sort of arbitration system which has no economic responsibility to the quite clear that, if we do have such a system, with complete irresponsibility to the community, we shall have au atmosphere conducive"" to industrial unrest. The second leg of the complaint by the honourable member for Werriwa was mote discipline in arbitration. What would arbitration be if there were no power to enforce decisions? It would be only a means for either employers or employees to try to gain a point. If it would be disregarded entirely. Under those circumstances, would the arbitrafurther disputes and arguments?

When a decision had been reached, nothing wtould happen. No result would be achieved, because the could, if he chose, ignore it completely.

After all, they are only human, and possibly they resented a curb being placed on their powers. We are faced with the difficulty of reconciling the delay that must occur under a system of appeals and the desirability of uniformity. I think the honourable member for Werriwa will be fair enough to concede that in any system of law or pseudo-law it is desirable to have some uniformity, so that the parties can make a guess about where they are likely to stand. It would be undesirable if they could say, "" If Commissioner so-and-so, we should have got a different decision.

They go into the court with their legal advisers behind them, and when they rise to speak they have to be prompted at every second word by their legal advisers, or by some expert on the subject whom they have engaged to assist them. It is a farcical performance when these people try to conduct a case, and have to be continually prompted. I see that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is nodding his head. He will be aware that this practice can become widespread if legislation restricts too closely the rights of parties to be represented by counsel. After all, it is only human, when one is engaging in argument, to try to employ some one who is expert in argument. better to prevent legal advisers from being in the court room at all?

That provision has regard only to the importance or otherwise of the subject matter, and I think that there w ill probably be considerable diffidence on the part of the commissioner to grant leave for counsel to appear in a tuppennyha'penny dispute. Another aspect of this amending legislation which honourable members opposite appear to have disregarded is our attempt to provide some system of conciliation and mediation in industry, which is in accordance with the frequently expressed wishes of honourable members of the Opposition.

I do not think that any good purpose will be served at this stage by insisting that a certain number of conciliators be appointed. I believe that this bill goes a long way towards meeting most of the objections that have been voiced by honourable members opposite over the years. There is no foundation whatsoever for the main objection of the Opposition, which concerns rhe penal provisions of the bill, because, having been in governinent, the Opposition must realize that legislation to provide for industrial arhitration cannot function unless there is power to enforce rhe decisions of the court. I support th° legislation, and I believe that it is a major step forward in the development nf onr conciliation and arbitration machinery. BeforeI proceed to comment on the proposed legislation, I should like to offer my concratulations to the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Kearney) on the excellent speech that he delivered in this House last week. ""We feel greatly encouraged by the quality of that speech, and by the knowledge that the honourable member displayed of his subject. ""We feel that, tbe Parliament is greatly helped in its deliberations by the presence of a inan of the quality of the honourable member, and we welcome his presence in this chamber. I now turn my attention to the bill before the House. The Parliament has again come face to face with a problem that has been the subiect of considerable contention, and that bas required review by the Parliament on other occasions. Governments have even been defeated because of their policies on this all important, matter. I can remember the situation that developed in 1929, when a government' of the same political complexion as the present one attempted to meant the end of industrial arbitration. Even certain of that Government's own supporters were unwilling to accept the Government's policy on that occasion. Among them were the bonorable member for North Sydney, Mr ""W. M . Hughes, the honourable member for Darling able member for Wentworth, Mr Marks, anil the honourable member for Fawkner, Air. Maxwell. Those gentlemen voted with the Labour party at that time, and the Government was defeated because of its threat to Australia's arbitration system. We are now facing the problem again. I feel that this Government will find it very difficult to justify this legislation to the people of Australia. Australians are most averse to the imposition of penalties in connection with industrial matters, especially arbitration, which should call forth every effort towards finding agreement, considering the other man's point of view, and appreciating the values that should be embodied in the determinations made. This is particularly so where the life, the health and the well-being of our community are concerned. Surely these things should be beyond determination by punitive measures. The principle of* arbitration calls for a different spirit, and it must be undertaken with a different outlook from that evidently employed by Government supporters. One can trace that attitude back almost to the beginning of arbitration in Australia. It was featured in the speech of Mr Deakin, the Prime Minister of the day, in introducing the first arbitration bill. To show the spirit behind that legislation, I shall quote from that speech. In it we see the idea of subjecting the working classes to some form of restraint because of the opposition that they presented to certain of the employing interests. Tn 1.904, Mr Deakin saidThere is to be no antagonism between the new order of things and the old. . . . The central purpose of the hill is to prevent strikes and lockouts . . . To protect employers and investors from the growing power of organized labour. That, no doubt, has been the spirit that has been manifest in the thinking of anti-Labour governments",44,Cameron What The Commission Is A Step In The Right Direc

It has become almost an industrial code that restraint should be exercised upon the efforts and aspirations of working people to improve their conditions. Therefore, we must recognize that any legislation which has relation to the principle of arbitration should be reviewed in a new spirit. Only in that way shall we have a more just and more favorable acceptance of that principle. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Eecently, when presenting to the House a bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I offered the view that industrial questions in Australia are, in my judgment, more difficult and complex than possibly in any other country. Some of the factors' that produce this result bear on the measure currently before the House. As I said then, there is a record degree of trade unionism in Australia. That is, of course, not a bad thing in itself. We, as a government, have encouraged trade unionism and have encouraged the newcomers to this country to join the union appropriate to their palling. We have maintained close and, f believe, co-operative relations with the organized trade union movement, but it is one of the cardinal facts in the Australian community life that, more so than in any other industrialized country, we have this very high degree of unionism amongst wage and salary earners. Then, we have a very much more active trade union participation in party politics than is to be found in most other countrieseven more than in the United Kingdom where there is a long-established tradition of collaboration by the trade union, movement with one of the major political parties. That activity in Australia takes place both at the organizational and the policy level. Over recent years we have had a sustained situation of full employment, greatly strengthening the bargaining power of the trade union and the individual unionist. To a regrettable degree,. Communists have infiltrated key sectorsof our economy. The coal-mining and waterfront unions are conspicuousexamples of the way in which power hascome into the hands of Communist officials, to be exercised by them for the purpose that they serve. In Australia tremendous power is in the hands of thetrade unions, but, with some very commendable exceptions, I do not think it could be said that the degree of discipline and responsibility has been developed' by the individual trade union or thetrade union movement as a whole which measures up to the tremendous power which resides in the hands of the organized trade union movement of this country. We have, in addition, a well-establishedtradition of solidarity on the part of the men at work which tends to produce a somewhat undiscriminating support for strike action, wherever it occurs. Some of these factors are good in themselves; some of them are bad in themselves. But, taken altogether, they create for this country a problem of great complexity and great difficulty. I have repeated those elements in our situation again to-night because I believe it becomes increasingly important for Australia that all of us have a realization of the significance of these developments which are going on around us. Viewing the stevedoring industry against this background, we recognize that it occupies a particularly significant place in the Australian economy.

110,' Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"^Minislive in an island continent of vast distances between capital cities of the various States and between one principal centre ar>'| another. The island State of Tasmania is vitally concerned with the efficiency of maritime transport. Having a small population, we have not yet developed as fully as other older and more closely settled countries the transport systems which they have been able to produce. Our circumstances demand of ns that we develop the most efficient system of shipping services and waterfront operation that we can contrive. But nobody would suggest for one moment that we have achieved this. It is a matter of unhappy notoriety that our waterfront performance is"" chronically bad. Performance is poor. Industrial relations are bad and have been bad for generations. The stevedoring industry has been rightly described more than once as a turbulent industry. If we examine the incidence of industrial disputes in this industry, we find that over recent years they have caused an average loss of about 5 per cent, of working time. This is around 80 times the rate of loss experienced over industry generally. owners contributed to that loss? this stage seeking to apportion blame in one quarter or another. I am merely trying to state quite factually what I believe the position to be. Buti f we are looking at it in an objective spirit, I throw in as an illustration what this means in terms of cost to the Australian community. For example, I am advised by the Stevedoring Industry Board that, on an average day with the average amount of shipping in port, a one-day hold-up in the port of Sydney would cause a loss to the shipping companies on that day of about £30,000. The economic losses and dislocation on the waterfront are very much more serious than in the case of most other shipping combine and its extortion of industries, even the coal industry. In the profits ? coal industry, if there is a stoppage of work for a day at a time when stocks in honourable gentleman will allow me to prothe hands of consumers are satisfactory, ceed with my discussion of this very nobody suffers very much except the complex problem, I hope to be able to coal-miners and the coal-owners. The deal with most of the matters which are coal-miners have lost that day out of exercising his mind. their working lives, but the coal is still there to be mined, and in a national sense the loss is not so sorely felt. When the shipping of a port is held up for a day a direct loss of wages is suffered by the waterside workers, and heavy losses are sustained by the shipping and stevedoring companies, and that process starts a chain reaction of dislocation which tends to run right through the economic structure. So, Australia has paid dearly over recent years, and indeed for many years, for this unsatisfactory waterfront performance. The industry is hampered by restrictive practices, some of which developed over the war years. If honourable members study the judgment of Mr Justice Ashburner in the .sling loads case, they will find comments made there on the way in which, during the course of the war years, by using the bargaining strength that had then developed, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia introduced at various ports restrictive practices which still hamper the efficient operation of industry in those ports. The judge has declared that in some ports the sling loads are disgracethe fully low and that in others these restrictive practices have resulted in an unsatisfactory level. I mention that merely as an illustration. If time permitted, one could give scores of illustrations of this very character, and one of the purposes of the bill is to enable the authority set up by the bill, in conjunction with the commission which is being established under another measure before the Parliament, to examine and regulate these practices which exist in the various ports and to see whether some reasonable level of performance can be established which is equitable in the interests of all concerned and certainly measures up to the requirements of the public interest. with the other side of the picture, the The relations",46,Suspension Of Standing Orders

Many trade unionists view waterfront developments as elements in a continuing struggle between the shipowner and the wharrie, but any talk of a psychology on the part of the waterside worker which impels him to strike, or on the part of the shipowner which makes him utterly unco-operative, seems to be answered by the experience of New Zealand where, over the last two years, there has been virtually no loss of working time from industrial disputes on the waterfront. Each of the groups directly concerned may sustain direct losses in the struggle, but the wharfie tends to take the view that the ships will still be there to be loaded when the trouble ends, and the facts reveal that the shipowners, not unnaturally perhaps, have sought to recover their losses by increasing their freight charges. Tn order to show what this means to us all, one has only to take the example which I give to-night, one of the scores which may be mentioned, of the rise in freight costs which have occurred in the carriage of general cargo between the ports of Melbourne and Sydney since the beginning of the war. In 1939, the rate for the carriage of general cargo between Melbourne and Sydney was £1 a ton. It rose to £6 14s. a ton as from the lst June, 1956. I think that most honourable members will agree that we have experienced rises in the cost of most commodities and services in the period since 1939, but I would invite any of them to poiut to one commodity or service which has experienced the abnormal rise which this instance illustrates.

124,Mr Haeoldholt,"the reasons at this stage, but honorahle gentlemen opposite, who were in government at that time and repealed that legislation, will be fully aware of the factors that made its repeal, in their judginent, desirable. The 1947 legislation was replaced by legislation of 1949, which set up the Stevedoring Industry Board. Some of us, as members of the then Opposition, strongly criticized the legislation which set up the Stevedoring Industry Commission, and we were very conscious of the need to produce some worth-while improvement of the arrangements then introduced if there was a continuing need for some sort of organization or administrative body to regulate the work force to ensure that men were available for thc needs of the various ports, and for that purpose to maintain a system of registration so that men would be available as required. There have been strong differences of Opinion about how an improvement of the position established by the 1949 legisemployers themselves. The overseas shiplation might best be brought about. Some persons have argued with conviction that, as far as practicable, we should restore a more normal employer-employee relationship in the industry. On the other hand, there have been those who have had misgivings about whether, having regard both to the industrial strength of thrunion and the differing interests of the very considerable body of employers in the industry, such a restoration would not produce even worse results. It may not be generally known that there are approximately 1S3 stevedoring companies on the Australian coast. Some are registered in more than one port, so, actually there are 327 registrations of stevedoring Companies. There are approximately 40 shipping companies operating around the coast, most of which are registered in more than one port, so that there are 160 registrations of shipping companies. It will he observed that, where you have the same work force in each of the ports but different employers from time to time, it is not easy to find a scheme that will produce what might be termed the normal employer-employee relationship. It will also be observed that, even if it were desired that the Government should step out of this field entirely and should leave the organization of the waterfront work force to the stevedoring companies and the shipowners-possibly , in suitable circumstances, in conjunction with the representatives of the unionthere would need to be a body run by the employers separately or in conjunction with the union with administrative functions, comparable to that which the Government proposes to establish under this bill. This Government did not rush into an immediate overhaul of .the existing legislation following its assumption of office. Indeed, there are some persons who feel that it has heen too tardy in its approach to a comprehensive overhaul. I point out, however, that there were disagreements between the various elements in the industry. I do .not confine that remark to the more obvious disagreements between the representatives of the union and those of management. I include the differing interests in the ranks of the owners had certain interests that they thought should be protected, and they did not always run hand in hand with the interstate steamship owners. Inside the interstate group itself were independent shipowners and others amongst whom there were differences of opinion. However, the Government took two important steps in its legislation of 1954. It will be remembered that at that time the Government presented to the Parliament a bill that sought to vary the method of recruitment. It did this because the ""Waterside Workers Federation was not, as it had demonstrated in earlier periods, willing to supply labour up to the stipulated level in the various ports. So an opportunity was given to the shipowners to build up the work force. Moreover, because of the conflicting views and allegations that were coming to me and other members of the Government, it was thought highly desirable to constitute a committee of inquiry that would furnish to the Government some up-todate advice which would guide the Governmeut in the course that should be followed. That was the view, not only of the Government, but certainly also of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and, I believe, of the Waterside Workers Federation. There was a general feeling that, if such an inquiry could produce an objectively found body of information, it would be of great help to the Parliament in deciding what policy should be adopted in the future. So the Government set up the Tait committee, consisting of a chairman in the person of Mr Tait, a barrister at the Victorian bar, Mr Gibson, a senior and respected representative of the employers, and Mr already investigated, together with such Shortell, a senior and respected member of the trade union movement. Government not include a representative speedily. It has reported on the organizaof the waterside workers? the honourable member to say. There may discipline; disputes and stoppages; and be some who disagree with the composithe very important problem of regulation tion of the committee, but I believe that and control. those three gentlemen set about the very heavy task that we imposed upon them with an earnest desire to produce findindicate, very shortly, the principal findings that would be of value to the ings of the Tait conimittee. In the Parliament and which would assist all first place, it came to the clear and firm sections of the industry to work out a conclusion that there should be a statumore acceptable scheme of waterfront tory authority in this industry possessed, organization. It was our hope when we set up the sent board. Its conclusions pointed to committee, at the end of 1954, that we the need, in many instances, to clarify would have a report quite early. At that existing powers, generally, in the directime, I asked the committee to make its tion of defining the area aud manner of findings as soon as possible and, if practheir exercise.

The Australian economy simply cannot advisability afford to go on losing 5 per cent, of the arbitral functions.

Taking the two to vest in the statutory authority the aspects that I have mentioned togetherthe 5 per cent, loss of working time from maintain industrial stoppages, a loss 30 times as between the statutory authority and the great as that which occurs in the rest arbitration tribunal, but under condiof Australian industry, and a loss of 5 tions which would avoid the difficulties per cent, of working time through rainit will be seen that, even if these were had the only two directions in which we were able to effect some improvement, there would be a dramatically advanit will be seen, follows very closely the tageous impact upon the Australian findings of the committee of inquiry. It economy as a whole. The committee considered the present known as tbe Australian Stevedoring procedures for handling disputes were Authority, composed of a chairman and quite inadequate, partly because of overtwo members-on e from the management lapping of functions between the arbiside of industry and one from the trade tration tribunals and the Australian union side. The Tait committee, and Stevedoring Industry Board. It referred before it Mr Basten. who. it will be in critical terms to the delays in deterrecalled investigated the problem of the mining disputes. It reported quite waterfront at an earlier stage, agreed Justice Wright, which resulted in a restoration of a fair measure of superThe committee was particularly critical of vesting in the statutory authority the whole of the court's court's arbitral functions but, instead, to a division of functions as and problems on which the committee reported so adversely. The broad plan provided in this bill, is along these lines. First, we are providing for a statutory authority to be that those members should uot come from the waterfront or shipping interests or from the unions directly involved. The Government believes that this is the proper course, at least at this stage of the history of this industry. It may be argued that, under more favorable circumstances, it could be desirable to have representatives of the employers and the trade unions directly concerned in the industry sitting with the authority which is to regulate the conduct of stevedoring operations. There may be arguments which run both ways as to the desirability of that; but I think it will be agreed almost universally that at this stage, and with the known unsatisfactory relationship existing between management and the union, it would be fatal for the successful working of any authority to have such direct representation on it at this time. Secondly, the bill proposes to give the authority clear, hut rather more limited, functions than the present board has. In certain directions the functions of the authority are being stated more explicitly. The main differences from the present functions of the board are that the power to control the performance of stevedoring operations, except during emergencies declared by the Minister-and I should hope that they would be rare to the point of non-existence-is to be eliminated, and the present power to regulate is being limited so that its. exercise will avoid, as far as possible, impingement on the control hy employers of their labour and their methods of working. The employers have strongly represented that the authority should have no power to regulate at all. Mr Basten expressed concern about the power to "" control"", and his final suggestion was that the power of the board to "" regulate and control"" should be re-expressed. His dislike of "" control"" stemmed from his belief that it involved a direction of labour and management. The Tait committee, on the other hand, argued that the authority should have extensive powers of regulation, but added that these "" should he exercised without interfering more than is essential with the authority of and control by, the individual stevedore employer"". In order to make the position as clear as possible specific provisions to that end are included in the bill. Subject to some re-arrangement, it is proposed to retain the other functions expressed in the present act, except the power to develop port facilities, which the Government regards as the affair of the State Governments. Not that we abandon interest in that aspect; but the States have certain constitutional responsibilities in that regard. The power to provide medical facilities, and certain amenities, is being qualified to apply only where employers and other authorities do not provide such facilities and amenities. This has not been done with any intention to limit the standard of the amenities or the facilities to be provided. On t.he contrary, the authority will, I hope, be vigilant to ensure that that is uot the case. But some of the port authorities felt that they should be given the opportunity to link up with their own port development the provision of desired facilities. On the other hand, the employers see, in the provision of certain medical facilities, an opportunity for them to extend what is being done at present, in an atmosphere removed from the bitterness of the ordinary industrial dispute, and to demonstrate their willingness to be of assistance in this aspect of the industry. I believe that their good faith should be tested at least to the extent of providing this opportunity. But the safeguard is there, and will continue to exist at all times, that, where standards fall below what is believed to be desirable, the authority will have the power to remedy the position. In accordance with the findings of the Tait committee certain of the present functions are being spelt out more precisely. For example, specific provision is heing made to cover the organization of transfers of waterside workers from one joh to another, and from one employer to another; the extension of the press and radio system; the application of the principle of intermediate starts; the regulation of the conduct of waterside workers on the wharfs, and so on. Some of those matters are currently before the judge, and it may be that, as a result of his determination, much of the answer to these problems will be found in a short space of time. There have been arguments in the past as .to whether the board could do certain of these things, so the matter is being put as far beyond doubt as we can contrive. In addition, in line with the Tait committee's findings, the authority is being given the functions of investigating means of increasing efficiency generally which, in particular, will allow it to study means of overcoming such problems as working in the rain, which causes so much loss of working hours, and other matters of importance. It is to have the function of investigating the causes of delays on the waterfront. Those frequently occur through faulty organization of movement of cargo by rail and other transport to the port, inadequate wharf accommodation, insufficient storage house accommodation, and so forth. Lastly, it is to have the function of encoxiraging safe working and,, where necessary, providing industrial clothing such ns gloves. I believe that this is a useful extension of the activities of the authority. Honourable members know that, in relation to the handling of some cargoes, the employer is required to provide certain protective clothing to the wharf labourers; but, as I have already pointed out, there are many employers in this industry and if each, in turn, issued protective clothing for a particular type of operation it might well happen that, in the course of a year or so, an employee would get many sets of gloves or some other item of protective clothing. We think there would be more satisfaction, and that much greater economy would be effected, if the authority were to maintain stocks of protective clothing and issue such clothing as occasion required. The bill provides that, as at present, ment of the authority. orders will be made in exercise of the functions of the statutory authority. However, qualifications are proposed, may appear to be a complicated arrangefirst, as already mentioned, about avoidment. It is true that it could be avoided ing any unnecessary encroachment on by giving all the power to the commission management functions; secondly-and or to the authority; but the Government this is an important aspect-h y requiring feels that there will be fairly widespread consultation with both sides before orders agreement that we should not remove of the authority are made; and, thirdly, from the Conciliation and Arbitration by providing that orders cannot be given to particular employers or in respect of particular stevedoring operations. Thc authority will not be able to step in and take such a hand in the day-to-day conduct of stevedoring operations as to be able to say to this or that company, "" This is what you will do "". But it will have a general and broad regulatory power. It is proposed to vest in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which is being set up under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which is also before the House, the present powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to settle industrial disputes affecting the waterfront. But we are making certain provisions designed to overcome the difficulties to which the Tait committee referred. We are providing that the commission, where it has a matter before it dealing with the physical conduct of stevedoring operations, with which the authority is better fitted to deal, may ask the authority to deal with that matter. We are also providing that, where a matter before the commission is of only local concern, the commission may, by arrangement with the authority, ask the local representative of the authority, for example, to deal with the matter. In addition, the bill proposes other means of overcoming the present overlap of functions between the arbitration tribunal and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. In brief, the bill proposes that when the authority wants to make an order within the area of its functions which is inconsistent with an award of the commission, including an award of the old Arbitration Court, it must first obtain the approval of the commission. Conversely, we are providing that when the commission, in dealing with an industrial dispute, wants to make an award inconsistent with an order of the authority, it will first obtain the agreeAt first sight, and at first sound, this -Commission the power to deal with wages, nours and other conditions of employment and, indeed, the whole range of matters now set ont in the current act. On the other hand, there will be widespread agreement that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will not be equipped to deal with the day-to-day administration of the bureaux system, recruitment of labour, and matters of -that character. Indeed, judging by some of his recent decisions, that is clearly the view that Mr Justice Ashburner, the judge who deals with this particular industry, himself takes of the problems of the industry. In his decision in the sling loads case the other day, he threw the responsibility for deciding what was a reasonable sling load on the employers, hut added that, if they did not deal with the matter satisfactorily, it should be -dealt with by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. I think that decision indicates the judge's attitude as to thf. relative range of his own function as a tribunal and that of the administrative authority. We believe these arrangements will work, because, by and large, the areas of overlapping between the functions of the authority and those of the commission will be reduced to a minimum. They are arrangements which will remove the grounds of objection that the Tait committee raised. They will fix responsibility for the discharge of functions, ancl they will obviate the possibility that either the authority or the commission may be able to avoid dealing with a matter on the ground that it is the affair of the other body. In short, what we believe is needed in this industry is a working partnership or, at least, an operative link between the statutory authority and the commission. I said something earlier about the port inspectors. The Tait committee found in favour of the system, and Mr Justice Ashburner has commented favourably on the use of inspectors in averting stoppages by giving rulings on the spot. But their position has been somewhat undefined. This will be remedied by defining tlieir functions so as to make it clear that they act as conciliators and advisers. They will not be authorized to dictate how work should be done, or to give authoritative rulings. The bill sets out their functions precisely and, I believe, conforms witli the findings of the committee. I come now to an important matterlabour recruitment. BeforeI proceed to describe the provisions relating to it. perhaps I should state shortly why tb' Parliament is called upon to make special provision for this industry. The importance of it has already been emphasized. Shipping movements cannot all be co-ordinated to ensure that ships arrive and leave ports in a regular stream. There are many ships. They follow many different routes, and they are owned by different owners. Heavy rain at a port may add to difficulties. If it continues over a period of days, it may cause a bank-up of shipping at that port or some other port. If there were a regular stream of ships, the provision of labour to service them would be relatively simple. It would be possible to fix a labour force capable of keeping the ships constantly moving, one after the other, in circumstances which would avoid any idleness on the part of the workers. However, the fact is that there are peaks and' flushes of shipping movements through our ports. If any of these ships are delayed because labour is not available, there is necessarily an economic loss, because the cost of keeping ships idl« in ports is great. Obviously, that ha«< its influence on freight rates. On the other hand, we cannot afford, especially in a full-employment economy, to have men sitting on the waterfront, ready and available to meet any call, just in order to keep the ships moving, but in circumstances which would mean that many waterside workers woulcl be idle for long periods. In short, the problem is to reconcile the interests of the community, which is directly affected by freight rates, which iu turn, are affected by losses resulting from idle ships, with a need to have proper regard to the interests of the waterside workers. What we as a community cannot afford to do is to place thf interests of the waterside workers above the interests of the community as a whole. We have to provide a labour force which will he sufficient to cope with the normal run of shipping, even .though that means that, on some occasions, some ships will be delayed for a short while, and we have to take other steps to cope with the usual and unavoidable peaks and flushes. The Tait committee saw that problem very clearly, and it proposed certain measures to deal with it. We have adopted its proposals in the bill. But there is yet another problem-that of the seasonal ports. There we have MU unusually heavy run of ships over several months. The port of Hobart, in lhe fruit season, and the north Queenshind ports, at the peak of the sugar season, are illustrations. It must be eviThe union maintains that it has no power dent to all that it would be quite ridiculous to build up a labour force to meet these conditions, only to have men idle for the rest of the year. Certainly, we cannot afford to hold up the ships. If we did, the Tasmanian fruit would not hit the market at the right time, and Queensland's sugar and meat would not get away at the most favorable periods. We propose to meet these problems by the means provided in the bill. I want to emphasize that furthest from the minds of myself and of my colleagues in the Government is any desire to return to the pre-war practice of having casual labour -me n known as "" seagulls "", "" snipers "". or whatever they were called-sittin g by the wharfs in the hope of getting a joh, but not part of the work force normally engaged. To think in those terms would be to throw away all the advances made in the last fifteen years in the direction of decasualizing work on the Australian waterfront. Accordingly, the bill adopts rhe nresent system of registering waterside workers and employers in the industry, with the statutory authority fixing quotas at each port. This provision, which was an important feature of the Stevedoring Industry Board's operations, has been retained, although there has been an extensive re-writing of the whole of the present provisions in order to cope with some constitutional problems which have manifested themselves. The Government proposes to leaveprimary responsibility for recruitment where it is at the present time and has bppn for many years past-wit h the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. In other words, once a quota has been fixed, it will be for the union to provide the labour. However, if the union fails to provide it, the statutory authoritv the statutory authority. This has heen will, after giving the union a further opportunity, proceed to recruit the labour itself. But even in this event, the union and the employers will be given the opportunity to object to the registration of any recruit. Provision is made to enable men so recruited to become members of the union. As to short-term recruitment, to date, the union has not been prepared to consider short-term registrations. By that I mean registrations limited to a period not in excess of, say, six months. to admit such persons to membership. In the Government's view, provision should be made to deal with the problems of places like Hobart, in the fruit season, and tlie north Queensland ports, in the sugar season. With short-term registrations, problems of redundancy caused by surplus waterfront labour existing after rhe need has passed, eitlier temporarily or for an indefinite period, would almost disappear, and, logically, the objections of the union to the building up of the laboui' force, with the risk of underemployment when the season has passed, a ho should disappear. .So the bill will permit short-term registrations, and will empower the union to alter its rules to admit to membership the waterside workers concerned. It proposes that the statutory authority will fix the number of temporary registrants needed at a port and then ask the union to provide the men. If the union fails to do so, the authority will be able to recruit the labour required. Let me now turn to supplementary labour. The problem, of coping with unpredictable labour shortages after bad weather, and so on, or because of shippingflushes,has constantly faced us. The union has always opposed the use of occasional labour to relieve emergencies. Apparently, it has not been very much concerned about ships standing idle because labour is not available. But I have already said that the Government will not countenance the pre-war idea of casual labour; and its assurance on that score \? given publicly to the union and other interested organizations. It is our belief that men could be found who would respond to a call to assist occasionally in the evenings and at week-ends if the arrangements were properly organized by done before. It is a regular thing in New Zealand at present. Far from causing industrial trouble in New Zealand, tbe record of industrial peace there in recent vears is something that we in Australia might well envy. It is done elsewhere, I believe. The Tait committee reported that if supplementary labour was available when required, if it could be organized, trained and subjected to discipline, and. if the circumstances and conditions for its use could be so precisely prescribed that it would be clear that it would not be used to the detriment of the legitimate interests of the regular federation labour, its use would contribute to a solution of the problem of peaks and flushes of shipping, particularly those of the abnormal type. It is proposed to do just those things. The bill provides that the authority may organize for the use of supplementary labour in the evenings and at week-ends to meet emergencies-onl y emergenciesof the type mentioned, which seem likely to cause the performance of stevedoring to be prejudicially affected for atleast five days. This labour will not be used if union labour can be made available. No one will be permitted to work under these conditions unless his name has been recorded with the authority and his engagement for the day has been approved hy the authority. To meet the Tait Committee's point about not defeating the legitimate interests of the union member, it is proposed that registered waterside workers shall be guaranteed a minimum wage for the four weeks succeeding the last use of supplementary lahour. The guarantee proposed is that if, in any period of seven days in a total period of 28 days after supplementary labour ceases to be nsed, the ordinary waterside worker's total earnings, including attendance money, are less than ten times the attendance money rate-that is. £12-the difTerence between the earnings and £12 will be paid by the authority, provided that the waterside worke observes all the terms a.nd conditions of employment, applicable to him. I think it necessary to add that, in my view, the need for making use of supplementary labour will be rare. Tn some ports, it may never he needed. The occasion for its use could disappear if systems of transfer such as those that operate in Brisbane and Adelaide were applied to other ports, and if other reforms of existing methods and practices were made. The point I am making i» that these provisions for supplementary labour are in the nature of a reserve power in the statutory authority, to be used only when the occasion really warrants, and when it seems to be the only way to avoid cargo congestion and shipping hold-ups. I should say here that the bill enables the union to admit to membership men who put their names down with the authority to work a supplementary labour. In short, nothing in the bill is designed to provide for the constitution of a second labour force on the waterfront, outsidt the union. I have already said something about redundancy. The bill contains proposalswhich, I believe, will improve the position so far as the union is concerned. The Tait eommittee proposed that the circumstances in which redundancy should be applied should be clarified. There is an agreement between the owner and the union that the owners will noi ask for the application of the redundancy provisions foT twelve months after a quota has been determined. It is pro posed to provide that the authority shall apply the provisions only if requested by the owners or the union and the authority is satisfied that the members registered will not waste to the new quota inside a year. I am hopeful that, in view of thc other provisions that T have described we can think of redundancy as something unlikely to occur except in most unusual circumstances. Now a word about discipline. The Tait committpp dealt at length with the problem of discipline. It urged thp introduction of a system of fines as an alternative to cancellation or suspension 1, of registration. It argued that such a course would be preferable to the prespnt system of suspension, which mean? frequently that a port is dp.pri""f>d of lfhmir when it is most needed. But, unfortunately, onr law advisors havp told us that no pTaetioahlp, svstp.m of fines can be evolved, and I gather that others who have studied the problem share, that view. The Tait Committee also found that the present disciplinary provisions should be clarified. It is proposed, in the circumstances, to adhere to the present arrangements but to restate the circumstances in which cancellation or suspension should occur. It is provided that appeals against cancellation or suspension of registration of waterside workers shall lie to the Commouwealth industrial court. In the case of employers, it seems to the Government that pecuniary penalties are more appropriate, at least in respect of some defaults. The bill provides, therefore, that in certain specified cases the authority may charge an employer before tlie Commonwealth industrial court for failing to carry out obligations to be expected of employers in this industry. A minimum fine of £100, with a maximum of £1,000, is provided for. In additioinI stress this-the industrial court is given power rn direct the statutory authority to cancel or suspend the registration of an emplover. While I am on the subject of discipline, it is desirable, I think, that I should say that the Government has been much concerned that the waterside workers should be entitled, irrespective of their behaviour, to receive attendance money-whic h is now 24s. a day, as well as a payment additional to the loading in the general wage rate, awarded because of the casual nature of the work. We think it quite inconsistent with the puhlic interest that on occasions when there has been misconduct or default of a group of waterside workers in a particular port, that those waterside workers should be eligible immediately for the payment of attendance money. We propose, therefore, that the statutory authority may, under certain circumstances, suspend the operation of the attendance money order. I do not expect that that is a power that the authority will feel it necessary to use with any frequency, but if, in the opinion of the authority,' there has been a concerted failure by all or any of the waterside workers resri ""tared nt a port to ""omply wifh t1>p provisions of the aet. order* of the nu^oritv or awards of the ""nmir sion. h» authority may su«nend the + operation of the attendance money order insofar as it relates to the waterside workers at the port. We go on to provide that the restoration of the attendance money order can be brought by the union applying to the commission-that is, the arbitral tribunal. We have provided that the commission may restore attendance money, if it thinks fit, back to the date of the application. in that context mean the statutory body? arbitral body. While I am on the subject of attendance money I should mention that the Tait committee observed that one ground of objection by the federation to the present radio pick-up system was its fear that the introduction of the system on a wider scale would result in the loss of attendance money. Some people may think it rather odd that a man should receive attendance money if, having been notified through the newspapers or by radio that he was not required for work, he could spend the day at home or otherwise, if he so desired. In the judgment of the Government, there are good and sufficient reasons why the payment of attendance money should continue, even under those circumstances. The waterside worker is required to hold himself available for work. Frequently it may be impracticable for him, if he is notified that he is not required on the waterfront, to arrange for other casual work or to organize his day in the way that would have been most convenient for him. For that reason and for other reasons, we believe that attendance money should be paid. The committee expressed the opinion that it should be made clear that the use of press and radio would not lead to the loss of attendance money, and the Government proposes to provide for this quite specifically in the legislation. Certain stevedoring work is to be excluded from the operation of the act. Although this work will not be on a considerable scale, I think the desirability and importance of the Government's decision in this Tegard will quickly 1 become evident to honourable memhers. At the present time, certain employers have exemption from provisions of the act. Some of these exemptions date back",51,Suspension Of Standing Orders

129,Mr Harold Holt,"It means themany years, and are provided for in awards of the Arbitration Court. The exemption granted to the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australia Limited, at Risdon, in Tasmania, is a case in point. The circumstances are, usually, that the employer unloads or loads cargoes directly from or into ships at wharfs associated with the employer's works. Tasmanian members will be aware of the problem* that have emerged in relation to the Bell Bay aluminium works. The performance of waterside workers there has been one series of acts which, put at their best, can that were made hy the old Stevedoring only be described as calculated to force up the price of Australian-produced aluminium. other side, too. be so, but I think that the honourable gentleman, who represents the constituency in which Bell Bay is situated, will find that most people, whatever their general views may be, would be strongly in favour of the proposals that I am outlining here. Other industrial developments are afoot in this country, not the least of which are the plans now being implemented to handle sugar through bulk loading equipment which is being installed at a number of Queensland ports. Specific provision is made in the bill which has the effect of excluding from its provisions persons employed in relation to the handling of loose bnlk cargo in certain circumstances. These are, in fact, where the work is not now heing handled by waterside workers. The bill also excludes persons employed in stevedoring operations where they are directly concerned with a particular industrial undertaking, as is at present the case at Risdon, as I have already mentioned. On the other hand, the work performed by waterside workers at, for example, wheat elevators will continue to be carried out by them. I believe that honorahle members will see the force of this provision. Peoule will not be induced to invest millions of pounds in equipment for bulk handling, as will be the case in our north Queensland sugar ports, if there is any real fear that a relative handful of operatives will be able to hold np the bulk loading operations, perhaps because of some dispute in which they have had no part, and in respect of which decisions have been taken hundreds of miles away. At least I believe that the good sense of this Parliament would dictate this course, and the matter is being presented to the Parliament for its determination. One of the matters commented on by the Tait eommittee was the difficulty of ascertaining what are in fact the terms and conditions applicable at any port. I have already explained that there are certain practices that have been built up over the years. There are orders Industry Commission, there are orders, made by the Arbitration Court, and in some instances there are the customs of a particular port. It is the Government's view that early action should be taken to codify for each port all awards and orders applicable to it, and it is intended, as soon as members of the new authority are appointed, to advise them that this is a task to which the authority should devote itself. As the Arbitration Court's awards are involved, the cooperation of the commission in this work will be sought. While the Tait committee saw no practicable plan in sight for permanent employment in the industry, the Government has not given up hope that some plan can be developed. The bill, therefore, provides that the statutory authority will, in exercising its functions, have in mind the desirability of encouraging schemes of permanent employment. I should, perhaps, have pointed out earlier that in order to give full effect to the scheme I have described, it will be necessary to make certain amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill uow before the House. Honourable members will realize that the constitution of the commission will also have a bearing on the arbitral functions in respect of this stevedoring industry, and so, if this bill is adopted, consequential amendments will be required in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The amendments will be by way of adding a new division. Division4 of Part IIA of the bill.

There is undoubtedly a more general realization by the xiustralian wage-earning unionist that what happens on the waterfront is not merely a sporadic, or frequent, brawl between the shipowner and the wharfie, but a steady erosion of the standard of living in the household of every trade unionist. Therefore, both die unionist and the general public look for an improvement. We believe that this legislation provides a framework in which that improvement can take place. Tliere is-and I do not think that I am mistaken in this viewa readier disposition on the part of employers to find amicable solutions of the problems of the industry. I say quite frankly that, in my own judgment, the employers made a great mistake in not negotiating an agreement during the last dispute, when the opportunity offered. There was then an opportunity for the negotiation of a satisfactory agreement which might have been the beginning of an improved relationship. I believe that some employers now realize that they missed an opportunity then, and are more ready to demonstrate goodwill. I trust that that, is not an over-optimistic expectation. If it is not, I believe that we are also entitled to look to the federation to play its part.

I do not think there is one of them that could be disputed by any patriotic Australian. Even the criticism that always comes when parliamentary allowances are increased has been a little wliile longer? This is not the time."" The report was received hy the -Government last September, and the 'Government then decided that that was not the time. That means that by the -time these increases are put into operation, they will have been delayed by that -decision for a period of eight or nine months. That in itself is an important -factor. As I said a moment ago, these increases w ill be the first in four and a half years. Taking comparable positions in the Public Service, in the educational institutions And in the State legislatures, there is hardly any group that has not had substantial increases during that period, while the salaries of honourable members -of this House and of the Senate have remained stationary. During that period, the cost of living and the burdens cast upon honourable members have greatly increased. The examination by this committee has brought all those facts to light. Honourable members have given the facts of their incomes and outgoings to the committes, and that is pointed out in the report. 1 -do not think that there has ever been an inquiry of so searching a character as that -conducted by this distinguished committee in the case of honourable members of this House and of the Senate. Though it is not exactly the same, it is like the decision «of a special tribunal acting in the nature -of arbitrators between the people on the <one hand and honourable members on the -other, which has given its decision or -award. That is the proper way to Approach this matter. As this National Parliament is situated so very far distant from certain parts of the continent, honourable members spend practically half of each year away irom home. An extra burden is cast upon them, not only financially, but by the strain that every person must undergo when separated from his loved ones for such long periods. Those are circumstances that we all know. No one ever calls attention to them but, while the position is one of great honour and responsibility, those factors make it also one that at, times can be very arduous indeed. I mention a few other facts, merely as incidental illustrations, and I take the position of the legislatures of the States simply to make the point that in three States the ordinary members of Parliament, covering both metropolitan and country electorates, receive salaries that are greater than those at present payable to members of the National Parliament. Action has been taken by the appropriate authority in those legislatures to increase salaries. Many other illustrations are available. In one federal electorate there ae no fewer than 21 State electorates and each one of those State members receives a salary that is greater than that received under the existing law by the average federal member. The members of those State electorates are very fortunate; each does not represent the large numbers of electors that are included in federal constituencies. The number of voters in some State electorates is in the neighbourhood of 1,500, 1,200, and 900. One must mention that matter, in fairness, if a proper judgment is to be made. Broadly speaking, for every federal electorate represented by an honourable member of this House, there are at least two State electorates and in some States, there are three or four or five. In the State of Tasmania, there are six. in Queensland. Prime Minister for reminding me that iu Queensland it is six. What has happened in this period? The salaries of executive ofBcers and judicial officers of the Commonwealth have been increased. We passed legislation to increase the salaries of judges to a very substantial figure; and the salaries of judges of the Arbitration Court are referred to in a bill that has been introduced. Such increases have been granted without any preliminary examination by a committee, because it is thought to be just. A committee did not examine the salaries of heads of Commonwealth departments to see what they should get, and for a long time some of them received salaries greater than those paid to the respective Ministers to whom they are responsible. wrong. It is wrong that the Minister should have the political responsibility",61,Second Eeading

145,Dr. Evatt,"If they all do, it isfor everything that is done in the department while the permanent head receives a higher salary. That is completely contrary to proper practice. The three committee men, the accountants and auditors, would know what salaries are paid in private industry. Details of those salaries are not published and are not available iii the ordinary sense, but there have been very substantial increases in the salaries <>f persons in industry who four and a half years ago received the same amount as members of this Parliament then received and still receive to-day. It is notorious that there have been very substantial salary increases, indeed, in all industries wrongs in another area. I submit that without exception, and it is thought proper that the cost of living should be taken into account. The great newspaper industry of this country is no exception to the rule. I indicated, in relation to another aspect, that the responsibilities of members of the Federal Parliament have increased enormously, even during the last ten or fifteen yea.rs. For instance, amendments ro the social services legislation have imposed obligations upon every member of the Parliament. He must be available and ready to assist members of the public who are interested in these matters. That legislation took from members of other legislatures an enormous portion of the burden imposed upon them under the previous practice. The situation is broader than that, and it affects the whole business of Parliament. Parliament is a hard-working institution. All that the public sees of it are the criticisms-prais e or blamewhich are all part of the democratic process, but members of the Parliament are hard-working. I believe that to-day they are harder-working than ever before in the history of the Commonwealth. In addition, they do not discharge their duties in the Parliament by mere attendance at debates. They work also in the committees of the Parliament. SoI cannot see any objection to the recommendation of the committee. The report is clear, it is concise, and it states the principles, and tbe committee has made a just decision. The decision is not altogether in every respect in favour of honourable members. Certain privileges have been, cut down, and that has to be considered, too, but as the Prime Mini*ter said, "" There is the report and it has to be accepted"". I want this to be clearly understood: when persons say that an increase in salary to any body of men cannot be justified because, in certain cases, there bave not been satisfactory increases to others in the communityI refer, amongst others, to great bodies of wage and salary earners-that is irrelevant and is no answer. Those matters must be dealt with in their proper sphere. A wrong, or partial wrong, in one area of the economy, cannot be righted by committing further that is unanswerable. This is a constructive, carefully prepared report. It should be accepted. As I said at the outset, I express these views on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition. I rise to speak on this matter witb some diffidence, because I hold, as it were, two separate views on this bill. First, I agree completely with the report and the way it expresses the need for parliamentary salaries of members to be increased. Secondly, for reasons which 1 shall endeavour to explain, I do not believe that it is appropriate that it should be implemented at the present time. I desire to direct my attention to that contention immediately. When I say, "" at the present time "", I do not mean, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has just said, that certain wages and salaries might be dealt with outside in another sphere. I mean that last year, at almost the same time, there was conveyed to the public knowledge of the fact that economic measures were to be introduced into this Parliament which meant a tightening of the belts of the people, plus a knowledge that this report was in the course of procreation, shall we say. At that time, in answer to questions from mernbers of my electorate committee and from people at public meetings in ray own electorate and at other places, T gave it as my considered view, then as a substantial word of mine, that it would not be proper for members of this Parliament to increase their salaries at a time when the Government;I am talking about the Government now-sai d that it",63,Second Eeading
146,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [9.44].,"proposed to-and did, as it eventuatedintroduce restrictive measures to apply to the people as a whole. The members of the Opposition may probably exonerate themselves from this; they would be entitled to do so. I want to make perfectly clear what I shall say in but a few minutes, that I am not endeavouring for one moment to score a point off any member of the Opposition, nor any member on my side. BecauseI gave my word to these people, and because,, as I see it, the situation has not changed-in fact, if anything, the economic measures have imposed greater hardship on the peoplethen I cannot in honesty retreat from the position which I took and in respect of which I gave my word to the members of my eleutorate. I have no tolerance whatever for those persons outside this Parliament who say that members of the Parliament are receiving too high a salary at the present time, they are overpaid, and who raise all those foolish arguments that one hears. I do not suggest for one moment, either that the implementations of the recommendations of the report would mean that we as members of the Parliament were overpaid. That is not what I am rising in my place to contest. As I say, the matter is in my view in two parts, but last year I gave my word that I would not support a similar proposal, and the position seems to me to he nn different now from what it was then. Having given my word, I will not retract it. Therefore, I will not support the bill. would not have spoken in this debate had the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) not spoken, because I have very definite ideas on the subject, f t is my opinion that it is well known hy honourable members that this bill will be carried and will become law. I do not want to go into details, but some honourable members know the action which I took when the Chifley Government, raised the salaries of members of Parliament from £1,000 to £1.500. On that occasion T spoke against the proposal and voted against it. takp the salary? thing that a sincere man would do: I did not take the salary. That course cost me over £1,300. I am supporting this bill. If I spoke against it and voted against it, I would not accept the increase. I have told constituents at Kerang, Nyah, Mildura and Swan Hill, and anywhere else I have met them, that I am supporting the bill. The recommendations were made by an independent tribunal. The bill which I did not support before was merely introduced by the Chifley Government on its own initiative. I say to the honorahle member for Franklin, that in his sincerity-if we can take it as such-h e knows that this bill will be carried, and I ask him to state in this House, even by way of interjection, whether he intends, if he votes against the measure, to take the increase. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [9.49] I propose to speak very briefly to this measure. I have always felt that when measures of this kind come before the Parliament we should assist if we spoke quite frankly to the public about the problems which arise, as we see them. After all, we have been selected by the public to come here and represent it. We were presumably the best choices offering in the electorates for the majority of voters at the particular time. We may not always take that view one of the other, according to where we sit in the House, but when the people elected us they felt that we, amongst those who were offering, were the persons who could most faithfully express that which the majority of the people desired to be expressed. In addition, the Constitution has thrown upon the members of this Parliament the responsibility of determining a fair rate of salary and allowances in respect of their parliamentary duties. Over the years, members of the Parliament have discharged that responsibility. The appointment, on. the last two occasions, of a committee, which we believed would be an objective body, to examine the problem and to make recommendations was not for the purpose of avoiding our responsibility but was part of the search that the Parliament had been making over the years for a method of dealing with this difficult problem that",64,Second Eeading

The public gives us, under the Constitution, the responsibility of deciding these things, and either we must decide them out of hand according to our best judgment or-and I believe this to be the preferable course-w e must seek advice from people who themselves will not be directly affected by their judgment about what is a fair thing in the circumstances. I should like to answer some of the criticisms that have been offered from time to time. First, there is the very regular criticism to which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has referred, namely, that the time is not ripe. I do not detract from my respect for the sincere approach of my colleague, the honorit ble member for Franklin( Mr otherwise of the provision that has been Falkinder), when I say that, in the judgment of the public, never in the history of the Parliament has the time heen ripe for an increase of parliamentary salaries. I am speaking now about the vocal elements of the public. I am quite' certain that there are many sensible persons who realize that a sensible, practical and realistic view of these things must be taken by members of the Parliament, but the vocal members of the public-and this goes for the press, too -hav e never, in my experience, found the time that was ripe for such an operation. Apparently their reasoning proceeds along this line: If prices are stable, why should members of the Parliament want to increase their salaries? If prices are falling, instead of increasing their salaries they should be reducing them. Indeed, it stands to the credit of members of the Parliament that, during the depression years, they voluntarily reduced their salaries, and it was many years before thpy were restored to their former level. Furthermore, according to the public, a period of rising prices is iust the time when the Parliament should be --etting nn example to evervbody else by uot granting an increase of the remuneration of its members. Such au argument won "" Vi all right if tbe circumstances 1 1 e in which the member of Parliament lived remsv^ed static, but his constituency experts certain standards aud certain act v''Meq of him. Tn a period when ; national prosperity in real terms, and not merely in money terms, has beat steadily rising, andwhen, as the committee has pointed out, since the finding of 1952 there has been an upward movement of average weekly earnings of the order of 33.5 per cent., is it reasonable and realistic to propose that the salaries of memhers of the Parliament,' who are themselves members of the community ia which these things are happening, should stand still? The fact of the matter ia that they have stood still throughout such a period and, as we know, many members have experienced great difficulty in maintaining the standards and carrying out the activities expected of them in their electorates. I shall not canvass the adequacy or made. It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, that some anomalies have crept into the system. Tn the early days of federation, the heads of departments received a salary that was equal to approximately one-half of the salary of their ministerial head, but to-day in many cases their remuneration ife greater than that of their ministerial head. That is one of the things that have developed, not because of the venality of the politician, hut because-and I say this conscientiously and advisedly-of his timidity in approaching the question of salaries and allowances. I emphasize the word "" t i m i d it y"" because the facts bear out my statement. If we trace the history of parliamentary allowances in Australia, we find that at the time of federation a sum of £400 was prescribed. That remained unaltered until 1907, when it was raised to £600. If my recollection is correct, the basic wage in 1907 was about £2 a week. In other words, the salary of a member of the Parliament was about six times as great as the then basic wage. From 1907 to 1920 there was no upward alteration, but in 1920 the allowance was fixed at £1,000 a year. From 1920 to 1947a period of 27 years-ther e was not even an increase of ls. in the salaries of members. Ts that evidence of venality on the part of hungry politicians itching to get at the public till? T suggest that iit is a remarkable tribute to the restraint that was exercised by parliamentarians for -a generation during which there had been considerable fluctuations. It was during that period, as I stated earlier, that voluntary reductions of salary were accepted by members of the Parliament. In 1947, the allowance was increased to £1,500. Later, in order to obtain a basis that members thought would provoke less criticism and create better understanding on the part of the public, the Nicholas committee was appointed. Then we come to the legislation of 1952 which flowed from the recommendations of the Nicholas committee. As the Leader of Hie Opposition has reminded us again to-night, approximately four and a half years will have elapsed from the date of the last increase to the implementation of the. present proposals. I have already referred to the movement of 33.5 per cent, in average weekly earnings. If we are to get a fair view of the situation, we must bear in mind that average weekly earnings have risen steadily. The wage or salary earner has not found himself suddenly placed in that position. His income has steadily kept pace with rising costs, whereas that of the parliamentarian has not. From time to time, we hear the stupid statement that there is never any shortage of people standing for election on polling day, and that therefore the salary paid to a member of the Parliament must be quite adequate. If persons who make that statement adopt the view that anybody will do to represent them and their interests in the Parliament, the argument has validity; but if such persons had the sense to reflect on the fact that the Parliament is charged with the responsibility, not only of the defence and -development of the nation, but also of approving a budget of the order of €1,000,000,000 a year, would they seriously propose that such matters be left to incompetents who came along and grabbed the salary currently paid to members of the Parliament? What we should be doing if, as a people, we want to have this job done effectively, is seeking to attract, whether by way of salary and allowances or a combination of other incentives, the ablest men and women that this country can produce into the service of the nation in the Parliament. I do not suppose that we will claim that we have reached that result in this Parliament at this point, but it is hardly our fault if that has not been the result. The critics in the public cannot have it both ways. Either the conditions are such as to attract the best political talent available in this country, or they are not such as to attract that talent. If they are such as to attract it, then we here represent the best that can be provided. If not, then, at least, we represent the best that is offering for the conditions which the public are prepared to endorse. I just want to add this in conclusionit is a considered judgment, made after many years of membership of this Parliament. I would say unhesitatingly thai most of the men and women with whom I have come in contact who have gained the suppjort of an electorate, have come here with a conscientious urge to serve their country and to serve the electorate. They have not come here to better their personal circumstances. They have certainly been prepared to accept a lot of deprivations-the loss of family life and the other things on which I do not need to elaborate because they are set out clearly enough in these two reports and they are known to every member of this chamber. I think that, when some of the most savage criticisms are being directed against us, it should be appreciated that there is an overwhelming majority of people in this place who have come here to do a job without being vitally concerned as to the remuneration for the job. But they want to carry on that job in accordance with the standards expected of them by their constituency, without having a haunting fear, all the time, that they will not be able to live up to what is required of them. I do not believe that the measure before us will do anything more than fulfil that condition. I would accept it as a criticism that the measure is -untimely if those who make that criticism go further and say that it is long overdue. I , for one. unhesitatingly am prepared to support what the committee has recommended. 1 vvould regret it myself if the Parliament missed the opportunity to have some quite useful discussion on this matter because it is only by our presenting our views frankly to the public that we can ever expect to hope that, in the fullness of time, there will be an informed and undernow, to present to the House in support standing public opinion on this very vexed question. personal explanation. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) has drawn my attention to the fact that a few words I have used may have been misconstrued. He states that I said, regarding the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder), that he was "" apparently sincere"". I watched the honourable member for Franklin before he rose. I knew that he was going to rise. I spoke to a friend of mine and said that the honourable member was going to rise. When he rose, it was apparent that he was sincere. obvious that he was sincere. If I used the words "" apparently sincere"", that does not mean that I was doubting his sincerity. I meant that it was apparent that he was sincere. Question resolved in the affirmative.

That being so, I not be said to contain essential provisions feel that something more than the Goand would not do justice to those who vernment now proposes requires to be wouid come within its scope. I hope, of my views a case that certainly cannot be controverted. In the present circumstances, unfortunately, the principles of arbitration seem to be one-sided. They operate with pains and penalties against those who have only their labour to sell. The court sits in judgment on their labour when it is assessing their rates of pay. Those who are on the other side, namely, the employing interests, are not required to submit to the court any evidence relating to their business such as the material that is used, the machinery that is required, and the efficiency or otherwise of the managerial conditions. We find that the wages of the workers are to be subject, not only to the consideration of industry's ability to pay them, but also to the consideration of their effect on the national economy, l n that respect the operation of the arbitration system is very one-sided. Although the basic wage was frozen from 1953until only last Friday, prices of commodities, and the profits made by industry in Australia, rose to such heights that they had a serious effect on the economy. Despite the fact that wages generally remained static during that period, living costs kept rising. So the court's freezing of the basic wage, unjust action as it was, has proved that the wages of the workers do not constitute the element in costs prices and inflation. There are many the freezing of wages and margins by claiming that high wages add to production costs and, therefore, to living clusively that the level of wages is not the vital element in thc inflation of costs and prices. It is not responsible, for instance, for the increased cost of erecting the houses that are so vital in this country to-day. Inordinately high profits and prices, which the Government has made absolutely no attempt to arrest, now",65,Second Eeading

155,Mr Maki N (Bonython [10.7],"Prio r stand clearly shown to be the elementsdone if there is to be equity in arbitration when the claims of the workers are being dealt with. Unlessi t can be shown that there is equity and justice in the judgments given by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and its agencies, the Government w ill not get the confidence of the overwhelming majority of the people. workers feel a sense of frustration because of prevailing conditions which deny to them their industrial rights. Employees of Adelaide's tramway system have been subjected to a state of affairs which proves how unscientific is the method of arbitration now employed, and how grossly unfair the system of determination of wage standards is. Those employees have been waiting for more than twelve months for a decision to be given on their wage claims. About 1,400 men are affected by this effort to secure improved wages. Legal and other costs of the case, which the trade union concerned has to meet, already total more than £6,000. justify a state of affairs which, in addition to denying to workers a proper wage standard, forces the trade union of which they are members to find such high legal costs. I consider, therefore, that there is every justification for the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the bill should be withdrawn and be re-drafted, so as to provide for a greater emphasis on the things that w ill enable conciliation to be the means of bringing parties to industrial disputes together and reach a basis of agreement which will give greater justice to the employees, and give the employees confidence that their claims will be dealt with in the quickest possible time. Today, the Government is imposing upon the section of the community least able to afford to bear them, burdens which are not justified, and which cause unwarranted distress and hardship. SoI say to the House that, if we are to have a system appropriate to the needs of these times, we must have arbitration whioh will do justice to both employer and employee and which will be the means of bringing a new spirit, not only into arbitration, but also into all the systems that are a part of our national life and which affect industry. If we achieve such a system we shall have done something that w ill lead to a tremendous advance in this country's economic position, and w ill provide a basis of protection against the present anomalous position of taking money from those who can least-afford its loss in order to give additional profits to already wealthy concerns and To-day, the individuals. There is a failure on the other .side of the House to appreciate the importance to the national economy of justice in relation to the claims of the community for a fair deal. I know, of course, that there are certain constitutional limitations that, may deny to this Parliament the f u l l power to deal with some aspects of the situation. But let us face up to thai position. If we are without the essential constitutional power to deal effectively with certain of those matters, then the quicker we bring this to the notice of the Australian nation and ask it to give us the added powers to enable us to deal f a i r l y and justly with all sections of the Nobody could possibly community, the better it w ill be for the nation. That being so, I suggest that furtlier consideration is required befoie the Government proceeds with this punitive measure. It is true that the provisions are hidden in quite an elaborate bill which w ill make many amendments to the principal act, but that does not justify the Government's seeking to alter the principle of our arbitration system by failin g to amend the provisions of the existing act that most urgently require amendment and by emphasizing the judicial aspects of arbitration and the heavy penalties that the court may inflict, particularly upon the workers and the trade unions, for breaches of certain provisions of this bill . I think it would be desirable to return to the principles enunciated in the 1947 amending measure in which the Chifley Labour Government placed a proper emphasis upon the principles of conciliation and kept the judicial aspects of the court properly in the background. Tn that respect, the Labour Government made a very valuable contribution to the conception of the supervision or determinations that should govern the industrial relationships of the community and the wage-earners. If we returned to those principles we could promote stability of the economy and we could have greater confidence and trust in the ability of the court to do justice to the claims of the workers more speedily and more effectively. If the Government's intention is to streamline the conciliation and arbitration law, let it do so by at least rectifying port the bill is its emphasis, first, upon the anomalies that I have brought to the notice of the House this evening, and by providing for the workers and the com-. munity generally a much better conception of what the principle of conciliation should mean to the people of Australia. Much could be done by means of satisfactory arbitration laws, to assure Australians of better conditions of life than I have seen in other parts of the world. I have always felt that, unless we aje willing to provide the machinery essential for equitable and fair dealing by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, we shall fail to win the confidence and the good will of those whose support we should have if the Parliament is to succeed as an instrument for the welfare of the community. House has discussed this bill for som« days now. As the present stage of the consideration of it is drawing to its close, I do not intend to traverse once more the various provisions of the measure, which have been discussed by honourable members from both sides of the HOUSK. Indeed, if I were to do so, I should mainly be repeating what has been already said. However, I do want to say something about the importance of the bill as a whole. First, I believe that one should remember, when listening to the speeches of Opposition members, that the Australian Labour party, which is one of the two main political parties in Australia, is the political wing of the trade union movement. Indeed, I think it would he right to say that a majority of Opposition members have graduated to this House through the positions that they held in that movement. Unlike the United States of America, for example, where the trade union movement has kept itself apart from the great political parties, we in Australia find that one of our main parties is closely allied to part of the trade union movement. In passing, it is interesting to note that the United States has a higher rate of productivity and greater co-operation between management and employees than we have. I think we should be wise to keep those facts in mind when we listen to the speeches of Opposition members. The second reason why I rise to supconciliation, and, secondly, upon arbitration. I think it is useless for Opposition members to condemn this measure out of hand and to propose an amendment containing a set of most extraordinary provisions, just because certain provisions of the bill do not agree with their own thinking, and because they consider that, in some respects, they do not go sufficiently far. It is unwise for them tocondemn the bill out of hand, and I think that, in their own minds, they will agreethat the provisions of this measure will be of great advantage and will prove another step forward in this essentially Australian process of conciliation and arbitration. We have great need for this progress, hecause Australia has now reached a stage in the development of its national economy at which all sections of the community depend upon one another.. No longer can some short-term advantagebe given to one section of the community. No longer can one section of the community take certain action which it thinks may be to its advantage in the shortterm without the result being felt by all sections of the community and in every home. When there is a hold-up of steel production in Newcastle or Port Kembla, the housewife in Sonth Australia soon feels the effect of it. So greater co-operation is necessary between those who work in and those who manage our primary and secondary industries and our commercial undertakings. Therefore, it is essential that we have an effective system? of conciliation and arbitration for the achievement of that co-operation. Honourable members opposite, instead of confining themselves to destructive criticism, should offer constructive suggestions in relation to a matter so important to the nation as this. I have always believed that the members of the Government parties and the members of the main Australian Labour party have together been supporters of the principle of conciliation and arbitration, but now, having listened to some of the speeches made by",68,Conciliatio N And Arbitration Bill 1956 Second Reading

In statements from this The coal-mining industry is an excellent grievances, promoted a series of unwarranted strikes.

This Government, in conjunction with the Joint Coal"" Board, is now exploring all avenues in its endeavours to win back some of our overseas markets for coal. We must have co-operation between the various interests in all industries. Further development of our conciliation and arbitration system is necessary, not only for the reasons that 1 have given already, but also because, unfortunately, Communists are returning to power in some trade unions. I believe that the members of the main Australian Labour party believe truly in the principle of conciliation and arbitration, but we know that Communists do not. SoI say to honourable gentlemen opposite, as well as to my colleagues on this side, that the bill must be supported because it will help to bring about greater co-operation between employers and employees in our industries.
