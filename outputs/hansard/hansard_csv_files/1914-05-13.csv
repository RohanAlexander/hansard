MrJ . H . CATTS The Minister knows very well that the Standing Orders would prevent my quoting from the Hansard of this session; but this is the note which I took of the words used at the time. . . . so far, evidence on Tariff matters had been taken only in Victoria, and, obviously, before a progress report could be made by the Inter-State Commission in respect to any industry, those affected in other parts of Australia should be given a chance to present evidence. Mr Tudor then askedDoes that answer mean that no Tariff matters will be dealt with until the Inter-State Commission has taken evidence in every State of the Commonwealth ? The Minister of Trade and Customs repliedCertainly not. ceedings is entirely in the hands of the Commissioner. I do not see what other meaning can be attached to the Minister's words than that evidence is to be taken in each of the States, unless it so happens although it is almost an impossibilitythat there is an industry confined to one State, and not affecting any other. When the Minister of Trade and Customs told us that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Inter-State Commission, the Prime Minister added, "" It is not going to be taken out of the hands of the Commissioners."" The honourable member for Maribyrnong asked that the evidence taken before the Commission should be placed before honourable members; but it has been in t i mated that this is not to be done. I , for one, absolutely refuse to be bound by the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. The Commissioners have no responsibility to my electors, and, so far as I am concerned, they are not going to perform duties that are my right in this House. We have been told that the Commissioners will give us a summary of the evidence on which they have arrived at certain conclusions; but I desire to have the whole of the evidence. If the honourable The Chairman of the Inter-State Commission is a confirmed Free Trader, and was for years one of the strongest advocates of the Free Trade policy in the New He did not South Wales Parliament; and evidence which might be satisfactory to hi m in regard to industries in my own and other electorates might not be satisfactory to me. As a matter of fact, while I sliould be glad to have a copy of the evidence, I cannot commit myself to any of the conclusions which may be arrived at by the Inter-State Commission. I submit that the Government, in referring the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission, a n d ' giving them no instructions as to whether a report was to be quickly presented, handed over a matter that very properly belongs to this Parliament. When the Tariff was referred to the Commission, the Government might have told the Commissioners that it was a matter of urgency, and that there should be a report at the earliest possible moment. Asi t is, the Commission has been sitting for nearly twelve months, and has dealt with only one State, with some 300 applications yet to be conThe conduct of the prosidered; and it becomes evident that during the life of this Parliament there can not even be a rectification of Tariff anomalies. This is a negation of the policy on which the present Government were returned. I have with me the report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th A p r i l , 1913, of the policy speech delivered ait Parramatta by the Prime Minister, at that time leader of the Opposition. as a Protectionist after that speech. MrJ . H .

CATTS -The Labour Government dealt with a large number of items under the Tariff, but the present Minister of Trade and Customs, speaking at Toowoomba on the 8th April of last year, said that this was altogether insufhas come here for the purpose of preventficient. The honourable member's speech covered five or six columns, and was headed with the word ""Advertisement,"" showing that it was paid for, and that it was to go forth to the people of Australia as his fully considered utterance. The honourable member complained about the small work done in regard to the rectification of Tariff anomalies by the Pisher Government, and he repeated the statement of the present Prime Minister .tliat there was to be a "" prompt rectififess this cation of anomalies."" After the first rectification of Tariff anomalies by the Fisher Government, the previous Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, in order to obtain evidence in connection with further anomalies, issued question sheets to manufacturers, and this investigation was proceeding when the Minister went out of oflice, but the need for the rectification of anomalies was so urgent, as shown by the investigations being made, that the then Prime Minister told the country that even if the electors did not amend the Constitution to enable the new Protection idea to be carried out, the Labour Governlast year, to have saidmenb would still go on with the question of the Tariff. The result of the investigations instituted by the previous Minister of Trade and Customs were in the possession of the present Government immediately they came into office, and have been in their possession for twelve months. Will the present Minister say that the information derived does not reto stand ""as it is.""; to make no material veal the fact that there are anomalies in regard to the Tariff? He knows perfectly well that it does. At any rate, if convictions fearlessly, and it is quite evithere were no anomalies to be rectified immediately, why did the present Prime Minister and the present Minister of Trade and Customs both refer to the need for the immediate rectification of anomato the policy speech made by the ex-Prime lies even without waiting for the report of the Inter-State Commission? with them in the previous three years? Mr J. H . CATTS -The Labour Government dealt with a considerable number of anomalies, but as the honourable reasonably protective, and to express the fiscal member was out in the wilds of Australia, where there were no newspapers to read, apparently he does not know this, or know that the Tariff had been even mentioned in the House. But the honourable member ing the Tariff being dealt with. He won his seat on the statement that he would prevent any further protection being given to Australian industries. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member admits that he was returned to Parliament for this express purpose. Mr J. H . CATTS -If a few more honourable members opposite would conMr J. H . CATTS -Yes, one is enough, but we know there are other members on the Government side who are in the same position. What was, during the last campaign, the attitude in New South Wales of those supporting the present Government? Sir Joseph Carruthers, who stumped the country in their favour, is reported in the Daily Telegraph of the 6th May last year, to have saidI have always held, and still hold, that, there is nothing which so rapidly makes for' extreme wealth on the one hand, and extreme poverty on the other, than high tariffs. Mr Wade is reported, on the 10th of May My remedy for trusts is to take away the Tariff duties on articles affected by trusts. The honourable member for Parkes in a signed letter appearing in the Daily Telegraph on 23rd April, 1913, saidBoth the Free Traders and Protectionists have, whilst preserving their respective convictions, mutually agreed to allow the Tariff alteration either in the direction of increasing or decreasing its incidence. The honourable member always speaks his dent that the arrangement honourable members opposite have come to was correctly stated by him. The Daily Telegraph on the 8th April, 1913, in referring Minister, saidAnd what he says now is that the Tariff Labour will propose, if returned to power, is one that will cover the difference between wages paid in Australia and elsewhere.

That being so, no necessity suggests itself to the Liberal Party for meddling with it one way or the other, except to remedy proved anomalies. The present Government, in submitting their programme to Parliament last year, made the following statement in regard to the T a r if f : The Inter-State Commission has already been appointed, and, in addition to fulfilling its constitutional duties, it will supervise and report to Parliament with respect to industrial production and commercial exchange. It will also inquire into the working of the Tariff and its operation and effect upon the investment of capital, and the employment of labour in Australian industries. It will make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff, due regard being had to the interests of all sections of tbe community. In the meantime any anomalies discovered in the existing Tariff will be dealt with. "" In the meantime."" actions of the Government, the phrase "" in the meantime"" does not mean "" inside twelve months."" MT . McGBATH our time."" MrJ . H . CATTS not, and now the Government come down w i th two paltry Billsi n order to seek some party advantage by striving to get a double dissolution before the Tariff is dealt with. have no intention of dealing with -the Tariff during this Parliament. The words in the policy statement the Inter-State Commission "" w ill make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff, due regard being had to the interests of all sections of the community ""-ar e an evasion. Isi t the business of the Inter-State Commission to have regard to all sections of the community ? It all depends upon which way we look at the question. Mr Piddington, the Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, may look at it from what he calls the stand-point of the rural consumers, and come to the conclusion, as he has done previously, that the interests of such consumers are best conserved by a policy of Free Trade. no recommendation from him in the direction of giving further assistance toAustralian industries. ter that ought to be lef t to the Government, and to this House. bers of this House represent various sections of the community, and it is their duty to protect those sections. In my opinion the Tariff issue is not the true business of the Inter-State Commission. It was stated in the House the other day that everybody was satisfied with what the Government are doing. I have here a report of the annual meeting of the Western Australian Chamber of Manufactures, held in Perthi n August last, and reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 30th August, 1913At the Chamber of Manufactures annual meeting the presidential report stated that the attention of the Minister for Customs had been called to a Fremantle firm importing a quantity of furniture, comprising several thousand pieces, from China. The Minister had promised the matter would be considered in the Federal Parliament. It has never been considered by the Federal Parliament. This was a matter According to the of urgency brought under the Minister's notice by the manufacturers of Western Australia through their organization, and a complaint was made that f u r n it u r e It does not mean "" in was being imported from China, to the detriment of local citizens interested in It certainly does tlie industry. Yet, in spite of the M in ister's promise, the matter has never been brought before Parliament. The report continuesMr Keyser, a member of the Sydney Chamber, exhorted West Australian manuThus they show that they facturers to hold fast to the prospective plank, and expressed the opinion that in the InterState Commission the dominating note of personnel was Free Trade, though Mr Lockyer was certainly a Protectionist. It is evident', therefore, that the manufacturers of Western Australia were dissatisfied some seven or eight months ago with the attitude of the Government on the Tariff question. So far as I am concerned, there are two directions in which the Tariff requires to be amended. Firstly, to deal with anomalies, and to more substantially protect Australian industries; and, secondly, to repeal those duties which are purely revenue-producing. By the first reform we would encourage Australian manufactures, and provide more work for our people; and, by the second, we should remove the load If so, we shall have which the majority of the people are now bearing, because of the taxes being raised upon necessaries of life which are not I say this is a matproduced in Australia.

45,Mr Higgs,"Which are not being proMrJ . H . CATTS -Yes. I emphasize that point, "" Which are not being produced in Australia."" Minister, in the speech to which I referred, said, under the heading of "" Cost of Living"" I should add, further, that since becoming the responsible leader of the party I have been inundated with appeals from all sorts of people as to what I propose to do to bring down the cost of living, and, at the same time, intimating that, in their opinion, the present high cost of living is the direct and sole result of the present Tariff. I do not hesitate to say, without discussing the subject fully, that I am hopeful an expert investigation of the Tariff may lead to a substantial reduction in the purely revenue duties of the present Tariff schedule. Surely, without any investigation by the Inter-State Commission, or any one else, every honourable member knows perfectly well thab there are a number of duties which are revenue-producing only, and, as I pointed oub in a speech delivered' by me in this House last year, the Government could bring down a B ill any day in the week to wipe out those purely revenue-producing duties, and help to reduce the cost of living, without requiring any investigation by any outside body at all, tlie particular items being perfectly well known to both Ministers and private members. raised by the present Government to carry out that promise to the people. As a matter of fact, that was one of the important statements made by Ministers of the present Government throughout New South Wales when they were appealing to the electors. au official pamphlet issued by the Liberal party in New South Wales, and printed w i th the authority of Archdale Parkhill, General Secretary of the Liberal organization in that State, asking the people to vote for the Liberal Senate candidates-Si r A .

Oakes"" to bring about low rents and cheaper l i v in g ; "" and, honourable member for Werriwa, knows in the electorate which the honourable member for Lang represents, there were placards all over his electorate, "" Votef o r W. E . Johnson, and reduce the cost of living."" That followed upon the statement of the Prime Minister that the revenue producing duties should be wiped out, and a burden taken off the backs of the people, so f a r as concerns revenue raised from the necessaries of lif e not produced in Australia. Yet nothing has .been done, and I venture to say that the Government have no intention of doing anything. The Prime Instead of grappling with the Tariff issue the Government declared their intention to t r y to get a double dissolution by introducing two Bills that do not deal w i th the business of the country in any way, but are intended simply to bring about a deadlock in the legislative halls of the Commonwealth. I am reminded by the honourable member for Kennedy that the Treasurer, hinted, if he did not actually say, that it was the intention of the Government to bring before the House a proposal for additional revenue duties; indeed, that is the only deduction to be drawn from the business paper. What is meant by the proposal that the House shall to-day go into Committee of Ways and Means, and Committee of Supply to find means of raising revenue? We know perfectly well' that the Government obtained supply which was to last them from June last u n t i l next June, if not into the middle of July, and yet now, at the beginning of May, we have a proposal that the House shall go into Committee of Supply, and the probabilities are that those additional revenue duties, which But not a finger has been were more than hinted at by the Treasurer the other day, will be brought forward. amendments should go ""to private people first?

49,Mr Pigott,"That shows that we arewe find the latter going back on the pledges which Ministers gave the people at the last Federal election. It is because the supporters of the present Government are a party of shreds and patches-becaus e they have no common binding policy save their hatred of, and opposition to, the Labour movement-that they cannot come together on this or any obher great question of public importance. That is why the Government have shelved the question. They do not propose to deal with it during the life of the present Parliament, since they have said that they intend to send both Houses of Parliament to the country as soon as possible. In conclusion, I venture to say that a majority of the honourable members of this House, regardless of party, desire that the Tariff shall be dealt with . I should like to, inasmuch as under the Standing OrdersI am not permitted to speak for more than half-an-hour, and I shall be compelled, probably, to take another opportunity to refer to it . a sheaf of correspondence fro m manufacturers in my own electorate relative to the Tariff, but I have not time to quote them to-day. this correspondence were represented to me as being very urgent immediately upon the assembling of this Parliament nearly twelve months ago, but for the reason I have just mentioned I cannot go into details affecting my own electorate in particular and Australia generally. I take this opportunity, however, to let my constituents know that I am no party to the stand taken up by the Government on this question, and that I . have availed myself of every means within my power to induce the Government to carry out the pledges which they made to the people in this regard. calmly tell the House that the whole matter has been handed over to the InterState Commission. That body, according to them, is to be the guardian of all the interests of the community in respect of the Tariff, and we are to act upon its report without .having more than a summary of the evidence upon which its conclusions are founded. There is no indication as to when the Tariff will be dealt with , and the Inter-State Commission has not been asked to report within any specified time. in pushing on with certain other business shows that they have no intention of dealing with the Tariff during the life of this Parliament, and, in these circumstances, the words of the motion which I have submitted literally express the proposition that the Government . have placed the Housei n an intolerable position in regard to the Tariff question. I am surprised that the Minister of Trade and Customs has not seen fit to rise at once and give the House some definite in dication of what the Ministry intend to do w it h regard to the great question of the Tariff. The replies which Ministers have given to questions on this subject are somewhat equivocal. We do not know exactly where they stand, but some of us have arrived at what we believe to be a reasonable conclusion as to their attitude. I cannot debate this matter as The interjections made a few moments ago by the honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Werriwa clearly show the influences to which the Government are subjected when they and I have their supporters meet in caucus. The honourable member for Calare was returned to this House for the express purpose of opposing any revision of the Tariffi n the Some of the matters covered by direction of granting further protection to the industries of Australia. A large proportion of the supporters ""of the Government belong to the old Free Trade party which we had thought to be absolutely dead. member increase the duties ? considerably increase them. I am anxious that we should have a scientific revision of the Tariff. I would point out to the Free Traders on the Government side of the House-and they seem to preponderate Ministers -that prior to Federation New South Wales was regarded as a Free Trade State, and that any income which it obtained through the Customs Department came principally from revenue duties. I can see the old New South Wales influence operating in this House to-day. Mr. FENTON I am not referring to the honourable member, for I regard h i m as a brilliant exponent of the Protectionist The action of the Ministry policy.

53,Mr West,"Pardon me.and he is also one of the most loyal members of the Labour party. Prior to Federation, as I was pointing out when interrupted, New South Wales was regarded as a Free Trade State, and many of her industries were in a very backward condition. But what has happened since the passing of the Federal Tariff? From 1891 until the inauguration of Federation the progress made by the manufactories of New South Wales was very small, but since the passing of the Commonwealth Tariff, which gave a certain measure of protection, the industries of New South' Wales have advanced by leaps and bounds. In 1891 the value of manufac-turing plant in New South Wales was £4,000,000; in 1912 it was £14,000,000. The factories of that State, in 1891, numevery climate, and can produce almost bered 3,056, with 43,000 employees, as against 5,162 factories and 90,000 employees in 1912. Then, again, the wages increased there from £4,272,000 in 1891 to £11,600,000 in 1912. The output of New South Wales factories was valued at £16,500,000 in 1891, whereas iu 1912 it was-valued at £61,163,000. The added value in the course of manufacture in 1891 was £8,000,000, whereas in 1912 it had increased to £22,000,000. In one year alone there was an increase of £7,000,000 in the value of the output of her manufactories. I quote these figures to show that even with a mongrel Tariff great advances have been made. With a scientific Tariff the advance would have been far more pronounced, and if we had a scientific Tariff now New South Wales, in common with all the other States, would benefit very considerably. gone up 35 per cent. ber would delight to obtain from China and Japan everything that he wears and uses in his household. Does the honourable member consider that we should patronize manufacturers who pay their workmen only 9d. a day? The logical effect of his argument would be that we should buy our goods where they can be obtained most cheaply. That would mean putting the Australian workman into competition with Chinese workmen receiving only 6d., 8d., and 9d. a day. MT. HIGGS -His god is cheapness. get his goods from the low-grade nations, whose workmen receive such awful wages. vent competition; it merely transfers it from one man's shoulders to another's. been disproved long ago. If the honourable member could guarantee to me the same social, economic, and industrial conditions throughout the world, I would vote for Free Trade. But, knowing the degraded state of the labour of many of the countries with which the artisans employed in Australian industries have to compete, I cannot understand a true Australian agitating for Free Trade. I believe in Australian goods for Australian people. If ever there was a country which should be self-contained, that country is Australia. We have practically everything. Why, then, should we not impose sufficient protection to encourage the development of all the resources of thiswonderful country? The honourable membet for Cook spoke of a pledge made by the Labour party at the last election. That pledge was discounted by our opponents, and particularly by the press, though one of the chief newspapers in the Commonwealth, in a leading article published on the 1st April, 1913a very significant date-said , "" Whatever happens,, the Labour party now stands irretrievably pledged to serve the cause of effective protection."" That was the comment on"" the policy speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, delivered at the end of March. Unfortunately this journal did not support protectionists during the electoral campaign; it criticised severely many of us who claimed to be staunch protectionists then, and who had been so before that time.

By so much as the Tariff may be necessary to encourage the production of particular articles, and by so much as the article produced fails to be of the value it would be in other countries, are we lessening the value of our natural production, and diminishing wages that can be paid to the workers.

It is fortunate, indeed, that there has been such an increase in the value of our great natural productions, because otherwise the burden of taxation would have become most severe. It is said that this Parliament has done nothing; but, at any rate, the Government have prevented the increase of burdens, and this is the first Parliament for many years that has sat without doing a considerable amount' of harm. The Government and their supporters have not been numerous enough to effect good sound legislation, but we have put some check on the foolish, insensate, nonsensical legislation which is said to be against the interests of wealth, honored if the Labour Government had but which increases the earnings of the wealthy by one and a half fold. going to take any notice of the report of the Inter-State Commission ? read tlie report of the Inter-State Commission, but whether I shall find myself bound by it is another matter. It is the evidence that I have to consider, and which will guide me in coming to a decision.

Protection of which the honourable member is said to be in favour? tific Tariff seem to have the result which followed the appointment of the Tariff Commission in the United States of America in 1881. Every member of that Commission was a Protectionist; but, after the evidence had been given, all had become Free Traders except one, and he was admittedly the stupid man of the jiarty. endorse the action of the honourable member for Cook in bringing the Tariff question before the House. The sincerity of the honourable member has been questioned by honourable members opposite, who point out that the Labour party, during their three years in power, could -have altered the Tariff in any direction they chose. A t Gympie, in 1910, the Leader of the Opposition stated that it was. the intention of the Labour. Government to submit certain questions by referendum, and that, if tliese questions were answered in the aflirmative, immediate action would be taken to bring into operation the New Protection policy. Unfortunately for the manufacturing, labouring, and other interests of Australia, the referenda proposals were defeated. A t the last general election, in 1913, the Leader of the Opposition, at Maryborough, distinctly stated that if his party were again returned, and even if the referenda proposals were defeated once more, the first business of the National Parliament would be the revision of the Tariff. That was the pledge made, and I am positive that it would have been been returned to power. Whether rural representatives opposite approve of the Prime Minister's promises or not, the fact remains that that gentleman, as Leader of the Opposition, when placing the policy of his party before the country, pledged himself to Protection as definitely as did the Leader of the Opposition. Now, however, while the whole of the members on bhe Opposition side are prepared to support a revision of the Tariff, a majority of the Government supporters repudiate the promise made by their leader during the last campaign. What an inconsistent position is that of honourable members opposite 1 On the platform they tell the electors that they favour industrial legislation, that they are whole-hearted supporters of the Wages Board system, and that they are prepared to continue the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The object of all. this legislation is to compel manufacturers and employers to comply with certain conditions; and the policy of Australia to-day is to regulate the hours, wages, and so forth, of every man and woman employed in our industries. Some honourable members opposite go further, and claim that to the Liberal party belongs the credit for the initiation of this class of legislation. However that may be, we are gradually creating here a standard of living which is superior to that in the older countries; and, in bhe majority of cases, the conditions are such as manufacturers elsewhere are not called upon to comply with.

I regret to say that there are some who are not enjoying the benefit of the form of legislation to which I have referred, but the majority of our people in Australia are enjoying industrial conditions that are superior to those operating in other parts of the world. Yet we find individuals who claim to be in favour of industrial legislation, and yet absolutely refuse to raise their voices or record their votes to give protection to the people engaged in our industries, and whose living depends on the prosperity or non-prosperity of those industries. the money from other members of the community to make up the difference? member, who is a Free Trader, point to a single Free Trade country where the workers generally have a standard of living equal to that which exists in Australia to-day, and which has been brought about by Protection-suc h as it is-and the various forms of industrial legislation in operation?

Yet that is the attitude of the honourable member for Werriwa and others who hold the same views. There is a growing feeling in parts of some r u r a l districts in favour of a system of Free Trade. This is due to the fact that a number of people like the honourable member for Werriwa are going through the country preaching a false gospel, false so far as the interests of Australia are concerned. In years gone by, when the prosperity of their industry depended on home markets, the farmers were not in favour of Free Frade, but now that the people of Australia generally have been taxed to give them improved facilities in order to get their produce to the markets of the older countries of the world, they favour it . paid for those facilities? community was taxed for the purpose of assisting ihe farmer to get his produce to the markets of the older countries. This false doctrine of Free Trade is being preached throughout the rural districts by a coterie of L it t l e Australians. The Labour party recognise how important the prosperity of the rural industry is to the community, but those who take a broad view must recognise that in regard to the general prosperity of the community, the manufacturing industry is just as important as the rural industry, and that each is dependent on the other. farmers are capable of taking a broad national view in respect to a policy of Protection. cognise that those engaged in the manuC a n the honourable facturing industry need protection against the cheap competition of the outside world; and though there are many men sitting behind the Government who preach Free Trade, there are others who go before the electors and proclaim themselves Protectionists, but yet, when the opportunity comes for carrying out their pledges, are found wanting, and are prepared to shelve the question of Protection altogether. ters? business of legislation, administration must go on. that they cannot get on with the business of the country as parties are at present situated.

But what do the Ministry care about Protection ? The honourable member for Cook has shown us what certain members of the Liberal party think of the question. I . wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs what he has to say in reply to our challenge that his view regarding the Tariff question is wrong, when he says that it would not be right to interfere with the Inter-State Commission? The honourable member for Cook has pointed out that last year the Ministry promised to rectify anomalies when they were discovered, and that they intimated there were certain anomalies which might be dealt with. Why are they not dealing with them ? forcing through the House certain legislation which, in regard to its incidence, has nothing to do with the welfare of the people of Australia ? What is the reply the Ministry make to the very strong in dictment of the honourable member for Cook? They put up the honourable member for Werriwa.

The honourable member for Yarra asked me on Friday, ""Does that answer mean that no Tariff matter will be dealt with u n t i l the Inter-State Commission has taken evidence in every State of the Commonwealth?"" and my reply was, ""Certainly not."" Mr J. IL CATTS -But what d i d you say just before that? reported in Hansard, and no misrepresentation is going to alter the fact. intend to make an announcement of my intentions. Of course, if tbe honourable member misunderstood me Government twist. the honourable member is an expert in that.

The Government have announced their intention of taking action in regard to the T a r if f as soon as the Inter-State Commission's reports are presented, and we are in a position to take such action. The statement which has been made by honourable members opposite is entirely without foundation, as is usual. It orable members . opposite are all running away from the Inter-State Commission at the present moment. What are they afraid of ? They passed the Act which enabled the Inter-State Commission to be appointed, and, now that we have appointed the Commission, they are afrai d of it . the appointment of the Commission. ber is honest in that statement; but the Labour Government introduced the B ill which provided for the appointment of the Inter-State Commission, and now that we have appointed it-no w that the members of the Commission are making a judicial inquiry so that Parliament may be able to act with knowledge-w e find tlie members of that party running away from it , and trying to raise political clap-trap cries. gress reports? ports from the Commission as they are ready. It was invited by this Government to deal at first with urgent way the matters with all industries needing urgent attention; but, as a matter of fact, not one industry has applied to the Commission to deal with a Tariff question on the grounds of urgency. While the Commission is judicially investigating these Tariff questions, and doing its duty in that way, we shall not call your interfere with it in the exercise of its duty. What would be said if , before it had completed its inquiry on some Tariff question, we took the whole matter out My attention havof its hands, and proceeded to deal with it? If the Commission had taken evidence only in Queensland with regard to some great industry common to Australia, what an outcry there would be in Victoria if we proceeded at that stage to deal with the question. Would not manufacturers in this State say, "" Why, you have not even allowed us to give evidence before the Commission?"" It is our duty to hold the balance evenly between all the StatesI f any one in any part of Australia desires to give evidence with respect to an industry, surely the right to give that evidence is not to be denied. Honourable members opposite appear to think that it should be, and there are people in this State who seem to imagine that the fact that evidence has been given is a peculiar thing that honhere with regard to a Tariff question should be suflicient to conclude the whole matter. The attitude of the Government is that the Inter-State Commission shall proceed to deal with the matters placed before it in the exercise of its own discretion, and that its reports, when presented, will be acted upon. In conclusion, I desire to refer to a statement that I always objected to has been made with regard to the supply of a full-report of the evidence taken before the Commission.

211,,"T h a t is a reflection on Mr Webster -Having allowed theof order. I was about to quote to the House the standing order to which the honourable member desires to draw attention. It saysAn urgent Motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of other Motions, as well as of Orders of the Day. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that this afternoon another motion was declared to be one of urgency, and was debated u n t i l half-past 4. The honourable member for Gwydir did not rise when that motion was called on, to move the motion which he now claims to be one of urgency, but which is not immediately connected with the business of the House. Standing order 284 declares thatAll Questions of Order and matters of Privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every otber Question. Those' are the Standing Orders that apply in this case. As to the urgency of the question which the honourable member for Gwydir wishes to discuss on a motion of privilege, I point out that nothing to which the matter relates has suddenly arisen. The honourable member himself allowed another motion to intervene which prevented a discussion of the matter to which he wishes to draw attention, although he was in the chamber before that motion was moved, and could have risen at any time in the interim since the House met, and I regard his action in doing so as practically an admission that the matter which he wishes to discuss is not one of urgency. to-morrow. what constitutes privilege, May says that breaches of privilege may be divided into these classes1. Disobedience to general orders or rules of eitlier House. The subject-matter of the honourable member's motion does not come under that heading, nor does it come under2. Disobedience to particular orders. The third class of breaches of privilege is spoken of as3. Indignities offered to the character or proceedings of Parliament. The fourth class comprises4. Assaults or insults upon members, or reflections upon their character and conduct in T h a t is not a point Parliament; or interference with officers of the House in discharge of their duty. The honourable member's motion does not cover breaches of privilege coming uuder any of these heads. dignity ? dignity in connection w it h some proceedings in the House. What the honourable member wishes to refer to took place in a railway train, beyond the precincts of the House, and cannot be said to be a matter of urgency which has suddenly arisen. The matter can be dealt w i th on notice. Mr J. H . CATTS -I s not interference w i th a member who is travelling to perf o r m his parliamentary duties a matter of privilege ? privilege of an urgent character coming within the category that I have read. It would be for the House to determine whether it was an interference involving a breach of privilege. that if a member is interfered with in his progress to this House, and prevented from reaching here in a fib state to carry on his duties, that is not an infringement of our privileges? if an honourable member were forcibly prevented from coming here to attend to his duties, it would be a matter of privilege, to be dealt with by an ordinary motion. Seeing that in the present case other business has been allowed to intervene, and that what has occurred did not happen immediately before the meeting of the W it h regard to House, it can scarcely be said to be subject-matter for a motion of privilege, to be dealt with as one of urgency.

TheB ill under consideration opens up one of the biggest questions with which the House has to deal. It is idle for our opponents to come, along with the stupid idea in the minds of some that they can stop the progress of industrial organization. No men have been subjected to such enormous difficulties as those gone through by men who have brought these organizations to their present stage. Many have lost their lives in the struggle for the combination and organization of workers, and in the effort to gain better conditions than those prevailing in days gone by-condition s which I hope we shall never see again. Before factory laws or laws regulating the operations of mining were introduced, the workers were compelled to toil under almost inhuman conThe Government ditions. Reports of Commissions presented to the House of Commons, and to Legislatures in the United States of America and elsewhere, have disclosed that in many factories children, six, seven, and eight years of age, took the places, not merely of the mothers, who took the places of the fathers, but of the men also, and worked twelve-hour shifts with overseers standing over them with straps to , keep them awake. It was the revolt against such a condition of affairs that I suppose that brought about the trade union movement, but the formation of Labour organizations The honourable member for had to be done in secret, and the books and minutes of the unions had to be concealed from the authorities.

MrM c DONALD We know now why the B ill was withdrawn. It is quite evident that honourable members on the Government side were not unanimous. A large number of unions can enforce preference to unionists. If preferenceto unionists is a good thing for those organizations that can enforce it , why is it not good for some of the weaker organizations ? As a matter of fact, our opponents take every step they possibly can to t r y to prevent the growth of labour organizations, but they might just as well attempt to stop the tide w i th a pitch-fork. There was a time when it might have been done, but it is not possible to-day. Our opponents know that any legitimate attempt to stop the growth of industrial organizations would probably lead to a revoluN o w we have it . tion. The present position of trade organizations has, in many cases, been brought about by bloodshed and by dragging from the powers that be the p r i v i leges the workers enjoy to-day.

277,Mr Orchard,"I said that there werewill do so whether our opponents lite it Or not, hut the hope is that our opponents may prevent political action being taken by the weaker organizations, who seek, by that action, to better their conditions. Have not employers derived all the benefits and privileges they enjoy to-day by political action ? Every action of aggression towards the workers has been taken by political action. The early organization of trade unions was prevented by political action. In the early stages of their existence these organizations were retarded by political action. through political action that Governments sent troops to shoot down trade unionists who sought better conditions And now to-day, because those organizations, which our opponents, by political action, tried to prevent coming into existence,' and whose progress they retarded, are now taking political action, honourable members opposite squeal, and say, "" It was good enough for us to use agaiust you when you were trying to form your organizations, but it is not good enough for you to use in order to better your conditions."" Trade organizations will use political action to better their conditions. It is absolutely idle for our opponents to say they should not do so. The trade unionist of to-day is not what the trade unionist was fifty years ago. Have we not given him the right to join a union, and the right to record a vote? Have we not also given him the right to be educated? Do we not go so far as to tell him that we shall prosecute him if he does not send his children to get the necessary education that the State provides, so that they may grow up to be better citizens at a later period ? Can we expect the organizations, composed of educated people, and with the franchise extended to them, and with the opportunity of realizing the power they wield-ca n we expect them to remain as their predecessors were thirty years ago ? It is not reasonable to expect member, being one of the most intelligent it. As a matter of fact, these combinations will become stronger, and bigger, and will wield the power they possess to get a fair share of the wealth they produce, as well as better conditions. The Attorney-General tells us frankly that he would not give any preference of any kind, but the most remarkable thing is that we find the Government introducing 'a system of preference at the first opporpreference to unionists on the transcon[35]-2 tunity they get. Even though they deny preference to the trade unionists of this country, and deny them the right to say whether they will work with non-unionists or not, we find the Govermnent are the first to initiate preference, under the law which enables them to sit on the Treasury bench. The Government have given to certain contractors preference without calling for tenders, and that involves the using of Government funds to the extent of £40,000 or £50,000, and yet they turn round and say that preference to unionists It was should not be given amongst' the employees casually engaged under the Government, because it means the expenditure of Government funds upon those particular individuals. ""What is happening on the transcontinental railway today? The Government cannot obtain men who are outside the organization, and they are obliged to give preference to unionists, whether they like it or not. Yet it is Government money which is being expended. The honourable member for Nepean tells us that the Government do not believe in preference to unionists in relation to men employed on the Government works. But that is only so much sham and hypocrisy for, as I have pointed out, the Government are giving preference to unionists to-day on the transcontinental railway. That will continue to be done on all big works where there exist vast organizations of workers who can enforce the principle of preference to unionists. It is a remarkable thing that where preference to unionists can be enforced by the organizations, industrial trouble very rarely takes place. dustrial trouble on the transcontinental railway. that the Government will not pay the wages that are asked. The honourable members of the party, will understand the point that I am trying to make. The whole argument of the Attorney-General is that we should not give preference to unionists where the expenditure of Government money is involved. That is the whole bone of contention, so far as the proposed Bill is concerned. Yet we find that the Government are obliged to give tinental railway, otherwise they could not",35,Ibvine
278,Sir John Eorrest,We have had in,36,Ibvine
279,Mr Mcdonald,"The reason isget the line constructed, because all the men employed are in an organization sufficiently strong to compel the Government to give preference. Because of the strength of that organization, the Government are prepared to accept the principle in that case, while, at the same time, into organizations, the idea being that imposing a penalty on others who are less advantageously situated in the cities and elsewhere. That action is not only inconsistent, but it is a rotten thing for the Government to do. The Government have no right to give preference to unionists even on the transcontinental railway, if they are honest in their opposition to the principlej because, in giving preference there and refusing it elsewhere, they are differentiating between two sets of people. So far as the proposed Bill is concerned, the honourable member who sought to introduce it gave practically no explanation as to why it was quirements of the time in a slight way, to be brought down. I am at a loss to understand how the honourable member has the courage to bring down .the measure after the exposure of the preference given by the Government in connection with the contract to Mr Teesdale Smith. was one of the most glaring cases of preference that I know of. The Govermnent refused to call for tenders, and gave prearmy, so as to get the workers into a body ference to one of their own supporters. The Attorney-General talks about spoils to the victors, but let me tell the honourable member that I have never known a more glaring case of spoils to the victors than the instance of the Teesdale Smith contract. It was an instance so glaring and palpable that any man could see exactly what was being done. It is all a hollow sham for honourable members to tell us that they do not believe in preference. Then, again, we are told by our opponents that the principle of preference to unionists will be the means of driving men into organizations. Of course it will; that is the object of it. condition of those workers was anything We do not want the principle except for that purpose. Even the Attorney-General has said on different occasions that we can never hope to have any peaceful settlement of the industrial troubles that occur from time to time until we have, on the one hand, the labourers completely organized, and, on the o£her hand, the employers completely organized. That is the position that we take up. We say that there should be complete organization on both sides, and, until there is that complete organization, there will be no machinery available by which industrial disputes can be dealt with. The whole aim of compulsory arbitration has been to force the employers, on the one hand, and the employees, on the other, once both parties are completely organized we are in a better position to control industrial movements than we can ever hope to be while both parties remain in a disorganized state. Compulsory arbitration will practically break down unless there is complete industrial organization. That has been the whole trend of development. First of all, there were the small guilds, then came the craft unions, firstly amongst the skilled workers, and afterwards in the different crafts. The great mass of the people, however, were in no organizations whatever, and, while the small guilds and craft unions met the rethey did not deal with the great mass of workers who produced the world's wealth, and who were the most poorly paid in the whole community. As time went on, it was recognised that only from a more That complete organization of the workers could great reforms come. Attempts were then made to organize this big industrial which would be able to claim better conditions than they had been able to obtain previously. I need only mention the instance of the shearing industry. Is there any class'of men under heaven who were worse treated than the shearers were prior to the formation of the Australian Workers Union? I say that they were the worse-treated class of men in Australia, and only by organization did they improve their lot. There is also the instance of the sugar workers, and the honourable member for Richmond, "" the rising hope of the Liberal party,"" will know that what I am about to say is correct. The but good.' I have known men working in the sugar industry who were treated little better than the Kanakas, and it was that treatment which helped to drive them into an organization. Then there is the case of the rural workers. Owing to the conditions these men have had to work under, and the miserable wages they are paid tween . the rural workers and their employers.",36,Ibvine

281,Mr Bennett,"There is no quarrel beMrM c DONALD statement a hundred and one times, hut, if there is no dispute, they are making a mighty big noise about it . amongst the farmers of this country there are many fair-minded men. I dare say the great bulk of them are fair minded. wages. and I was glad to hear the honourable member for Hume say that they are paying better wages than the rural workers axe asking for. But what is the reason for all the protest against the rural workers' log if the farmers are paying better wages than the workers are asking for? workers do not want the log. the farmers are prepared to pay fair and reasonable wages, and give reasonable conditions to their employees, but there are others who are not prepared to do that. They are ' the men who bring about trouble, and if the honourable member for Gippsland is sincere in his protestations this afternoon, he will have sumcient courage to go amongst the farmers who are paying good wages and congratulate them, and also congratulate the workers on the organization they are bringing into being. I was pointing out how badly the shearers and the sugar workers were treated prior to their organizing. Now let me refer to an organization which the honourable member for Hindmarsh is in terested i h . The carrying of heavy bags, some of them weighing 3 cwt. and 4 cwt., and the piling of those bags in high stacks, was a means of killing thousands of men employed in that industry. Y e t who were the people who fought against a reform ? We found honourable members on the Government side against the introduction of a smaller bag. duced it . members sitting behind the Treasurer were sitting on this side at that time. The right honourable member was a member of the Ministry, and, I think, the smaller bag was introduced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The right honourable member for Swan and the bonorable member for Eden-Monaro are, I have heard that I think, the last two remaining of the then Ministry, but the majority of members'who are now sitting on the Government side never lost an opportunity of saying that the introduction of a admit that smaller bag was an injustice to the farmers, and that tbe men who refused to carry the large bags were mere loafers. The death of an honourable member who sat on this side of the House, and who died suddenly last session, may be traced to the fact that while working on the wharfs he had to carry and stack these heavy bags. It is idle for our opponents to tell us that the employers want to do the best they can for all parties. I do not hesitate to say that, if the opportunity offered, we should have prevailing to-day the conditions that operated twenty or t h i r t y years ago. Every concession, every benefit, that tbe rural the worker has gained has been wrung from the powers that be; no voluntary concession has been made. Those who did not hesitate to avail themselves of a constitutional means of coercing the workers and of tyrannising over them in days gone by now howl like a lot of curs because 1 their opponents say that they intend to avail themselves of. exactly the same means of bettering their conditions. We are told that but for vile agitators like some honourable members on this side of the House the rural workers would cheerf u l l y follow their occupations. That, no doubt, is tbe view of the honourable member for Gippsland; no doubt, he would say that but for the agitators "" everything in the garden would be lovely."" The Attorney-General and others of his party assert that .they desire to bring about more harmonious relations between the workers and the employers, and that they also wish to see the employees securing the f u l l fruit s of their industry. But what is the position ? Statistics show that the worker does not get anything like the f u l l fruits of his to i l ; that out of fighting every week he works two days for himself and four for his employer. In such cirI t h in k we introcumstances, is it not idle to say that the relations between employers and employees should be more harmonious? The very action which the Government are taking is but another effort to divide society into two clearly-defined classes: those who produce wealth, and those who own the means of production, distribution, and exchange. These are two antagonistic forces. On the one hand, we have the men trying to get as much as they can",37,Ibvine

Industrial unrest w ill continue and spread all over the world, for the reason that the workers are becoming more intelligent and enlightened, and are beginning to realize that the civilization of to-day presses harshly, heavily, and cruelly on the great masses. We are, of course, better off in many respects than our British brethren, but the conditions which make for the present system are in our midst here, as well as abroad. I have no desire to enter into a heated party squabble, because this is too serious a question for that sort of treatment. It is terrible when we realize how colossal wealth is being built up by one section of the community, while the other section work for a bare living. These latter have nothing to sell but their labour, ancl as labour w ill not "" keep,"" it has to be disposed of in the market at once, if the people are to live; and the profits thus made tend to create further wealth for the more fortunate section. I am not complaining about people owning wealth, but merely pointing out how brutal, immoral, and barbarous is the present system of civilization. It is-a disgrace to men of intellect and culture, who have had all the advantages of education, that they do not do something to bring about altered conditions. The workers, w i th their trade unions and other organizations, are working steadily in one direction ; and the Labour party have ever been in favour of arbitration and conciliation and other peaceful methods of solving the problem. There is a demand for better conditions, 'and the steps that are being taken are not taken out of revenge or any feeling of that sort. Our great desire is to banish hatred and other strong feeling, and to regard the matter from a philosophical point of view. Let us realize the blots on our civilization, and, for Heaven's sake, t r y to remove them! If we f a i l , we shall, at all events, have the satisfaction of having tried. A t present, the workmen can go to the Court and obtain an award; and the time may, and, I think, w ill , come when another section of tlie community w ill have to face a tribunal, the duty of which w ill be to fix prices; the one is the logical outcome of the other.

Every day in the newspapers we read of men being convicted of felony, but we do not say, on that account, that the laws against felony are a failure. On one side we have the educated section of the community; on the other side we have the uneducated; and as the strain of hard work does not tend to brain culture such as is enjoyed by those who do not work, there should be large-hearted charity extended in the one direction where there would be hesitation to grant it in the other. Could not the Attorney-General find a better job than bringing in a B ill like this? He may differ from me as to the evolution that is to take place according to the picture of civilization that I have drawn. I know that it is his task to protect invested interests aud the conservative interests against whab he thinks are the inroads of the great mass of the working people. Tliere is a clear line between the two parties. There is ahead fe/ouble enough, passion and hatred enough, without honourable members opposite going out of their way for the purpose of manufacturing further trouble. That is one reason which makes me feel so bitterly against honourable members opposite. I do not blame them for being conservative. I respect Conservatism. I differ from it in principle, but I recognise that some men, by their education; environment, and by their very mental constitutions, do not take a hopeTul view of things, and are frightened that tliose who share my views will break things, and take extreme action. They recognise that evils exist, but they think that our remedies may not be effectual, and may make things worse. But such Conservatives do not go out of their way to make, war on their fellow-men. They are content to simply block any further advance by those who share my opinions, and thus give the country a breathing time until the people are prepared to allow affairs for another series of years to be under the management of those who seek to bring about a policy of extensive reform.

If the amendment is-passed, the proposal to introduce this B ill will be referred to a Committee, and the result ot the Committee's investigation will be to discover grounds on which a measure can be framed, or to advise that such legislation should be deferred to a later period. I do not think any honourable member will seriously contend tliat he is giving to the country the best that is in him when he is a party to any legislation that is born of strife and feelings bordering on revenge. from a section of its adherents who like that sort of work, is not doing the best that can be done for. the country. There is plenty of legislation with which we can occupy our time. Some three years ago the question of Tariff reform was very much before the people of the Old Country, and some honourable members who are present to-night were in England, and had an opportunity of observing the attitude of the leading statesmen of the Motherland. I am not referring to the statesmen of either party in particular, but to the leading statesmen of the British Parliament; and I have never felt such pleasure and pride as I did over their attitude in regard to Tariff reform. They had, and they have to-day, difficulties to contend w it h ; but one of the chief objections they had to dealing with the Tariff question was that they saw the terrible condition of millions of the working people of Great Britain, and they said, "" If we cannot do anything to make the conditions of tliese people better, we will not do anything to make their conditions worse."" That may not be a very great attitude for a reformer to take u p ; but it was a masterly attitude for a statesman to adopt, and I ask the Government to take that attitude to-day. There is a tremendous bitterness of feeling in regard to this industrial question, and I would appeal to both sides of the House to remember that we have to face this problem, or it will be faced by others when we have passed away; and possibly they, having a clearer view, and education being more widespread among the working classes, will be able to deal with these problems more satisfactorily than we can to-day. What are the Government going to get out of this measure, eyen if they get leave to introduce it? loose throughout the country party animosity, party hatred, and all the bitterness that can possibly confront us.' Dust is to be thrown in the eyes of the piimary producers, and they will be told of all sorts of iniquities that will spring from this industrial movement, which, I say, is one of the best guarantees in the world today for industrial peace and for the solidarity and strength of the British Empire. The uplifting of the great masses can never be effected from the top; they must work out their salvation from beneath; and mistakes, no doubt, will be made. The educated section of the community Any party that takes its lead never makes any mistake, and I do appeal to the Government to withdraw this motion and allow us to proceed with something useful.'

The Attorney-General says that he proposes to bring in a measure to deal with this question. My own candid opinion is that he will not be able to do so; because, as has been said on different occasions, an alteration of the Constitution is necessary in order to give this National Parliament power to cope with the matter.

The National Parliament cannot be judged by the number of Bills that it passes. There are some questions which we might be justified in discussing for a month, and even then we might not feel competent to arrive at a definite decision as to the action that -should be taken. know what the"" press may say, nor do I care, but I submit that Parliament is not bound to pass a B ill a day or even a B ill a month. quality rather than the quantity of our legislation. The mere fact that a large number of Bills is passed in one session is no reason for congratulation. quality of our legislation is the point to be considered, and a record of the passing of many Bills may point to nothing save that our legislation has been swift, and, perhaps, of a shoddy character. Another question to which this Parliament might well turn 'its attention is the control of the Murray waters. A t the recent Conference of State Premiers a proposal was made to deal with the Murray by a system of locking, the Commonwealth to find something like £1,000,000, and the remaining expenditure to be borne by Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. ment referred that matter to the InterState Commission? referred to the Inter-State Commission; it should be dealt with by this Parliament. There may be some feeling between the States concerned, but where on bhis continent is there a better assembly for discussing and settling the question in the interests of the people of the whole Commonwealth .than is the National Parliament? Legislation dealing with the subject should follow broad national lines. Many people in South Australia believed, prior to Federation, that the The National Parliament would have control of the Murray River. Indeed, I think However two-thirds of the people of Australia held -that view. But later on they found t h a t Federation would not help them out of the difficulty. An y intelligent man viewing the fact that the two parties in this House are practically equally divided, would say, "" If members had any patriotism they would sink their The Opposition have no desire to differences of opinion and come to an We wish agreement upon national issues of pressing importance to the people."" This question of the Murray waters demands the combined wisdom of the National Parliament. There is also the revision of the Tariff awaiting our attention. Honourable members opposite say that the Labour party should have dealt with it when in office. My answer is that so I do not many large and important questions of pressing urgency demanded our consideration that it was impossible to dispose of them all. If I were making an We have to consider the' unreasonable proposal I should not be surprised' if the Attorney-General turned it down, but the position that I take up is that we do not and cannot make the The issues in this great country. The electors have returned to this House two parties practically equal in number, . and those who know the ABC of public life must recognise that in such circumstances nothing in the way of reform or progressive legislation on vital party lines can be attempted. Recognising this, the Government should deal with the broad, non-party questions that await our attention. It is all very well for the Government to say, "" We do not like this or t h a t "" ; but they are in the same position as we are. We should like to be able to carry reforms calculated, by evolution, to change the face of our civilization, and to bring about a better distribution of wealth by removing the system of wage slavery that we have to-day.

342,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memThe passages -which I propose to read are to be found in a great speech delivered by the honourable gentleman, in 1900, when a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. reported in the New South Wales Hansard for the 2nd August, 1900. The Prime Minister, having delivered his speech, had proofs of the report submitted to him by the printer, and, on the following day, calmly corrected them in his office, so that his remarks might be preserved for posterity in the public records of the country in the exact form that he wished them to take. This speech was not made when he was w it h in tlie ranks of the Labour party. Years before he had l e f t the Labour party to join the so-called Liberals. A t the time of its delivery, he had been a M in ister of the Crowni n a Liberal Administration, and had had many years' experience in Parliament. The speech, therefore, was the expression of one whose mind must be considered to have matured on the question with which he dealt. Having taken some interest in union matters, and having heard the question of preference to unionists threshed out in great union assemblies, in public debates, and in this Parliament, I say that the arguments and pathos of the speech, excel anything that I have heard. Speaking of voluntary action in settling disputes, the honourable member saidAll that voluntary action can eto for the settlement of these disastrous industrial troubles has boen done; but in spite of all that has been done, men are to-day being victimized because they belong to trades organizations The other day a mine manager discharged six men, the reason given being that the trade of the mine was falling off, and that, therefore, these men had to go. It was only a coincidence that they were the six men at the colliery who had agitated for an advance in wages, which was afterwards conceded. -They attended the meeting, at which it was 'determined to ask for this advance, and, so to speak, took a lead of the proceedings whereby it was secured, and it was merely a coincidence that they, and only they, were sent about their business at a time when there was an appearance of a falling off in trade. .With variations, that has been the experience of the union movement from the beginning down to the present day. Members of a trade, fearing injustice, their fellows to band together, and become their spokesme», agitating for better conditions. them the wrath of their employers, because the improvement Afr. J. H. Catts. tions and the increasing of wages means the corresponding curtailment of profits. Every device known to the human mind is practised to get r i d of such men, It is coercion being used to drive them out of the industry. The Prime Minister, when he made his speech, .had been Postmaster-Generali n an Administration of which the present HighCommissioner was the head. Having worked in mines, the instance which he cited appealed to him directly. quorum. [Quorum formed.] MrJ . H . CATTS It is to be remembered that the Prime Minister, when he spoke, had had experience in the Old Country as well as in Australia, and knew the hardships to which unionists had been subjected in both parts of the world. Dealing with the attitude of Australian capitalists, and to show why unionists should be more f u l l y protected in Australia than in any other country, he saidHaving had experience of both countries, I venture to say that there is a difference between the capitalism of the Old Country and the capitalism of these Colonies. . . . It seems to me that the difference in the capitalism in the two communities is largely one of temperament. In the Old Country there is still a lingering trace of the old spirit of noblesse, which has come down from feudal times. I am glad to say that it has not yet left the capitalism of the Old Country. In these young countries most capitalists have had to force their way up from the ranks, and the process has developed a somewhat harder side to their natures. They have become what may be called professional capitalists. From a remark recently made by the honourable gentleman, it would appear that he is now the spokesman for those capitalists. He pointed out that there was greater necessity for protection for the workmen in Australia by the expedient of preference to unionists than there was in the Old Country, because Australian employers, generally speaking, were a harder lot to deal with, and more given to desperate and inhuman measures, than those of whom he had spoken. Now we come to the thir d point, when the Prime Minister answered the objections of employers to preference to invite unionistsBut now let ns see for a moment what this objection really is, and whether it is so formidable as it might appear in some quarters. This: at oncebrings upon I take up a criticism of the Bill by the Builders' and Contractors' Association, and of working condihere the objection is put in sentences.",46,Ibvine
343,Mr Websteb,"We should have aThen he quoted the objections of the Employers Association as follows-We also question the justice of imposing disabilities upon nine-tenths of the industrial community at the instance of the trade-union ""tenth"" in order that the majority of the employees may be coerced into joining trades unions or becoming industrial IshmaeBtes. That is the same old "" gag "" for it cannot be called an argument-that is put forward by the employers to-day; and the reply by the Prime Minister of 1900 is as applicable now as it was then. The honourable gentleman bas never retracted those words; in fact, he has emphasized them by saying that he has never turned round on any of his principles. He went on to deal with the question of free labourIt is a recognised rule in unionist circles that unionists should not work with free labourers. Yet the honourable gentleman is a party to a B ill which seeks to compel unionists to work with free labourers on the public works of the Commonwealth. He proceededI know a great many people who will not agree with tliat. The reason why that takes place to-day is this : A free labourer is I egarded by the unionist as a menace to his wages, as a menace to his ' price. It is in order to secure his price that he has to sacrifice the free labourer. That is the reason why unionists very much object to work with free ""labourers, because the free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept conditions which the unionist dislikes. That being so, under this Bill the motive of the employer to employ free labour will be taken right away. The free labourer is never called into requisition at all, except in times of industrial trouble. May I remind the honourable gentleman that he recently delivered himself in a speech before an organization which is, presided .over by that evil genius of the workers of Australia, one J . T. Packer. When the tramway employees at Ballarat were tryin g to obtain an increase of wage, which then stood at 30s. a week for married men, this Packer of this Liberal strike-breaking labour institute, wrote to the manager of the company to the effect that if the unionists were not prepared to work for wages the members of the organization were prepared to send men from Melbourne to do the work at the company's price. Y e t the Prime Minister honoured this organization with his presence, gave it his blessing, and sent it on its way rejoicing. The Prime Minister stated that those strike-breakers are never called into requisition except in times of industrial trouble, and there can be no excuse that he did not understand the position. Some honourable members opposite may not realize what it is for a man, with a wife and family, to be struggling on 30s. a week, and, when no has banded with his fellows to obtain a few shillings more, to find, just as success is within his grasp, that some one else comes along and deprives him of it . The increase of wages would have meant more boots and more education for his children-woul d have meant bread and butter instead of bread and drippingbut all his efforts are rendered abortive by the free labourers. As I say, some honourable members opposite may not understand these matters, but that cannot be said of the Prime Minister, who realizes the'position perfectly well, and had it in his mind when he was speaking. He went on to sayMan for man, it is a recognised rule that the trade unionist is at least the equal of the free labourer in ability at his work. Thereforo it is not on account of superior workmanship that the free labourer is employed, but in order that he may be a menace to the unionist, who is employed for the time being, or in order to defeat him if he is out on strike. The honourable gentleman tells us that the free labourer, whom this B ill has Been introduced to placate, is not employed because he is the better workman, but for the express purpose of being a menace to unionists; and yet, as an employer of labour on behalf of the people of Australia, he now proposes-in fact, he ad-, mits having already done so-to employ them, not because they give better value to the public, but because, by their means, he can help them to break down unionism as employers generally are trying to break it down. labour. Mr J. H . CATTS -Quite so. The honourable gentleman went on to sayAs this Bill is going to stop strikes, there will be no further motive on the part of the employer to take the free labourer under his protecting care. We have an Arbitration Gourt which is presided over by one of the Judges of the H i g h Court, and it has absolute jurisdiction over the public works of the Commonwealth. If there is no need for this discrimination of favour of unionists when there is an Arbitration Court to settle matters, surely, on the honourable gentleman's OAvn argument, there is no",47,Ibvine
344,Mr Mcgrath,"And to get cheapneed for h i m to do by this B ill what the Government have already done, namely, encourage those who object to workmen's organizations. He went onI should like'to say, as the result of long experience in these matters, that if honorahle gentlemen will think for a moment what is the object of the free labourer, and the effect of the free labourer upon the condition of the unionist, they will see a very good ground for dislike on the part of the unionist to the free labourer. The Prime Minister has been sitting in his place while I have quoted his own speeches and expressions of opinion, and no denial has come from him. We know that, as a rule, if the Prime Minister objects to any statements regarding him, he uses his privilege freely. He sits there interjecting every two or three minutes to contradict statements that may be put forward, but he, has never stood up in the House and contradicted the speeches I have quoted. I now wish to refer to the question of freedom of contract. The Prime Minister is now connected with a party who bandy about the sacred name of liberty, and the following reply of his to an argument based on that old sentiment, is very appropriate at the present time. saysWe hear it in these words : that this Bill is an interference with liberty-a n interference with the principle of freedom of contract. I often think that those gentlemen who make this objection must be very ignorant of our industrial history. They must be very ignorant of the operations of this principle of the freedom of contract when they claim for it so many virtues and so many advantages. The industrial history of this, and every other country, shows that masquerading under this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly and horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. Go to the beginning of this century and read there a picture of the operation of this principle cf freedom of contract. I have here a volume entitled Industry in England, by Mr H. de B. Gibbins. Any one who will take the trouble to read this book will, I think, for ever after be use of which I shall now advert, as a last very careful as to how he uses that phrase, "" freedom of contract."" We are not here, I take it, to mouth shibboleths either of liberty or protection or anything else. We are here to investigate facts, and to see the bearing of them, and they are facts in the industrial life of this country. The honourable gentleman, who is seeking to return to the old principle of freedom of contract, under which the employer shall be free to choose non-unionists as against unionists, here states that that principle has been responsible for some Mr J, fl. Catts. of the most ghastly tragedies in the industrial life of the Empire. H is words are as true to-day as they were when uttered in 1900. He went on to picture how employers w i th freedom of contract, treated little girls in Englandi n the factories, and he quoted the speech of a member of the British House of Commons as follows:Our ancestors could not have supposed it possible-posterit y will not believe it true-that a generation of Englishmen could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping infancy of a few summers old, regardless alike of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresistiug weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, and through the weary night also, till, in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of youth was faded, and fell ere it was unfolded. . . . Here is a picture put forward by our present Prime Minister of the treatment employers w ill mete out to tiny toddling, girls in their lisping infancy. misreported ? MrJ . H . CATTS -No; and when the speech is quoted in his presence he walks out of the chamber. He does not like to be reminded of these convictions of his, which, I venture to say, are just as much his convictions to-day as they were He on the day they were uttered. The Prime Minister may have changed his position, but he has not changed his convictions on the matter. It is absolutely impossible for a man in the maturity of liis manhood, after having been for many years in public life, to put forward opinions of this description which are not his real opinions. To imagine that a man would do that sorb of thing is to have an opinion of him that I would not -like to describe. Then the PrimeM in ister proceeds as to the work of these girls on the night shifts in the factories of England. He says, . . Then, in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose.

346,Mr Higgs,"Prime Minister also quoted another great authority on this question. He saidWe cannot do better than refer to an authority which is more frequently quoted by the opponents of this measure than perhaps any other-a n authority whom they nearly always regard as being on their side. I refer to John Stuart Mill. I am going to quote a few sentences from his essay on liberty. Whatever other people may say of John Stuart Mill, I disagree with him in many of his statements; but I recognise in him one* of the clearest and most profound thinkers on these questions that our race has ever produced. This is what John Stuart Mill says: "" The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force, in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty _ of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can he rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. Then he adds his comment, and saysThat quotation from John Stuart Mill corbitration Court might safely be intrusted rectlv describes the principle operating under with the exercise of his discretion on thethis Bill. He was there referring to the principle of unionists, but this B ill asserts preference to unionists beiug included in bad principle that, though a Judge the Arbitration .Bill introduced in the might safely be allowed to exercise this New South ""Wales Legislative Assembly. immense jurisdiction over the lives of The Prime Minister had made a study of citizens, he is not to be intrusted to decidethese authorities.

Now the ence; that is, if , on a plaint referred to the Arbitration sided over by a High Court upon the evidence produced, the Judge We have had Mr Justice Higgins presidthinks terests of the whole community granted preference to unionists, he may do that this Judge has been very sympathetic so.

In every casecretion is left to the President Arbitration Court, who is a Judge of the ration Court the union has claimed preH i g h Court, and this B ill , so far as it has any operative effect, seeks to with draw part of the jurisdiction of the Court in this matter. This is what the Prime Minister had to say about it We commit millions of pounds' worth of pro. perty to the disposal of our Judges every day.. All over the world the Courts of Law determine the conditions of families and of estates, and it seems to me that we should not hesitateabout committing trade disputes to the arbitration of a Court in regard to which we have the highest guarantees to assure us that the Court will be what we say it will be. We commit these material interests to the hnn<i-s of men to whom w.e are content to commit the issues of life and death.

347,Mr J. Jet. Catts.,"ference to unionists; but this Judge, who according to the Prime Minister, is not to be trusted to hear evidence as to whether preference to unionists shall be granted on works under the Commonwealth Government, has never in the history of the Court, since 1905, awarded preference to unionists on the evidence put forward. An Honorable MEMBER -He did so in the Brisbane tramway case. Mr J. H . CATTS I must correct myself to that extent; I remember the instance mentioned. In the Brisbane tramway case the Judge did not, in the first instance, award preference to unionists; he said, "" I do not wish to interfere with. the employers in their choice of their workmen, but if I find that the men are being victimized, the union may come back to me, and I shall be compelled to award preference to unionists."" True to the instincts of that type of employer, the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company did go in for wholesale victimization of the men. who had banded themselves together to better the conditions of themselves and their fellow-workmen, and then, only then, did the Court say that, in order to stop such tyranny and prevent the employers from evading the decision of the Judge in regard to the conditions of labour, ho was compelled to give a preference that would protect unionists. That was a case in which the tramway company were doing what the Prime Minister has described in the speech I have quoted, when he spoke of the half-dozen miners banding themselves together to advance tbe interests of themselves and their class; but through some flimsy pretext of a falling-off in trade, the men who had taken leading parts in the union were sacked. Preference to unionists is to prevent victimization of that kind; and in the tramway case the Judge was obliged to give preference to unionists, in order to protect the men against the employer. If the number of workmen concerned was to be totalled up, it would probably be found that the President of the Arbitration Court delivered awards which governed the working conditions of at least a quarter-of-a-million of workmen, and the only instance in which he awarded preference to unionists was in connection with the employment of two or three thousand men. The next point I wish to deal with is what unionism has done for workmen and for the community generally; and on this point the Prime Minister was no less emphatic. He adduced arguments why workmen's organizations should be encouraged, and why their members should get preference over those who did not subscribe to the upkeep of the union. The honourable member argued that, in the interests of the whole community, such organizations should be encouraged, and to afford that encouragement it was necessary to give to them preference in their employment, so as to encourage other men to join the unions, which were a boon to society, and were making it possible for the workers to live on a higher plane of civilization than before. This is what the honourable member saidI t is generally recognised to-day, I think, by all intelligent men, that nearly'all that has come to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the privileges he already enjoys, and which he has hardly won by many years of arduous toil, when a man is brought into the arena to try and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers, in these unionist centres at any rate, step in to reap where they have not sown. It is that feeling which gives rise to hostility on the part of the unionist. Then the honourable member developed the case he was making out for the protection of unions and unionists. I venture to say, that upon the merits of thc case alone, the Bill does right to give a preference to the trades unionist. I have already said that in my judgment trades unions have done more for the workers than, perhaps, all the other influences which operate tfo advance our civilization put together. That is not my opinion only; it is the opinion of those who have studied the question deeply, and who are in a sphere which enables them to detach themselves from the influences which operate with those who have had anything to do with these troubles. It is their opinion that trades unions have done a great deal of good to the country at large. Almost the last speech that Mr Gladstone delivered before he died furnished an opportunity for a statement of this kind. Continuing, the honourable gentleman quoted this statement by GladstoneI believe the trades unions of the world are the bulwarks of our modern Democracy. "" That,"" said the Prime Minister, "" is Mr Gladstone's deliberate opinion in almost the last speech he delivered."" And then the honourable member, giving evidence of his research and study, quoted Thorold Rogers. He saidThorold Rogers -will be admitted to be one of the clearest-headed men we have who has ever investigated this subject. He saysThc public is profoundly interested in the efficiency and independence of the working man. By the former, the industrial success of the country is guaranteed and secured. In the latter lies the only hope that we shall be ever .able to realize in our day what the trade guilds of the middle ages aimed at,. . and in some direction unquestionably secured. . don and other large towns do not, perhaps, exercise the moral discipline over their members which they might do if their fellows more generally enlisted in the system, and they will do as they get stronger and better informed, but I am abundantly convinced that the trade unionists in England include in their numbers thc most intelligent, conscientious and valuable of the working men. That is Thorold Rogers' view of trades unionists. He saysI confess to. having at one time viewed them suspiciously. A long study of'the history of labour has convinced me that they are not only the best friends of the workman, but the best agency for the employer and the public, and that, to the extension of these associations, political economists and statesmen must look for the solution of some among the most pressing and the most difficult problems of our own time. I shall hope to show this after I have dealt with the facts of the present situation. Those are the opinions of writers who have studied these questions deeply, and therefore, it seems to me, to be but a just recognition of the work of trade unionists and, apart altogether from its incidental bearing upon the Bill, that this preference to trade organizations should be given. We have seen cases in some unions in Australia where a minority of the organization has refused to abide by the majority's decision.' There have been cases in which there has been a decision by the union that work should be continued during some industrial friction; but a minority of members have broken away, and thrown the industry into chaos and strife. In order that organizations might be able to exercise discipline over a minority broke away and caused industrial when the majority of workmen in the industry desired that further should be given for a peaceful the Prime Minister should be encouragement to men to join Mr J. H. Catts. the organizations. He contended that when industrial trouble loomed on the horizon, men who were not members of a union should be encouraged to join, so that the discipline of the leaders of the organization might be exercised openly, and so that disputes might be settled in a constitutional and peaceful manner. Preference should be the encouragement given to bring about industrial peace and the settlement of these disastrous troubles by reference to the Law Courts of the land. The honourable gentleman has made one . The trades unions of Loneffort to extricate himself from the position in which he finds himself. On 10th June, 1912, he went to Lithgow, the district which first returned him to Parliament, and in the course of a speech which he made, some questions were raised in regard to preference to unionists, and as to whether he had altered his opinion. The honourable gentleman replied, "" Oh, no, I have not altered my opinion. My opinion is what it was before; but other people w i th whom I was associated have altered their opinion. It is they who have done the jumping round."" That statement fastens upon the honourable gentleman the holding of these opinions from 1900 to 1912. When pressed to state in what way the others had done the jumping round of which he spoke, he said t h a t he believed in preference to unionists before the unions took part in politicswhen they were purely industrial organizations-bu t since they were taking political action to secure the objects for which they were banded together, he now objected to preference. Before exploding that excuse, may 1 say that almost every object of a trade union is to-day the subject matter of political action? The workers band together to secure the payment of a minimum wage, a shorter working day, the provision of devices to protect them when working amongst machinery, better sanitary conditions, more breathing space, and separate lavatories that in factories for male and female workers, unrest, compensation in case of accident, and so forth . Almost every object aimed at by opportunity a union, as something to be gained by settlement, organization, is the subject of political argued that there action. Surelyi f men are banded together and are paying in to their union a few pence a week to attain these objects, that fact should not debar them from securing preference. It might be necessary, for instance, for a union in Western Australia to send a deputation to the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General in Melbourne, to ask for an amendment of the navigation law, so as to provide for compensation to seamen injured in the discharge of their, duties. But the very moment that they spent money in sending that deputation here it would be said that they .were taking political action, and were to be put upon straight away. That, according to the Prime Min-. ister, would be an evil. According to his argument-if it be an argument-the men should go out on strike, throw the whole industrial community into a state of turmoil, and rely only on brute strength in fighting out the issue. They must not take constitutional measures to remedy their grievances. As a matter of fact, I can knock away that prop on which the Prime Minister is relying. I find that he himself, when secretary of the Miners' Union at Lithgow, convened a meeting of the unions in the district, and proposed that they should combine to secure the re-"" turn of members of Parliament. I quoted the honourable gentleman's letter a few days ago, and now that I am linking him up with this question, it may not be out of place to quote it once more. It shows that the Prime Minister was in favour of preference to unionists at a time when unionists were taking political action. It is the last proof that need be given of his support of the principle. I have shown that he argued in favour of it in 1900, that in 1912 he said that he had not shifted from his original position, that he believed in preference to unionists when the organization was for industrial purposes and not for political action, and now, by quoting this letter, I shall show that he invited the tmions of the Lithgow district to join with him in taking political action to return members to Parliament. The letter is as follows:Having regard to a communication which recently appeared in the daily press purporting to have been written by the secretary of the Drivers' and Firemen's Association to the Trades and Labour Council, suggesting the fusion of the Labour forces of the district, with a view to returning a representative to Parliament whose sympathies should be entirely with the worker, I am directed by my delegate board to submit for your consideration the following proposition :-That two (2) representatives from each Labour organization of the Hartley district meet, at a time and place to be hereafter arranged, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps for the return of a Labour candidate at the next general election. The need for this has been emphasized by the unsympathetic, and actively hostile attitude assumed, by our present member throughout the long and wasting strike, in the midst of which our own organization is plunged at the present time. During the present crisis, Mr. Hurley has not failed whenever the opportunity presented itself to declaim against the tyranny and unrighteousness of the methods of our procedure, as well as having gone out of his way to be brutally offensive towards those members upon whom only we can rely to furnish us with the means of voicing our complaints in the Parliament of the country. Not only so, but very recently Mr Hurley gave expression to words in the House which ean only be construed as containing a direct challenge to the Labour organizations of this district. Furthermore, since the commencement of the present struggle Mr Hurley has never evinced the slightest desire to help in any 'way those of his constituents and supporters whose fortunes have been so adversely affected by the continuance of the strike, and, indeed, has shown in every possible way and manner the strong sympathy with those who in this struggle must be regarded as the opponents of trade unionism. In view, therefore, 'of the unquestionable attitude taken up by Mr Hurley with respect to the progressive developments cf the Labour forces of this colony, my Board is anxious to express its cordial agreement with the action taken by the Drivers' and Firemen's Association, and urge the earnest consideration of the above proposition as the best means of giving effect to that sympathy which exists amongst the various workers of the Colony, and which can only find fitting expression in that unity of action which shall secure to us direct representation in the Parliament of this Colony. Hoping you will give the matter your best attention, and do me the favour of an early reply. (Sgd.) Jos. Coox> Miners' General Secretary.

He would say, "" You are not a member of the union, sir, and we give preference to unionists."" But we have the Attorney-General's own case.

We shall be requiring the services of architects in connection with the Eederal Capital, and I think that preference should be given to the union architect. I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong, who is another union lawyer, will agree that that would be quite right. It is strange that the honourable member should be found voting for an anti-preference to unionists Bill. I do not know what is coming over the so-called Liberal party when they allow themselves to be run by the Tories, with the Attorney-General at their head. I want a Select Committee to make inquiries into the bona fides of a number of trade unions. Honourable members will no doubt recollect that the Hon. King O'Malley, when Minister of Home Affairs, issued an edict, in which he said, "" I find that we are only paying -builders' labourers 8s. 4d. per day. Pay them 9s. per day, and give preference to unionists."" I might have the builders' labourers' rules with me, but, if not, I could supply them to the Select Committee if it be appointed. I wish the Committee to inquire into the bona fides of the Amalgamated Carpenters and Joiners formed sixty years ago, when carpenters were getting 4s. 6d. a day.

407,Mr Higgs,"This association claimsthe entrance fees to this organization? They are 5s. per member, with contributions of ls. per week for f u l l benefit members, and 4d. per week for trade benefit members. Now, is it not a fair thing to give preference to members of that organization who have raised wages from 4s. 6d. per day sixty years ago to what they are at the present time? Then let me take the case of the Australian Builders' Labourers Association. The objects of that body are thus set out, "" To obtain and maintain reasonable hours of work and fair wages and conditions, to improve, protect, and foster the best in terests of its members, to assist by just and equitable methods in the settlement of any differences which may arise between the members and their employers, to provide benefits to members when unable to work as the result of accident, and to establish a f u n d to carry out the foregoing objects."" Is there anything extravagant in the claims of that association? Let the proposed Select Committee ascertain. They will not find in the rules of that organization anything such as may be discovered in the rules of the High Court as to the fees which barristers may charge-the y will find no twenty or twenty-five guineas per day, with ten-guinea refreshers. All that the Minister of Home Affairs did was to direct that these builders' labourers should be paid 9s. per day, and that preference should be granted to unionists. The Attorney-General,'who is the idol of the society classes of Victoria, said, "" We will not permit you to have preference to unionists,"" and the Prime Minister, whose opinions were quoted by the honourable member for Cook to-night, knows perfectly well what is the work of a labourer. He knows that these builders' labourers who are associated together for these moral objects are entitled to preference at the hands of the Commonwealth, ought to employ the best men in the interests of the Commonwealth. be found in the unions. Let the honourable member go to the TradesH a l l in any city, and he will there meet men who are good tradesmen in their respective avocations. If the presidents, secretaries, and committees of these trade associations considered themselves only they would have no need to be members of a union at all. But they have some sympathy with their fellows, and w i th the wives and families of their fellows, and consequently they meet together, and form these trade unions. Surely the Government ought to help these men in the groundwork which they are performing by granting them preference in any employment which the Commonwealth has to offer. It is not a very great deal of employment, it is true. Some honourable member said that it embraces only 2,000 or 3,000 men in the Commonwealth. The Attorney General will doubtless tell the public that we wish to interfere with the Public Service Commissioner and the Public Service Act. But that Act contains many sections directing how persons shall gain admission to our Public Service. To do so, they must first pass certain examinations. They have to be able to read and write, to know something of arithmetic and geometry, and, in some cases, of French or German. The Attorney General and our opponents, with the aid of the daily press-and I wish to say here that I recognise some of theexcellencies of the daily press-wil l attempt to blind the people as to the true merits of the B ill which the Government wish to introduce. I would like to see a Select Committee appointed to inquire into this matter, because I believe that the evidence taken by such a body would find its way into the daily press and act as a counterblast to the speeches of the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister. I do not know whether I ought to occupy any f u r t h er time in dealing with other trade associations. I hold in my"" hand the revised rules of the Amalgamated Coachmakers and the Rolling-stock and Wheelwrights Society of Victoria. By-and-by we shall be entering upon the railway business, and we shall have to employ wheelwrights and coachbuilders. Why should they not be granted a preference ? I read : ' ' TheH e knows that he objects of this society shall be for the pur* pose of adopting such regulations from time to time as.will conduce to the benefits of members generally, to give support to its members when unemployed, to afford protection in cases of oppression, to assist them to obtain a fair remuneration for their labour, to abolish the system of piece-working, to use its influence in consolidating the system of working eight hours a day, to prevent any encroachment on the rights of the various trades, and",59,Ibvine
408,Mr Atkinson,,60,Ibvine
409,Mr Higgs,"And the best men are tofor any purpose affecting the interests of members which the society may determine."" W ill any honourable member opposite say that a union which has been formed to assist its members when unemployed should not get preference? L e t the Select Committee which I desire to see appointed inquire into this matter. The Prime Minister should not object to that. I have read a speech which was delivered by him in his best Sunday afternoon clerical voice several voices. He has the voice of a lion sometimes, when he is attacking honourable members upon this side of the chamber,' but at other times he coos like a dove. The honourable gentleman knows all about the unemployed, and my desire is to get h i m into the witness box, and ask what he meant the other day when he spoke about a man deteriorating every hour when he was unemployed. discussing the question of preference? desirability of appointing a Select Committee to inquire into some of the honourable member's speeches on the question. If I were a member of the Committee I should ask the honourable gentleman, "" Do you think that an organization like the Amalgamated Coachmakers, RollingStock, and Wheelwrights Society, which provides unemployment benefits, ought to receive preference at the hands of the Commonwealth?"" very fair question, and I now put it to the people of Victoria and of the Commonwealth. A t present there is no comprehensive system in Australia for dealing w i th the unemployed. The Salvation Army may give food in return for certain work; and, under the circumstances, considering the poor response to the appeals for subscriptions, I suppose it is about the best that that body can do. But neither State nor Commonwealth afford any means of dealing with the unemployed, whereas the trade unions do. member deal with the amendment ? posed Committee should inquire into the bona fides of the society I have mentioned, and ascertain whether or not it ought to be given preference. again, there is the Operative Bakers Society. I do not know that the Commonwealth is likely to employ bakers, although there is, I believe, a State bakery in New South Wales, which supplies bread to public institutions at I d . a pound. and bad bread !

Further, the Committee might inquire as to the possibility of the Commonwealth entering into the drapery business, although I believe there is plenty of competition in that business now. The motto of the Shop Assistants Association, is as followsFor the cause that lacks assistance, For the wrongs that need resistance, For the future in the distance, And the good that we can do.

All this trouble has arisen out of the builders' labourers being paid 9s. per day and preference to unionists being granted in the Department of Home Affairs. I want a Select Committee to inquire into the rules of the Federated House and Ship Painters, Paperhangers and Decorators Association, w i th a view to ascertaining to what extent its members should be granted preference. great many carpenters are employed by the Commonwealth, and I would like a Select Committee to inquire whether the rules and objects of the Carpenters and Joiners Association are what they claim to be. If they are, the members of this association should get preference. The following are the objects of this association :The objects of this society arc to raise funds for the advancement, protection, and organization of the trade; to render legal assistance to members for the recovery of wages; and for the mutual support of its members in cases of sickness, accident, and superannuation; for the burial or cremation of members and their wives; for the loss of tools; for assistance to members out of work; and to assist (to a reasonable extent) any branch or On l y in relation to district desirous of joining with other organized branches of trade with which our members are identified either in the ship or houseI shall leave the building industries, with a view to advancing the material conditions of the worker; also as These latter follow a very directed in the following rules, to form a contingent fund, which shall be used for the purpose of granting assistance in cases of disThere are l if t attentress not otherwise provided for by these rules; to aid our own or any other organized trade to take legal proceedings under the Employers' Liability Act and Workmen's ComWe must be approaching the pensation Act on behalf of members who may have been injured or met their death by accident in the British Isles and in countries where Acts of this description are in operation. The assistance to recover wages is very necessary. Sometimes employers refuse to pay their men. A lot of people talk about the advantage of capital to labour, I remind the honbut the carpenter does his work before he gets his wages, and sometimes he does not get his wages. I believe that if a Select Committee inquired into the justification for leave to introduce a B ill of this character, they would decide that leave sliould not be given. Should a Committee go through the rules of the hundred and one organizations of employees in Australasia they would see that associations formed for such highly moral purposes are entitled to preference to unionists. I doubt if they would find anything h i the objects of the Bar Council of the nature of the humanitarian proposals to be found at the head of the rules of indust r i a l organizations. If any one should get preference, it should not be legal members of the Bar Council, nor medical men, nor architects. It should be those men who have to use the plane and the saw, A and the pick and the shovel. I venture to think t h at a Select Committee would tell the Attorney-General and the Prime Miuister that leave should not be given to introduce a B ill of this character. on the Committee ? Select Committees or Royal Commissions. I have had experience of both, and they are very trying and arduous, and take a good deal out. of one.

I have spoken in connection with the motion for leave to introduce this question, and I regret that I find it necessary to address myself to the amendment, hut I cannot allow the opportunity to pass 'without some attempt to place before the House my opinions upon it. I speak with all due respect when I say that the motion itself implies that there is a desire, not so much to settle industrial troubles as to utilize a position which the Attorney-General has created in order to attain some end the Government have in view. That end is what? To, if possible, plunge this country into industrial unrest, and to make out of the industrial situation a condition of affairs which will enable them, if they possibly can, to limit the power which the Labour party has in this House, where the Government find themselves in a hopeless position, and also in another place, where we are perfectly satisfied, and have the Government under the whip. The Attorney-General has attempted to make much profit out of the situation. He has stepped out of the ordinary run of things, and, in his public utterances, has outlined a course of action which he thinks will aid his party.

""We have been told that the Opposition are seeking to prevent legislation; but that charge is groundless. What we are seeking to prevent is what we regard, from our standpoint as a Labour party, as bad legislation; and, therefore, we suggest, as an amicable solution, the appointment of a Select Committee. We are face to face with a position that may plunge us into serious trouble. There is no doubt that if this Bill be passed in the form suggested, there will be found throughout Australia an organized force prepared to oppose it at all costs and hazards. If we can avoid that, and preserve peace, by all means let us do so; let us resort to intellectual methods, and not to strikes and disruptions, which mean so much harm to the country as a whole. Although the Attorney-General may be prepared to do so, I do not think that those sitting behind him are ready to face the issues that will arise when we on this side take up the cudgels, as we undoubtedly shall if this Bill be forced through the House. I do [36]2 not know what may happen in the Senate, but the Government may be able to force us to the country; and I urge that this extreme step should not be taken, unle'ss, it cannot be avoided. Let us have a Select Committee to ascertain how many public servants are concerned. Can the Attorney-General tell me how many are concerned ? Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is too late to answer questions. Wliy should honourable members ber for Dalley is not in order in asking a question in debate, nor would the Attorney-General be in order in answering it. sir, but it is a question which, I think, might well have been answered without intervention from the Chair. The silence of the Attorney-General convinces me that the Government are not in possession of the facts, and cannot tell us whether 300 or 3,000 men are involved. What is there in the amendment that the Government and their supporters should be afraid of? Do they fear that the facts are against them, and that on investigation the Bill will be found to be valueless? Are they, after all, utilizing this little measure for ulterior motives-to gain some little end in their own particular interests. All the facts ought to be placed before the House, and a Select Committee presents the best means. What harm could a Committee do ? Hon orable members opposite are afraid to T answer. They are not concerned with the question of preference or non-preference, but they are concerned with a little cry that they propose to pour into the ears of their own people, in the hope that it will be carried from one to the other, and result in the defeat of the Labour party.

[Quorum formed.] crisis had arisen in the Imperial Parliament, and that crisis was sought to be removed by just the means we have suggested to-night. In the House of Commons they did not refer the matter of the alteration of the Home Rule Bill to a Committee, but they held what are popularly known as "" conversations"" among the leaders of both sides, by which it was proposed to arrive at an agreement. So the Prime Minister will see that by the amendment submitted to-night we are striving to do exactly what was sought to be done in the Imperial Parliament. We are not actuated by obstructive tactics. We simply desire to find an honourable way out of what must be admitted is a difficulty. Honourable members opposite must be aware that the Opposition, by every means in their power, even to the last drop of blood-i l one may use the phrase-mus t oppose the proposal of the Government. But we.are willing to meet Ministers privately, and discuss the matter, and come to some understanding with them, because we are as anxious as honourable members opposite are to get on with the business of the country. Honorsion of this measure .will offer an extended source of obstruction to the passage of useful legislation. We cannot allow the Bill to pass if we can find the means to prevent it. Our very existence as a party depends on certain well-known and clearly-defined principles, and, as preference to unionists is one of those principles, we are prepared to stand by it at all hazards, and to use every constitutional means in our power in order to oppose any attempt to deprive unionists of the right to organize and secure that preference which the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated is their just and lawful due. If the Government are anxious to go on with useful legislation here is a way out of the difficulty. There are important social items that sadly need attention. There are urgent matters of legislation that we are willing tp support. There are quite a number of ""measures urgently needed. Therefore, why should we deliberately and wilfully have the pathway of the progress ""of legislation obstructed by the Government bringing in a Bill which will create obs'truction in the House, and excitement in public affairs, of which no honourable member can see the end? The principle of preference to unionists has been forced upon us. I have the authority of the Prime Minister for saying that the position of the workers to-day is due largely-if not entirely-to the unions, and their loyalty to each other, and their demand for the recognition of their rights. He has saidI t is generally recognised to-day, I think, by all intelligent men that nearly all that has come to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the privileges he already en]oys, and which he has hardly won by many years of arduous toil, when a man is brought into the arena to try and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers step in to reap where they have not sown. It is that feeling which gives rise to hostility on the part of the unionist. I have no desire ,to be referring continually to the statements of the Prime Minis-, ter in regard to this matter. They are so thoroughly well known, having been so repeatedly quoted in the House, that hon-^ orable members are quite well aware that",68,Chapman Nasty Member Address Himself To The Question

508,' Mr Finlayson,"A very seriousthe very things for which we ask, the very principles for which we stand, are those which have always been advocated by the Prime Minister, and from which, by word, he has never withdrawn, though-whic h is very important-by deed he has done so. The unfortunate position in which we find ourselves is just a repetition of ancient history. Unionism was forced upon the workers. When we remember the condition of our own kith and kin in the Old Country years ago; when we think of their absolute degradation-almos t slavery, if not worse in some cases-w e wonder that the Empire of which we are all so proud in certain directions should have reached even the power and glory that it has attained. T wish to give honourable members a glimpse into the history of industrial affairs in Great Britain. It marks the starting point of that movement which we now call the trade union movement, the demand for preference for members of unions based on the inalienable right of every member to stand by his fellow members, and the securing for each and every member of a union the proper return to which his labour entitles him. I quote from a very fine book recently published, and entitled The Church and the New Age, written by the Eev. Henry Carter. This book, on page 63, deals with mill-owners of England and their need for labour, and saysThe mill-owners systematically communicated witli the overseers of the poor, who arranged a day for the inspection . of pauper children. Those chosen by the manufacturer were then conveyed by waggons or canal boats to their destination, and from that moment were doomed to slavery. Sometimes regular traffickers would take the place of the manufacturer, and transfer a number of children to a factory district, and there keep them, generally in some tralia, that has developed trade unionism, dark cellar, t ill they could hand them over to a mill-owner in want of hands, who would come and examine their height, strength, and bodily capacities, exactly as did the slave dealers in the American markets. After that the children were simply at the mercy of their owners, nominally as apprentices, but in reality as mereslaves, who got no wages, and whom it was not worthwhile even to feed or clothe properly, because they were so cheap and their places could be so easily supplied . . . . Children were often worked sixteen hours a day, by day and by night. Even Sunday was used as a convenient time to clean the machinery. . . . They were fed upon the coarsest and cheapest food, often with the same as that served out to the pigs of their master. They slept by turns and in relays in filthy beds, whic(i were never cool,; , for one set of children were sent to sleep in them ns soon os the others had gone off to their daily or nightly toil. There was often no discrimination of the sexes; and disease, misery, and vice grew as in a hot-bed of contagion. . . . The catalogue of cruelty and misery is too long to recite here; it may be read in the Memoirs of Robert Blincoe, himself an apprentice, or in the pages of the Blue Boohs of the beginning of the century, in which even the methodical dry official language is startled into life by the misery it has to relate . . . During the whole of the period of 1800 to 1820, and even to 1840, the result of their sufferings was seen in the early death of the majority of the children, and in the crippled and distorted forms of the majority of those who survived. On the women and grown-up girls the effects of long hours and wearisome work were equally disastrous. Even adult men were treated as mere chattels. Under what was known as the Boundsman system, "" t h e Parish sold pauper labour to the occupiers of property at a certain low price, and made up the difference between that and the scale allowance. Sometimes the paupers were sold to the farmers at auction. At Yardley, Hastings, e.g., all the unemployed men were put up to sale weekly, and the clergyman on one occasionsaw a lot of ten men knocked down to one of the farmers for 5s. That is an extract from the report of the Royal Commission on Poor Laws in 1834. Well might Southey say, in a letter written in March, 1833, that "" the slave trade is mercy compared to it."" That is a picture of a condition of things from which, I am sure, honourable members on the Government side recoil with horror equally as much as we do. They are quite willing to dissociate themselves from anything of that character, and I would not for a moment say that any member on the Government side believes in conditions of labour such as are there pictured. But it was those conditions that brought about the movement in Great Britain, and has startled the movement into life in Austhat great principle of comradeship, that exhibition of fraternity which is surely as great and grand as the world has yet seen. I cannot forget that from early ages, before the dawn of the Christian era, the workers of the world were banded together in indissoluble unions so strong, so effective, and so secure in their foundations, that no Avorkmen in any craft, and no man who had to associate Avith his friends, or AVIIO Avas performing labour in the same calling as other men, Avas outside a union. to the state;-of the House.

509,Mr Eenton,"I beg to call attentionThe honorahle member for Gippsland, when you, sir, ordered that the bells should be rang, expressed pleasure that he was relieved for the present of what he was pleased to call ""this clatter."" I object to that word, and desire that it be withdrawn. ledge of what thc remark applied to, but the honourable member for Brisbane did not take exception to it. I do not know whether the remark applied to the honourable member who was speaking or to the ringing of the bells, but the word itself is not disorderly, unless it had an offensive application to an honourable member. show that the workers were forced, by the unfortunate condition in which they were placed in the earlier days of the industrial movement, to band themselves into unions, and it is well known to every honourable member that unionism, even at that stage, partook of a very strong political character. In the objections of honourable members on the Government side, and their supporters generally, have expressed, stress is laid upon the fact that the unionism of to-day is political, and therefore preference should not be granted to it. I desire to point out that the workers themselves were forced into political action. It was because the laws of the country were so shockingly opposed to the trade unions, and to their having any privileges or recognition, that the workers were at one time forced to abandon their unions, and later on to seek to obtain redress by parliamentary action. Honourable members will remember well how, on the introduction of machinery, and the consequent displacement of very large numbers of Avorkmen, very regrettable riots took place, notably the "" L u d d it e "" riots in 1811 and 1816,'when the Avorkers reA'olted against the introduction of machinery, and thought that by smashing the machinery they Avould improve their employment. They learned better as years Avent on, and on page 65 Carter saysThroughout these years there were constant appeals to Parliament by the operatives to sustain their rates of wages, enforce the legal restrictions of tbe number of apprentices, or prohibit certain kinds of machinery. The appeals were founded on long established custom, tor from the sixteenth century Parliament had regulated wages and conditions of employment, or empowered Quarter Sessions to do so locally. But, in face of the Industrial Revolution, Parliament stood perplexed. The problem was unprecedented. The wage-earners' standard of life was confessedly degraded. Mediaeval trade laws, framed for the hand-working age, clearly needed revision in an age of machine labour. Parliament/ instead of helping the workers by its acts, hindered them, an'd shattered their hopes. Carter finishes a very interesting chapter by sayingI t was in these circumstances that the toilers -lef t to work out their own salvation-dre w together, developed organizations of defence, and the modern trade union movement was born. Rioting was f u t i l e; Parliament would not help; the workers must help themselves. For many years the workers had to depend on their OAvn organizations, but in those years those infamous combination laws were introduced, and the workers Avho had been denied proper wages and conditions Avere also denied the right to form unions and to secure those benefits which they ought to have obtained by combination and associative effort. On the other hand, the employers Avere well assisted in every possible direction by those very same laws. I could quote one or two rather striking illustrations of that fact. Laws in favour of the unions were quite unknown, but laws in favour of the employers were very strong indeed, and the consequence Avas that men were often compelled to abandon their unions, simply because they were unable to stand up against the law. I may later on quote a passage which gives several instances of men who, for infinitesimal offences against the law, aud simply because they were unionists and demanded rights in virtue of their unionism, Avere cruelly treated by the laws of their country. To show how the unions were treated at that time, and hoAv closely related the proposals of the Government, in Australia to-day are to those now effete and discredited laws, let me read the following passage to honourable members. On page 74 Carter says' The following is the actual wording of the ""Document"" which ironmoulders were asked? to sign during the period following the great engineers' strike, to which reference is made on a later page :Declaration made by the undersigned on engaging in the employment of .

In the first place, the Government proposal has been accepted as a challenge on the whole principle of preference to unionists generally. It has been said by the Government that it is a challenge. In the second place, the Commonwealth has already in its employment a very large number of workmen, following various callings, and many of these belong to unions which demand certain rates of pay, irrespective of what may be the opinion of the Government of the day, since they are working under the awards of Wages Boards or of Arbitration Courts. what may or may not have been generally admitted by the Government does not affect the terins of the motion; but the honourable member w ill be in order in discussing the question on the lines of the second point raised by him. ment are going to prohibit preference to I would remind the unionists, what w ill be the position when the Commonwealth employs a still larger niunber of these men? If , for instance, an award of the Arbitration Court provides for certain rates of wages to builders' labourers, then, in employing such men, the Government must observe that award, since the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been granted by this Parliament power to provide for preThe honourable ference to unionists. If this motion were passed, or if the amendment were rejected, it w ould mean that the men, in T such circumstances, would either have to face immediate dismissal, or leave their unions. The second alternative is what the Government would probably invite, I am trying to keep within the and it is that very danger that causes us The proposed to oppose the B ill . My opposition is due, not to any desire to delay business, but to the fact that we are here up against the principle, the policy, and the I am trying to platform of our party. We must fight this B ill by every possible means. The Government need be under no misapprehension. We are standing in the direct line of succession to men who, in the Old Countryi n days gone by, had to fight, and many of whom had to suffer, and even die, for the very principles for which we are fighting to-day.

Mr Badger and Mr Wilcox frankly that they have tried to prevent among their men; and I have no difficulty in finding that tliey have granted privileges, benefits, attractions of all sorts, to men to retire from thc union, and that they have encouraged and bolstered up rival unions -what, thu men call the ""company's -in order to injure the men's union. "" Company's union "" is a name which, as one of the ""company's union"" members told me in evidence, is given by thc men because thoy reckon the company ""gives us good things which the men's union does not get."" There is no doubt a bitter feeling between the two bodies. Melbourne, the company's union has about 70 members; the men's union, in spite of the company's antagonism, has over 1,500 in the Melbourne gross revenue of the company's union subscriptions of the members is about £42 per annum, and all the rest of the comes from outside donations. be no rivalry of unions, and little or no friction, if the men were left to themselves. company's union could not last but for the company's coddling. ing of a rival union, tins encouragement of its members and discouragement bers of the other union, is the root of such bitterness could easily get rid of the bitterness by ceasing to bestow exceptional favours on the company's union. The badge is not to blame. The word ""intimidation"" to what the companies have done than to the as he admits-dismissed tempting to form a union; but he reinstated them on the condition that they would drop the idea. The tramway men in Brisbane en-' joyed the use of a recreation hall, which they much prized; but when Mr Badger formed his company's union, he handed the hall over to it, and forbade the others to enter. From the point of view of thc companies, the endeavours to stifle unionism may seem justifiable; from the' point of view of this Court the endeavours cannot be treated as legitimate or reasonable. this Court expressly sanctions and encourages unions. "" chief objects"" .of the Act is to "" facilitate Mr Finlayson.

The system of arbitration would be unworkable without organized unions; and it is my duty to carry out the Act and to give effect to the w ill of Parliament. I would emphasize the point that the provision in the Conciliation and A r b it r a federated tion Actf o r preference to unionists was In the case of Adelaide, the posideliberately inserted, as Mr JusticeH i g formation gins said, as a guarantee of industrial It is the old device-first peace.

Therefore, the leaders on both sides have every inducement to t r y to arrive at an honourable arrangement. Isi t too much that we are asking that the subject of preference to unionists in Government employment shall be submitted to a conference of leaders? There may be reasons which appear satisfactory to Government supporters for not giving preference to employees in the Government service; but not only is preference to unionists accepted in every country in. the world, but in some countries unionism is enforced by law. That is bome out by this extractThe following clause with regard to preference to unionists has been placed in the .schedule of the recently given award in the Nelson Tailor and Tailoresses case in the New Zealand Arbitration Court, before Judge Sim :-It shall be the duty of every employer, when engaging a worker, to ascertain whether he or she is a member of the union; and if -he or she is not a member of the union, the employer shall notify the secretary of the union accordingly within seven days of the date of engaging such worker. It shall be the duty of every non-unionist engaged as aforesaid to join the union within seven days after receiving from the secretary of the union a request in writing to do so. It shall be the duty of every non-unionist employed in the trade at the date of the coming into operation of this -award to become a member of the union within fourteen days of such date. Non-compliance with any of the above-mentioned provisions shall constitute a breach of award. No employer shall place any obstacle in the way of any representative of the workers' union in the collection of moneys due; provided that the collection shall not take place in any work-room oftener than onoe a fortnight, and that a representative of the union sball obtain permission from the employer previously to visiting such work-room.

That demand is not ""Why go on with busibased on any question of unfairness I s there no or prejudice, but on the recognition of out? We say that there is. the solid and incontrovertible fact that men and women have joined trade unions to better their conditions, to improve their opportunities, and to secure higher wages. It. is not more than ordinary justice that those whose efforts have gained the advantages which have come from organization should be permitted to enjoy them. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and one cannot speak on these matters without being reminded of the statement of the Prime Minister that the non-unionists are skulkers, and act unfairly towards their fellows. The proposal of the Government is to declare by Statute that preference to unionists shall not be allowed in Government employment. There would be less objection to such a declaration by Executive minute. A f t e r this Government took office, no one was alarmed when they abolished, by administrative act, preference to unionists in Government employment. That was expected, and it may be safely predicted that if the Labour party again get3 control of Commonwealth affairs preference to unionists w ill be recognised again. We shall recognise all the time, and every time, the unions that are recognised officially, and registered under the laws that we have passed. The proposed B ill aims a blow at a statutory provision, but does so indirectly and unfairly. If the Government earnestly desire to abolish preference to unionists in Government employment aud elsewhere, we are ready to debate the question with them in connection with an amendment of the. Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Governments of nearly every country in the world have repeatedly tried to discourage and to destroy the work of the trade unions. A Commission was appointed in Great Brita in to inquire into the subject generally, and the Rev. Henry Carter, at When thc reports of the Commissions were unionism than had been anticipated. A mawent farther, and recommended that "" All laws affecting contracts for labour as a crime if it were not criminal in itself."" Legal protection was also accorded to union funds. That was very little protection to the trade unionistsThe Times said "" True statesmanship will neither cease to augment nor to reduce their (tha unions) influence; but, accepting it as a fact, will give it free scope for legal development."" But the Government Bills, which followed in 1871, took away with one hand as much as they gave with the other. The good points of the minority report were conceded, but "" peaceful picketing "" in support of a strike, even by a single person, was definitely declared criminal. A storm of protest arose, but unavailingly, and the Bills quickly became law. Then follow some of the most disgraceful records in the Old Countryi n connection w i th this matterSeven women were imprisoned in South Wales merely for saying ""bah "" to a ""blackleg."" In 1872, a number of London gas-stokers were dismissed for complicity in a strike; others who refused to work until their mates were taken on again were prosecuted, and sentenced to twelve montlis' imprisonment. On page 101 reference is made to the decision of the House of Lordsi n the Taffvale Railway Casei n 1901By this decision the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants were held responsible for the unlawful acts of certain of its members during a strike in South Wales, and the Taffvale Railway Company obtained £23,000 damages against the society. the connection w it h the amendment. prohibit preference to unionists in Government employment is a political move, and I am showing that it is in line with what has been done by the Imperial Government In Great Britain an attempt was made to prohibit unionism in connection with any employment. This Government, by the necessities of the case, is forced to propose the prohibition of preference to unionists only in Government employment. If Ministers are opposed entirely to preference to unionists, there is an honest, legitimate, and reasonable way of putting forward their views. What is now proposed w ill not do what is desired, but w ill breed no end of difficulties and trouble in the Government service. A large number now are, and in the future a much larger number w ill be, members of unions, and may be working under awards of the Courts which the Government w ill have to recognise. If these awards impose preference to unionists, in what position w ill the Government be? This attempt to prohibit preference to unionists will excitethe worse passions of the community, and w ill breed more indust r i a l strife than we have known im any period of our industrial history. When addressing the House previously on the original motion, I made referenceto this point; and I am so impressed with the dangers of industrial disputes and industrial strife that I am supporting this, amendment in the belief that it offers a. reasonable, legitimate, and proper w a y out of the difficulty. We do not desirestrife-w e do not desire industrial war. The history of the whole trades union movement is 'characterized by one factmore than any other, and that is, that those concerned have always sought, by every possible means, to establish harmonious relations w i th the employers. That they have not been able to do so ist not their fault, and that they have had to fight is possibly their misfortune ir* soine directions; but all this has certainly educated the workers of the world in the knowledge that, while they mayrely to a large extent on their own. powers of organization to secure certain benefits that they legitimately desire, and are honorably entitled to, there is a power in their hands that. they must use, and that they are in I am unable to see creasingly using in every country in the world, namely, the power of Parliament to protect them in the enjoyment of t h e i r rights. TheB ill seeks to defeat that very purpose, and the amendment is an effort to avoid strife and disorder-that industrial upheaval which this proposal of the Government, if persevered in , is sureto bring about. The words used in the amendment are "" in order to effectively legislate "" ; and it is impossible to so legislate if the Government are going to be adamant in their opposition. If the Government have only one idea, and are not open to argument-if their minda are thoroughly made up to fight this question by every means at their disposal, and if they are prepared to set in motion the whole electoral machinery, and put the country toa cost of anything from £60,000 to £80,000, in order to establish this principle-the y must accept the responsibility for all that may follow.

524,Mr Ernxayson,"-This attempt to the people generally, will be divided by a very Sharp line of cleavage and demarcation. There is no doubt that by this proposal the people of the country will be split into two antagonistic sections. Here we are, trying by means of conciliation and arbitration to bring about a better and a saner understanding between employer and employed, and yet the Government's proposal is to antagonize them and to create enmity; industrial peace is on their lips, but war is in their hearts. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, perhaps better than any other honourable member on his side, knows that if the principle of preference in Government employ, and trades unionism, were recognised, he would be saved any amoiuit of trouble, because then he could deal directly with bodies instead of being irrithey have not said when. I suptated by irresponsible individuals. The honourable member is thoroughly aware that it is much easier to deal with an organization than with separate persons. We desire even more than the Government do to deal with this question of preference to unionists, because it is one in regard to which we are in deadly earnest, as meaning our very bread and butter. Indeed, it is a matter of death and life; politically it is our breath, and industrially it is our living. We demand that in this connection there shall be no unnecessary cleavage in the community. There is so much possibility of improvement, socially and industrially, that one regrets that such questions as these should be unnecessarily obtruded; and I hope that even yet the Government will see that the amendment is not in any way unfair or unreasonable, but an honest desire to promote peace in the community. a.m.] I should have been gratified if the Attorney-General had softened somewhat to the appeal made to him from this side, and had accepted the amendment as a way out of the ridiculous position in which he has placed, not only the House, but the country, in submitting the Bill. There is no doubt that this measure requires the fullest investigation; and the policy of the Government throughout its short reign has been to delegate-to Boards, Royal Commissions, or Select Committees anything and everything they did not understand. I may say that if the Government continue to remit to such bodies all questions they do not understand, we shall soon have nothing but roving Commissions all over the country. We were told that, in order to understand what the Tariff is, and what amendments are necessary, it was necessary to send it to the Inter-State Commission. terrupt the honourable member, but I see nothing in the amendment relating to the Tariff. this as an illustration, and pointing out that in the case of the Tariff, the Government deemed it necessary to have it fully investigated by the Inter-State Commission, in order that they might at some time arrive at a solution, though pose that, so long as a solution is arrived at some time, the Government will be satisfied to wait.' Then, again, there is the Electoral Commission, although this body found nothing to inquire into. Everything was proved to be all right; but it was necessary to have an inquiry in order to remove the stigma placed on the Government by the charges they had heaped on the heads of members on this side. Another matter that puzzled the Government, though it did not puzzle many other people, was that involved in the question of whether powellised sleepers could be demolished by the white ants. tention of the honourable member to the fact that he is not dealing with the amendment. the Government should accept the amendment. Inasmuch as this course has been adopted in all the cases I have mentioned, and in other cases in which they failed to find guidance in their own intelligence, we ask them to submit this Bill to a Select Committee. The Attorney-General, in his last public statement, said that this Bill would mean giving preference only to men in the Public Service who are not provided for by Statute. I observe, however, that the honourable gentleman's leader does not wholly agree with him, and told the House that when the Government policy was disclosed it would be by the head of the Government, and not, I suppose, by the ""head"" that has",75,Chapman Nasty Member Address Himself To The Question

529,Mr Webster,"I wish to show whycontrolled the Government so long. However, we wish to know whether the statement made represents a fact or not. How many men in the Service are provided for by the Public Service Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration .Act, and so forth? It is essential that these facts should be known, in order that the public may not be wholly deceived; and the Select Committee would give us those facts on sworn testimony, and Ave should then have tangible grounds on which to proceed. We might also be able to discover how many of-even the casuals in the Government employ were already in unions enjoying preference to unionists. should know how many of them are not under the obligation to respect preference to unionists, not only in regard to casual workers, but also in regard to those who should be encouraged to join unions, and so bring about that contentment and that measure of justice that should exist betAveen employers and employees. lieve that investigation would show that under the present conditions not more than 200 of those engaged by the Government would come under the operation of the Bill. Clearly, therefore, it is a waste of time discussing measures, having before us merely imaginary conclusions, statements not borne out by facts, and figures that cannot be supported. is no justification for the Bill until, at any rate, a thorough investigation has been held. On all otlier matters the Government have not only agreed to, but have initiated, similar inquiries, with the alleged object of getting information to guide them. It is possible that a Select Committee would inquire as to the effect of preference to unionists on the general welfare of the Commonwealth, as to whether the action the Government propose to take Avould improve public affairs, and as to Avhether the Government would run the risk of disorganizing the whole business of the continent. also ascertain Avhether the Government are prepared to do what no private employer is prepared to do; that is, to gather a host of unemployed who are not members of unions, and who are the least capable tradesmen and give the least valuable return for the money paid to them. We are entitled to ascertain what good will emanate from giving leave to introMr Webster. duce the Bill. No doubt investigation by u Select Committee Avould divulge astate of affairs that would put au end to the action of the Government. The only reason for the attitude of the Government toAvards the amendment is that they fear the result of the information that Avoulct be secured by a Committee of inquiry.. The Committee would necessarily extend its inquiries in order to investigate the effect of preference to unionists in all occupations, and Avould make inquiries of men having the experience of union and non-union labour. If evidence was called from firms employing large numbers of We men, it would be found that in most casesthe doctrine of the Government would not be tolerated for five minutes. The bulk of employers know the value of unionism, to which preference to unionists is thenatural corollary. But the GoA^ernment burke inquiry. They know that an in vestigation would enable the people toI beunderstand the position without difficulty. I have been an employer and an employee. As an employee I always felt that I Avas. happier working amongst a body of men who had signed the same bond as myself,, and who contributed to the same union.

A Committee would fully expose the Bill as a mere scarecrow, and the Government for all timewould be known as the Scarecrow Ministry. And rightly so because measures-' L of this character that have no foundation, that are merely shadows and myths, in troduced for the purpose of deceiving the people, are exposed at once Avhen thelight of inquiry is throAvn upon them. They could The GoA ernmeni will, as a result, be comr pelled to withdraw this measure in disgust at the puny effort they have made to carry out the business of the country. around them For many years there was no organization Avithin the Public Sendee, and at that time there-Avas nothing but continued discontent. No Postmaster-General, either under the State regime, or under that of the Commonwealth, had any possible chance of doing justice to his 0 Government Preference Department, faction to himself. of every man for himself, and each man cutting the other's throat. selfishness and inhumanity were evidentall the time, and Ministers were worn out listening to appeals, not from a body of men, but from individuals^ complaints were the result of the lack of organization in the Federal Service; but since the law has recognised organization, and granted the right of those in the Federal Service to go to the Arbitration Court, the Commonwealth employees have banded themselves into organizations for their common benefit. I guarantee that the files w ill show a very different state of affairs from the .times gone by, when Postmasters-General and members of Parliament were worried from Monday morning t ill Saturday night, and tortured by individual complaints and troubles that used to come to hand by every mail. That sort of thing went on, and I know that since organization has taken place in the Department the Government, by reason of their law, have encouraged men to join organizations for the purpose of appealing to the Court. And I would remind honourable members that the men cannot appeal to the Court unless they are organized; individual workers cannot appeal to the Court. If the Government were to succeed in introducing non-preference in the Government service, even amongst the casual employees, they would immediately undermine the advantages gained by the unionists in that Service, and, by so undermining them, would gradually substitute non-union labour, and bring discontent into other branches, where at present organization is a safetyvalve. orary Minister changed his mind. spoke very eloquently upon this subject on one occasion. ister Bas proved by every action since he has been a Minister that he knows very little about these things, and the more he tries to do the more he falls in the esteem of his colleagues and of the country.

We want to ascertain by means of this The Select Committee how many men w ill be affected by the proposed B ill , how many among the casual employees are enjoying preference to-day, what unions they beIndividual long to, how many non-unionists are in the Government service to-day, and what changes the Government have made in the conditions that prevailed when their predecessors controlled the affairs of the country. The only method of discovering those things is by an independent in quiry,' not only into the preference which has existed in the Commonwealth service, but also into the inroads which the Government have made in that preference, and the intentions of the Government in substituting non-preference for preference. The' Committee would also report as to whether the Government proposals would be beneficial to the Public Service of the Commonwealth. against you, would you object to it? ber cannot honorably object to an inquiry of this nature, seeing that he has already acquiesced in the appointment of Royal Commissions, which are to-day inquiring into other matters. If it was thought necessary to appoint Commissions to in vestigate the powellising of timber, the Tariff, and electoral matters, it is ten times more necessary that this question of preference to unionists should be submitted to a Committee, so that we may be able to feel certain of the effect which the Government B ill will have on the men working in the Service. We want to know to what extent the Government's proposals are likely to bring about disintegration in the Service, which has worked I wonder why the Honmore harmoniously, successfully, and He satisfactorily lately than at any time since I have been a member of this Parliament.

There was an attempt at organization, but there was no direct gain likely to come from it , because, in days gone by, most of tlie men appointed to the Postal Department were appointed by reason of political influence, and they had been taught to rely upon the influence and recommendation of individual members of Parliament to get them into the Service, irrespective of qualifications oftentimes, and to secure them promotion, -whether merited or unmerited. happens to-day that, through lack of a system to recognise the value of unionism, and gained by united effort, the Public Service is still encumbered lot of worthless and hopeless men, who never have earned, and never will earn, the money that is being paid to them, under a system that gave them promotion by seniority and social influence rather than by merit. That is the result of freedom of contract, individual effort, and political influence bordering on corrupt i o n ; aye, worse than corruption, because it undermined the value and efliciency of the Service. The day came when the Public Service realized that there was something in being united, and to-day those meu having discovered t h a t , by united effort, they could u p l if t each other, whereas by individual effort they often dragged each other down, the tide in favour of organization is rising faster even than does the tide in the Northern Territory.

The whole policy of the Department is practically that of preference to unionists. The only section of the Service to which that policy does not apply is one which, if we are to believe the Government, does not actually exist to-day. We ask for an inquiry to ascertain, amongst other things, whether or not it does exist. What have tEe Government done in other matters in regard to'which they needed enlightenment?

593,Mr Anstey,"The Attorney-General means of existence?dorse tlie action of Ministers, and prove how If the Government desired to secure adequate information they would be only too anxious to have a Select Committee appointed so as to secure all possible evidence in order to justify to the country i the enforcement of this measure. Everybody knows that the late Government were accused of giving spoils to the victors in all shapes and forms. It was said that all good positions in the Government service were given to friends of Labour Ministers, and those friends in t u r n gave preference to others who had been politically and industrially associated with them. A t the Cotter River a large number of men are employed, and if a Select Committee were appointed they might elicit information which would enable the Government to expose to the country the iniquities committed by the Labour party -when they were in power. are, at the woollen mills, men who were appointed by the Labour Government, and to whom preference was given, to the exclusion of non-unionists and free labourers who were not given a chance. The Committee could take evidence there, and what a tremendous illustration that would be of the tyranny of the Labour party! Would that not be a justification for the Attorney-General, in his fine flights of oratory about upholding the equality of all citizens before the law and the liberty of the citizens? Why should the honourable member not avail himself of all the opportunities which the prerogatives of the Chamber give him to secure all the information that is at hand? The honourable member»could carry the country by sheer weight of evidence, instead of having to depend on the mere generalities which he indulges in at present. Crib Point there are naval works where hundreds of men and bosses, appointed by the late Government, are employed. There, again, the Committee could take evidence. In fact, the world is f u l l of possibilities, and if a Committee were appointed supply us with a wealth of facts. Instead of one party and the denials of the other, would it not be better to have before a Select Committee witnesses who would give their evidence upon oath and whose words would be recorded in black and white ? A t Crib Point there is a clothing factory in connection with which the Labour Government are charged strong their case is ? with having appointed officers because of their political and industrial association with the Labour party. Surely amongst all the girls and men employed at the factory there is a wealth of evidence lying to the Government's hands. From the clothing factory the Committee could pass on to the small arms factory, then to the cordite factory, and so on, from point to point, and place to place. Having done their work in Victoria and New South Wales, the Committee could pass on to South Australia, proceed to Port Augusta and ascertain what injustices have been done in connection with the transcontinental line. Afterwards they could travel by boat to Western Australia to examine the post-office site in Perth, pass on to Kalgoorlie and take all the evidence they could possibly secure there, proceed round the coast to Port Darwin, and go Then there down the Katherine River, and on to Alice Springs, and miss not a single chance of taking evidence. The Committee might even examine the native races of the Northern Territory. Upon the evidence thus secured and submitted to the House we could proceed to legislate. If the Committee had not time to complete their labours before the end of the session, the Standing Orders would permit of their continuing their operations by order of the House. The work of a Committee travelling from one part of Australia to another in the manner I have described would be invaluable, because its opportunities would not be restricted to the one matter of preference to unionists. It could not travel from State to State without observing many things that might be of advantage, and the intellectual standard of the House would be enhanced. Members At of the Committee would come back with a wider vision, and we should all be gainers by the increased information which would be at our disposal. NowI come to the composition of the Committee. The Committee should, of course, comprise men of unqualified judgment, men who are able it would unquestionably to rise above party bias, men of honour and understanding. It would necessarily of having the affirmations follow that there would be some members who would be excluded. I would not make the Committee too large; but, at the same time, I would not exclude any member who wished to sit on it , so that if the Committee were large enough the amount of information that would be gathered in the course of its travels would increase from day to day. his Law and Practice of Legislative Assemblies, tells us thatThe appointment of a few members, selected from the whole body, for the performance cf some particular duty, furnishes so obvious and convenient a means of facilitating the transaction of business, in a legislative body, or other deliberative Assembly, that it would be strange not to find the employment of committees a common practice in both branches of .Parliament from the earliest period. Accordingly in the most ancient of the Journals of the Commons, which are now extant, and as early as the year 1.554, there are entries of the terests at stake that the Housei n its wisappointment of committees. It is remarkable that the first Select Committee of which there is any record was appointed as the result of an amendment to a motion for leave to introduce a Bill. That was in 3554. I find that, there was a Bill to avoid counterfeit steel; a Bill against the shooting of gags, that might have been; a Bill again3t tbe unlawful assembling of masterless and a Bill for avoiding sand out of the sea. In the first case, my Lord Willoughby laid out the Duke of Suffolk, who, with fifty-two others, was charged high treason, and the whole of thorn finally lost their heads.

There are Bills which it is absolutely necessary to refer to a Select Committee in order that a matured judgment may he brought to bear upon them. On the 9th May, 1816, Castlereagh moved for leave to introduce a B ill to repeal duties on leather. An amendment was moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to report to the House. The Government, when introducing that measure, should have been in a position to go right on; but there were such big in dom decided that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee. All the authorities go to show that the amendment in this case should be carried. If it were, other important measures which the Government say they desire to bring on could be dealt w it h at once. That being whatever so, we are really trying to assist the Government when we say that men, instead of arguing this question until doomsday we should refer it to a Select Committee for investigation and report, so that in the meantime with proposals for dealing w it h the financial situation, which the Government say must claim our consideration, may, together with other measures, be brought forward. wished We do not know what the decision of the Select Committee would be. It might, propose to enlarge the scope of the B ill ; The on the other hand, it might propose toMy Lord modify it .

The Select Committee would take evidence from members of Parliament and employers and employees of every kind, and would not l i m it its investigations to Australia.

The only limitations to the field of investigation in indus. trial, social, and political matters are the limits of the globe itself. Time was, and not very long ago, when means of communication, and means of transport, were exceedingly limited, and the information available to people in every part of the world made evidence, if it could be got, of very littl e value. To-day we are privileged creatures compared with people who lived previously. Every happening in any continent or in the young Dominions of the southern seas is immediately made available by cable, and subsequently by more detailed communication to the newspapers or by letters to individuals, and it is not a wise Government nor a perfectly shrewd people who would carry out a policy of their own with insufficient information.

If we desire to find out where the main question is, we may find it on turning to a statement of the Ministerial policy presented by the Prime Minister, and ordered to be printed, on the 12th August, 1913. In the sub-clause of paragraph 2, it is stated that it was proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of whose funds were directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes; and also to restore the exemption of rural workers from the operations of the Act, believing that the ought to be l e f t for determination by the States. It will be remembered that the new Government, which came into power in July, had no policy, and that the House was adjourned for a mouth to enable them to construct one.

The very thing which was However, there are accomplished on the 12th August, 1913, is now detaining the House, at half-past 4 o'clock in the morning, in May, 1914.

Do honourable members suppose that our intelligence is to be in sulted with impunity ? Are we doing anything less than our duty in fighting the proposal at every stage?

Men are not allowed to experiment on the lives and bodies of others without having given a guarantee of possessing certain skill to do the work. But that does not touch the question of unionism. When the necessary amount of skill has been acquired, and qualifications have been granted, and doctors, chemists, lawyers, dentists, or artisans, whoever they are-it is perfectly immaterial, the principle is the same throughout-ente r upon the practice of their professions or the work of their trades, we reach the question of unionism, and we find doctors' unions and lawyers' unions in existence. the analogy between the doctor or lawyer and the worker. to show the honourable member the complete analogy.

But the principle is precisely the same, whether we are dealing with a profession or a trade. A man acquires a certain amount of skill to do the work his calling requires, and having been qualified to do the work, he enters into comradeship w it h others engaged in the profession or trade, and naturally unions are formed. Some of the strongest unions are the barristers' union and the medical union. I do not think I have ever heard of stronger steps taken on behalf of a union than those taken by the Medical Association in respect to what they quite My candidly call ""blacklegs"" in the profession.

His admission throws a flood of light upon the abandonment of -every line of the Government's policy iu this regard. Ministers cannot proceed with their policy in regard to preference to unionists, because their own party evidently will not stick together in order to out it on the statute-book. Otherwise they would have gagged it through the Chamber. The honourable member for Nepean made it perfectly clear that the Ministerial party are not solid on the question, -and it is very likely that this is -one reason-thoug h by no means a sufficient excuse-wh y the policy of the Government in this matter was abandoned. The crux of the. whole question is political unionism. It is admitted reluctantly-the admission has been dragged from honourable members opposite-that preference is denied only where the funds of unions are devoted to political purposes. In the enlightened twentieth century, what is wrong with the exercise -of one's political rights? person be penalized for exercising political rights in the way he thinks proper? A man is to be penalized because he chooses to use his money in the way he thinks best within the law in order to promote his own interests. I can tell honourable members what is wrong about it. These political purposes have been employed by unionists against honourable members opXjosite. Unionists have thought fit to support the radical Labour party, and, of course, they must be penalized, and have the law of the land directed against them. This seems to me to be pretty hot preference. we are driven to it reluctantly, but it is on our programme, and we shall stand by it ; but there is to be no preference where you use your funds in a certain way."" In other words, if unionists vote for the opposite party their political rights will be shorn away. did iu regard to the postal vote. member sees the logic of the position, and it is of no use his drawing a ""red herring"" across the matter at issue.

Then honourable members prattle about justice, fairness, and liberty, and about equality to all classes. The matter has only to be honestly examined to show the utter falsity of the position, and how illogical the Government are in regard to the general question of preference to unionists. I shall say little in regard to the exemption of rural workers from the operation of the Arbitration Act, on the ground that the matter should be left to the States, except that the States have had a chance to deal with the matter for fifty years, and have done nothing. It suits the Government to talk about "" restoring the exemption.""

The idea is that this B ill w ill weaken the hands of unionists, and the Government are prepared in every way to destroy the prospects of the unions, although, as they and their supporters must agree, it is the unionists who have brought Ministers, when they address about the great march of progress in Australia to-day.

Many supporters of the Government, and some members of the Government themselves, were instrumental in creating the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, with the object of preventing industrial strife; and this, of course, was a move in the direction of practical preference, seeing that no one outside a union has any chance of obtaining an award. The Arbitration Court has^ done much to improve the conditions of the workers; and the Prime Minister, who assisted in bringing about that piece of industrial legislation, must realize that, in order to obtain the best results, every one employed by the Govermnent should be a unionist, and as a unionist have preference. The only reason that the Government oppose preference is that the vested interests they represent in this House are deadly in their antagonism to it, and they are anxious to satisfy this A gas-stoker, for instance, has to work in extreme heat under the most trying circumstances, and he may find the small pittance of 8s. or 10s. a day insufficient for the support of his family in anything like decent comfort.

It is not permissible for an honourable member to wander about and deal with matters not germane to the question before us. ib will be necessary for the Government to employ many thousands of men on railway and other large public works; and, without preference, they will find it, perhaps, absolutely impossible to obtain the necessary labour. If they do attempt to employ non-unionists, trouble will immediately arise. The unions of Australia have done much for the industrial peace of the world, and, unless the Government are willing to assist those unions in maintaining that peace, we can only come to the conclusion that they are anxious to create unrest. Whether that be part of their policy, it is hard for me to say; but I think they will recognise that they must employ only members of unions.

In the Brisbane tramway trouble we have a case in which non-unionists benefited considerably through the funds and efforts of the unionists. the better conditions awarded to the Brisbane tramway men were brought about by the unionists who took part in that memorable strike of 1912, when they lost their positions through the action of the Government of Queensland in assisting the strike-breakers. driven and conducted by men who are receiving up to 12s. and 13s. a day, as compared with 6s. 6d. a day, which was paid to the unionists, who lost their positions, and were replaced by non-unionists, who are enjoying the benefits obtained from the Arbitration Court. case in which the Arbitration Court has awarded preference to unionists. ber is not in order in proceeding on those lines. men in Australia who try to lead people to believe that they are a union.

H a d the Government not taken the precaution to guard If he w ill not connect his remarks against anything that might affect the unionists employed on those tunnels undoubtedly trouble would have arisen. Those are reasons why the Government should support this amendment, so that they might get these men into the organizations,.

790,Mr Mcdonald.,"Suppose they were to take up the Syndicalist attitude, practise sabotage, as it is never be made good. We all remember sometimes practised in France, and put all the letters into the wrong bags, or were to strike because non-unionists were amongst them, there would be such a state of chaos as it is almost impossible for the human mind to conceive. And that disastrous result would be brought about simply because the Government would not accept an amendment of this kind. No member of the Government is in a better position than is the Treasurer to gauge the consequences that would follow such occurrences as those t'o which I have referred. I wish now to come back to the point as to what would happen if what I may describe as a collective strike on the part of Commonwealth servants took place. If , as the result of the employment of non-unionists in any branch of the Public Service, a strike took place public servants in other departments might come out in sympathy with them. Ninety per cent, of the public servants of the Commonwealth might be involved, and the whole of the instrumentalities of government paralyzed. merely drawing on my imagination, for it is not very long since the Commonwealth was nearly overtaken by such a disaster. It is our duty, and particularly the duty of the Attorney-General, who seems to have made the control of the Public Service his especial care, to take steps to avert such a calamity. The amendment proposed by us would obviate anything of the kind, and it is deserving of very serious consideration. The Government should accept the amendment, and so compel all employed by the Commonwealth to join an organization. Under the Conciliation and Arbitration (Public Service) Act. which was passed a little while ago, we required public servants, in the .event of any dispute arising, to go to the Court for a settlement of their troubles, and we can. hope to make compulsory arbitration in relation to Government employment effective only by requiring our employees to join an organisation. Compulsory arbitration is designed to do away with strikes. Many of us regard strikes as a barbarous method for the settlement of industrial disputes. -Every strike involves an economic loss to the whole communitya loss that can the railway strike which took place in this State some years ago, and the confusion to which it gave rise. The suburban trains every day carry 140,000 passengers to and from the city, but during the railway strike these people had to get into the city as best they could in order to follow their daily avocations. Then, again, the country railway service was entirely disorganized, with the result that perishable products for consumption in the city were often not forthcoming. A t one time a serious disaster seemed probable.^ It is our bounden duty to try to prevent the recurrence of such an industrial upheaval. The raihvay strike involved, in much loss and misery, not only the strikers themselves, but thousands of others. I have known men during a strike to be walking the streets practically bare-footed, and to be living on less than 4s. per week. Imagine, for a. moment, the sufferings of their wives and children. During the progress of a strike we have seen children almost starving. We want to avoid such a thing in the future. The PublicI am not Service organizations are federated, and their ramifications are most extensive. The Victorian railway strike not only disorganized Government operations here, but affected ail the other States. As much as £200 was offered to any engine-driver, who would take a train from Melbourne to Adelaide, and yet, for a time, no one was prepared to do so. Australia has decided that compulsory conciliation and arbitration shall be adopted as a peaceful means of settling industrial troubles.' I am prepared to admit that compulsory arbitration has not done all that we should have liked it to do, even since the Act relating to the Commonwealth Public Service was passed. The intention of that Act was to remedy grievances, which were increasing too rapidly for the Public Service Commissioner to settle. While he was trying to deal with the troubles of one branch of the Service, hardship was being caused to. other branches. I think that it was a very wise thing for the Government of the day to bring the Public Service under the arbitration law. But arbitration can be successful only with proper organization. Without such organization there is bound to be trouble. pressure to bear upon isolated units in any branch of industry, and disputes arise out of the refusal of organized workers to work w i th those who are not organized. zations have not yet been made sufficiently strong that the Court has not been able to do all that is required of it . The Attorney-General has said thatHe was in favour of voluntary association in the solution of difficulties between labour and capital. They would have to find a solution of these difficulties in still greater organization, not only among labour, but among capitalists. organization that they could ever arrive at a settlement of the great question of labour and capital.

Surely the country is to be ruled by the principles of justice and equity, and by common sense. Government employment covers a, great deal of ground. In the Postal Department, there are telegraphists, letter sorters, mail hands, linemen, and men in almost every trade and calling, who would probably get preference if they were working for a private firm; and it is monstrous .that preference should be denied to them because, through accident, they have become servants of the Commonwealth. The same remarks apply to the Home Affairs Department, in which there are men of almost every calling employed. The Government, who should set an example to the community, are setting one with a vengeance in contending that what is good enough for general employers is not good -enough for them. Ministers should make some defence of their hostility towards the amendment. poses is all very well, but it is no answer to say that honourable members belong to the Conservative party, and seek to stem the tide of Democracy. -object of the Government? smashing? case if their actions will not stand the test of equity and justice. A departure from the principles of equity and justice, and the use of some subterfuge, does not say much for this Parliament and the' Government that leads it . I challenge M i nisters to show cause why they should not accept the amendment. that something should be incorporated in the measure that would have a tendency to bring about industrial peace. Preference to unionists is the high-water mark .of industrial life recognised by all unionists to-day. A previous Parliament said that, for the purpose of industrial peace, people must cease strife and industrial unrest, and must go to the Arbitratio n Court for the purpose of settling their disputes. go one step further. It may be said that the step we propose would do an injustice to the non-unionist. B ut the non-unionist 'has never made any effort for industrial peace. That is the last thing he thinks -of. He probably imagines that he can do -better without joining a union, or he may have some crank about every one being Is there a more pitiable free to do as he likes-thoug h no community permits it . The principle of the legislation passed by the previous Parliament was that, if men registered under the Arbitration Court, they must waive their right to strike. The non-unionist waives nothing. He believes in his glorious freedom, and in being able to roam wherever he pleases without any restriction; I maintain that the man who has placed himself under restriction, and recognises the value of industrial peace, is entitled to say that if he gives up the right to strike, he should be given the right to preference of employment. Can Ministers make any reply to that argu-: 'ment? It must be met, either in the House or outside. The hall-mark of success in the financial, trading, and commercial world to-day, in the industrial 'world, in the arts and sciences, and in belles-lettres, is "" U p to date.""

The position I take up is that it is essential that this amendment should be agreed to by the Government in the interests of industrial peace amongst their own employees. As the employers of a vast number of men, the Government cannot afford to trifle with the subject, and treat it with indifference and contempt. In my experience, and in the experience of honourable members on this side of the House, who have been associated with labour organizations for as long as forty years, our trouble is not in our own organization, but arises from the possibility of a sympathetic strike occurring.

827,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memCommonwealth employment preference to members of any industrial organization not registered under the laws of the Commonwealth."" It is true that the Government have given eflect to the principle underlying their proposal, hut the amendment seeks .to restrict the area of the operation of what I call this politically-evil principle. If we are not able to secure preference to unionists for the whole of the day labour employed in connection w i th our public works, we are entitled to t r y to procure the next best thing, preference to the members of organizations of workmen employed on public works if those organizations have complied with the laws of the Commonwealth, and have registered under the Arbitration Act. The amendment in no way seeks to interfere with the operation of the provisions of the Public ServiceA c t regulating ordinary admission to the Service by the test of competitive examinations; it applies to those employed on what are known as day-labour yvorks. As the amendment speaks of "" industrial organizations"" it becomes expedient to inquire what is an industrial organization. That raises the further questions-What is an industry ? and What is an industrial matter ? The Conciliation and Arbitration Act defines ""industrial matters"" in these terms""Industrial matters"" includes all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms and conditions of employment or non-employment; and in particular, but without limiting the general scope of this definition, in the Arbitratio n Act, it has been laid cludes all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employfis, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal or nonemployment of any particular persons, or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of any organization, association or body, and any claim arising under an industrial agreement, and includes all questions of what is fair and right in relation to any industrial matter having regard to the interests of the persons immediately concerned, and of society as a whole. That is a wide definition. An association and an organization are entirely different, an association being a body of persons existing outside the law which, upon registration, becomes an organization. It has been decided by the H i g h Court that a body is not an organization u n t i l it has been registered. The definition of "" in d u s t r y "" contained in the Arbitratio n Act is this"" Industry"" includes(a) any business, trade, manufacture, undqrtaking, or calling of employers on land or water; (6) any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of employees, on laud or water; and (c) a branch of an industry and a group of industries. When this measure was first brought forward we had a trained legal man at the head of the Government of the day, and it might have been supposed that the definitions which I have read would prove satisfactory. Appeals to the Court, however, have shown that what appears to be the meaning of the plain words of the Statute is not actually the meaning. The Attorney-General has stated that a union of lawyers such as the Bar Council would come w it h in the definition. Mr W. H . IEVINB D o not lawyers follow an avocation? Sitting suspended from S to 9.30 a.m. (Thursday). MrJ . H . CATTS -When the sitting was suspended, I was discussing the question of what constitutes an industry and an industrial dispute for the purpose of considering what organizations would be entitled to come within the scope of the amendment.

I think that, under down definitely that the relationship of employer and employee must exist. That decision was given, I think, in the Clancy case.

These workmen are associated together in organizations throughout Australia. I have no doubt that there are at least fifty or sixty organizations which group some classes of these workmen together. One of these very matters was raised in the judgment given in the case of the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Association. What is their position ? There are a few stationary engine-drivers connected with various industries in the Commonwealth, and with various works being carried on by the Commonwealth Government. A t the works in Canberra, and along the railway route, there are certain stationary engines operating cranes and machinery. It is necessary for us to see whether the workmen could be grouped together in an organization and registered under the Arbitration Act for the purpose of coming within the scope of a measure of this kind. The decision giver, in the Federated No t a certain organiEngine-drivers' case is rather pertinent to the question raised by the Attorney General as to whether the Bar Council of Victoria would come within that category. In deciding what "" in d u s t r y "" meant, the H i g h Court saidAn industry means an enterprise in whicb both employers and employees are associated, and does not include the vocation of persons doing a particular kind of work in connection with several different classes of such enterprises. In the case of the Bar Council, gentlemen are engaged not in any particular enterprise, but in dealing from time to time with various enterprises of the Commonwealth as a whole, and some of the litigation with which they are connected could not, I suppose, be brought within the definition of an enterprise. Quite clearly, v A discussion on the therefore, as laid down in the two cases I have cited, the Bar Council could not come within the scope of either the proposed measure or our amendment. Again, there is some difficulty in regard I desire to refer to registerable organizations. There may be a number of organizations covering the same class of workmen. Take the Amalgamated Engineers Society and the Australian Engineers Society. Both of these organizations cannot register at one and the same time under the Arbitratio n Act, for the reason that it contains this proOn day-labour works, visionThe registrar shall unless in all the circumstances he thinks it undesirable so to do, refuse to register any association as an organization if an organization to which the members of the association might conveniently belong has already been registered. Unfortunately it may be that two organizations existing side by side cannot come within the scope of this proposition, but the persons affected by such organizations must remember that the Labour party are not now putting forward what it conceives to be the ideal conditions. We arc circumscribed by the proposals of the Government and what would be relevant thereto. The proposition we put forward is the best that we can devise within the limits imposed upon us by the action of the Government and the Standing Orders.

We have come to the position that we cannot do any more business, and there is, therefore, nothing left for me to do but to move, very reluctantlyThat the House do now adjourn. I want to bring under the notice of the Ministei of External Affairs, who I regret to see is not present, several questions relating to the administration of the Northern Territory. Some time ago the Department decided to send a battery to a place called Mahranboy, a new t in If the Prime field. I am informed that the miners on the field are stopped from making any progress because the removal of the ore is very expensive. It is really imposI submit, sir sible for them at present to make a living there. That, however, is not the worse feature. A large' quantity of the ore is so poor in quality that it does not pay to shift it from the mine, with COOK I think I shall the result that it is thrown on to the B mullock heap, and a serious loss is there-by occasioned to the community. OnI several occasions I have asked the M in ister to hurry up with the battery, which, I object to the Prime as honourable members know, is already promised. A good opportunity is now afforded to the Government to improve the roads in this district. If it is not possible for the Department to expedite the transit of the battery to the district, which is situated about 60 miles from Pine Creek, and if they really mean to do anything to the roads a good opportunity is afforded to them to provide employment for the idle miners. I have been informed by the miners that 'the storekeepers have been very good in deed to them, but, of course, there is a l i m it to that consideration being extended. A part of the battery, I believe, is in Melbourne, and a part is in the haste in endeavouring to get tlie battery up to the Mahranboy mine. There is another matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. A short 'time ago certain gold reserves were proclaimed within the Territory, namely, at Umbrawarra, Yenberrie, and Ferguson. There is a regulation which provides that „ Chinese are not permitted on gold reserves unti l after a certain period has elapsed. I am informed that these goldfields are now overrun by Chinese, and that it is utterly impossible for white men to go there while the Chinese are in possession. According to the information I have received the Chinese are breaking the law. I ask the Minister to take some steps in this matter, because I am assured that if white men could gain admission to the gold reserves they would be able to make a living. Those persons who have had the opportunity of seeing the districts admit that the mineral reserves deserve some consideration from the Government. The advent",123,Nextday Of Sitting

1031,Mr West (East Sydney) [11.30 A.m.].,"of a mining population would, I believe, be tbe forerunner of tbe Territory becoming populated. Tbe desire of some persons is to get an opportunity to peacock the best reserves for their own use. Another reason for running down the prospects in the Northern Territory is the fear that its development might involve a reduction in the population of the States. The settlement of people iu the Territory is a matter of such great importance that I do not think I need B -apologise for delaying honourable members for a few minutes from taking the rest to which they are well entitled. The tin proposition at Mahranboy is, I believe, one of the best tin propositions in the whole of Australia. I am informed by men who have gone there from Sydney that the tin field comprises an area of 25 miles by 8 miles. The shifting of the tin ore costs half a crown per ton per mile. If the Minister were to employ the idle miners in improving the roads it would save a distance of from 4 or 5 miles in the carriage of the ore to the railway. That would be a great consideration for thc men out back, because it would mean a saving of 10s. a ton. At present there is thrown on the mullock heap a large amount of ore which, if put through the battery, would produce a very fair return. We ought not, if it can be avoided, to allow this ore to run to waste. If any enterprise would push forward the Territory, certainly it is mining. As honourable members know, miners have been the real pioneers of Australia. natural, of course, for the squatters to peacock the best land. It is the rascality of Governments which has permitted the best reserves in tlie Territory to be peacocked. Sooner or later the Minister of External Affairs will have to resume some reserves in order to secure proper roads, and to throw open to settlers a bit of good land. To my mind very little has been done by the present Government"" to develop the Territory. On the contrary, everything that has been done has been in the way of butchering those who have made an attempt to settle there. These persons have met with nothing but disappointment. continued they will have to leave or starve. I believe that honourable members on the other side would, if possible, exterminate the white residents because they are jealous that the Territory may Mr West. become a field for those who have a little energy and determination, and a desire to better their conditions by going there. Nothing but poison is poured into the mind of every person who desires to open up the Territory. I hope that my honourable friends opposite will get into a better frame of mind aud deal with this great question in a way which will bring credit to Australia^ and promote the development of the Territory. The intention was that as soon as possible after Federation was accomplished some action should be taken in order that this part of Australia should not remain virtually a desert. I shall avail myself of every possible opportunity to impress upon the Government the necessity for taking prompt measures so that the back door of Australia shall become peopled by persons of our own race. I desire to bring under the notice of the House replies to some questions which I received from the Postmaster General a few days ago. The questions were as follow:1. Is the Postmaster-General aware that an instruction class for telephone mechanics has been started in Adelaide? 2. Is he also aware that the Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, refuses to recognise same ? 3. Will he ascertain the reason or reasons for the Deputy so acting? The Postmaster-General furnished the following answers:It is 1. Yes. Thc class for instruction to telephone mechanics was started at Adelaide on the 11th February last. 2. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, states that he did not refuse to recognise this class, which is being conducted by officers of the Department in accommodation provided for the class on Departmental premises. 3. Answered by 2. The information I have is that the class was established in Adelaide on the date mentioned, and in accordance with an order which was posted in the Department. The bottom of the notice readsI shall be glad to receive on or before Monday next the names of officers who are willing If this treatment is to conduct one of these classes. The class met on the 11th February, at the first meeting Mr Brooks, of Adelaide, being the instructor. It was convened iu the presence of MrH ill , the assistant engineer for telephone equipment, and in a room measuring 24 feet",124,Territory Tinmining Territory B U T There Seems To Be No
1032,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [11.40 A.m.].,"by 22 feet. It is fitted with benches, and ridge for the work to be carried out there. This is the only seating accommodation which is provided for the members of the class, consequently it is most uncomfortable for them, to sit on the benches and 'listen to an instructor. These mechanics recognise that they are not as efficient as they should bo. Now, it is to the advantage of tbe Department that they should have, efficient rather than inefficient mechanics. meeting of the class, which was held on the 11th February, was attended by no less than eighty-three mechanics. A t the meeting on 18th February, there were thirty-seven present, the reduction being explained by the fact that, on that evening, the mechanics were holding a benefit social to one of their esteemed presidents, who is now deceased. On the 25th February, the total number present was 57; on 4th March, it numbered 64; on 11th March, 56; on 18th March, 57; on 25th March, 60; on 1st A p r i l , 45; on 8th A p r i l , 4 1 ; and on 15th A p r i l , 44. will be seen, therefore, that the classes have been well attended throughout.' When they were first established, it was proposed that the instructor should receive a fee of £ 1 ls . per. meeting; but, so far, he has not been paid for his services. Some time ago, a deputation, consisting of one member of the Assistants Association, one from the Lines Branch, one from the Mai l Brancli, and one from the Lettercarriers Branch, waited on the Deputy Postmaster-Generali n Adelaide. In his reply, that gentleman said that, as a matter of fact, the whole thing was premature, and that he had not given instructions, for the class to be formed. Yet his reply through the Postmaster-General wasThe Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, states that he did not refuse to recognise this class, wbich is being conducted by officers of the Department in accommodation provided for the class on departmental premises. Yesterday, I received the following wire in regard to the matter: Location class shifted to Exchange basement to-night, when ' assembled instructor ordered to leave building by foreman's orders. Nothing yet heard from Deputy. I am informed that the Department is experiencing a difficulty in getting telephone attendants, and that it iB even proposed to introduce, men from overseas. That being so, I hope that the Postmasteron each bench there is a General will look into this complaint, with a view to remedying it at the earliest possible moment.
