Budget Statements is one of a series of Budget Papers, the purpose of which is to provide information supplementary to that in the Budget Speech, A full list of the series is printed on the inside cover of this Paper. The key Budget aggrygates for 1981-82 are summarised in the following table, together with comparable data for 1980-81: 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Change on 1979-80 . Estimate Change on 1980-81 $ million $ million percent $ million $ million per cent Outlays 36274 +4613 + 14.6 40862 +4588 + 12.6 Receipts 35146 +5520 + 18.6 40716 +5569 + 15.8 DeficitI 127 906 146 981 Overseas Deficit 1556 + 89 1688 + 132 Domestic Surplus 429 + 995 1542 +1113 The projected increase in total Budget outlays for 1981-82 is 12.6 per cent compared with 14.6 percent in 1980-81. The 1981-82 rate of growth is boosted by the occurrence of an additional payday for public service salaries and for some major pensions and benefits. After adjustment for payday effects, the 1981-82 estimates imply an underlying growth of about 11.5 per cent. In real terms outlays are estimated to increase by about 1.9 per cent in 1981-82 (under 1 per cent after the payday adjustment) compared with 3.5 per cent in 1980-81. Outlays as a proportion of GDP are projected to decline slightly in 1981-82. Total receipts are estimated to increase by 15.8 per cent in 1981-82, compared with an increase of 18.6 per cent in 1980-81. In contrast to 1980-81, when company tax receipts and crude oil levy proceeds increased very strongly, the main sources of growth in 1981-82 are sales tax (reflecting the measures announced in the Budget) and PA YE income tax receipts. The Budget deficit for 1981-82 is estimated at $146.million, a reduction of $981 million on the deficit recorded in 1980-81. The deficit on overseas transactions is estimated to increase by $132 million to $1688 million, mainly because of increased payments fopurchases of defence equipment overseas and increased overseas aid payments. The Budget domestic surplus is thus estimated to increase by $1113 million to $1542 million. . The following table shows outlays in 1980-81 and 1981-82 classified according to broad economic types of expenditure: 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Change on 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 $ million $ million per cent $ million $ million per cent Net expenditure on goods and servicesDefence 3291 + 504 + 18.1 3813 + 522 + 15.9 Other current expenditure 3961 + 615 + 18.4 4561 + 601 + 15.2 Capital expenditure 438 + 148 + 51.0 434 4 1.0 Total 7690 + 1267 + 19.7 8808 +1119 + 14.5 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Change on 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 $ million $ million percent $ million $ million percent Transfer payments and net advancesTo.the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities 12919 + 1360 + 11.8 13977 + 1059 + 8.2 Cash benefits to persons (a) 11432 +1347 + 13.4 13208 + 1775 + 15.5 Interest paid 2561 + 339 + 15.2 2808 + 246 + 9.6 Transfers overseas 576 + 55 + 10.6 667 + 91 + 15.8 Net advances (other than to States and NT) (b) 202 + 123 + 157.9 296 + 94 +46.8 Other (c) 894 + 121 + 15.7 1098 + 204 +22.8 Total 28584 +3346 + 13.3 32053 +3469 + 12.1 (a) Cash benefits to persons are now titled 'personal benefit payments' in Budget Paper No.9, National Income and Expenditure, prepared by the Australian Statistician. Includes unfunded employee retirement benefits. (b) Includes net advances to Commonwealth authorities, the public and overseas. (c) Consists of subsidies, grants for private capital purposes and purchases of existing assets. Net current expenditures on goods and services and cash benefits to persons, which constitute just over half of total outlays, are estimated to account for over 63 per cent of the projected increase in outlays in 1981-82. This mainly reflects the occurrence of an additional payday in 1981-82, the benefits measures announced in the Budget Speech and the large increase in defence spending in line with the priority attached to such spending by the Government. Other features of the table are: rapid growth in n-t advances (other than to the States and NT), reflecting it reduction in repayments to the Budget by Qantas (which are offset against advances) and substantial increases in payments to the Defence Service Homes Corporation and the Aboriginal Development Commission; strong growth in 'Other' transfers arising largely from increased outlays on homes savings grants; export market development grants, subsidies for employment training, and bounty assistance for the textile industry and shipbuilding; strong growth in transfers overseas resulting from the Government's decision to increase overseas aid payments significantly; a modest rate of growth in total transfers and advances to the States, the NT and local government authorities reflecting decisions made at recent Loan Council and Premiers 'Conference meetings; and a small reduction in direct Budget-financed capital expenditure (including stocks), reflecting reduced expenditures on civil works by the National Capital Development Commission and a forecast reduction in returns of 'borrowed' uranium to the Commonwealth stockpile. Estimates of outlays in 1981-82, classified by major functions, are set out and explained in detail in Statement No.3. The table below summarises the figures for 1980-81 and estimates for 1981-82 in the functional format: 1980-81 1981-82 Proportion Change on or Total Actual' 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 Outlays$ million per cent $ million $ million percent per cent Derence 3537 +17.6 4112 + 575 + 16.3 10.1 Education 2930 + 12.3 3255 + 325 +11.1 8.0 Health 3650 + 15.2 2872 778 21.3 7.0 Social Security and Welrare 9917 + 12.9 11 357 +1440 + 14.5 27.8 Housing 341 0.4 399 + 58 + 17.0 1.0 Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment 110 4.0 79 31 28.3 0.2 Culture and Recreation 400 +24.9 461 + 60 + 15.0 1.1 Economic Services 2379 +29.0 2712 + 332 +14.0 6.6 General Public Services 2477 + 15.5 2847 + 370 +14.9 7.0 Not Allocated to FunctionPayments to the States, the N.T. and Local Government Authorities nec 7971 + 12.3 9902 + 1932 +24.2 24.2 Public Debt Interest 2561 +15.2 2808 + 246 + 9.6 6.9 Allowance ror Prospective Wage and Salary Increases (Non-Derence) (a) (a) 60 + 60 n.a. 0.1 (a) Amounts actually spent on increases in wages and salaries in past years are recorded under relevant runctiona1 headings. In large measure both the decrease in outlays on Health (21.3 per cent) and the increase in respect of Payments to the States, the N.T. and local government authorities not allocated to specific functions (24.2 per cent) reflect the changed health funding arrangements under which general purpose payments are being made to the States in lieu of some specific purpose health assistance provided previously. Adjusted for this change, outlays on Health in 1981-82 would show an increase of 10.2 per cent, while Payments to the States, the N.T. and local government authorities not allocated to other functions, would show an increase of9.8 per cent. Other points which might be noted include the following: the estimated increase in outlays for housing (17.0 per cent) largely arises from the full year effects of expanded eligibility for homes savings grants and defence service homes benefits introduced during 1980-81; the continued strong growth in defence outlays (16.3 per cent) reflects the high priority being given to national security requirements; the 14.5 per cent growth in social security and welfare expenditures reflects the effect of indexation on benefits, a net increase in beneficiary numbers, the additional payday in 1981-82 and a number of increases in benefits announced in the Budget; and the growth of 14.0 per cent in outlays on economic services reflects a number of factors, including increased outlays on air transport, roads grants and transportation assistance for Victoria, increased funding for employment training programs and increased payments for export market development, textile industry bounties and shipbuilding assistance. There are offsetting reductions in areas such as the urban public transport program and for payments in respect of expected returns of uranium borrowed from the Commonwealth stockpile. Total receipts in 1981-82 are estimated at $40716 million, an increase of 15.8 per cent. In the absence of the tax measures announced in the Budget, receipts would have grown by an estimated 14.2 per cent in 1981-82. Those measures, together with measures announced prior to the Budget, are described in detail in the 'Measures' section of Statement No.4 and Appendix III to that Statement. The table below summarises actual receipts in 1980-81 and estimated receipts in 1981-82; details are provided in the 'Estimates' section of Statement No.4. 1980-81 1981-82 Proportion Change on of Total Actual 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 Receipts$ million percent $ million $ million percent percent Taxation RevenueCustoms Duty 1884 + 15.7 2 110 + 226 + 12.0 5.2 Excise DutyCrude Oil and LPG 3108 +36.9 3440 + 332 + 10.7 8.4 Other 2725 + l.l 2810 + 85 + 3.1 6.9 Sales Tax 2102 + 12.7 2913 + 811 +38.6 7.2 Income TaxIndividuals (net) 17543 +16.6 20860 +3317 + 18.9 51.2 Companies 4695 +37.8 5170 + 475 + 10.1 12.7 Withholding Tax 161 +14.1 175 + 14 + 8.7 0.4 Other General Taxation 248 4.3 290 + 42 +16.9 0.7 Total Taxation Revenue 32467 + 18.9 37768 +5301 + 16.3 92.8 Other Receipts 2680 +15.4 2948 + 268 +10.0 7.2 On the basis of these estimates, the composition of growth in receipts in 1981-82 would differ significantly from the outcome for 1980-81. In 1980-81 receipts from company income tax and the excises on crude oil and LPG increased by 37.8 per cent and 36.9 per centrespective1y, whereas in 1981-82 receipts from each of these sources are estimated to increase by only 10-11 per cent. Stronger growth is forecast in 1981-82 for receipts from sales tax and individual income tax. The sharp increase in estimated sales tax revenue, 38.6 per cent compared with 12.7 per cent in 1980-81, is accounted for by the measures announced in the Budget. The faster overall increase in individual income tax receipts is accounted for by the faster growth in gross PA YE collections which are estimated to increase by almost 22 per cent in 1981-82 compared with about 15 per cent last year. Overall, income tax collections from individuals in 1981-82 are estimated to increase by 18.9 per cent. In the absence of the half-indexation adjustment of 3.8 per cent, effective from 1 July 1981 for P AYE tax instalment purposes, it is estimated that total individual income tax revenue would have increased by 21.7 per cent in 1981-82.

To this end policies have sought to eliminate a number of distortions in the economy, the most important of which were inflation, an over-expanded public sector and depressed profitability. Some progress has been made. In particular, the slowdown in inflation in 1977-78 and 1978-79 has contributed to a marked strengthening of activity and employment over the past two years or so. The growth of the non-farm economy in 1980-81 was faster than in any year since the early 1970s, notwithstanding generally depressed conditions in the rest of the world. This strong expansion was marked by exceptionally rapid growth in private fixed investment and relatively buoyant private consumption expenditure. With the surge in investment now under way both in the resource-related sector and more generally, Australia has the opportunity to reap the benefits of a period of sustained economic growth -provided that increases in wages and prices can be contained and reduced. In the opportunities that it presents, the situation now is similar to that in the late 1960s when Australia was last poised to benefit from a period of rapid mineral development. One contrast-the importance of which it is almost impossible to overstate-is that the underlying rate of inflation now is about three times what it was then. The key test of economic policies over the period ahead will be their capacity to reduce inflation and, at the same time, achieve a steady, sustainable rate of growth. This Statement is in three parts: PartI reviews the main domestic and international economic developments during 1980-81; Part II outlines the role of the 1981-82 Budget in the Government's overall economic strategy; and Part III presents an assessment of the economic outlook for 1981-82 as it now appears. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are in constant price (real) terms, with the growth rates for half years based on seasonally adjusted data and expressed as annual rates. PART I REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 1980-81 Demand and Output On the basis of present estimates, the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980-81 was in line with the '3 per cent or more' expected a year ago, although growth in non-farm product was a little stronger and farm product a little weaker than projected. As Table1 shows, the increase in non-farm GDP in 1980-81 was the strongest since 1973-74. On the other hand, farm product-which was again depressed by widespread drought-declined by 12.3 per cent. In contrast to 1979-80, when exports provided the major stimulus, the strong growth in activity in 1980-81 mainly reflected a sharp rise in private domestic final expenditure (See Table 2). A rise in the statistical discrepancy (the difference between the income and expenditure estimates) is shown to have contributed 1.1 percentage points of the recorded growth in 'real' GDP in 1980-81; the size of this contribution suggests that considerable caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions from these preliminary estimates.

Most areas of consumption expenditure contributed to this growth. As can be seen from Table 3, real household disposable income grew by 3.1 per cent in 1980-81, compared with 0.3 per cent in 1979-80. There was no change in the overall saving ratio but there was 'a rise'in the 'non-farm' saving ratio; the latter is thought to reflect a delayed response in consumption to the strong rise in mcomes. The growth in consumption expenditure moderated in the second half of the year when the rate of increase in both employment and average earnings slowed a little. Higher interest rates in that period may also have had a dampening effect on some components of consumption expenditure.

Seasonally adjusted, annual rates. Private business gross fixed investment grew by 21.2 per cent in 1980-81. This followed a decrease of 5.1 per cent in 1979-80 and an increase of 12.2 per cent in 1978-79. Non-dwelling construction, which typically accounts for around one-quarter of private business fixed investment expenditure, grew by 29.9 per cent in 1980-81, while expenditure on plant and equipment increased by 18.3 per cent. The strongest growth occurred in the resource related sectors, although as Table4 indicates, growth was by no means confined to those sectors. Movements in stocks over recent years are shown in Chart 1. There was a further run-down of farm stocks in 1980-81, reflecting the effects of the decline in farm production. At the same time, there was a build-up of non-farm stocks, despite a fall in the second half of the year. Labour Market The recovery in employment, which commenced in early 1979, continued into 1980-81 and was accompanied by some decline in unemployment, particularly towards the end of the year. Table6 summarises movements in the main labour market indicators over recent years.

The increase of 2.6 per cent in employment in 1980-81 as a whole was a little greater than in 1979-80 although the growth rate slowed during the year. Total employment grew by 2.3 per cent over the course of the year. Growth in female employment declined from 5.3 per cent over the year to June 1980 to 2.4 per cent over the year to June 1981 while during the same period the rate of growth of male employment increased from 1.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent. Employment of juniors (both male and female) grew by 2.9 per cent over the course of 1980-81, compared with 5.6 per cent over the preceding twelve months. Wage and salary earner employment increased by 2.7 per cent in 1980-81 while the number of employers and self-employed persons increased by 2.4 per cent. This reversed the pattern evident over the previous three years when working proprietor employment increased at the faster rate. Total public sector employment increased by 1.4 per cent in the twelve months to May 1981, compared with 1.0 per cent over the preceding twelve months. The growth in the labour force increased from 2.1 per cent in 1979--0 -o 2.3 p-r cent in 1980-81, reflecting a small increase in the participation rate and a nse 10 the migrant worker intake.

It is of interest that in 1980-81 the proportion of GDP represented by private business fixed capital expenditure rose to close to the average level during the 1960s and early 1970s (see Table 5).

The available indicators point to further strong growth in private investment in dwellings in 1980-81. The Statistician has warned that some caution is necessary in interpreting the present estimates but, as they stand, they suggest growth for the year as a whole of 10.6 per cent, with some easing in activity in the second half of the year. The estimates for the latest half-year are particularly uncertain but an easing in activity would be consistent with the decline in lending for new housing over the course of 1980-81. During much of 1979 and 1980 the housing sector appears to have been boosted by an investment and speculative component which generated stronger growth in activity than would be suggested by the flow of fin-nce by the major mortgage lenders. The strongest growth occurred in Sydney and in the resort areas of Queensland, and in townhouses, home units and flats. Government final expenditure on goods and services increased by 2.6 per cent in 1980-81. Consumption expenditures by the Commonwealth increased by 9.3 per cent and capital expenditures fell by 1.0 per cent. State and local government consumption expenditures rose by 1.6 per cent but their capital spending fell by 0.9 per cent. Increased deliveries of defence equipment augmented Commonwealth current expenditure, which in the national accounts is recorded on a deliveries rather than a payments basis. On a payments basis, Commonwealth current expenditures increased by 4.3 per cent in 1980-81, compared with 0.4 per cent in the previous year. Chart2 provides details of the ratio of government final expenditure on goods and services (on a deliveries basis) to GDP. There was a slight rise in the ratio for total government spending in 1980-81, due to a rise in the ratio for Commonwealth expenditures; the State and local ratio remained unchanged. Additional data on public sector trends appear in the section on fiscal conditions andin Statement No.6.

This weakening reflected sluggish economic conditions overseas, the effects of drought on the availability of cereals and other rural products for export and the effects on coal exports of the Queensland coal miners' strike in the first quarter of the year. Imports rose by 9.0 per cent in 1980-81, in marked contrast to 1979-80 when they fell by 0.6 per cent. The growth in imports reflected the general lift in domestic demand and especially the surge in business fixed investment which appears to have had a major impact on imports in the metals, metal manufactures, machinery and transport equipment categories. The rise in imports and, to the extent that it reflected increased domestic pressure on local production, the decline in non-rural exports, facilitated the rapid growth in domestic demand that was experienced in 1980-81. unemployment declined to 387,200 or 5.8 per cent of the labour force in 1980-81 compared with 398,100 or 6.1 per cent in 1979-80. As a result of declining participation rates toward the end of the year, there was a more pronounced improvement in unemployment over the course of the year, with the total unemployment rate at June 1981 being 5.2 per cent, compared with 6.1 per cent a year earlier (see Chart 3). The unemployment rate for juniors declined from 16.5 per cent in June 1980 to 13.0 per cent in June 1981. Hard information is limited, but reports indicate that shortages of skilled labour, particularly in the metal and electrical trades and professional personnel in the construction and engineering sectors, have become more pronounced during the past year. There has also been evidence of rising over-award payments, larger intakes into apprenticeships and sharply increased numbers of employer nominations for skilled immigrants.

Various indicators of rates of change in prices are shown in Table 7. Among the factors influencing recent price movements have been the increased pressure of demand and, at times, an unduly accommodating monetary environment. Also significant, and partly reflecting the aforementioned factors, has been an acceleration in the rate of increase in wages (see Table 8), which has rekindled cost-push pressures. At the aggregate level, the improvement in the profit share in 1980-81 (see Chart5 below) suggests that wage increases have been substantially and quickly passed on. Some of the largest price increases have occurred in the building and construction sector, which has experienced strong growth in activity. The rapid rise in prices of building materials over the course of 1980 partly reflected rising oil and other primary commodity prices; while those particular influences have since moderated, wage and demand pressures have become more intense in some regions. The increase iimport prices slowed markedly in 1980-81 in response to both subdued world demand conditions and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. The implicit deflator for imports of goods including petroleum is estimated to have risen by 8.5 per cent in 1980-81 compared with 17.7 per cent in 1979-80; excluding petroleum products the increases were 5.6 per cent in 1980-81 and 12.4 per cent in 1979-80. Consumer prices benefited both directly and indirectly-through the greater competitive pressure exerted by imported goods-from this moderation of import prices. During 1980-81 consumer prices were also restrained by other influences, including widespread petrol discounting in the first half of the year and a smaller increase in food prices. The drought led to relatively large increases in the prices of dairy products and of fruit and vegetables but a higher rate of slaughterings, combined with weak export marl<;.ets, dampened the rate of increase in meat prices. Overall, the Consumer Price Index increased by 9.4 per cent in 1980-81, compared with 10.2 per cent in 1979-80. As Table7 shows, however, when the variable health care, food and petroleum items are excluded, the index for the residual items suggests an upward trend consistent with the movement in the wider-based non-farm product deflator. .g Table 7: Indicators of Price Cha-ge (Percentage change on previous period) ...j;;' Half-year (a) 5"" ;:,: ::: Year 1979-80 1980-81 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 II Consumer price index (b)-------------------------------------------------------------II AH groups 16.7 13.0 13.8 9.5 8.2 10.2 9.4 10.6 8.9 9.4 Food 9.7 9.9 11.7 10.9 11.5 14.0 10.3 13.5 9.8 8.4 Petrol 15.5 14.8 4.5 8.9 22.9 35.8 16.2 20.7 7.1 30.9 Adjusted CPI(c) 19.3 18.0 11.7 8.4 7.7 7.6 8.8 8.3 9.1 8.6 Implicit price deflators (d)Final consumption expenditurePrivate 17.6 15.6 11.5 9.5 9.0 9.7 8.9 10.2 8.4 8.6 Public 24.2 15.1 11.0 7.8 6.3 9.6 12.8 13.0 14.9 8.7 Gross fixed capital expenditure Private 23.4 16.1 12.2 10.2 7.8 9.8 10.9 12.2 ·11.D9.4 Public 23.6 14.9 13.2 8.0 6.8 12.2 12.1 14.6 12.3 9.8 Private non-dwelling construction 26.5 16.0 12.7 8.6 6.8 11.8 12.4 13.3 13.4 9.0 Total domestic final demand 20.0 15.5 11.7 9.2 8.2 9.9 10.1 11.3 10.2 8.8 Exports of goods and services Hi.7 7.5 11.2 4.2 15.5 14.3 11.7 13.3 15.5 3.2 ...... 00 Imports of goods and services 28.3 ILl 15.8 13.5 9.7 17.5 8.9 16.0 . 9.6 1.2 Gross non-farm product 21.6 16.2 10.9 8.5 7.4 9.4 10.7 12.4 9.6 11.3 ;I> Gross domestic product 18.4 14.8 11.0 8.2 7.8 10.4 10.5 11.2 10.7 9.3 ...'""......

This compares with increases of 9.9 per cent in 1979-80 and 7.7 per cent in 1978-79 (see Table 8). Several factors contributed to this situation, including the operation of the wage indexation system, which provided increases in wages based on past price movements. During 1980-81 the degree of indexation of award wages to previous CPI increases averaged about 80 per cent. The contribution from this source was larger than in 1979-80, partly because three half-yearly national wage increases were effected within 1980-81, the third (handed down on 7 May 1981) reflecting the timing provisions in the new wage fixation principles introduced by the Arbitration Commission on 7 April 1981. The round of award wage increases based on so-called 'work-value' considerations also contributed to the acceleration in award wages and earnings in 1980-81. That round had begun in 1978, but much of the flow-on occurred late in 1979 and through the course of 1980, to be virtually completed by the end of 1980-81. Increases in over-award payments were another important source of earnings growth in 1980-81. A comparison of the rates of increase in average male awards and average weekly ordinary time earnings (male unit basis) provides an indication-albeit an imprecise one-of the extent of 'earnings drift'. As indicated in Table 8, ordinary time average earnings have increased since mid-1980 at rates consistently 31/2 to 4 percentage points greater than the awards series (which covers many, though not all, 'work-value' increases). In summary, the latest figures point to a significant widening of the gap between National Wage Case award increases and increases in average weekly earnings. Had national wage increases been the only source of earnings growth over the year to the March quarter 1981, the increase in average weekly (ordinary time) earnings would have been no more than about 8-8t per cent, compared with the actual increase of 13.1 per cent. This gap is a measure of the extent of 'work""value' increases and earnings drift. The past year also saw the development of a further source of labour cost pressures in the campaign for reductions in standard hours of work. Agreements providing for such reductions were reached during the year in a number of industries, including power generation, the glass industry and parts of the engineering, shipbuilding and repair, mining equipment manufacture, petrochemical and aluminium industries. The incompatibility of significant non-National Wage Case increases and selective reductions in standard hours of work with the then existing highly centralised wage determination system exerted mounting pressures on the framework of wage determination during 1980-81. Against that background and an accoIllpanying high level of industrial action, the Arbitration Commission held a public inquiry early in 1981 into 'principles' of wage determination. The new principles introduced on 7 April were aimed at severely restricting wage increases outside National Wage Cases and so-called productivity bargaining for reductions in standard working hours.

Table9 presents information on real award wage rates and average earnings viewed both as 'incomes' and as 'costs'. These estimates were obtained by deflating nominal awards and earnings figures by the implicit price deflator of private final consumption expenditure for 'incomes', and by the implicit price deflator of gross non-farm product for 'costs'. For the first three quarters of 1980-81 real earnings on the 'incomes' basis increased by 3.9 per cent compared with the corresponding period of 1979-80 while real wage 'costs' increased by 2.3 per cent, both being the largest such 'increases since 1974-75. Although it is often alleged that real wage levels have been substantially reduced as a consequence of partial wage indexation decisions since mid-1976, when measured on an 'incomes' basis, real average weekly earnings have actually increased by about 3+ per cent over that time. That increase occurred from what was at that time the clearly unrealistically high. base pertaining in 1975-76, itself a proximate cause of the high level of unemployment then obtainin:g. Movements in average weekly earnings and in the consumer price index in recent years are illustrated in Chart 4. The chart shows that earnings increased considerably faster than the CPI during 1980-81. .

(b) Gross non-farm product at average 1974-75 prices per hour worked by persons employed in the nonfarm sector. (c) Movements in real unit labour costs do not correspond fully with movements in the profit share derived from national accounts estimates (see Chart 5) because, inter alia, whereas the product measure in the real unit labour cost calculation relates to market prices, the profit share is on a factor cost basis and does not cover all enterprises. (d) Seasonally adjusted. Table 10 compares average real labour costs, average labour productivity and average real unit labour costs for the non-farm sector of the economy over recent years. Despite some strengthening in average labour productivity growth in 1980-81, reflecting in part higher levels of capacity utilisation, the increase (1.6 per cent) was only about the same as the rise in average real labour costs (1.7 per cent) recorded over the same period. Consequently, real unit labour costs showed little change in 1980-81 and remained above the level of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The rising level of economic activity contributed to an increase in aggregate profit levels in 1980-81. The gross operating surplus of trading enterprise companies (i.e. the operating surplus before allowance is made for depreciation) increased by 18.2 per cent in 1980-81 following an increase of 17.7 per cent in 1979-80. In 1980-81, the gross operating surplus of non-farm unincorporated enterprises increased by about 11 per cent while the gross operating surplus offarm unincorporated enterprises declined by a similar percentage. Chart5 indicates that the profit share, as derived from the national accounts, continued its slow recovery in 1980-81. That trend is confirmed by other indicators, including business surveys, which point to improved profit performances during 1980-81.

Fiscal Conditions The Commonwealth Budget deficit for 1980-81 was $1127 million, $438 million below the Budget estimate, ,and equivalent to 0.9 per cent of GDP. The latter figure compares with a peak of 4.9 per cent in 1975-76. The domestic surplus of $429 million in 1980-81 was the first for seven years. Budget outlays increased by 3.5 per cent in real terms in 1980-81, compared with an average increase of less than 1 per cent over the previous four years. As a proportion of GDP, outlays rose slightly to 27.9 per cent while Commonwealth sector outlays remained unchanged as a proportion of GDP, at 29.1 per cent. The growth in outlays of the State and local government sectors has slowed in recent years, mainly as a consequence of slower growth in direct assistance from the Commonwealth, partly offset by the development of new revenue and funding arrangements and continued strong growth in Loan Council borrowing programs; these latter programs increased by 11.6 per cent in 1980-81, compared with 16.0 per cent in 1979-80 and 18.0 per cent in 1978-79. . The estimates. in Table 11 indicate that the public sector as a whole commanded a slightly higher proportion of the nation's resources in 1980-81 than in other recent years.

Public sector operations also impact on financial markets. The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), which consolidates the deficits of all public sector authorities, affords one broad measure of this impact. Reflecting the reduction in the Commonwealth Budget deficit, the PSBR fell from a peak of 6.0 per cent of GDP in 1977-78 to 3.2 per cent in 1980-81 (see Table 12).

It differs From the measure of net borrowing by the public sector, used elsewhere in Statement No 2, largely because of the.ueatment of net advances to other sectors by the public sector. These net advances are treated as outlays in the calculation of this measure but, for the purposes of analysing net borrowing and lending between sectors, are treated as lending in the calculation of the net borrowing measure. (b) Because the deficit of the State and local government sector is financed in part by advances From the Commonwealth Budget, the borrowing requirement of that sector is reduced to that extent. The figures shown here do not include these advances and thereFore indicate the residual borrowing requirement of that sector. (P) Preliminary Monetary Conditions (i) General financial conditions At this time last year the Government indicated that the degree of monetary restraint considered consistent with broad policy objectives could be symbolised by an outcome for M3 growth of about 9 to 11 per cent over the year to June 1981. In the event, M3 increased by 12.7 per cent over 1980-81, slightly faster than the increase of 12.3 per cent over 1979-80. Table 13 and Chart6 depict the major influences on monetary growth over recent years. In respect of 1980-81 they show a further decline in the Budget deficit and therefore in the contribution to primary liquidity (private sector LGS and SRD assets) from this source, a marked increase in the contribution to primary liquidity from the external account, and an insufficiency in sales of government securities to the non-bank sector relative to the growth in primary liquidity.

On the other hand, there was a strong demand for funds and a very large increase in. private capital inflow. That inflow was largely translated into additional resources from abroad through a widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, but there was a larger surplus on the private sector's foreign exchange transactions than had been expected and an excessive contribution from that source to the growth in primary liquidity. The net result of these (and other) factors was a rise of $2877 million in primary liquidity in 1980-81, $1449 million more than in 1979-80. Sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank sector are the principal way of preventing such strong growth in primary liquidity from contributing to undesirable expansion of the monetary aggregates. During 1980-81, however, these sales totalled only $557 million, about $180 million less than in 1979-80, despite the much larger rise in primary liquidity. Net sales of Australian Savings Bonds were negative until towards the end of the year and this added to the bond seIling task. But apart from a brief period in the early months of the financial year, the progressive non-bank take-up of bonds was also negative until tap stock yields were adjusted in early January; from late April, they fell away again in the face of strong competition from alternative investments. Treasury Notes accounted for all of the net non-bank take-up of Commonwealth Government securities in the first half of the financial year but holdings of these highly liquid securities declined sharply as financial conditions began to tighten in late March. This fall, combined with redemptions of bonds maturing in May, reduced non-bank take-up in the eleven months to end May to a low $243 million. In June, when liquidity conditions were easier than expected, there were net sales of Commonwealth Government securities, raising non-bank take-.up for the year to $557 million. Sales of securities in 1979-80 and 1980-81 are shown in Table 14, while the withinyear pattern of sales is depicted in Chart 7.

Bank liquidity rose strongly in 1980-81. This was reflected in a further high level of secondary credit creation by the banking syste·m. The increase of 12.6 per cent in advances of the major trading banks (MTBs), while substantially lower than the 16.7 per cent recorded in the previous year, remained in excess of that consistent with monetary objectives. The generally easy liquidity conditions also allowed most non-bank financial institutions to increase their lending considerably.

While MTB lending in total might have seemed to be broadly in line with what was desirable in that first six months, the combination of strong non-overdraft lending with the sharp increase in overdraft usage during the seasonally tight June quarter led, by the end of the year, to a level of bank lending overall which was excessive relative to monetary growth objectives. Although domestic Budget transactions in the June quarter of 1981 extracted about $1200 million more from financial markets than in the same quarter of the previous year, the strong growth in trading bank lending did not give rise to any particularly sharp tightening of liquidity in the banking system. This partly reflected a change in the pattern of Rural Credits advances over the year; given the smaller advances earlier in the year there was little net change in Rural Credits advances outstanding during the June quarter, compared with repayments of about $500 million in the June quarter 1980. Of more importance, however, were the very high level of private capital inflow and the si-nificant fall in non-bank holdings of Commonwealth Government securities (partially reversed in the month of June). These enabled the banking system, and financial markets generally, to handle the large payments of provisional and company tax during the June quarter without difficulty. (ii) Sectoral changes and interest rate pressures With investment, particularly in the resource area, growing well in excess of the corporate gross operating surplus, it is not surprising that net borrowing by the corporate sector increased sharply in 1980-81. There was a sharp rise in new capital raisings by listed companies, which were 43 per cent greater in the first three quarters of 1980-81 than in the corresponding period of 1979-80. The increased demand for funds by the corporate sector during 1980-81 was partly offset by a fall in public sector net borrowing. At the same time, net lending by the household sector (including unincorporated enterprises) declined, with household capital expenditure rising more rapidly than household savings. Chart8 provides estimates for the past decade of net lending and borrowing by the major sectors as a proportion of GDP. With net lending by the household sector falling and the total public sector's demand for funds remaining at a high level, the corporate sector's borrowing requirement necessarily had to be met by an increase in net borrowing from overseas-that is, by a widening in the current account deficit-if that sector's expenditure plans were to be realised. The resultant large current account deficit in 1980-81 was financed entirely by private capital inflow, in contrast to the period from 1976-77 to 1978-79 when relatively large deficits were financed in part by Commonwealth Government borrowings overseas and reductions in official reserve assets. Part of the increased demand for funds by the corporate sector in 1980-81 was of course met from domestic sources, thereby contributing to pressures on interest rates. Table 15 indicates that there were some large increases in market-determined interest rates during the year. These increases brought administered rates under pressure. As administered interest rates in the banking sector became increasingly out of line with market rates the supply of trading bank funds to small borrowers was adversely affected, at least in respect of loans subject to interest rate controls. Uncompetitlve administered rates also reduced the deposit intake, and hence the lending capacity, of the savings banks.

These included an increase of 2 percentage points to 12.5 per cent in the maximum interest rate banks could charge on overdrafts of less than $100 000; an increase of one percentage point to 11.5 per cent in the interest rates banks could charge on loans for owner-occupied housing; and abolition of all controls on the interest rates on bank deposits of 30 days or longer to maturity. Chart9 indicates that, notwithstanding these changes, banking sector interest rates are still lower relative to other rates than they were in the late 1960s and early 1970s. To the extent that 'real' rates of interest can be measured by the margin between nominal interest rates and:the rate of inflation during the immediately past period, the December increases served to maintain the real rates evident in the banking sector in r-cent years, although at levels significantly below those recorded in the 1960s. ' Monetary growth is usually assessed in terms of growth of M3. Liabilities of nonbanks and monetary aggregates broader than M3 are, however, important influences -n financial conditions. These broader aggregates have generally increased faster than M3 as a result of the better competitive position of most non-bank financial institutions. In 1980-81, and particularly in the first half of the year, there was some widening in the gap between the growth of M3 and that of the broader aggregates, reflecting both the ready availability of funds to the non-bank sector and the generally strong demand for finance. For example, the growth in the monetary measure usually termed M6 (which includes the components of M3 plus deposits of the public with building societies, finance companies and money market corporations) increased from 13:4 per cent over the year to June 1980 to 15.7 per cent over the year to December 1980 while M3 growth increased from 12.3 per cent to 13.0 per cent over the same period. There was a slight narrowing of the margin between rates of growth of M3 and other broader aggregates following the relaxation of the controls on bank interest rates in December 1980. This was the result of the loss of competitiveness of building society deposits associated with delays in several States in adjusting building society deposit and lending rates. Building society deposits grew by only 11 per cent ih 1980-81, with most of tpat growth occurring in the first half of the year, compared with 20 per cent in the previous year. However, reflecting the strong growth of finance companies and money market corporations, the margin between the rates of growth of M3 and M6 widened again towards the end of the financial year. Balance of Payments There was a substantial strengthening of Australia's overall balance of payments during 1980-81, with a marked increase in the deficit on current account being more than offset by a large increase in private capital inflow. Developments on the current account, and particularly on the trade account, during 1980-81 must be viewed against the background of an exceptional outcome in 1979-80. In that year, with record wheat shipments and buoyant sales of certain minerals, and little real growth in imports (partly as a result of a falling away in capital goods imports reflecting the reduction of the investment allowance on 30 June 1979), there was a particularly large trade surplus. At the beginning of 1980-81 it was expected that weakening export growth and a recovery in imports would lead to a substantial decline in the trade surplus. In the event, the decline was stronger than expected, with weak world demand, the effects of the drought on rural exports, the impact of industrial disputes (especially on coal exports) and the effects of strong growth in domestic demand being the main factors responsible.

(b) Estimate (c) Percentage change on a year earlier. The value of rural exports fell marginally in 1980-81, the result of a substantial decline in volume, especially of wheat and other grains and to a lesser extent of beef and veal exports, largely offset by higher prices. The latter influence was most evident in the first half of 1980-81; world spot prices for wheat, meat and especially sugar declined sharply in the second half of the year. Non-rural exports increased slightly in 1980-81, following a rise of around 25 per cent in the previous year. Modest price increases more than offset a decline in the total volume of non-rural exports, the more significant falls being in iron and steel, iron ore and non-ferrous ores and metals. Manufactured exports as a group declined slightly in volume terms in 1980-81 following two years of very strong growth. Those components of manufactured exports which are particularly susceptible to world economic conditions (eg non-ferrous metals) suffered most while other components (eg miscellaneous manufactured articles) continued to grow. The total value of imported goods increased by around 20 per cent in 1980-81, with volume and price increases both contributing. In value terms large rises were recorded for imported crude petroleum and related products (29 per cent) and machinery and transport equipment (24 per cent), the latter associated with the rapid growth in business investment. While average import prices for the year as a whole were about 8.5 per cent higher than in 1979-80, there was little increase in prices over the course of 1980-81. This slowdown was apparent across most import categories and reflected both the subdued state of world trade and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Chart 10 depicts the trends in exports and imports during the past three years. Details of the main balance of payments aggregates in 1979-80 and 1980-81 are shown in Table 16.

This increase in the current account deficit helped to relieve the inflationary pressures being exerted on Australian supplies by the strong growth of domestic demand. Relative to gross domestic product, the deficit in 1980-81 was a little higher than the average deficit recorded in the latter part of the 1960s when Australia was also experiencing substantial investment in natural resource projects. Chart 11 traces the current account deficit and net apparent capital inflow in recent years. There was a large increase in net apparent private capital inflow in 1980-81 which was mainly attributable to an increase in foreign investment in enterprises in Australia (other than undistributed income) and to movements in trade credit balances. As yet unidentified balance of payments transactions, presently included in the balancing item, also account for part of the increase in net apparent private capital inflow. A break-down of foreign investment in enterprises for the first three quarters of the year is shown in Table 17.

(b) Includes net borrowing overseas by State semi-government authorities under the infrastructure borrowing program,loans raised overseas by public transport enterprises, etc. . (e) Consists of changes in branch liabilities to head offices (overseas) and intercompany indebtedness. The most striking feature of these statistics is the sharp increase in overseas borrowing (other than by public non-monetary enterprises) iIi 1980-81, including some acceleration over the course of the year. This trend can be attributed mainly to inflows associated with major resource development projects and to relative interest rate differentials which favoured overseas borrowing for part of the year, particularly in the Marchi April period when companies were preparing to meet large taxation commitments. Foreign investment in corporate equities also increased in 1980-81, with a concentration in the first half of the year. Data to the March quarter 1981 show that most of the rise has been accounted for by direct investment but portfolio investment, which had risen substantially in 1979-80, remained the larger component in absolute terms. The pick-up in foreign investment in corporate equities is thought to reflect a variety of Chart II-Current Account Deficit, Net Apparent Capital Inflow and Net Official Monetary Movements (a) ($million per quarter, not seasonally adjusted) $million $million 2400 -2400 / Net Apparent Capital Inflow (left scale) / 2000 / -2000 ---/ / 1600 / -1600 / 1200 -1200 ------.....:: 800 -800 \ 400 \ -400 \ / o \ ---J / o -400 s D M J s D M J s D M 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 $million 1000 Net Official Monetary Movements -400 -600 -800 s D M s D M J S D.

As would have been expected in these circumstances, trade credit turned from a large net outflow in 1979-80 (reflecting record export levels, especially for wheat) to a net inflow in 1980-81 as the trade account moved into deficit, this movement dampening the impact on reserves of variations in export receipts during the two years. Net monetary movements (see Chart 11) were zero in the first half of 1980-81 and totalled $1148 million for the yearas a whole. Private sector foreign exchange transactions resulted in a net inflow of $2839 million for the year, of which $2005 million was recorded in the second half. The impact on official reserve assets of the overall balance of payments surplus in 1980-81 was offset by a decline of $933 million in the value of gold holdings, as international gold prices fell throughout the year. Official reserve assets other than gold increased by $961 million. The Exchange Rate Management of the exchange rate of the Australian dollar during 1980-81 was conducted against the background of great volatility of interest rates and exchange rates in international financial markets and a strengthening of Australia's overall balance of payments. Movements in the trade-weighted index (TWI) of the value of the Australian dollar and in bilateral rates with the major currencies are shown in Chart 12. Movements over the year are shown in Table 18. Table 18: Bilateral Exchange Rates and the Trade Weighted Index (TWI) Percentage June 1980 (a) June 1981 (11) change $US/M 1.1530 1.1404 -1.1 Yen/SA 251.41 255.73 1.7 DM/SA 2.0375 2.7093 33.0 Pound Sterling/SA 0.4933 0.5782 17.2 TWI 84.9 91.9 8.2(b) (a) Monthly average. (b) Between 30 June 1980 and 30 June 1981 the TWI rose by 9.3 per cent. The diversity in the movements in the various bilateral rates reflected movements in exchange rates between the major currencies in international markets. While these changes were influenced by many factors, perhaps the most important was movements in interest rates in the United States. US bank prime lending rates, for example, opened the year at 11. 75 per cent, rose to a peak of 21.5 per cent during December, settled back to 17.25 per cent in March, rose again to 20.5 per cent in May .and closed the year at 20.0 per cent. At the end of 1980-81, the TWI, which is an overall indicator of the value of the Australian dollar relative to the currencies of Australia's trading partners, was back at about the level at which it settled following the devaluation of the Australian dollar in late 1976, having increased by 9.3 per cent over the year to 30 June 1981. The main factor underlying the appreciation during 1980-81 was the strength of the balance of payments. But for that lift in the exchange rate, larger inflows of funds from abroad and larger additions to domestic liquidity could have been expected. From another standpoint, the appreciation of the Australian dollar facilitated the lift in imports during 1980-81 which was required, other things being equal, by the sharp rise in private sector investment and the consequent need for the savings/investment identity to be equilibrated through a widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. For some purposes it is relevant to look at the movement in the 'real exchange rate' -that is, the exchange rate adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between Australia and its trading partners. Changes in real exchange rates can provide a rough indication of the effects of price and exchange rate changes on the prospects and profitability of sectors of the economy which compete with foreign producers. Although often referred to as measures of 'competitiveness', real exchange rate movements are imperfect in this respect and take no (or at least incomplete) account of a number of other influences upon international competitiveness (eg costs of international transport, the extent of competition in third markets, and non-price aspects of competitiveness) . Movements in real exchange rates can be measured in different ways depending, for example, on whether consumer price indexes, broadly based deflators or wage indexes are used, and on the basis of the weighting adopted. Moreover, such measures are essentially averages and should not be seen as necessarily typical of the experience of particular producers or industries. The measure of movements in Australia's real effective exchange rate shown in Chart 13 should be interpreted in the light of these considerable qualifications. World Economic Developments The strong performance of the Australian economy in 1980-81 occurred against a background of difficult adjustments in most industrialised economies generally associated with overly expansionary policies in the late 1970s and the sharp increases in oil prices in 1979 and 1980 which were in part facilitated by those policies. For 1980-81 the OECD area as a whole is estimated to have experienced real growth of less than 1 per cent, steadily rising unemployment, high although slowly decelerating inflation (to about 10 per cent in June 1981) and a large current account deficit with the rest of the world. Within the OECD area, there were very marked differences between individual member countries in growth, inflation and external performance. Australia and Japan grew considerably faster than most of the other industrial countries; activity in the United States in the past year or so has been uneven while in West Germany and the United Kingdom it declined. Inflation has remained high in the industrial countries but the rate of increase is now showing some signs of deceleration at a time when there is considerable upward pressure on Australia's wage rates and rate of inflation. As Chart 14 shows, wages are already increasing more rapidly than in our major trading partners while prices (as Chart 12-Movements of the Australian Dollar Against Selected Currencies and in the Trade Weighted Index(a) (1977 March quarter = 100) I ndex points 110 105 $US/$A /DM/$A 100 !

In the United States, monetary restraint and associated high interest rates, combined with a strengthening in the US current account position, contributed to a substantial rise in the value of the US dollar on foreign exchange markets during 1980-81. This appreciation has served to highlight a conflict between internal and external policy objectives in some (particularly European) countries. Governmentsin many countries have been concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on domestic activity but, at the same time, have been reluctant to allow their currencies to depreciate because of the impact that would have on inflation in their economies. In the event, most European countries have responded to the developing situation by adjusting, in varying degrees, both their interest rate and exchange rate policy instruments. The mix of economic policies, and particularly the weight presently placed on monetary policy in the United States and its implications for other countries, have been the subject of considerable discussion at international meetings recently. Many European countries, who not so long ago were strong advocates of the need for the United States to make more strenuous efforts to tackle its economic-and particularly inflationproblems, are now advocating a less stringent use of monetary policy in the United States. It remains to be seen how the United States authorities respond to these and other pressures but it is likely that, in the absence of a tightening in fiscal policy, any significant relaxation of monetary policy would put at risk the opportunity that now exists for some significant progress in reducing inflation (and hence interest rates) world-wide. The spot price for Saudi light oil fell from around $US40 per barrel in January 1981 to around $US32 per barrel in June and a number of other major producers have reduced their official prices. The OPEC producers decided against any increase at their meeting in May. Oil consumption has declined sharply in the major industrialised countries in the past year and, given the prospect of further conservation gains and the absence of serious supply disruptions, oil price increases seem unlikely to be a major source of inflationary pressure in the period immediately ahead. The oil price rises of the past two years are, however, continuing to pose some difficult adjustment problems, especially for many non-oil producing developing countries. The OECD current account deficit with the rest of the world more than doubled from $US35 billion in 1979 to $US75 billion in 1980. In 1,980 the oil exporting countries had a current account surplus of about $US120 billion while the non-oil developing countries had a deficit of about $US55 billion. The combined current account deficit of the OECD area is likely to decline gradually over the next year but, in the absence of more effective adjustment policies, that of the non-oil developing countries is expected to deteriorate further. PART II-POLlCY OBJECTIVES AND THE BUDGET STRATEGY Background A major objective of economic policy in Australia over the past several years has been to reduce the rate of inflation and to re-establish conditions conducive to sustained expansion of private sector activity. Various policies have been pursued-although not always in unison-with that objective in mind. Table 19 provides an indication of the changing emphasis placed on different policies over the years. It also shows that the strong recovery of the past two years has occurred in association with a substantial reduction in the Commonwealth's Budget deficit.

Compared with the mid-1970s, the rate of inflation-w-ile still too high-is now much lower and profitability has improved. Australia's in-ernational competitiveness seems to have been restored to about where it was in the early 1970s. The strengthening of private sector activity over the past two years or so can be attributed in no small way to the general anti-inflationary thrust of the policies which have brought about these improvements and have helped, in so doing, to create a more favourable economic and investment climate. Changes in relative energy .prices, which have favoured development of resources with which Australia is generQusly endowed, have also contributed to this economic recovery. These latter changes -re in some respects fortuitous but the speed and vigour with which investors have moved to take advantage of Australia's increased comparative advantage in the energy-related resource sector owes a good deal to steps having been taken earlier to re-establish the precconditions for a high level of investment, in resource and non-resource areas alike.; The progress that has been achieved in recent years is one good reason for persisting with the same basic strategy in the years immediately ahead. At the same time, its appropriateness needs to be assessed against current and prospective developments. As to the latter, perhaps the main points to note are that the economy is now growing strongly, the much heralded resource-based investment boom has been taking solid shape, and inflation is threatening to take off again. These developments are not, of course, unrelated. Part III of this Statement attempts some broad quantification of the main likely trends in the economy in 1981-82. Here it is sufficient to observe that further strong growth is in prospect, with the main impetus continuing to come from an exceptionally strong surge in private investment expenditure, but with private consumption remaining buoyant. A turnaround this year in farm production seems likely to add to this growth, in contrast to both 1979-80 and 1980-81. The two other developments referred to-inflation and resource investment-are important elements of the context in which the Budget has been framed and warrant some elaboration. The Outlook for Inflation Despite the progress that had been made in establishing a more favourable environment, the rate of inflation remains high. Taking the non-farm product deflator as a broad measure, the inflation rate came down from a peak of 22 per cent in 1974-75 to around 8 per cent in 1977-78 and 1978-79. Since then it has drifted upwards, to between 10 and 11 per cent in 1980-81, while inflationary expectations have lost their earlier downward momentum. The source of this reversal to the earlier progress came first from overseas, with substantial rises in oil and other commodity prices through the course of 1978-79 and into 1979-80. Subsequently, however, thmain upward pressure on prices has come from domestically generated wage increases; average earnings rose by close to 14 per cent over the course of 1980 and by an estimated 13 1/2 per cent in 1980-81 as a whole. At least in the immediate future it is likely that external factors-slack world trading conditions (including in oil markets), increased competition among international suppliers and the continuing benefits of the appreciation of the Australian dollar during 1980-81 -will exert a moderating influence on the domestic rate of inflation. What is required is that domestic policies be appropriate to re-inforce that external influence and, in so doing, guard against the inflationary consequences of an overly rapid expansion of the economy and an associated burgeoning of wage claims. Because for a number of years there has been an evident deficiency, rather than excess, of economic growth relative to the potential of the economy, there is perhaps a risk both of being too slow to recognise potential danger signals and of not appreciating how quickly such signals can be followed by an acceleration of price and wage inflation. Some signals of this kind are already appearing, especially in the non-dwelling construction sector where investment plans seem to be outstripping available capacity. Reports of construction delays, lengthening delivery times for materials and manufactured components, and shortages of certain categories of professional and skilled labour are becoming more frequent. In this sector, and more generally, competition among employers seeking to attract and retain skilled labour is already leading, and is likely to continue to lead in the period ahead, to offers of higher wages to some categories of workers. This is ofcourse additional to the continual wage pressures exerted by sections of the trade union movement in industries or occupations where withdrawal of labour has most uncomfortable effects for employers and the community at large and where, in consequence, the monopoly power of trade unions in wage bargaining is also great. While some wage rises can be justified on economic grounds, problems are created when those rises flow on to the rest of the work-force on the basis of so-called 'comparative wage justice' considerations. The recent abandonment of the wage indexation principles could help to slow down such flow-ons, provided firm anti-inflationary macroeconomic policies are in place. Another danger is that a continuing high level of inflation will come to be widely accepted as something the community can 'live with'. Those whose incomes and financial transactions are more or less effectively adjusted for increases in prices, either by automatic indexation formulae or otherwise, are perhaps most susceptible to this line of thought. Those who rely wholly or partly on fixed incomes, or who are unable to obtain increases in income to match price increases, or \¥ho are unable to obtain jobs because of the effect of inflation in curtailing employment opportunities, would be justified in holding a different view, even in terms of narrow self interest. It is perhaps largely a social and political phenomenon-but one ,certainly not without its economic rami fications-that,the former group has tended to become larger relative to the latter in recent years. Certainly, if the viewpoint of that former group (as characterised above) were to come to hold sway over inflationary expectations, there would be a high risk of the recovery in activity, nurtured initially by declining inflationary expectations, losing much of its present momentum. The experience of the mid-1970s amply illustrates the consequences for an economy when wage demands become excessive and inflationary expectations are geared to accelerating price increases. The resultant uncertainty among consumers and investors leads, inevitably, to a decline in investment and economic activity and a loss of job opportunities-not only directly but also indirectly through the effects of the policy actions that eventually have to be taken to restore some balance in the economy. The downward trend which now seems to be emerging in rates of inflation overseas is a further powerful reason for ensuring that policy resumes a stance of bearing down hard upon inflation at home. As indicated in Part I, wages in Australia increased at a rate below the average recorded in our major trading partner countries in 1979 but that advantage was lost during 1980 and, if present trends were to continue, the margin against Australia would widen further in 1981. A similar, though lagged, pattern is apparent in prices; Australia's inflation rate is now shaping to rise as fast as or faster than the average for our major trading partner countries in 1981 In principle, differences in inflation among countries can, over time, be compensated for by movements in exchange rates, leaving international competitiveness unchanged. Such exchange rate adjustments do not, however, diminish the adverse effects of higher inflation on the domestic economy. Nor is there any guarantee, in practice, that in the short-term exchange rate changes will synchronise with differences in the rate of inflation. The variations experienced in international competitiveness in Australia and other countries over the course of the 1970s demonstrate how far the two can diverge in circumstances where other factors (such as relative interest rates and resource endowments) also exert an influence on the balance of payments and the exchange rate. Current and prospective developments in the resource sector will require adjustment in the structure of the Australian economy. The benefits of those developments can be maximised, and the costs of adjustment minimised, by policies which reduce inflation and facilitate adjustment. Conversely, those costs would be very substantial indeed if this inevitable adjustment were left to come about through a loss of competitiveness generated by domestic inflation: they would involve forgoing much of the prospective benefits of the developments in the resource sector and, in all likelihood, bring many of them to a halt. Resource Investment The current surge in investment in resource projects is but the latest in a series which have occurred intermittently throughout Australia's history. The important differences from the last 'mining boom' of the late 1960s, however, are that inf}.ation was then running at between 3 and 4 per cent annually, compared with about 10 per cent now, and that the public sector is now commanding about 38 per cent of total resources, compared with about 32 per cent at that time. Developments in the resource sector cannot sensibly be considered and assessed separately from developments in the rest of the economy. For example, the extent to which that sector's requirements for labour and capital are satisfied, and the implications of those requirements for wages and interest rates, will depend crucially on what is in prospect in other sectors-including, in particular, what influence is being exerted upon that prospect by economic policies. Detailed consideration of these issues is outside the scope of this document but several general points can be made. First, the large investment now occurring in coal, natural gas, uranium, aluminium and other energy-related activities has the potential to add substantially to Australian real incomes and living standards. For the most part this investment is based on activities where, largely because of the changes in relative energy prices during the past decade, Australia has come to have a significant and seemingly durable comparative advantage. It is therefore in our national interest to see that those activities which possess distinct advantages in terms of efficiency and competitiveness are allowed access to the resources they need to the maximum extent consistent with other objectives, including the need to contain and reduce inflationary pressures. Secondly, in a situation where there are already strains on certain categories of real resources (especially skilled tradesmen) and on financial resources, the provision of more 'room' for investments in these naturally efficient areas will require that the expenditure plans of other areas be restrained. The shape of the Budget-and of public expenditures in Australia more generally-is obviously very relevant here, as are policies in a number of other areas. Thirdly, the task of putting the investments in place and facilitating the inevitable structural changes involved without exacerbating inflationary. pressures and causing other undesirable repercussions for the rest of the economy is but the first step; equally important is the task of ensuring that the potential thereby created to improve living standards for all sections of the Australian community, and not only for those directly involved, is satisfactorily realised. This will require that, while being consistent with the continuing overall objective of reducing inflation, policies in relation to such areas as foreign investment, protection and taxation also be effectively directed to that end. Finally, it is worth observing that, although it will be some time yet before the resource projects now under construction are in full operation and earning substantial additional export income, they are already contributing-directly and indirectly-to the improvements in activity, employment and confidence now evident in the economy. Budget Policy It is against the background of re-emerging inflationary pressures including, in particular, mounting pressures on wages, that economic policies for 1981-82 have to be formulated. Given some recent escalation of wage claims and settlements, it is perhaps already too late to prevent some short-term escalation of price increases. If so, that makes it all the more imperative that policies generally be directed towards reducing the underlying rate of inflation. Budget policy and public sector policy more generally can contribute to the anti-inflation task in several ways. As a first step policy can seek, by reducing public sector demands, to make more 'room' for private sector activities to expand within an acceptable degree of pressure on real reSOUTces. In addition, by further reducing the Budget deficit and the total public sector borrowing requirement, fiscal policy can ease pressures on financial markets and assist in regaining firm control over the monetary aggregates so that financial conditions bear down on the rate of inflation, rather than accommodate it. The 'real' and 'financial' implications of any Budget are, of course, inter-related. As to the former, the view that public sector demands should be restrained to make room for the expanding level of private sector activity is based, at the simplest level, on the realisation that it is not possible to get a quart out of a pint pot. Otherwise-that is, if the public sector were to continue to make heavy demands on limited national resources-the economic outlook is such that inflationary strains could only be averted by severely curtailing private demand. The total public sector's expenditure on goods and services has declined slightly as a proportion of GDP since the mid-1970s-almost entirely because of a declining Commonwealth share-but that proportion remains well above what it was in the 1960s and early 1970s, when private sector activity was last expanding strongly and when in any case the subsequent march of events may suggest, with hindsight, that the proportion was already too great to be sustainable over the longer term. Reference has been made earlier to the pressures now evident in the construction sector. The decisions of the June 1981 Loan Council meeting should be seen as one respohse to those pressures. The overall growth in Loan Council borrowing programs has been limited to 6.6 per cent in 1981-82 compared with 8.8 per cent in 1980-81. As part of that attitude of restraint, the Commonwealth Government has also put to the States that present circumstances require a more searching evaluation of the priority to be attached to different forms of public expenditure, including public works expenditures, and that wherever possible infrastructure should be provided by the private sector rather than the public sector. The basis of the latter approach is the belief that it is the private users who are in the best position to evaluate the requirements for certain kinds of infrastructure and, given those requirements, to assess the cost effectiveness of alternative projects. Not all infrastructure spending can be hived off in this way, of course, and there are clearly greater opportunities for doing so when infrastructure is related largely to particular private sector projects or to activities which might more efficiently be carried out by the private sector. Apart from possible gains in efficiency (which could be significant), whether or not shifting some infrastructure projects to the private sector would reduce total demands on resources depends on the relative priority the private sector attaches to these particular projects. In other words, those projects would be tested by the discipline of the market (of which profits provide the touch-stone) against other competing projects. In the public sector, such a discipline either does not apply at all, or if it does, applies only in a much vitiated form. Yet it is by concentrating on the most cost-effective projects that the community stands to reap the maximum gains in real income from its limited, resources of labour and capital. It has been suggested that the Government's concern to make 'room' for private sector expansion implies that the economy is now constrained in some way from growing at the relatively rapid rates achieved in the late 1960sand early 1970sAnother variant of that suggestion has been that the Government is in some sense 'afraid' of the prosperity and growth that has lately been emerging. Perhaps the main point to be noted in response to such suggestions concerns the two major differences, which have been mentioned already, between those earlier periods and the present situation. These are, first, that the underlying rate of inflation is now very much higher and, secondly, that the public sector's call on resources is relatively much larger. Both factors imply that there are at present constraints on the rate of growth that can be achieved on any sustained basis unless, inter alia, the public sector is cut back to make more 'room'. Another constraint is the speed with which an economy can lift itself out of a prolonged recession. It takes time to revitalise the capital stock and for capital and labour to shift to those sectors and regions that are providing the new stimulus to growth. The present expansion in business investment is part of that adjustment process and promises to provide the basis for higher rates of growth in activity in the years ahead. Increased trade training by employers and increased immigration of skilled labour are also helping to mobilise the labour required for a growing economy but it takes time for all those various elements to dovetail together. In the meantime there must be renewed efforts to control and.reduce inflation. It would be irresponsible to risk losing the hard won gains of recent years-and the potentially much greater gains to be had in the years ahead-by allowing both public and private sector deman.ds on resources to continue largely unchecked. Although, as indicated in Part I, the public sector borrowing requirement is now being wound back, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP, the legacy of the rapid growth in public sector borrowing in the mid-1970s is still very much in evidence in the form of a substantial accumulated stock of domestic public debt to be 'rolled over' in the years ahead. In round terms the required roll-over of public debt, excluding short term borrowings, in the three years to 1983-84 is about $9700 million. The estimate for 1981-82 is about $2900 million; while this is less than the $3400 million in 1980-81 it compares with a figure of less than $1600 million in 1979-80. The public sector borrowing requirement also depends on the choice that is made between the use of internal funds and borrowings in financing the capital programs of public enterprises. There is a need for balance between the two but in present circumstances that balance has swung too far towards reliance on borrowings and some greater degree of reliance on internal funds would help to ease present pressures on financial markets. It is sometimes suggested that another way around these financial constraints would be to fund more public borrowings overseas. Such suggestions, however, overlook the fact that oVerseas loan raisings (except in the case of those loan raisings undertaken by the Commonwealth itself as part of its external policies) involve foreign exchange transactions that inject new liquidity into the Australian economy. That is, to the extent that they are not matched by higher imports (that would not otherwise occur in any case) they add directly to the money supply. This additional injection can be left in the system-in which case it will add to the money supply and to general inflationary pressures-or the authorities can seek to neutralise it by additional sales of government securities. The latter response would of course also exert upward pressure on interest rates, with essentially the same effect as if -ttempts were made to have the projects concerned financed domestically. There is, in short, no escape from the need to restrain the growth in the public sector's borrowing requirement if firm control is to be achieved and maintained over the monetary aggregates. The clear conclusion, therefore, is that, just as total demands on real resources need to be restrained if they are not to exceed the supplies available, so total demands for loanable funds must also be restrained if they are not to surge ahead of the loanable funds becoming available in the community. A Balanced Approach to Policy The Budget is clearly a central policy instrument, both in its own right and in its contribution to the achievement of the objectives of monetary policy. The latter is, of course, of crucial importance and, in a more general sense, unless the growth of monetary aggregates can be reduced consistently over a run of years there can be no real prospect of winding back the rate of inflation to a more acceptable level. This task, in turn, will be facilitated by an appropriate degree of flexibility in respect of interest rate and exchange rate movements. Failure to achieve the monetary projections in recent years, despite large reductions in the Budget deficit and substantial movements in interest rates and the exchange rate, serves to illustrate the difficulty of maintaining this necessary flexibility under present institutional arrangements. This means that the further large reduction in the Budget deficit must be complemented by appropriate policies elsewhere in order to achieve a balanced and compatible mix of policies. Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies are twin imperatives for reducing inflation. However, to the extent that such policies can be supplemented by other actions which, by restraining demands or increasing supplies, also work to reduce inflation the short term costs of pursuing firm fiscal and monetary policies can be lessened. Other policies which can operate, either directly or indirectly, to ameliorate excess demand pressures or exert downward pressure on the general price level can also be brought into play. It needs only a moment's thought to see that, in a situation where burgeoning private demand is outrunning the availability of supplies within Australia to meet that demand at existing price and cost levels, two responses are possible. The first-to make more 'room' for that private demand to expand, by restraining the growth of demands from the public sector-has already been noted. The second, clearly, is to undertake measures to increase the availability of supplies by providing greater access to imports of goods and services, and not least labour, from overseas. In this respect, the Government is committed to sending a reference to the lAC requiring it to report within six months on possible methods of further general reductions in protection and is eliminating the additional preference for Australian goods in Government purchasing, except in respect of certain defence-strategic industries. Action on those fronts can help to reduce inflation and inflationary expectations, although it would not obviate the need to adopt firm fiscal and monetary policies. In the period ahead those latter policies will have a particular bearing on the outcome for wages. With the abandonment of the wage indexation principles on 31 July there are opportunities for imparting a greater degree of flexibility into wage setting practices and for enabling rates of pay to be determined more by market forces. At the same time, however, the build up in wage pressures which led to the collapse of the indexation system can be seen at least in part as a reflection of buoyant labour market conditions. Changes in wage determination procedures, per se, will not remove those pressures. Irrespective of the nature of the institutional arrangeinents, macro-economic policies will need to be set more firmly towards influencing the general environment in which wage bargaining, and wage settlements, between employers and employees occur. PART III THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, 1981-82 This Part provides an assessment of the economic outlook for the year ahead against the background of the recent strong growth in demand and employment and the thrust of excessive wage increases. Containing this threat, with its attendant implications for prices, profitability and employment, seems certain to pose major challenges in 1981-82. Indeed, given the pressures already in the pipeline, firm policies will be necessary to hold the increase in earnings in 1981-82 to around the 13t pet cent estimated for 1980-81. As always, the underlying forecasts are surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty. This is particularly true of the wages area; the significance of recent developments in the wages field can only be assessed as events unfold, but taken at face value they would appear to enhance the possibility of more flexible wage-determination processes. However that may turn out to be, it is quite clear that, over the medium term, the consequences for inflation will depend crucially on the nature of the economic policies adopted now and on the extent to which they are followed through. Forecasting Framework For forecasting purposes it is necessary to make a number of assumptions,including assumptions about the thrust and timing of economic policy. So far as fiscal policy is concerned, the parameters of the Budget are now known; they point to a marked and very appropriate tightening on this front. This is perhaps most evident in the further substantial reduction in the deficit. Other relevant aspects of the Budget parameters include: a large increase in the Budget domestic surplus, which is estimated to rise from $429 million in 1980-81 to $1542 million in 1981-82; increases of 12.6 per cent in total outlays and 11.3 per cent in direct expenditure on goods and services, compared with 14.6 and 23.2 per cent respectively in 1980-81 (I); an increase of 15.5 per cent in cash benefit payments, compared with a 13.3 per cent increase in 1980-81, with the extra payday adding about 2 per cent to the 1981-82 increase; growth in household income tax payments of 18.9 per cent compared with 16.6 per cent in 1980-81-the larger increase mainly reflecting offsets to income tax collections in 1980-81 associated with increases in dependant rebates in that year and the removal of the tax surcharge from December 1979; and an estimated increase in Commonwealth indirect taxes (on a national accounts basis) of 14.1 per cent compared with a rise of 16.5 per cent in 1980-81, but with sales tax collections, rather than crude oil levy receipts providing the major source of growth. (I) The estimates for direct expenditure on goods and services are on a national accounts basis which, among other adjustments, records defence expenditure on a deliveries rather than a payments basis; the increase for 1980.81 was boosted by the arrival of two frigates. On a payments basis, the growth in direct expenditure on goods and services in 1981·82 is estimated at 15.1 per cent compared with 17.8 per cent in 1980·81. Apart from the Budget estimates, the main assumptions underlying this outlook are that: policy instruments will be adjusted to ensure that· growth in the monetary aggregates is constrained to a rate consistent with an in'crease in M3 in the range 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82-the decisions in relation both to Com-9nwealth bond r.ates and bank lendi-g ratin the 'controlled' area which were --riounced followmg the Loan Council meetmg on 13 August, 1981 are relevant in fhis regard; wotId economic activity and trade will remain slack, With growth of, at most, 2 p-r cent in real gross domestic product in the OECD area as a whole in 1981-82 compared with less than 1 per cent in 1980-81; inflation as measured by the consumption deflator will ease to around 9t per cent in the OECD area as a whole in 1981 -82, following an increase of about 11 per cent in 1980-81, with little if any upward pressure on oil prices; and receht rains will produce more normal seasonal conditions allowing the sharp decline in farm production that occurred in 1980-81 to be reversed. The forecasts on which this part of the Statement are based attempt to depict the most likely outcome, given the forecasting assumptions and available information. It should be appreciated, however, that these forecasts lie within wide ranges of uncertainty and are based on statistical data which, in some cases, are subject to substantial revisions. Most attention should therefore be paid to the broad thrust of the assessment, rather than to particular forecasts for individual items. General Outlook Both aggregate demand and wages developed considerable momentum in 1980-81 and both are projected to continue to increase fairly rapidly in 1981-82. As in 1980-81, private business investment is expected to be a major influence on demand, although private consumption is also likely to remain buoyant. While generally restrictive policies aimed at containing the rate of inflation have been assumed, private domestic demand is still forecast to increase by between 4 and 4t per cent in 1981-82, compared with the strong 5.4 per cent estimated for 1980-81. Given that it is likely to take some time for the assumed policy environment to bear down on wage movements, cost pressures from that source are likely to remain strong in 1981-82. The revenue measures announced in the Budget will also contribute to the increase in price indicators in the short term. Stated briefly, the outlook for 1981-82 is for: some slowing in the growth of real gross non-farm product to between 3 and 3t per cent, mainly reflecting slightly less rapid expansion in business investment after the exceptionally sharp burst in 1980-81, and a slower rise in public expenditure; growth in real GDP of more than 3t per cent, the increase from the 3 per cent in 1980-81 reflecting the projected recovery in farm output; some modest recovery in exports, after afaB of about 8 per cent in 1980-81, and continued strong growth in imports; some easing in the rate of growth in employment to around 2 per cent and little change in the average level of unemployment; an increase in average weekly earnings of around 13-!per cent, which would be similar to that estimated for 1980-81; a rise of around lOt per cent in the Consumer Price Index, of which t of a percentage point would be attributable to changed health care arrangements and a similar amount to higher Commonwealth indirect taxes; an increase in the non-farm product deflator of around lOt per cent, or about the same as that implied in the estimates for 1980-81; a marked slowing in export and import prices; a widening in the current account deficit (implying a slight rise to about 4t per cent as a propprtion of GDP) but, with high private capital inflow a surplus on private exterrial transactions of a broadly similar order of magnitude to that recorded in 1980-81. Some of the mairicomponents of this summary outlook are elaborated upon in the following sections. Expenditures Private consumption expenditure is estimated to have increased by 3.2 per cent in real terms in 1980-81 and a slightly faster increase is projected in 1981-82. Real household disposable income is estimated to grow by about 3 per cent in both years. The 'nonfarm' saving ratio is estimated to have increased in 1980-81, against a downward trend evident since 1974-75; this largely reflected the sharp rise in consumers' incomes and the usual lag in translating that into increased consumption spending. That lagged response will tend to boost consumption expenditure in 1981-82 but the further strong growth in nominal incomes will tend to hold up household saving. The response in household saving will also hinge upon the success of policy throughout the year in dampening the inflationary expectations otherwise associated with the recent surge in wage pressures. The projected growth in private consumption in 1981-82 is broadly consistent with no change in the 'non farm' saving ratio. Farmincomes and saving appear likely to recover in 1981-82, after declining in 1980-81. Private dwelling investment again grew very rapidly in 1980-81, with much of the growth occurring in respect of multi-unit dwellings. Present estimates indicate arise of almost 11 per cent in real terms, after a rise of 10 per cent in 1979-80. There have been signs of considerable investment and speculative activity in this area, with building running ahead of both the availability of finance from the major mortgage lenders and the underlying rate of growth of demand for new dwellings. Finance approvals by major mortgage lenders declined in the second half of 1980-81, in part because of lags in adjusting administered interest rates to changes in capital markets. Reflecting these developments, and assumed monetary restraint consistent with growth in M3 of 10 to 11 per cent, investment in dwellings is estimated to decline in 1981-82 but still remain at a relatively high level; this forecast assumes that administered housing interest rates are adjusted in line with movements in interest rates generally. Further strong growth in business fixed investment is expected in 1981-82. The forecasts are based largely on the investment expectations of private enterprises surveyed by the ABS in April-May 1981; these pointed to especially rapid growth in respect of non-dwelling construction in 1981-82 (see Chart 15). Realised expenditures grew rather more strongly in 1980-81 than had been expected on the basis of past relationships but, with constraints on capacity now emerging, that is unlikely to be the case in 1981-82. Overall, and after allowance for modest growth in rural investment (which is not covered in the expectations data), private investment in non-dwelling construction is forecast to grow by around 20 per cent in real terms in 1981-82. The expectations data suggest rather more modest growth in investment in equipment in 1981-82 than in non-dwelling construction. In 1980-81 the realisation of investment expectations was relatively low in this area, but this appears to have reflected delays of one kind or another, rather than domestic supply constraints. The forecasts assume a somewhat greater realisation of expectations in 1981-82 compared with 1980-81 and, after allowance for areas not covered by the expectations survey, suggest a rise in equipment investment of around 10 per cent in real terms. Overall, these forecasts imply another very strong rise in real business investment of between 10 and 15 per cent in 1981-82, following a 21 per cent rise in 1980-81. Many factors will influence the level of public sector activity in 1981-82, including the Commonwealth Budget provisions, the approved Loan Council borrowing programs, the pattern of defence deliveries and the ability of the States and authorities to finance expenditures from their own sources. The national accounts estimate in 1980-81 of Commonwealth consumption expenditure (which is on a deliveries basis) was boosted by the arrival of two frigates; this largely accounts for the estimated real growth of 9 per cent. The Budget provides for a real increase of 5 per cent in defence outlays in 1981-82 but the arrival of the frigates last year means that, on a national accounts basis and after allowance for the extra payday, Commonwealth consumption spending overall could show a modest decline this year. Tota/public current expenditure is forecast to show little growth in 1981-82, following an estimated 4 per cent increase in 1980-81, while total public investment expenditure is likely to be little changed, after declining by 1 per cent in 1980-81. This would mean that total public sector expenditure on goods and services would rise by less than 1 per cent in real terms in 1981-82, compared with 2.6 per cent in 1980-81. On the basis of these forecasts the ratio of total public sector expenditure on goods and services to GDP would decline from about 24.5 per cent in 1980-81 to about 24 per cent in 1981-82. Non-farm stocks rose significantly in the first half of 1980-81 but were run down in the second half of the year. While there is likely to be some rebound in aggregate terms in 1981-82, stocks could be further run down in those sectors of the economy where there are pressures on domestic supplies. Pressures on profits, combined with projected tight monetary conditions, would tend to encourage economies in stock management. Overall, non-farm stock movements could detract slightly from growth in activity in 1981-82. Farm stocks were run down further in 1980-81 as a result of the drought but are expected to recover in 1981-82 pending the recovery of export shipments.

These figures are not published by the Statistician. but are available on request and are published in the Treasury publication Round-up oj Economic Statistics. _Balance of Payments While domestic demand is expected to remain strong during 1981-82, foreign demand is likely to remain subdued. The continued sluggishness in world economic activity is expected to lead to only modest growth in the volume of exports of goods and services this year following an 8 per cent decline in 1980-81. Little growth is expected in the volume of rural exports, which will be constrained by the continuing impact of the recent drought on livestock numbers and on carry-over stocks of grains. Modest growth in the volume of non-rural exports is expected, although that partly reflects a recovery from the effect on exports of the coal strike early in 1980-81. Rural export prices in 1981-82 are not expected to change much from the average prices for 1980-81. Prices of non-rural exports are expected to show a slight rise in 1981-82, reflecting in part increased coal prices. The expected strength of domestic demand in 1981-82, especially in investment expenditure, is likely to result in further strong growth in the volume of imports of goods and services. Increased importing is also likely to be encouraged by some further deceleration of import prices in 1981-82 associated with increased competition among overseas suppliers, the prospect of lower inflation in our major trading partners, and the continuing effects of the appreciation of the Australian dollar in 1980-81, especially in the latter months of that year. Reduced deliveries of defence equipment and a lower volume of petroleum imports in 1981-82 are expected to be broadly offset by increased imports of civil aircraft and the importation of several oil rigs. Given these developments in exports and imports, the trade balance is expected to show a larger deficit in 1981-82. This, together with continued growth in the net invisibles deficit, is likely to raise the current account deficit relative to GDP to a level slightly greater than the 4-1per cent estimated for 1980-81. The wider current account deficit in prospect for 1981-82 should again permit domestic demand to grow somewhat faster than gross domestic product, though to a lesser extent than in 1980-81. In this way, the external sector will continue to play an important role in easing domestic demand pressures (jnel uding price pressures). Net apparent private capital inflow is expected to continue at a high level in 1981-82. Given effective action to avoid a continuing acceleration in wage costs and domestic inflation, the basic factors underlying the recovery in foreign investment borrowings and equity investments related to major resource developments and Australia's relatively stable political and economic climate -should again be evident in 1981-82. In short, while the outlook for the balance of payments is always surrounded with considerable uncertainties, the information presently available suggests that, on the assumption that appropriate domestic economic policies are pursued, the current account deficit in 1981-82 should again be readily financed by capital inflow. Monetary Conditions As indicated in the Budget Speech, the Government will be seeking to restrain growth of M3 to between 10 and 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82. Although the objective has, as previously, been set in terms of M3, the framing of monetary conditions consistent with the need to reassert downward pressure both on inflation and inflationary expectations will require that all the monetary aggregates grow much less rapidly than they have in recent years. The planned large reduction in the Commonwealth's Budget deficit in 1981-82 will facilitate the attainment of the monetary projection. Because of that reduction, total net borrowing by the public sector is likely to be considerably lower than in 1980-81 despite some increase in borrowings by State and local authorities. Expressed in relation to the size of the economy, the reduction could be from just over 3 per cent of GDP last year to around 2 per cent. Against that, net borrowing by the corporate sector (defined as the difference between gross saving and gross capital expenditures) is likely to be boosted by further strong growth in investment at a time when profit margins are likely to be under downward pressure. This requirement could rise to over 3 per cent of GOP in 1981-82 compared with just over 2 per cent in 1980-81. With the prospect of little change in the net lending position of households as a proportion of GOP, these various propositions suggest that net borrowing from the rest of the world (basically the deficit on current account of the balance of payments) would also tend to be broadly similar as a proportion of GOP to that realised in 1980-81. The extent to which this net borrowing requirement is financed by private capital inflow will depend, inter alia, on the balance of domestic and internal policies adopted in pursuit of the projected tightening in monetary conditions. Pressures on capital markets seem likely to remain in 1981-82. However, the combined effect of the substantial reduction in the Budget deficit and the increases in government security yields announced on 13th August will make a major contribution to easing those pressures, settling the markets and restraining monetary growth. Gross Domestic Product In 1981-82 economic growth is again expected to stem mainly from private final domestic demand, with the forecast recovery in exports and farm production also contributing. On present indications non-farm product could grow by between 3 and 3t per cent in 1981-82, following an estimated increase of 4 per cent in 1980-81. Given the recovery in farm product, gross domestic product would rise by more than 3+ per cent, compared with 3 per cent in 1980-81. Labour Market Against the background of an expected slowing in the rate of growth in non-farm product in 1981-82, there is likely to be some slowing also in employment growth. The less buoyant outlook forecast for company profits also tends to suggest some moderation in the pace of execution of investment plans and, for/that and other reasons, more moderate growth in employment. The forecasts provide for growth in total employment of about 2 per cent in 1981-82, compared with 2.6 per cent in 1980-81. Wage and salary earner employment in 1981-82 is estimated to grow at a similar rate to the total and that rate has been adopted in the Budget estimates for PA YE collections. While the average participation rate in 1980-81 was higher than in 1979-80, the previous strong upward trend was interrupted over the course of the year. The reasons for this apparent change are not clear but, on the assumption that the upward trend is not resumed, the participation rate would be little changed in 1981-82. Combined with the more moderate rate of growth in employment, such an outcome would lead to some rise in unemployment over the course of 1981-82, although the average level for the year as a whole would be much the same as in 1980-81 and there would be a slight fall in unemployment expressed as a proportion of the labour force. Consistent with this picture, and an assumed further rise in the ratio of the number receiving benefits to the number unemployed, the Budget estimates allow for a slight rise in the average number of unemployment benefit recipients in 1981-82. Incomes and Prices Reference has been made to mounting wage pressures and to the uncertainties currently surrounding wage determination processes. At this time, however, it appears likely that wage pressures already have sufficient momentum to impose some inflationary strains on the economy over the course of 1981-82. The maintenance of firm macro-economic policies consistent with the sharply reduced Budget deficit and growth in M3 of 10 to 11 per cent will help to contain these pressures. Their containment would be further assisted by more direct action at the micro-economic policy level, designed to produce a more competitive domestic environment within which wage bargaining proceeds. Even so, it is likely to take some time to relieve the recent strengthening in wage pressures. Accordingly, average weekly earnings (male units basis) are forecast to rise by 13t per cent in 1981-82, much the same as the present estimate for 1980-81, when wage rises were boosted throughout the year by the effects of 'work value' increases. In present circumstances, there is more uncertainty than usual attached to this particular forecast. The Budget estimates for P AYE tax collections in 1981-82 also assume a 13t per cent increase in average weekly earnings. The changed arrangements for health care, which come into effect on 1 September 1981, are estimated to add about t of a percentage point to the overall increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in 1981-82. The increases in indirect taxes announced in the Budget are estimated to add another t of a percentage point. Higher State and local government charges could also add to the rise in the CPI in 1981-82. On the other hand, the moderating trend in import prices should continue to have a significant beneficial effect on the rate of inflation in Australia this year. As indicated in Part I, the implicit deflator for imports of goods decelerated sharply in 1980-81 and, with oil and other primary commodity prices generally likely to be fairly flat, import prices are forecast to decelerate further in 1981-82, while export price rises are also likely to be modest. On top of all these factors, wage increases, both past and prospective, will be working to increase consumer prices in 1981-82. While firm monetary restraint will help to dampen the response of prices to higher wage costs, present indications are that the CPI could increase by around lOt per cent in 1981-82 as a whole, compared with a rise of 9.4 per cent for 1980-81 as a whole. The implicit deflator for private consumption expenditure, which is not affected by the changed health care arrangements and which gives a slightly lower weight to the indirect tax increases, is forecast to rise by around 9t per cent in 1981-82, compared with an 8.9 per cent increase last year. The most broadly based indicator of price and cost pressures in the economy, the non-farm product def/a-or, which reflects these and other influences, including export prices, is forecast to rise by around lOt per cent-much the same rate as shown for 1980-81. These forecasts imply that wages will again rise more rapidly than prices in 1981-82. On the basis of the present estimates for 1980-81 and forecasts for 1981-82, average weekly earnings adjusted by the private consumption deflator (which provides a measure of real earnings) would rise by around 7t per cent over the two years. An important part of the estimated 4t per cent rise in real earnings in 1980-81 derived from subdued traded goods prices brought about by the depressed state of world trade and the appreciation of the exchange rate, which held down (and is likely to go on holding down) prices of imports and import-competing goods. This appreciation also held down receipts of exporters so that wage earners have secured gains over this period through a redistribution of income away from the export and import competing sectors. In effect, wage earners have been able to anticipate some of the real income increases likely to be associated with future increases in production stemming from resourrce developments. Those gains can be sustained only as long as those future increases in production are in fact forthcoming and only as long as they are not sought 'twice' by further real earnings claims at that time (e.g. by so-called 'productivity' wage claims based upon some 'Aladdin's cave' theory of real income distribution). Over the same two years the increase in average weekly earnings deflated by the non-farm product deflator, which provides a measure of the real cost of labour as a factor of production, seems likely to be around 5t per cent. These numbers imply an erosion of profit margins in 1981-82 that would more than offset the rise that occurred in 1980-81. Overview The year ahead poses major challenges for economic management. In 1980-81 slack world activity and the drought retarded what was nevertheless a substantial expansion in demand. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong in 1981-82. The central challenge to policy at this time is represented by the substantial wage and price pressures in the pipeline. Firm policy action will be needed to contain these pressures. The basic framework for such action bas been laid by this Budget and by the decisions announced following the Loan Council meeting of 13 August-decisions taken within the framework of the monetary projection for 1981-82. Particularly given the present momentum behind wage claims, however, the year ahead is likely to be one in which efforts are chiefly directed to the prevention of further deterioration in the underlying inflationary situation. In that respect, the fruits of the firm policy action now in train are unlikely to be garnered until 1982-83. Page Summary 126 1. Defence 129 2. Education 134 3. Health 147 4.

These payments are made fortnightly. There are 26 fortnightly payments in most years but in 1981-82 there will be 27 paydays. The additional pay occurs, on average, only once in about twelve years. (Thus a public servant whose annual rate of salary remained unchanged throughout the year would receive about 0.3 per cent less than his annual salary in most years but some 3.5 per cent more than his salary in 1981-82.) The effect of an extra payday falling in 1981-82 is to boost the recorded rate of growth of total outlays in 1981-82 above the underlying rate of growth in spending. Precise estimates for the effects of the extra payday on individual pensions ,alld' benefits and departmental and statutory authorities' wage and salary estimates are-Qr'i available, but an approximate indication of the influence of payday effects on the'growth in total outlays between 1980-81 and 1981-82 can be made by adjusting outlays in both years to a ""constant number of paydays"" basis. The rate of growth in outlays -("":: this basis is reduced by about 1 per cent from an unadjusted 12.6 per cent to an und-r. lying growth of about 11.5 per cent. (,: 7 The main functions affected by the additional payday are Social Security and Welfare (which include all the pensions and benefits affected and some wages and salaries), Defence (which includes all defence-related wages and salaries) and Administrative Services (which includes a number of Commonwealth departments' wages and salaries votes). All other functions are affected to some extent. The following chart gives a broad impression of the relative size of the major functional blocks of outlays and recent and projected movements in those proportions. It is emphasised that changes in the size of these functional blocks from one year to artother are affected by a number of special factors, major examples of which are changed funding arrangements in 1981-82 for Public Hospitals (in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory), for the Community Health Program and for the School Dental Scheme under which general purpose grants are to be made to the relevant States and the Northern Territory in lieu of previous specific purpose payments, large loan repayments by the Australian National Airlines Commission and the Australian Industry Development Corporation in 1979-80, the payment of an advance to Queensland in connection with the International Sugar Agreement in 1979-80 and the repayment of this advance in 1980-81, and changes in administrative arrangements, most notably those relating to the progressive transfer of functions in recent years to the Northern Territory as part of arrangements for self-government. For 1981-82 the proportions shown in the attached chart for the Health function and for Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec are both significantly affected by the revised funding arrangements for public hospitals and the Community Health Program and School Dental Scheme referred to above and should therefore be interpreted with care.

DEFENCE Consistent with the policy announced by the Government last year that there be a sustained developm,ent of the Defence Force and national defence infrastructure, outlays on Defence in 1981-82 are estimated to increase by 16.3 per cent to $4111.8 million. The provision involves a real increase over 1980-81 of about 5.3 per cent. Defence outlays are expected to rise to around 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1984-85; in 1980-81 they were 2.7 per cent and this year's estimate represents a further increase in the proportion of Defence expenditure to gross domestic product. The estimate is generally in April 1981 prices but allows for the effects of the May National Wage Case, and the June clerical officers' work value decisions, and an additional payday in 1981-82. Also included is a bulk provision of $100 million for prospective increases in wages and salaries of service and civilian defence personnel during 1981-82; provision for other price increases in 1981-82 will, as appropriate, be made in Additional Estimates later in the year. The current estimate of Defence outlays represents 10.1 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays in 1981-82. Outstanding obligations on orders placed, mainly for capital items, to be carried over to 1982-83 and later years are estimated to be $2578 million compared to $2236 million carried into 1981-82. However, it is expected that further large commitments associated with the new tactical fighter and other equipment projects will be entered into during 1981-82 which could increase the outstanding obligations at 30 June 1982 by some $2800 million. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Manpower CostsCivilian 289.4 331.4 362.4 + 31.0 ForcesNaval 239.5 277.1 309.4 + 32.3 Military 466.8 542.7 607.6 + 64.9 Air 323.0 370.6 413.1 + 42.5 Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits 177.0 199.9 235.6 + 35.7 Total 1495.7 1 721.6 1928.0 +206.4 Defence Equipment and StoresNaval Construction 266.0 223.6 202.9 20.6 Aircraft and Associated Initial Equipment 50.6 81.9 114.4 + 32.6 Armoured and Combat Vehicles, Artillery 28.6 16.3 16.1 0.3 Other 'Capital' Equipment and Stores 145.3 235.1 324.5 + 89.4 Acquisition of Boeing 707 Aircraft 3.4 0.2 0.5 + 0.3 Supporting Eq.Jipment and Stores 351.1 433.5 475.6 + 42.1 Repairs and Maintenance \08.2 134.9 158.4 + 23.4 Total 953.2 1 125.5 1292.3 +166.8 Defence Faci1itiesAdvances to the States for Service Housing 1.5 1.3 4.2 + 2.9 Other Buildings, Works, Furniture and Fittings 71.2 108.1 155.1 + 47.0 Acquisition of Sites and Buildings 12.1 5.5 16.4 + 10.9 Repairs and Maintenance 66.8 75.7 80.7 + 5.0 Total 151.5 190.6 256.5 + 65.8 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Industrial CapacityMaintenance of Production Capacity 61.3 74.7 69.8 4.9 Government Factory Operations 7.7 0.1 5.0Cr. 5.0 Other. . 41.1 51.6 83.1 + 31.4 Total 110.1 126.4 147.9 + 21.5 Defence Science and Technology Establishments 98.8 113.0 126.4 + 13.4 Defence Co-operationPapua New Guinea 14.2 15.2 14.9 0.4 Indonesia 9.6 11.9 10.8 1.1 Malaysia 2.9 3.9 4.0 + 0.1 Singapore 0.7 1.2 1.2 Other. 2.7 5.6 9.8 + 4.2 Total 30.0 37.9 40.7 + 2.8 Storage and Transport 19.0 23.3 24.7 + 1.4 General Administrative Expenditure 240.9 295.1 318.4 + 23.3 Natural Disasters, Civil Defence and Other 11.1 6.8 7.4 + 0.6 Recoveries and Repayments . . . . 102.2Cr 103.5Cr 130.4Cr 27.0 Allowance for Prospective Wage and Salary Increases ..... . 100.0 + 100.0 This category provides for the bulk of service and civilian manpower expenditure of the Department of Defence. The net increase of $206.4 million in 1981-82 reflects the effects of the January and May 1981 National Wage Case Decisions ($78.4 million), the additional payday in 1981-82 ($58.9 million), the clerical officers' work value case ($6.4 million), changes in manpower numbers, other approved increases in salaries and allowances, and increased provision for defence force retirement and death benefits ($35.7 million). The main factors in this latter increase are theannu\ll update of pension rates in July 1981 in line with the increase in the Consumeq-riceIndex of 9.4 per cent over the year to the March Quarter 1981 (estimated to cost $12.6 million) and a projected net increase of 1428 in the pensioner population. The estimates provide for service manpower increases of 1025 over the 30 June 1981 level, which will raise the permanent force strength at 30 June 1982 to 73569. ' These increases are primarily intended to enable new equipment coming into service to be adequately manned, to support increased activities and to bring the Army Operational Deployment Force at Townsville to full strength. In 1980-81 provision was made to bring the effective strength of the Army Reserve from 22500 at 1 July 1980 to the level of 30000 by 30 June 1981; which was nearly achieved. An additional $3.3 million is provided to maintain strength at 30000 in 1981-82. The civilian staff level for the Department of Defence has been set at 29 669 at 30 June 1982 which is a decrease of 725 from the actual strength at 3Q June 1981. The costs of the remaining elements of manpower are recorded under the categories 'Defence Science and Technology', 'Natural Disasters Organisation', 'Defence Cooperation', 'Naval Ship Repair and Construction' and 'Maintenance of Production Capability'. Possible costs of wage and salary increases during 1981-82 are shown in bulk in the 'Allowance for Prospective Wage and Salary Increases'. Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended 'to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, armour, artillery, etc.) is adequate to support operational activities and enhance the capacity for expansion. Outlays on 'capital' type equipment in 1981-82 are estimated at $658.4 million or $101.3 million more than in 1980-81; outstanding obligations on capitalitems to be carried over to 1982-83 and later years are estimated to be some $1400 million compared with some $1230 million carried into 1981-82. Additional large commitments are expected to be entered into during 1981-82 for major equipment projects, including the acquisition of 75 new tactical fighters, the replacement for HMAS Melbourne and the basic training aircraft. Significant components of estimated outlays in 1981-82 for previously approved equipment are $97 million on progress payments for the four FFG patrol frigates (two of which were delivered in 1980-81, the third is scheduled for delivery in 1983 and the fourth in 1984), $28 million for fast patrol craft, $33 million for the two fleet underway replenishment ships, $16 million for the defence integrated secure communications network, $70 million for the target acquisition and tracking system for the FIll, and $10 million for medium trucks for the Army. Expenditure on supporting equipment and stores such as fuel, ammunition, rations, and clothing for the maintenance of the Defence Force is estimated to increase by $42.1 million. This is due to the net effect of changed prices and exchange rates, service manpower growth, increased requirements to support the higher level of activity including patrol activity in the Indian Ocean announced by the Government in February 1980, and a selective increase in stockholdings. Outlays on repairs imd maintenance of ships, aircraft, vehicles, weapons and equipment are estimated to' increase by $23.4 million in 1981-82. This increase is due to higher costs and increased repair activities generally, including the cost of maintaining the sophisticated equipments that have come into service in recent years. Expenditure under this heading ito provide and maintain facilities, including living and working accommodation, for the Defence Force and Department of Defence, other than for Industrial Capacity and Defence Science and Technology. Advances toth-. States for the provision of new houses and improvements to existing houses for servicemen and their families are estimated at $4.2 million. Provision is also made, in 'Other Buildings, Works, Furniture and Fittings' for the construction of some 500 houses at Service establishments and in areas where rental accommodation is not readily obtainable, arid in 'Acquisition of Sites and Buildings' for the acquisition of some 100 houses from priv--e sources .. Outlays on 'Other Buildings, Works, Furniture and Fittings' are estimated to increase by 43.5 per cent in 1981-82. The major part ($131 million) of the provision is to meet progress payments on projects committed in earlier years. These include provision for modernisation of the dockyard and fleet base at Garden Island (NSW), construction of naval patrol boat bases at Darwin (NT) and Cairns (Qld), the Australian Defence Force Academy (ACT), the Army Schools complex at Bonegilla (Vic.), further development of the Army bases at Holsworthy and Randwick (NSW) and Townsville and Enoggera (Qld) and the provision of new hangars at the Naval Air Station Nowra (NSW), and at the Darwin RAAF Base (NT) to support the Tactical Fighter Force. Expenditure on new defence works projects in 1981-82 is estimated at $24 million or 15 per cent of the provision. New commencements include significant works for the development of Naval dockyards and establishments and Army and Air Force bases. Full details of these projects will be announced by the Minister for Defence in due course. Outstanding obligations to be carried over to 1982-83 and later years are estimated to be $330 million compared with $270 million carried into 1981-82. The estimated 6.6 per cent increase over 1980-81 expenditure on repairs and maintenance of facilities reflects increases in costs and the provision of $2.3 million for fitting out a building at Deakin (ACT) to accommodate a large computer. Expenditure under this heading is mainly for the retention and continuing use, in Government aircraft and munitions industries, of production capabilities and skills regarded as essential for the manufacture or support of defence materiel and equipment but for which peacetime workloads are not sufficient to enable full recovery of associated overhead costs. The subsidisation of continuing production of Nomad aircraft (of which 119 aircraft of the approved production run of 200 aircraft had been completed at 30 June 1981), the procurement of plant and machinery to maintain or upgrade industry capabilities, and the construction, modernisatiqand repair of buildings and works are provided for also. . The item also covers the purchase or manufacture of items of essential defence materiel for reserve stock holdings, the development of production techniques and new production items in the industries, and expenditures on updating facilities to allow Australian participation in the manufacture of parts for the Boeing 757 and other new aircraft projects. The Government has decided to sell the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo (Vic.), as a going concern and to sell or lease the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg (Vic.). Expenditure on defence science and technology has the objective of assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in defence technology and developing weapons and :weapon systems suited to Australia's defence needs. The estimated expenditure of $126.4 million in 1981-82 covers salaries, other administrative and operating expenses, machinery, plant, stores and works services of the defence science establishments and laboratories. Considerable effort is being devoted to activities such as the Jindalee over the-horizon radar, underwater detection aids, and electronic warfare techniques. The net increase of $13.4 million reflects effects of price and wage increase,s and increased activity on a wide range of projects. The Government has decided that direct Commonwealth involvement in these activities be reduced and the private sector and universities be encouraged to perform some tasks. There will be a consequent increase in the number of research and development projects to be contracted to Australian industry and universities. Through the Defence Co-operation Program the Government seeks to develop harmonious relations with nations in our region which share our strategic interests by promoting their independent defence capabilities through co-operative assistance. Estimated expenditure of $40.7 million in 1981-82 includes $14.9 million for defence co-operation activities with Papua New Guinea. These activities include assistance in the form of loan personnel, equipment and training, and study visits to Australia for PNG Defence Force personnel. Current projects include provision of Nomaaircraft and assistance with survey and mapping and civil engineering tasks. Provision is made for Indonesia to receive $10.8 million in assistance. This will be used for such purposes as a combined Army jRAAF survey and mapping project in Maluka Province, provision of Nomad aircraft, maintenance on the Indonesian airforce's C 130 aircraft, advisory assistance and training. Continuing assistance is provided for Malaysia ($4.0 million) and Singapore ($1.2 million). Bilateral programs place emphasis on advisory assistance in the two countries and training assistance in Australia. A large part of the allocation for 'Other' is devoted to the provision of defence assistance to countries of the South West Pacific. Increased provision is also made for project assistance, study visits, and training for the Philippines and Thailand. Provision is also made to expand training facilities and equipment for overseas students in Australia. The item provides for shipping and long term storage services on behalf of defence and for removals and storage of furniture for servicemen, civilians, and their families, on posting or transfer. The increase of $1.4 million reflects the full year effect of cost increases in 1980-81. General administrative expenditure includes rent, movement expenses, office requisites, postage and telephones, fuel, light, power and water, freight, compensation payments, training at other than defence establishments and medical and dental services. The proposed increase of $23.3 million to $318.4 million in 1981-82 reflects increases in costs and an increased level of activity particularly in the areas of training and exercises and computer support. Expenditure under this heading covers the operating expenses of the Natural Disasters Organisation, including salaries and administrative expenses, reimbursement of the States for some salaries paid to State civil defence personnel, and Commonwealth assistance in the form of equipment and stores to State and Territory Emergency Services ($5.1 million). The other significant item is outlays on maintenance of war graves ($2.3 million). The principal items provided for under this heading are rent payments made by service personnel for houses under the Defence Force Group Rental Scheme ($40.7 million), charges made for meals and accommodation provided at Defence establishments ($28.2 million), returns from disposals, and recoverable services for research and development. The increase of revenue of $27.0 million is due mainly to an increase in recoveries from other Governments arising from exercises in Australia, an increase in expected disposals revenue and higher revenues for rents and meals and accommodation. The amount required to meet prospective increases in wage and salary rates of civilian and service personnel flowing from wage adjustments (including those adjustments recommended by the Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay, which is examining work value and other pay adjustments) during 1981-82 will depend on actual increases in wage and salary rates. awarded. An allowance of $100 million has been included in the Budget estimates; the actual additional provision to be made will be reflected in additional appropriations later in the year. 2. EDUCATION Total direct outlays on education are estimated to increase by 11.1 per cent in 1981-82 to $3254.7 million, which is equivalent to 8.0 per cent· of Budget outlays. Assistance for education is also given through income tax rebates for certain expenditures on self-education and education of a taxpayer's children or dependants and through income tax deductions for some gifts to educational institutions; the cost of revenue so forgone is not included in the figures given here. Over four-fifths of the Commonwealth's direct expenditures on education are in the form of grants to the States and the Northern Territory.

In the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions and in line with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, the Government announced that it would promote a major rationalisation and reallocation of resources in higher education. This will involve the consolidation of colleges of advanced education for which teacher education is a major activity into multi-purpose or multicampus colleges with a single governing body or by integration with neighbouring universities, the phasing out of certain Victorian engineering schools (with no new students to be admitted after 1981), and a sharing of resources and collaboration between certain neighbouring universities. Th-e Government intends that the consolidation of institutions will result in genuine amalgamations with real savings in resources and has assumed such savings in determining the level of recurrent funds for 1982. As part of this rationalisation, the Government is also encouraging a redirection of effort in advanced education to the technologies and business studies. Negotiations with the States on the detailed proposals for rationalisation are continuing and there are, as at 30 June 1981, firm proposals to amalgamate 20 of the 30 institutions. Funds have been provided for the Government's 1980 election commitments for the establishment of research centres of excellence in universities, for the development of community language courses in universities and/or colleges of advanced education, and for the provision during the triennium of 350 additional basic nurse training places in colleges of advanced education, including the establishment of new pilot courses in Tasmania and Queensland. For 1982 recurrent expenditures will increase by 8.3 per cent over 1981. The 1982 provision for equipment is 20 per cent higher than in 1981 and includes an additional $4.2 million to assist institutions in replacing outdated equipment and in responding to needs arising from technological change. While the total grants for capital programs in 1982 will decline by $1.1 million, there will be some provision for high priority projects 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $mi11ion General Administrative and Other ExpenditureAdministration 21.2 24.4 26.3 + 1.8 Other 1.9 2.1 1.5 0.6 Total Administration and Other 23.1 26.5 27.8 + 1.3 Recoveries nec 1.9Cr 2.2Cr 2.2Cr+ 0.1 (a) In addition to the amount of $35.2 million for 1981-82 shown under the School to Work Transition heading, $22.9 million of the Commonwealth Schools Commission grants to the States for government schools has been earmarked for transition purposes. (b) Expenditure under the Employment Program for Unemployed Youth is included for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. It should be noted that comparisons between 1981-82 and previous years of outlays on certain program components are affected by changes in arrangements for providing for program cost increases. Previously, Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and Schools Commission programs were supplemented retrospectively in line with increases in wages, salaries and other costs; the program estimates in the Budget Papers were presented in June prices, with an estimated allowance for cost increases being included under the item 'Cost Supplementation of Grants'. From the end of 1981, automatic retrospective adjustment for these education program cost increases will cease. The announced program amounts for 1982 represent the actual cash amounts which will be provided for expenditure in that calendar year. Because education programs are funded on a calendar year basis, the 1981-82 figures cover six months under the new arrangements and six months under the retrospective adjustment approach. Thus, the July-December 1981 portion of the 1981-82 estimates is at June 1981 prices, with the estimated adjustments required to bring the grants to an outturn basis under the automatic cost supplementation arrangements being shown separately for the schools and tertiary programs. The January-June 1982 portion of the estimates is at final outturn prices. With the exception of further education in the Australian Capital Territory and some other minor items, the estimates under this heading for 1981-82 comprise the second half of the 1981 and the first half of the 1982 calendar year programs of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. Through these programs, the Commonwealth provides full. financial support for all universities and colleges of advanced education (CAEs) and assists the State and Northern Territory systems of technical and further education (TAFE). Total expenditure for the 1981-82 financial year for tertiary education is estimated at $1763.8 million, c?mpared with $1652.4 million in 1980-81. Details of the calendar 1982 program, as shown below, were announced by the Minister for Education on 4 June 1981. The 1981 program is shown for comparison purposes. Both sets of figures are estimated actual expenditure. Because payments are to commence in 1982 as a result of a lower expenditure commitment to ongoing projects. The Government has decided to reintroduce fees on a limited basis for students commencing second and higher degrees from 1982 (except for recognised combined degrees and diplomas). The revenue in 1982 is estimated to be $4 million; this is expected to rise to $20 million in 1984. Student load in universities and colleges of advanced education built up rapidly in the decade to the mid-1970s but has tended to remain stable since that time; this relative stability is seen as continuing in the medium term. Current trends are for a higher proportion of students to study part-time and for more mature age students to enrol.

(Source: Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission) Other Advanced Education The Commonwealth also funds the operations of the Australian Film and Television Schoolwhich undertakes national training at an advanced level in film, television, radio and audio-visual communications. In 1981-82 a provision of $5.2 million has been made for the operational and capital expenses of the School. As announced in decisions on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the School has been directed to pursue a policy of full cost-recovery in respect of its Open Program activities. An amount of $0.5 million has been included in the School's allocation for preliminary design costs associated with the School's permanent building. Also included is $53000 for specialised workshops for the disabled in 1981-82. The Government has decided that, from 1 January 1982, responsibility for funding the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) will pass to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Included in this category is $425 000 for the operational expenses of NIDA for the period 1 January to 30 June 1982. NIDA is presently funded through the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and expenditure for the first half of the financial year is included in the table item 'Advanced Educationi Tertiary Education Commission Grants'. Planning for NIDA's permanent premises in the grounds of Sydney University will continue in 1981-82, although no funds will be required for the building in that year. Also included within this category is $190 000 for sports-oriented courses at the Canberra College of Advanced Education to operate in conjunction with an Australian Institute of Sport (see 'Youth, Sport and Recreation' under the functional heading 'Culture and Recreation'). The Government has reviewed the existing scheme of assistance under which teacher education courses in certain non-government teachers' colleges receive up to 50 per cent of the recurrent costs of corresponding courses in colleges of advanced education. It has decided that, from 1982, these courses will be fully supported. Nongovernment teachers' colleges will also be eligible for consideration for capital grants within the total capital funds available. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission will advise on the implementation of this decision after consultation with State authorities and the institutions concerned. Technical and Further Education The States and the Northern Territory are responsible for technical and further education. Commonwealth grants, constituting about one-quarter of total outlays for such education, are provided on the understanding that the States and the Northern Territory will at least maintain fully their own efforts in this area. General recurrent grants are provided by the Commonwealth to compensate the States and the Northern Territory for not levying fees for courses at technical and further education institutions. These grants are expected to rise in 1982 in real terms, in response to growing enrolments. The specific recurrent grants, which are directed to improving the quality and effectiveness of technical and further education, have been substantially increased. TheT AFE sector is also benefitting substantially (approximately $12.5 million in 1981 and up to about $27 million in 1982) from the Commonwealth's School to Work Transition Program (see below). On the capital side, where Commonwealth grants now make up about three-quarters of total T AFE outlays, estimated expenditure in 1982 is intended to maintain the substantial program which has now been built up in line with the high priority attached by the Government to this form of education. Building works commitments to be met after 1982 amount to about $122 million. Of $112.1 million provided for capital programs in 1982, $21.4 million represents the final instalment under the Government's original supplementary ""$50 million"" grant over the period 1979-82. The Government has also decided t6 establish a T AFE equipment program from 1982 and has allocated $10.1 million for this purpose to assist the States in meeting the need for updated equipment, particularlyin the technologies. The Commonwealth will also contribute $0.2 million as its share of the cost in 1981-82 of the National TAFE Research and Development Centre to be based in Adelaide. Further Education in the ACT Most further education institutions in the ACT are now housed in relatively new or substantially upgraded accommodation. In 1981-82, significant improvements will continue at the Canberra College of T AFE, particularly through the construction of the Central Services Facilities Building. . The School of Art and Woden College of T AFE will become fully operational in 1981-82 in their new buildings. At the School of Art, two new craft workshops for work in glass, and in textiles and fibre, are scheduled to open in 1981-82. Student enrolments at Woden College ofTAFE have grown rapidly during 1981, with over 4000 students enrolled at the beginning of 1981-82. Course enrolments in Canberra's five further education institutions are estimated to reach 20390 in 1982,2.5 per cent more than in 1981. The 1981-82 estimates provide $25.5 million altogether for these bodies, of which $20.8 million is for current and $4.7 million for capital expenditure compared with $15.1 million and $10.6 million, respectively, in 1980-81. Overseas Student Charge Private overseas students enrolling for the first time (or changing to a new course of study) at Australian universities and colleges of advanced education are required to help defray the cost of their tuition by paying charges. From the beginning of 1982, these charges will be increased by an average of 10 per cent; this is the first increase since the charges were introduced in 1980 and is significantly less than the increase in education costs. The charges in 1982 will range from $1700 to $2500 a year depending on the course of study. Students liable for the overseas charge will not be required to pay additional fees for second or higher degrees. Both the demand by private overseas students for entry to Australian tertiary institutions and the number admitted have continued to rise despite the introduction of the charge. The estimated number of students liable for the charge was 3372 in 1980-81, yielding revenue of $7.3 million. This is expected to rise to about 6400 in 1981-82 yielding revenue of $12.0 million in that year. Schools in the States and the Northern Territory The Commonwealth provides grants to the States and the Northern Territory for programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission for recurrent and capital costs of government schools. Payments for recurrent and capital purposes are also made to the States and the Northern Territory for on-passing to non-government schools. In addition, Commonwealth assistance is provided to both government and non-government schools systems under Joint Programs such as special projects for handicapped children and multicultural projects. Commonwealth grants represent about 11 per cent of total spending on government schools and about 66 per cent of . total public sector spending on non-government schools. Total expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated at $974.7 million, compared with $804.7 million in 1980-81. Details of the calendar 1982 program, as shown below, were announced by the Minister for Education on 4 June 1981. (As with the tertiary grants, payments arrangements prevent direct comparison with the financial year estimates.) 1981 1982 $ million $mi11ion Government schoolsRecurrent 330.6 355.1 Capital 110.2 124.7 440.8 479.9 Non-government schoolsRecurrent 363.6 440.0 Capital 41.0 44.9 404.7 484.8 Joint programs 37.2 38.9 Total 882.6 1003.6 Total grants to the States and the Northern Territory in 1982 are estimated to increase by 13.7 per cent over the 1981 grants. In the government schools sector, although Australia-wide enrolments are expected to continue to fall, most categories of assistance will be maintained at the present real levels of support. Savings' will accrue from the termination of the innovations program from the end of 1981 and there has been a reallocation within the disadvantaged schools program. As a result of decisions taken during the Review of Commonwealth Functions, there will be a reduction in the Commonwealth Schools Commission's direct involvement in program administration and information collection, the activities of its State offices will be scaled down, and the Buildings Unit in the Central Office has been disbanded. An additional $10.7 million has been allocated for the migrant education program, retitled 'English as a Second Language'. The Commonwealth's programs for the severely handicapped will continue in 1982 at a cost of $2.5 million and the country areas program (formerly the disadvantaged country areas program) will be increased by $2.1 million in 1982. Within the Commonwealth Schools Commission's grants to the States and Northern Territory for government schools in 1981-82, an estimated $22.9 million has been earmarked for expenditure on the School to Work Transition Program in secondary schools and about $9 million of this total will be set aside for cash grants to government secondary school boards or committees (at the rate of$10 per pupil) for expenditure on transition activities. (See 'School to Work Transition' below.) For non-government schools, where enrolments continue to show a significant growth, the percentage link between non-government schools general recurrent grants and average government schools standard costs will be maintained. These grants are estimated to increase by about 21 per cent in 1982 compared with 1981. In line with election commitments, the existing six subsidy levels are being compressed into three and per capita subsidies for all three groups are to be increased progressively over the years 1982 and 1983. The Government has also decided to provide non-government special schools with a basic per capita grant at the rate of 20 per cent ,of government primary school standard costs. An additional $25 million is being provided over 1981-83 for the non-government capital program to assist non-government schools with the provision of new places; $8 million will be allocated for this purpose in 1982. The following table sets out information on recent trends in enrolments together with projections to 1984: School Enrolments (as at first week 0/ August a/respective year) Change on previous Primary Secondary Total year '000 '000 '000 Per cent Government1979 I 517.3 819.4 2336.7 -0.8 1980 (a) I 508.0 810.1 2318.1 -0.8 1981 (b) I 481.5 8\0.7 2292.1 -1.1 1982 (b) I 448.4 816.7 2265.0 -1.2 Non-government1979 367.4 282.8 650.2 +1-9 1980 (a) 376.1 290.4 666.5 +2.5 1981 (b) 382.6 301.6 684.2 +2.7 .1982 (b) 385.5 314.9 700.4 +2.4 Change on previous Primary Secondary Total year '000 '000 '000 Per cent schools979 1884.8 1102.2 2986.9 -0.2 980 (a) I 884.1 1100.5 2984.6 -0.1 981 (b) I 864.1 I 112.2 2976.3 0.3 982 (b) 1833.9 1 131.5 2965.4 -0.4 983 (b) 1790.0 I 164.4 2954.4 -0.4 984 (b) 1740.8 I 198.0 2938.8 -0.5 Preliminary estimates (Australian Bureau of Statistics). Projected (Department of Education). Looking further ahead, enrolments in government primary schools appear set to dene by around 121 000, or approximately 8 per cent, over the three years to 1984; nonvernment primary school enrolments are expected to remain stable. Government ondary school enrolments, on the other hand, seem likely to increase by about 000 or 5 per cent while non-government school enrolments are expected to increase about 43 000, or almost 15 per cent, over the same period. Overall, total enrolments e projected to decline by about 40 000 or 1 per cent. Increased immigration and ograms such as the School to Work Transition Program, which are designed to enurage more young people to remain in education, will have a bearing on the outcome. e-Schools in the States and the Northern Territory Under the Children's Services Program, the Commonwealth makes a block grant to e States and the Northern Territory as a contribution towards the costs of pre-school ucation. The Government has decided that $33.1 million will be provided in 1981-82 this purpose-the same level of funds as was available to the States for pre-schools in 1980-81. Actual payments in 1980-81, however, were reduced by $1.9 million on account of excess funds being held in one State from payments in 1978 for certain preschool projects that did not eventually proceed. Government Schools and Pre-schools in the ACT Outlays for government schools and pre-schools in the ACT are estimated at $94.2 million in 1981-82, an increase of 9.8 per cent compared with 1980-81. Recurrent expenditure is estimated to rise by 13.4 per cent to $91.0 million but capital expenditure is expected to fall from $5.5 million in 1980-81 to $3.2 million as reduced building activity reflects the declining rate of growth in the need for new classroom space. Total government school enrolments for 1982 are estimated at 38 036 compared with 38 262 in 1981 (primary down 2.3 per cent, high schools up 2. 7 per cent and secondary colleges up 0.3 per cent) and current Department of Education projections. show slightly declining enrolments overall in the medium term. The first full financial year of operation of two high schools (Wanniassa and Charnwood) and Erindale secondary college will be 1981-82. One new primary school and pre-school is planned to open in 1982 at Monash (Tuggeranong) . Non-Government Schools in the ACT The Commonwealth provides grants per pupil to non-government schools in the ACT equivalent to those paid through the Commonwealth Schools Commission and by State Governments to non-government schools in the States. These grants are the major component of recurrent assistance which is estimated at $15.9 million in 1981-82, compared w,ith $14.5 million in 1980-81; the increase reflects both higher grant rates and an :( ·i""'·' estimated 5.0 per cent increase in enrolments (to 17 184) in 1981; a further increase in enrolments of 4.9 per cent (to 18018) is projected for 1982. The Department of Education's projections suggest some slackening in the rate of growth in non-government school enrolments in the three years beyond 1982. Capital grants are provided to non-government schools in the ACT under arrangements similar to the Commonwealth Schools Commission program of capital assistance for non-government schools in the States. Assistance is also available under an interest subsidy scheme, under which the Commonwealth reimburses interest charges up to 10 per cent per annum for up to twenty years on loans for approved building projects. Similar schemes operate in the States. For 1981-82, total capital assistance is estimated at $2.7 million, compared with $2.8 million in 1980-81. The main new project to be assisted will be Stage Two of the Catholic system primary school at Wanniassa. Commonwealth Schools Commission funds for government and non-government schools in the ACT for 1981-82 have been increased from $0.6 million in 1980-81 to an estimated $1.5 million in 1981-82. Funds are provided for capital works on nongovernment schools and for an extended range of Commonwealth Schools Commission programs in government and non-government schools. School Transport in the ACT The cost of subsidising bus services for children travelling to and from schools is estimated at $3.7 million in 1981-82. This figure reflects significant increases in fuel, salary and other operating costs, increases,in route distances and the number of schools to be served, and a revised method of allocating to schools the cost of student transport. Curriculum Development Centre The Curriculum Development Centre as a statutory body has, in consultation with other Federal and State level education authorities, produced and marketed teaching materials for use in Australian schools as well as advising on curriculum and materials development. As part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government decided to abolish the Centre unless the States were prepared to contribute 50 per cent of its total administrative costs. As the States were not prepared to do so, the Commonwealth is proceeding to disband the Centre. The provision of $2.0 million in 1981-82 ($2.5 million in 1980-81) is made in accordance with this decision but will allow for the Centre to meet its obligations in 1981-82. The Government is providing substantial grants over the five years from the beginning of 1980 for a range of education, training and counselling activities in schools and T AFE institutions. These activities are directed particularly to young people who have left (or are likely to leave) school early and are intended to equip them better to move into the work force. The estimated cost of this program in 1981-82 is over $35 million, including $4.4 million which has been made available from the Education Program for Unemployed Youth (EPUY). In addition, this program has been substantially increased through decisions to provide. living allowances to students under Commonwealth or State transition schemes as from February 1981 at an estimated cost of $13 million in 1981-82 (see Function 8D: 'Labour and Employment') , and, from the beginning of 1982, to earmark for transition purposes an estimated $22.9 million of the Commonwealth Schools Commission's grants to the States and. Northern Territory for government schools. Where States increase their own recurrent expenditure on transition activities, the amount expended will be offset against the earmarked grants for government schools. The total amount available for transition projects in 1981-82 will be up to $58.1 million (apart from the estimated $13.0 million available for student allowances). Of this, up to $25.3 million will be available for transition projects within T AFE institutions, $30.3 million for government secondary schools and $2.5 million for nongovernment schools. The main schemes of community-wide student assistance are the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS), the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS), and Postgraduate Awards. These provide support for families of children who are in the final two years of schooling (SAS), for adults studying full-time at matriculation level or the equivalent (ASEAS), for full-time students undertaking T AFE courses (TEAS), and for full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at universities and colleges of advanced education (TEAS and Postgraduate Awards). The Postgraduate Awards are free of means test but are taxable and are awarded on the basis of academic merit. The other schemes are open to all, subject to a means test on family and student income and to academic admission requirements, and are free of tax. From the beginning of 1982, the allowance under SAS will be increased by 10 per cent. Allowances are reduced where family income and, for TEAS and ASEAS, student income, exceeds certain levels in a year. Family income levels in these means tests will be increased by 7 per cent for TEAS and ASEAS, and by 14 per cent for SAS (see following table). In addition, the Government has decided to introduce a loans scheme as a form of assistance additional to TEAS benefits. Means test levels and maximum rates of living allowance applicable in both 1981 and 1982, and numbers of students expected to receive assistance in these two years, are as follows: Maximum entitlements Number of students Scheme and main benefit 1981 1982 1981 1982 $ $ Tertiary education assistanceLiving at home 1675 I 675} Living away from home 2583 2583 88800 86800 Independent students 2583 2583 Adult secondary education assistance as for TEAS 2040 2040 Secondary allowances 660 726 25500 26200 Postgraduate awards 4620 4620 1928 2012 Marginal adjusted family income for use in means test: TEAS and ASEAS 10 312 11034 SAS 7440 8482 Other forms of assistance for students are available to certain special groups, namely Aboriginals, soldiers' children, and isolated children; these are dealt with in the separate section 'Special Groups', but certain information on them is included in the table below. Taken together, all forms of assistance for students (including those for special groups) are estimated to require $251.4 million in 1981-82, an increase of $17.1 million (7.3 per cent) over 1980-81. Details of estimated expenditure according to scheme and the main institutions of study are shown in the following summary table: 1980-81 1981-82 Change$ million $ million $ million Student assistance schemesTertiary education assistanceUniversities . . . . . . 68.3 67.7 0.6 Advanced education . . . 66.1 68.S + 2.4 Technical and further education 29.0 34.9 + S.9 Total 163.4 171.0 + 7.6 Postgraduate awardsUniversities . . . 8.6 9.6 + 1.0 Advanced education 0.1 0.2 + 0.1 Total 8.7 9.8 + l.l Other tertiary 0.6 0.3 0.2 Adult secondary education assistance 4.3 4.6 + 0.2 Secondary allowances ..... .12.7 IS.3 + 2.6 Total student assistance schemes 189.8 201.0 + 11.2 Assistance provided under programs for special groupsA borigina lsSecondary grants 17.4 19.4 + 1.9 Study grants 10.2 12.1 + 1.9 Soldiers' children . 2.4 2.2 0.1 Assistance for isolated children 14.S 16.7 + 2.2 Total special groups 44.S SO.4 + S.9 Total assistance for students 234.3 2SI.4 + 17.1 The Budget estimates include $99.2 million towards the education of special groups in 1981-82, an increase of $1 0.9 million (12.4 per cent) over 1980-81. Aboriginals The Aboriginal Secondary Grants and Aboriginal Study Grants schemes provide living allowances and other forms of benefits, free of means test, to Aboriginals attending approved secondary schools or classes or undertaking approved full-time or part-time courses of education and training at universities, colleges of advanced education, TAPE colleges and other institutions. Living allowances under these schemes in 1982 will remain at the 1981 levels. These schemes constitute the bulk of the Commonwealth educational assistance available to Aboriginals and account for $31.4 million of the total provision compared with $27.6 million in 1980-81. The increase of 13.8 per cent reflects a greater number of Aboriginals participating in the schemes. In addition, $10.9 million is to be available as grants-in-aid and grants to the States and Northern Territory through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the implementation of programs that address the special educational disadvantages of Aboriginals. Migrant Education The Contingency Program for Refugee Children has been transferred to the Commonwealth Schools Commission from the Commonwealth Department of Education. It covers the costs (teachers' salaries and purchase of language teaching materials) for 'on-arrival' language and orientation classes for new arrivals. These classes are given to new arrivals' children before they move into ordinary schooling. As well, grants are made to government and non-government school authorities for emergency classroom accommodation. The allocation for refugee children under this heading is for the period July-December 1981. From January 1982, this activity will be absorbed into Commonwealth Schools Commission programs. This heading also covers the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education Program under which $31.3 million will be available in 1981-82 for initial settlement orientation and for 'on-arrival' and 'ongoing' English language training needs of adult migrants and refugees. The provision covers the salaries of English language instructors, bilingual information instructors, funds for partial devolution of field and program activities to States and non-government organisations, and living allowances for adults attending full-time courses. Ninety-five per cent of the program's cost is for salary and salary related items. In 1981-82, the increase of $2.5 million over 1980-81 (8.8 per cent) reflects the higher salary and salary-related costs to maintain the program. Soldiers' Children Education Scheme Under this Scheme, assistance is provided by way of living allowances and other benefits for the schooling, tertiary education and training of children of veterans who died as a result of war service or who are either blind or totally and permanently incapacitated. Benefits are generally free of means test although a student's own earnings may be taken into account. Allowances for primary and secondary students under the Scheme are to be increased by 8.8 per cent from January 1982. The cost of the Scheme in 1981-82 is estimated at $2.2 million, compared to $2.4 million in 1980-81, be'cause of a projected slight decline to 1821 in the number of beneficiaries. Assistancefor Isolated Children This scheme assists families whose homes are remote from normal daily access to government schools. It provides basic allowances, free of means test, for eligible students who are boarding away from home, studying by correspondence or living in a second family home close to school facilities. Means tested allowances ate also provided to meet the additional costs of boarding away from home and to meet cases of special hardship. The scheme also covers children regarded as isolated for reasons of medical and social disability. From the beginning of 1982 the level of family income above which allowances are reduced will be increased by 7 per cent and 14 per cent in respect of additional boarding and special supplementary allowances, respectively. In addition, the special supplementary allowance for eligible senior secondary students will be increased by 10 per cent. It is estimated that the scheme will cost $16.7 million in 1981-82 (compared to $14.5 million in 1980-81) and it is estimated that assistance will be provided in respect of 19 170 children (the same number of children as for 1980-81). The increased provision reflects the effect of higher allowances announced in the 1980 and 1981 Budgets. In addition, the Government will introduce a three year pilot program costing about $4 million to provide, on loan, video facilities to certain isolated students and communities. General administrative and other expenditure of the Department of Education is estimated at $27.8 million in 1981-82, of which $22.0 million is for wages and salaries. Also included under this heading is $1 million in support of research in education through the Education Research and Development Committee and the Australian Council for Educational Research, and for evaluative studies (mainly of student assistance schemes) being undertaken by the Department itself. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government has decided to abolish the Educational Research and Development Committee and the reduced amount appropriated for educational research in 1981-82 reflects this decision. 3. HEALTH Commonwealth outlays on health are estimated at $2872: 1 million in 1981-82, a decrease of $777.9 million or 21.3 per cent on 1980-81. This reflects the Government's decisions, announced on 29 April 1981, to change health insurance arrangements from 1 September 1981 and to alter from 1 July 1981 funding arrangements for public hospitals, the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme. Under these new funding arrangements, a further amount of $1150.6 million in lieu of previous health payments is included under the functional heading 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government nec'. Details of the new arrangements are set out in the sections that follow. Further Commonwealth assistance for health care is available through the taxation system. A tax rebate of 32 cents in the dollar, separate from the existing concessional rebate arrangements, will apply to the cost of basic hospital and/or medical insurance with registered health funds with effect from 1 July 1981. In addition net expenditure in respect of doctors, hospitals, chemists, dentists, opticians and optometrists is in certain circumstances allowable for income tax rebate purposes; gifts of $2 or more to eligible organisations (eg medical research organisations) are tax deductible and a wide range of health related goods are exempt from sales tax. The figures in this section do not include the cost to revenue of these measures; the new health insurance rebate will not affect revenue until 1982-83, when it is estimated the amount forgone will be of the order of $600 million. 1979-S(j 19SO--S1 T981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Medical Services and BenefitsMedical Benefits 621.0 682.9 820.0 + 137.1 Diagnostic Services 20.4 23.6 24.5 + 1.0 Veterans and Dependants 71.5 85.2 94.7 + 9.S Total 712.9 791.6 939.2 + 147.6 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Hospital Services and BenefitsHospital Payments 1230.8 I 393.9 272.1 -I 121.8 Hospital Benefits Reinsurance 52.4 115.2 100.0 15.2 Other Hospital Benefits 2.6 0.5 0.2 0.3 Veterans and Dependants 187.7 204.1 227.1 + 23.0 Launceston General Hospital 5.2 3.4 5.0 + 1.6 Total 1478.7 I 717.1 604.4 -1112.7 Health Program Grants 4.5 5.3 5.8 + 0.5 Pharmaceutical Services and BenefitsPharmaceutical BenefitsGeneral 108.3 118.2 128.3 + 10.1 Pensioners 166.4 191.0 216.9 + 25.9 Administration 9.4 11.1 12.4 + 1.3 Veterans and Dependants 39.0 44.9 51.6' + 6.7 Total 323.1 365.2 409.2 + 44.1 Nursing Home and Domiciliary Care Services and BenefitsNursing Home Benefits 227.4 277.8 387.0 + 109.2 Nursing Home Assistance 85.0 103.8 155.2 + 51.4 Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefits 9.8 \7..5 20.6 + 3.1 Nursing Care for Veterans and Dependants 34.7 39.2 43.6 + 4.4 Home Nursing Service 12.3 13.5 16.0 + 2.5 Total 369.1 451.9 622.4 + 170.5 Community Health Facilities and Services 55.3 67.8 8.1 59.7 Dental Services for School Children 23.3 20.9 0.2 20.7 Treatment of Tuberculosis 1.2 1.3 1.5 + 0.2 Health Services in the ACT, nec 46.7 50.7 78.8 + 28.1 Health Services for Aboriginals 18.5 19.9 21.8 + 2.0 Other Health ServicesMedical Research Grants 13.6 19.2 23.3 + 4.1 Walter and Eliza Hall Institute 0.1 0.3 2.2 + 1.9 Commonwealth Serum Laboratories 7.5 10.5 7.5 3.0 Commonwealth Institute of Health 2.4 3.0 4.4 + 1.4 Aids and Appliances 7.2 11.9 15.4 + 3.5 Blood Transfusion Service and Products 11.9 13.8 16.0 + 2.2 Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Assistance 2.3 4.8 6.0 + 1.2 Drug Education Campaigns 1.2 I.7 I.7 Quarantine Services 25.3 28.3 28.9 + 0.6 National Health Promotion Program 0.5 0.5 + 0.5 Other 13.5 15.7 18.2 + 2.6 Total 85.7 109.4 124.2 + 14.9 General Administrative Expenditure 58.0 53.1 60.3 + 7.3 Recoveries 7.8Cr 4.0Cr 3.9Cr+ 0.1 Eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefits (PHB) and Health Benefits Cards Subject to an income limit of $40 a week for a single person or $68 a week for a married couple (the limits are higher where there are children), a person in receipt of one of the following pensions, benefits or allowances is eligible to receive a PHB or Health Benefits card: age, invalid, widow's and service pensions, supporting parent's and sickness benefits, and sheltered employment, tuberculosis and rehabilitation training allowances. Since January 1981, 50 per cent of any disability pension received by a service pensioner has been excluded from the PHB income test. This is to be increased to 60 per cent from January 1982. Holders of PHB and Health Benefits cards and their dependants are entitled to the following Commonwealth 'health' benefits without charge: the provision, with the agreement of doctors, of Schedule medical services (see under 'Medical Benefits'); Schedule optometrical services; pharmaceutical benefits; and hearing aids and batteries (provided by the National Acoustic Laboratories). The estimated number of holders of PHB and Health Benefits cards and their dependants at 30 June 1981 was 2.3 million. Eligibility for Health Care Cards From1 September 1981 three groups of persons in special need will be eligible for a Health Care card. They are: for the first six months of residence, migrants and refugees, regardless of their income, who have been authorised to remain indefinitely in Australia; people on unemployment benefit or special benefit who, in the case of married couples, have an income, other than benefit, of less than $68 a week and who, in the case of single people, have an income, other than benefit, of less than $40 a week; and people whose average weekly income for the four weeks prior to applying for the card is below theJollowing levels: married couples, $160 a week (the income level rises by $20 for each child), single parents with one child, $160 a week (the income level also rises by $20 for each additional child), and single people without children, $96 a week. Holders of Health Care cards and their dependants will be entitled to the following 'health' benefits: the provision, with the agreement of doctors, of Schedule medical benefits (see under 'Medical Benefits'); Schedule optometrical services; and free public hospital' accommodation and treatment in shared rooms and free outpatient treatment. Medical Benefits Until 31 August 1981 the Commonwealth's contribution towards the costs ofmedical benefits will be as follows: pensioners and sickness beneficiaries (and their dependants) covered by Pensioner Health Benefits or Health Benefits: 85 per cent of Schedule fees, subject to the gap between the benefit and Schedule fee for a service not exceeding $5; disadvantaged patients, as classified by their doctors: 75 'Per cent of Schedule fees for all services; and the rest of the population: that part, if any, of the Schedule fee in excess of $20 for each service. From1 September 1981 the Commonwealth will contribute: 85 per cent of Schedule fees, subject to the gap between the benefit and Schedule fee for a service not exceeding $5, for pensioners (and their dependants) covered by Pensioner Health Benefits entitlements and sickness beneficiaries (and their dependants) covered by Health Benefits entitlements; 85 per cent of the Schedule fee for each service for persons in special need covered by a Health Care card where the service is bulk-billed on the Commonwealth; 85 per cent of the Schedule fee, subject to the gap between benefit and Schedule fee for a service not exceeding $5, for persons in special need covered by a Health Care card where the patient is billed and claims through a registered medical benefits organisation; and for the rest of the population, 30 per cent of the Schedule fee for each service provided the person is covered by basic medical insurance with a registered health fund. Commonwealth medical benefits will no longer be available to persons who do not take out basic medical cover with a registered health fund. It is expected that in 1981-82 Commonwealth medical benefits for around 87 per cent of services rendered to eligible pensioners, sickness beneficiaries, the disadvantaged (to 31 August 1981) and Health Care card holders will be paid directly by the Commonwealth under the bulk-billing arrangements. In respect of the rest of the population who are insured for medical services (including the balance of eligible pensioners, sickness beneficiaries, Health Care card holders and their dependants), registered medical benefits organisations will act as agents for the Commonwealth and pay Commonwealth medical benefits. Outlays on Commonwealth medical benefits are estimated to increase by $137 million in 1981-82 to $820 million. The increase comprises: $43 million for the balance of the 9.7 per cent average increase in Schedule fees from 1 November 1980 following the 1980 inquiry into Schedule fees for medical benefits purposes, and the increase in optometrical consultation fees from 1 January 1981; $46 million for benefits at Pensioner Health Benefits rates, for growth in the estimated numbers of persons covered (the full year effect of the extension of coverage from 1 November 1980 for eligible supporting parents and sickness beneficiaries and dependants, and from January 1981 to veterans in receipt of disability pensions who qualified under the changed means test) and for increases in utilisation; the estimated net cost ($9 million) resulting from the ending from 31 August 1981 of the arrangements covering those deemed by their doctors to be disadvantaged and the introduction of the new arrangements for persons in special need from 1 September 1981; $11 million, the estimated net amount resulting from the ending of the present arrangements for the general popUlation from 31 August 1981 and the introduction of the new Commonwealth medical benefit of 30 per cent of Schedule fees for medically insured persons from 1 September 1981; and an allowance for the effects of a possible increase in Schedule fees in 1981-82. Diagnostic Services This item relates to the running of health laboratories operated by the Commonwealth. These include Department of Health pathology laboratories, which provide services to hospitals and medical practitioners, the National Acoustic Laboratories, the National Biological Standards Laboratories and the Australian Radiation Laboratory. As foreshadowed in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the possibility of transferring the pathology laboratories to the States is being taken up with State Governments. The provision of $24.5 million for 1981-82 allows for a full year's operation of the pathology ,laboratories pending negotiation with the States. Treatment and Allowancesfor Veterans and Dependants The Commonwealth meets the costs for eligible persons of specialist, local medical officer, paramedical and dental services, the provision and maintenance of surgical aids, and travelling expenses incurred in obtaining medical treatment. The increase of $9.5 million arises from increased fees for professional services and. an increase in the use of services. Hospital Payments In 1980-81 the Commonwealth met half the approved net operating costs of State and Northern Territory hospitals 'recognised' for the purpose of cost sharing under Hospital Agreements under Section 30 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. SimilaT cost sharing arrangements applied until 30 June 1981 to 'recognised' hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory: 'Payments in 1980-81 for 'recognised' hospitals amounted to $1322.4 million. An additional $25.8 million was provided for Australian Capital Territory hospitals under theapptopriation for the Capital Territory Health Commission as the ""State-type"" contribution to hospital operating costs. ' The Hospital Agreements with the States (other than South Australia and Tasmania) and the Northern Territory expired on 30 June 1981 after a one-year extension from their original expiry date (30 June 1980) to allow for receipt of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the· Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals (the Jamison Report). The Agreements with South Australia and Tasmania fun until 30 June 1985. After an extensive review of health policy taking into account, inter alia, the recommendations of the Jamison Report, the Government decided not to renew those Hospital Agreements expiring on 30 June 1981. Similar funding arrangements in the Australian Capital Territory were also terminated on 30 June 1981. Under the new arrangements, in 1981-82 and later years, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will receive general purpose financial assistance to replace the separate specific purpose assistance previously provided for hospital operating costs, the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme. The new arrangements are explained in more detail under Function 10A-'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. Notwithstanding the unexpired term of their Hospital Agreements, South Australia and Tasma,nia have been given the option to elect at any time before their agreements expire on 30 June 1985 to receive general purpose funding in respect of public hospitals on the same terms as the other States and the Northern Territory in lieu of specific purpose assistance. Unless they exercise this option, the Commonwealth will continue to meet half the approved net operating cost of hospitals ""recognised"" under their Hospital Agreements. Hospital net operating costs represent the aggregate residual operating deficits of ""recognised"" hospitals after patient fees and other hospital revenues have been taken into account. Commonwealth payments in 1979-80 and 1980-81 were on the basis of maintaining the overall level of hospital services at their 30 June 1979 level. Estimated payments in 1981-82 to South Australia and Tasmania are again designed to maintain the same overall level of services. The Agreements with South Australia and Tasmania are to be amended with effect from 1 September 1981 to reflect major changes to criteria for the provision of free public hospital accommodation and treatment and to levels of charges for hospital services along lines similar to those underlying the determination of the levels of general financial assistance in lieu of health grants to the other States and the Northern Territory. Payments under the Health Insurance Act 1973 for hospitals in 1981-82 are estimated at $272.1 million, a decrease of $1121.8 million reflecting the absorption of equivalent payments to New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory into general purpose financial assistance from 1 July 1981 and the transfer of funding for public hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory to the sub-function 'Health Services in the Australian Capital Territory nec'. The 1981-82 estimate of $272.1 million comprises: half the estimated net operating costs of ""recognised': hospitals in South Australia and Tasmania for 1981-82-$152.1 million; an amount of $20 million to finalise State and Northern Territory entitlements in respect of 1980-81 cost sharing; and payments to private hospitals in respect of the daily bed subsidy arrangements (see under 'Private Hospitals' below)-$lOO million. Private Hospitals Under the Health Insurance Act 1973 the Commonwealth makes payments of $16 a day for each occupied bed in approved private hospitals. As part of its review of health insurance arrangements the Government decided to introduce a higher bed day subsidy for patients receiving prescribed surgical procedures. The bed day subsidy for these patients was increased from $16 to $28 per day from 25 June 1981. Largely as a result of this increase, outlays for this purpose are estimated to rise from $71.5 million in 1980-81 to $100 million in 1981-82. Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund Under the provisions of the National Health Act 1953, the Commonwealth subsidises private health funds by sharing deficits that arise in reinsurance accounts required to be maintained by registered hospital insurance organisations. The deficits arise from paying benefits to high risk and chronically ill members and, until 31 August 1981, insured patients in approved nursing homes. Reflecting the Government's earlier announced decision to assume full responsibility for nursing home benefits from 1 September 1981, the Commonwealth's contribution to the Fund in 1981-82 will be reduced to $100 million. Other Hospital Benefits Expenditure on other hospital benefits is estimated at $0.2 million compared with expenditure of $0.5 million in 1980-81 and $2.6 million in 1979-80. The decreased expenditure results from finalisation of residual claims following the abolition on 1 November 1978 of the subsidy payable to registered health insurance organisations in respect of contribution rates for basic 'hospital only' insurance. Veterans and Dependants Hospitals and clinics are maintained in each State for the treatment of eligible veterans and their dependants; to a limited extent non-repatriation patients also are treated in repatriation hospitals while some use is made of private and State public hospitals for repatriation patients where this is appropriate. The provision of $215.9 million for repatriation hospitals is an increase of $22.7 million over 1980-81, reflecting higher wages and salaries and operational costs associated with the running of repatriation institutions and increased bed charges in non-departmental institutions expected to come into effect from 1 September 1981. Expenditure on mental health facilities and services for eligible veterans and their dependants is estimated at $11.2 million in 1981-82. This amount is provided for their medical care and treatment in State mental hospitals. Launceston General Hospital The Commonwealth is meeting 50 per cent of the approved cost of Stage One of the redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital. In December 1980 the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments agreed to include the construction of a new laundry in Stage One of the redevelopment. The Commonwealth's share of the total estimated cost is now $23.8 million of which $17.9 million has been paid. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated to be $5.0 million. Health Program Grants, authorised under the Health Insurance Act 1973, are payable to eligible organisations to meet the cost, or such proportion of the cost as the Minister may determine, of approved health services, including contract medical services, provided outside of hospitals by medical practitioners employed on a salaried or sessional basis. Eligible organisations impose charges for services where appropriate. Included in the estimate of $5.8 million for 1981-82 is: $1.5 million for the payment of salaries and associated staff costs involved in the clinical activities of Aboriginal medical services. Administrative and other expenses are provided by grants-in-aid from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; $2.5 million for payment to family planning associations in respect of estimated deficits on the clinical activities of the associations; and $0.9 million for projects that develop and test new forms of health care delivery systems (eg health maintenance organisations). Pharmaceutical Benefits-General and Pensioners Except for a flat charge (at present $2.75 and from 1 December 1981 $3.20) per prescription payable by persons other than Pensioner Health Benefits (PHB) and Health Benefits card holders and their dependants, the Commonwealth meets the cost of a wide range of drugs supplied on doctors' and dentists' prescriptions. Card holders and their dependants are eligible to receive all drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) list without charge. Outlays on pharmaceutical benefits (general and pensioners) are estimated to increase by a net $36.0 million in 1981-82 to $345.2 million. The main components of the net increase ($25.9 million for pensioners and $10.1 million for non-pensioners) are as follows: the full year effect ($9.5 million) of the increase from 1 November 1980 announced in the 1980-81 Budget Speech of 20 cents in drug prices per benefit item; a part year increase of $9.0 million ($18.0 million in a full year) resulting from a drug price increase awarded to manufacturers and wholesalers to apply from 1 November 1981, on the basis of 3.5 per cent on the price to chemists plus 10 cents per benefit item; $10.9 million as a once only payment of back-dated increases in chemists' remuneration resulting from the first determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal handed down on 26 June 1981; $22.5 million flowing from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's determination in respect of chemists' dispensing fees to apply from 1 July 1981; a part year reduction of $10.2 million ($20.3 million.in.a full year) resulting from the increased patient contribution of $3.20 per item to apply from 1 December 1981; and ... -.. a reduction of $5.7 million flowing from a number of factors incl-ding a variation in the mix of benefit items prescribed and a decline in the volume of prescriptions dispensed due to the removal of some items from the PBS list and, to a lesser degree, the increased patient contribution. Pharmaceutical Benefits-Veterans and Dependants . The Commonwealth meets the full cost of drugs and medicinal preparations supplied on doctors' and dentists' prescriptions for eligible veterans and their dependants. The increase of $6.7 million to $51.6 million in 1981-82 reflects increased use of pharmaceuticals together with the increases in drug prices awarded t.o manufacturers and wholesalers and in chemists' remuneration refem:d to in the pr-ceding section. Nursing Home Benefits. . Under the National Health Act 1953 benefits are paid byJheCommonwealth for . all patient-in approved nursing homes who are notjnsuredwith a registered hospital benefits fund. From1 September 19.8,1 the. Commonwealth will takeover full responsibility for benefits regardless of the insurance status of the patient. Current benefit rates which have applied since 6 November 1980 are: Ordinary Extensive care care patients patients $a day $aday New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory 18.10 24.10 Victoria ......... . 26.80 32.80 Queensland ........ . 16.85 22.85 South Australia and Northern Territory 24.30 30.30 Western Australia .. .... 16.00 22.00 Tasmania. . . . . . . . . . 18.65 24.65 Benefits are reviewed annually, with new benefit levels to apply from the first pension payday in November, so that together with the statutory patient contribution (currently $8.95 a day) they cover fees charged to 70 per cent of patients in approved nongovernment nursing homes in each State at the time of the review. The patient contribution is set at 87.5 per cent of the single pension plus supplementary assistance. Expenditure on nursing home benefits is expected to increase by $109.2 million in 1981-82 to $387.0 million reflecting the Government's decision to assume responsibility for all nursing home benefits from 1 September 1981, the effects of higher benefits and an expected increase in bed days of the order of 4 per cent during 1981-82. Nursing Homes Assistance Under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974, the Commonwealth meets approved operating deficits of eligible private non-profit nursing homes that participate in arrangements authorised by the Act. Expenditure on financing of deficits of eligible nursing homes is estimated to increase by $51.4 million (or 49.5 per cent) to $155.2 million reflecting the Government's decision to assume responsibility for all nursing home benefits from I September 1981, an allowance for cost increases and a 7 per cent increase in bed days. The expected increase in bed days reflects the greater availability of funds provided under the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. It is estimated that the average number of beds funded under the deficit financing arrangements will increase by some 1000 in 1981-82. Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefits The Commonwealth pays a benefit of $42 per fortnight to eligible persons who provide nursing care for approved patients at home as an alternative to institutional care. Patients must be aged 16 years or over and require professional nursing care to an extent that would otherwise justify admission to an approved nursing home. Expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated to be $20.6 million, $3.1 million higher than in 1980-81. The increase results from the full year effect of the increase in the benefit rate from $28 to $42 per fortnight from 4 September 1980 and expected growth in the number of recipients of thorder of 5 per cent. . Nursing Care for Veterans and Dependants The Commonwealth meets the full costs of nursing home accommodation required by veterans for serviCe-related disabilities. For certain categories of veterans and war widows, it also meets the cost of nursing home care for disabilities not related to service, subject to payment by the patient of the patient contribution applicable to other nursing home patients in the community. Free domiciliary care services are also provided to these groups as required. Home Nursing Services The Commonwealth provides subsidies, estimated to cost $16.0 million in 1981-82, to approved non-profit organisations providing home nursing services. The Commonwealth subsidy may not exceed that paid to the organisation by the relevant State or local government organisation. The increase of $2.5 million largely reflects the removal from 1 July 1981 of the restriction on the number of nurses eligible for subsidy ($0.9 million), an increase in the rates of subsidy from 1 July 1981 ($0.6 million), and some provision ($0.8 million) for an expected increase in the amount of assistance provided by the States in 1981-82. From1 July 1981 funds provided by the Commonwealth in respect of Community Health Program projects in the States and the Northern Territory that were formerly cost shared with the States and the Northern Territory are included in general revenue grants. The component of general revenue grants in respect of community health services is equivalent to 110 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution in respect of 1980-81 for projects in the States and the Northern Territory. An amount of $0.4 million is included under this heading to finalise Commonwealth payments in respect of 1980-81. In 1981-82 the Commonwealth will provide an estimated $6.7 million for 'national projects' that have an Australia-wide application and are fully funded by the Commonwealth, e.g., the Family Medicine Program (a vocational training program for medical graduates wishing to enter general practice) and the secretariats of national nongovernment health organisations. An amount of $0.9 million is also provided for health care planning and research in the form of grants to the States and the Northern Territory (on a $ for $ basis) and to institutions and persons. From1 July 1981 funds provided by the Commonwealth in respect of dental services for school children in the States and the Northern Territory are included in general revenue grants. The component of general revenue grants in respect of school dental services is equivalent to 110 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution in respect of 1980-81. In 1981-82 an estimated $0.2 million is provided to finalise Commonwealth payments in respect of 1980-81. The provision of$1.5 million in 1981-82 is for the payment of allowances to persons (and their dependants) suffering from tuberculosis. The increase of $0.2 million reflects mainly increased rates of benefit and an additional benefits pay day in 1981-82. The Commonwealth provides or subsidises. health services.inthAGT of the type provided elsewhere. by State and local government authorities .. These include three hospitals (expected to have 903 acute care. beds, 44 nursing home beds and 20 beds for the profoundly intellectually handicapped in 1981-82), public health activities, ambulance services, community health and nursing services (including 11 community health centres, 61 child health clinics, and 57 school dental clinics), 2 nursing homes (248 beds)6 residential care hostels for the mentally ill and the handicapped (130 beds), a central health laboratory and a centralised health services supply centre. Net expenditure by the Commonwealth under this heading in 1981-82 on recurrent and capital costs of health services in the ACT is estimated at $78.8 million, as against $50.7 million in 1980-81. The increase reflects the inclusion in 1981-82 of the total net operating costs of 'recognised' hospitals in the ACT-previously half these costs were recorded under the heading 'Hospital Payments'. After allowing for this change, the overall increase in recurrent and capital costs of health services in the ACT is estimated to be $2.4 million or 3.1 per cent in 1981-82. Special assistance is also provided for Aboriginal health through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' programs of direct assistance to Aboriginal organisations and groups including Aboriginal Medical Services ($7.3 million in 1981-82), and payments to the States and Northern Territory ($14.6 million in 1981-82). Under these programs, funds are provided for the prevention and control of alcohol abuse, for the development of Aboriginals' responsibility for, and involvement in, the improvement of their own health through participation in the delivery of medicalfhealth services, and for the development, through training, of Aboriginal expertise in all aspects of health care administration. (In addition, $8 million is being provided in 1981-82 as the first stage of implementation of the Prime Minister's dection pledge to provide $50 million over five years for the Aboriginal Public Health Improveinent Program. This amount has been provided through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' grants-in-aid and State Grants programs for Community Management and Services, which appear under the function 'Urban mid Regional Development nec'.) Medical Research Grants The Commonwealth provides financial assistance for medical research through the Medical Research Endowment Fund (MREF). Disbursement of the funds is made by the Minister for Health on the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council and acting, where necessary, in accordance with the conditions of gifts or bequests made to the Fund. Assistance is provided to universities and other institutions such as the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and to individual research workers or trainees, and may also be provided to Commonwealth and State Govern_ ment departments. In the 1980-81 Budget the Government increased substantially the real level of funding for medical research. As the majority of grants awarded from the MREF are on a calendar year basis the effects of the increase will continue to be felt in the 1981-82 financial year when expenditure on mediCal research through the MREF is estimated to be $23.3 million, an increase of $4.1 million over 1980-81 expenditure. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research The Commonwealth has agreed to share equally with the Victorian Government the approved cost of a new building for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The project is estimated to cost a total of $22.7 million at January 1980 prices and construction is expected to be completed in December 1984. The Commonwealth provided funds of $0.3 million in 1980-81 and $2.2 million is the estimated Commonwealth contribution for 1981-82. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission (CSL) produces and sells pharmaceutical and veterinary products as approved by the Minister for Health. Under the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 the Commonwealth meets the full cost of those activities undertaken in the national interest at the request of the Minister for Health. The national interest activities include research, the maintenance of production facilities and the holding of stocks of pharmaceutical products. The estimated cost of these activities in 1981-82 is $5 million. In addition, a further $2.5 million is being made available to complete capital works commenced in 1978. The total estimated cost of these works is$13.2 million. The Government has allocated $1.85 million for CSL to conduct research into the drug ""Interferon"" over the period 1980-81 to 1983-84. An amount of $0.25 million was provided in 1980-81 and $0.6 million is estimated to be required in 1981-82. Commonwealth Institute of Health The Commonwealth Institute of Health, jointly operated by the Commonwealth Department of Health and the University of Sydney, is a national research and teaching centre. The Institute continues the basic functions of its predecessor, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Priority is given to health services research, health education, preventive medicine and health surveillance, and occupational and environmental health. The amount of $4.4 million to be provided to the Institute in 1981-82 includes its recurrent and capital costs ($3.1 million), $1.3 million for a special epidemiological study into the effect of herbicides and other chemicals on Vietnam veterans, and $5000 towards the establishment of a malaria and other insect-borne diseases monitoring station in Torres Strait, construction of which has been delayed. Aids and Appliances Hearing Aids The Commonwealth provides through the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) at no cost to users a range of hearing services for children, eligible pensioners and supporting parents in receipt of an allowance from the Department of Social Security. Services include hearing tests, provision, fitting and maintenance of hearing aids and the supply of hearing aid batteries. The laboratories also conduct a research and development program on hearing impairment, hearing aid design and technology and noise measurement and hearing conservation. As foreshadowed in the Review of Commonwealth Functions action is being taken to increase private sector involvement in NAL activities. Tenders are to be called for a contract to manufacture in Australia hearing aids to NAL designs. The cost of supplying hearing aids. and batteries in 1981-82 is .estimated to be $8.2 million, $0.4 million higher than in 1980-81. Stoma Appliances The Commonwealth meets the full costs of stoma appliances that are supplied free of charge by stoma associations to their members. Costs are estimated to be $3.5 million in 1981-82, $1.0 million higher than in 1980-81. Artificial Limbs Artificial limbs are supplied free by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to veterans and other eligible persons. Payments to contractors for the supply of these limbs are estimated to be $1.3 million in 1981-82. Program of Aidsfor Disabled People The Government will provide $2.4 million for the continuation of this program under which aids (for example, wheelchairs, walking aids, splints and home modifications) are made available without charge to disabled people who are not eligible to receive them under other Commonwealth or State programs. This amount includes a provision to cover the costs incurred by the States and Territories in administering the program. An amount of $0.4 million was advanced to the States and Territories for expenditure on the program in 1980-81. Blood Transfusion Services and Products The annual operating costs of the Red Cross Society's Blood Transfusion Service in the States are shared by the States (60 per cent), the Society (the lower of 5 per cent of operating costs or 10 per cent of the previous year's income from donations) and the Commonwealth (the balance). In the Northern Territory the Commonwealth provides similar assistance. Approved capital costs are shared between the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory on a $ for $ basis. Blood collected by the Transfusion Service is processed by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission and blood products are supplied free bf charge, to hospitals and approved pathologists for use in medical treatment and analysis. The Commonwealth reimburses the Commission for the cost of processing the blood. The Commonwealth contributions are estimated to increase by $2.2 million in 1981-82 to $16.0 million, reflecting cost increases. Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme Under this Scheme the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to persons (and, if necessary, their escorts/attendants) who are referred for specialist medical treatment not available locally. To be eligible for assistance a patient must reside outside the metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth and more than 200 kilometres from the nearest place of specialist medical treatment; persons residing on certain offshore islands are exempt from this requirement. As a result of changes introduced on 1 October 1980, the Commonwealth meets the approved travel costs per return journey of all eligible patients, escorts and/or attendants less a total contribution of $20 regardless of whether the patientis escorted or not. An accommodation benefit of up to $20 per night per person in respect of each approved overnight stay is also payable. Reflecting greater awareness and use of the Scheme, its cost is expected to increase by about $1.2 million in 1981-82 to $6.0 million. Drug Education Campaigns Assistance is provided through the National Drug Education Program to sllpport State, Northern Territory and national programs of education to reduce-the abuse of narcotics and drugs of addiction.' . ' Quarantine Services Human, plant and animal quarantine measures are enforced to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases into Australia. By arrangement, the States and the Northern Territory administer animal, plant and certain human quarantine operations in their respective areas and the costs they incur on the Commonwealth's behalf are reimbursed. Human quarantine control measures at ports of entry are administered by the Commonwealth. The provision of $28.9 million for quarantine services in 1981-82 is an increase of $0.6 million on 1980-81. This increase reflects, in part, the net effect of the following factors: increased payments of almost $3.0 million to the States and the Northern Territory and medical practitioners for animal, plant and human quarantine operations; and reduced expenditure on: the quarantine component of coastal surveillance (from $6.1 million to $5.3 million) pending the outcome of an interdepartmental review of the coastal surveillance program, the quarantine publicity campaign (from $0.8 million to $0.7 million), quarantine capital works (from $3.7 million to $1.9 million). National Health Promotion Program In 1979-8.0 the Government developed and tested, at a cost of $0.5 million, a program designed to improve the general level of health in Australia by promoting more healthy lifestyles. An amount of $0.5 million has been allocated in 1981-82 for further development. Other This category includes expenditure on international health, environmental, social and other public health activities, health advisory committees, and expenditure under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1966. Also included are grants to the States and the Northern Territory for the Australia Encephalitis Eradication Campaign ($0.1 million in 1981-82), funds for the National Trachoma Program ($0.4 million in 1981-82), and a subsidy to the Royal Flying Doctor Service ($4.3 million in 1981-82). Expenditure under this heading is estimated at $60.3 million in 1981-82 and comprises the major portion of general administrative and capital expenses of the Department of Health including the costs of administering Commonwealth medical benefits, nursing home benefits and assistance, and subsidies for private hospitals. Expenditure in 1980-81 also included $2.9 million for final payments in respect of the winding up of the former general function of the Health Insurance Commission. The Commonwealth pays a service fee to registered medical insurance funds for paying medical benefits on the Commonwealth's behalf to non-medically insured: persons, registered with the funds, for medical services rendered to them after I November 1978 but prior to 1 September 1981; PHB and Health Benefits card holders and their dependants whose doctors decline to bulk-bill; and from 1 September 1981, Health Care card holders and their dependants whose doctors also decline to bulk-bill the Commonwealth. The estimated cost in 1981-82 of the service fee is $4.5 million, $1.2 milli6ri greater than in 1980-81. The increase reflects the full year effect of an increase in fees and an increase in the number of services attracting the fee. Recoveries shown under this heading are in respect of charges met by certain countries for treatment given to their war veterans through facilities made available by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, charges made on departments and authorities for the use of the Department of Health's computer facilities, and other miscellaneous receipts. 4. SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE The Australian social security system is intended to protect people from economic hardship caused by events such as loss of earnings through age, invalidity, sickness, unemployment or the loss or absence of a supporting spouse as a result of death, desertion or long-term separation. It is designed also to compensate veterans for service-related disabilities and the dependants of those whose deaths are service-related and to assist parents with the expenses associated with raising children. Much of this assistance is provided by way of cash benefits. There are selective or income-tested benefits such as invalid and widow's pensions and unemployment benefits, as well as universal benefits such as family allowances and handicapped child's allowance. In addition, assistance is provided, either directly or through State and local government authorities and voluntary agencies, for a wide range of welfare services for people with special needs. The aged, for example, may be assisted with their accommodation needs and the disabled may be trained so that they can re-enter paid employment. Assistance is provided in a variety of forms for the advancement of Aboriginals. Total direct outlays on social security and welfare in 1981-82 are estimated to be $11 357 million which is equivalent to 27.8 per cent of total Budget outlays. The increase over 1980-81 is $1440 million or 14.5 per cent, but the increase in outlays due to increases in rates of pensions and benefits, increased number of cash benefits recipients, and expansion of welfare services is about 12 per cent once allowance is made for the different number of pension etc. paydays in 1980-81 and 1981-82. In addition to these outlays on social security and welfare, assistance is provided through the personal income tax system. The dependent spouse and sole parent rebates assist single income families, and the deductions allowed for gifts to certain welfare bodies provide indirect assistance to the organisations concerned. Further details on assistance provided through the taxation system are included in Appendix II to Budget Statement No.4. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Assistance to the AgedAge Pensions and Allowances 3508.8 3935.8 4535.0 + 599.2 Aged Persons' Homes and Hostels 51.1 45.8 58.0 + 12.2 Home Care Services 18.0 21.5 24.4 + 2.9 Personal Care Subsidy 14.5 19.6 21.6 + 2.0 Other 0.2 0.2 0.2 Total 3592.6 4022.9 4639.1 + 616.3 Assistance to Veterans and their DependantsDisability Pensions and Allowances 434.6 499.9 501.2 + 1.2 Service Pensions 525.2 686.5 823.1 + 136.6 Other 0.6 0.6 0.6 Total 960.4 1 187.0 1324.8 + 137.8 Assistance to the HandicappedInvalid Pensions and Allowances 796.4 880.8 990.0 + \09.2 Sheltered Employment Allowances 22.8 27.5 34.5 + 7.0 Handicapped Children's Benefits and Allowances 20.8 20.8 23.4 + 2.6 Handicapped Persons' Facilities 39.3 51.4 55.5 + 4.1 Rehabilitation Services 21.1 25.0 29.5 + 4.5 Other 0.2 0.9 1.5 ,+ 0.7 Total 900.6 1006.4 1 134.5 + 128.0 Assistance to Widows and Single ParentsWidows' Pensi,ons and Allowances 561.4 641.8 720,0 + 78.2 Supporting Parents' Benefits and Allowances 259.6 412.4 600.0 + 187.6 Other 24.9 14.3 14,3 Total 845.9 1068.5 1320.0 + 251.5 Assistance to FamiliesFamily Allowances 1012.7 950.4 1040.0 + 89.6 Children's Services(a) 36,2 42,9 47,1 + 4,2 Crisis Accommodation for Families in Distress 2.0 + 2.0 Orphan's Pension 2.1 2.1 3,2 + 1.1 Other 3.4 4.5 5,3 + 0,8 Total 1054.4 999,9 1097,6 + 97,6 Assistance to the Unemployed and SickUnemployment Benefits 925,2 995,7 1090.0 + 94,3 Sickness Benefits 126.6 174.5 215.0 + 40.5 Special Benefits 52,9 70,0 76.0 + 6.0 Unemployment Relief 15.2 14.2 5,0 9,2 Relocation Assistance Scheme 1.0 1.3 1.3 Other O.lCr 0.3 0,3 Total1 120,9 1255,9 1 387.6 + 131.7 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Other Welfare ProgramsFuneral Benefits. . . . . . 1.5 1.5 1.4 0.1 Telephone Rental and Postal Concessions 19.4 21.0 22.4 + 1.4 Assistance to Homeless Men and Women 4.5 7.7 6.3 1.4 Assistance for Migrants 4.8 5.6 5.7 + 0.2 Welfare Programs in the ACT 7.7 7.9 7.6 0.2 Other. . 2.6 3.7 5.4 + 1.7 Total 40.4 47.3 48.9 + 1.6 Aboriginal Advancement Programs nec 25.8 50.6 78.0 + 27.4 General Administrative and Other Expenditure 250.2 283.4 330.1 + 46.8 Recoveries and Repayments . . . . . . 8.ICr 4.8Cr 3.9Cr+ 0.9 (a) Excludes block grants paid to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-school education. Those amounts are recorded under the function 'Education'. Pensions and Allowances Age pensions are payable, subject to an income test, to residentially qualified women aged 60 to 69 years and to residentially qualified men aged 65 to 69 years. Residentially qualified men and women aged 70 years and over receive a fixed base rate of pension free of income test. The rate of this pension is lower than the maximum rate payable under the income test but the higher rate may be paid if the person qualifies under the income test. To be residentially qualified for age pension, a period of ten years continuous residence in Australia at any time is usually necessary. The Government has decided to amend the pension income test provisions to address some of the deficiencies in the law that enable people to deprive themselves of income in order to obtain a pension, a higher rate of pension or Commonwealth pensioner concessions, particularly through schemes which are being promoted in the community to obtain these effects. Wife's pension is payable to an age pensioner's wife who does not qualify for an age, invalid or repatriation service pension in her own right. The pension is subject to the same income test as age pensions. The Government has decided to amend the Social Services Act 1947 so that the same general conditions apply to the granting of wife's pension as apply to the granting of age and invalid pension. This will require the claimant to be residing in Australia at the time of lodgement and grant. Additional payments of $10 a week for each child are available topensioners with children. A single pensioner with one or more children may also qualify for a guardian's allowance of $6 a week ($8 a week if a child is under 6 years or an invalid): These payments are subject to an income test. From .February 1982, the maximum level of supplem-l,ltary assistance payable to pensioners who pay rent or lodging charges will be increas-d by $3 to $8 a week. The Government has also decided that, from the same date, the subsidy rate will be changed to 50 cents for each $1 of rent in excess of $10 a week. The amount of assistance thus determined will be reduced by $1 for each $2 of income as assessed (combined income in the case of pensioner couples). Pensioners receiving assistance as public housing tenants will not, in future, be eligible for supplementary assistance. However, current recipients of supplementary assistance who would otherwise be disadvantaged will continueto receive assistance under current rates and conditions. Upon the death of one of a married pensioner couple, the surviving member may receive, for up to six fortnightly instalments, the equivalent of the two pensions that would have been paid had the spouse not died. Age pension (including wife's pension paid to the wife of an age pensioner) is subject to personal.income tax, but no tax is payable by those having little or no income apart from their pension. The additional payments for children and supplementary assistance are not subject to tax . . The basic rates of pensions are increased automatically each six months in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The rates will be adjusted in November 1981 by the percentage increase in the CPI between the December quarter 1980 and the June quarter 1981, and in May 1982 by the percentage increase in the CPl·· between the June and December quarters 1981. The existing maximum rates of age pensions and additional payments, and the rates to apply from November 1981, are set out below: From November Pension or additional payment Existing 1981 $a week $a week Pensions Standard (or single) rate of pension .......... . 66.65 69.70 Married rate of pension (each person) ......... . 55.55 58.10 Wife's pension . . -. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55.55 58.10 Free of income test pension-age pensioners aged 70 years and overStandard rate . . . . . 51.45 51.45 Married rate (each person) ......... . 42.90 42.90 Additional Payments Additional pension for each child (including a student child) \0.00 10.00 Guardian's allowanceNo child under 6 or invalid 6.00 6.00 At least one child under 6 or invalid 8.00 8.00 Supplementary assistance 5.00 5.00* * $8.00 a week effective from February 1982 The above rates also apply to invalid and widow's pensions,supporting parent's benefit and sheltered employment allowance. Widows and supporting parents may receive mother's allowance in lieu of guardian's allowance and sheltered employment allowees receive the income-test-free incentive allowance in lieu of supplementary assistance. The cost of the automatic increases in the rates of age pensions in November 1981 and May 1982 is estimated to be $169.5 million in 1981-82 and $429 million-in a full year. The increases and changes to supplementary assistance are estimated to' cost $10 million in 1981-82 and $23 million in a full year. The average amount of age pen'sion (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from about $55.50 a week in 1980-81 to about $60.30 a week in 1981-82, an increase of 8.6 per cent. The main reason for this rise is the increases in pension rates in line with the CPI. The following table sets out the actual number of age pensioners at 30 June '1981 together with the estimated number at 30 June 1982. Age Increase over Pensioners previous year including 30 June wives Number Per cent '000 '000 1981 1377 24 1.8 1982 (estimate) 1406 29 2,] (Source: Department of Social Security) Population of pensionable age is increasing faster than the population generally and this situation is projected to continue for at least the next few years. Aged Persons' Homes and Hostels Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, organisations are assisted to provide suitable homes in which aged people or disabled people aged 16 years or over may live. Grants on a $2 for $1 basis to a maximum limit of $12 100 for a single unit of' accommodation, $14035 for a double unit, plus a maximum of $1920 per unit for land costs, may be made to religious and charitable organisations and local government bodies to meet the cost of erection, extension or purchase of those home;s. Expenditure on the provision of homes is estimated at $45.55 million in 1981-82. The Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972 is designed to encourage the provision of hostel accommodation for the aged. Subject to certain conditions, the Commonwealth meets the cost of hostel accommodation provided by eligible organisations up to a maximum of $18 150 a person for buildings, and up to $2 400 a person for the purchase of land; a further $250 a person is available for furnishings. Accommodation is allocated strictly on the basis of need and without any contribution from the prospective resident. Grants may only be made in respect of hostels approved for funding under the Act within the three year period commencing on 27 September 1972. Grants in 1981-82 for projects under construction at 30 June 1981 or expected to commence in 1981-82 are estimated at $12.45 million. In December 1979 the Government decided to allocate a further sum of $225 million to projects under both Acts. Of this, $58.0 million will be provided in 1981-82. Grants for pensioner accommodation under Housing Agreements with the States and the Northern Territory are included under the functional heading 'Housing'. Home Care Services Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 imd the States Grants (Paramedical Services) Act 1969, the Commonwealth provides funds in association with the States for the provision of a r-nge of home care services, mainly for aged persons, and for the provision of senior citizens' centres and associated welfare officers. Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969, the Commonwealth shares on a $1 for $1 basis with the States the cost of approved housekeeping or other domestic assistance provided wholly or mainly for aged persons in their homes. The Commonwealth also shares with the States, on a $2 for $1 basis, the approved capital cost of senior citizens' centres and, on a $1 for $1 basis, the cost of the salary of a welfare officer employed in conjunction with such a centre. Grants towards the cost of approved housekeeping and other domestic assistance for aged persons in their homes are estimated t'o rise from $11.5 million in 1980-81 to $13.7 million in 1981-82 because of cost increases and the expansion of approved services. Grants towards the cost of the salary of a welfare officer employed in conjunction with a senior citizens' centre are estimated to rise from $1. 3 million in 1980-81 to $1.4 million in 1981-82 because of the effect of salary increases awarded in 1980-81 and the higher use of approved positions. In December 1979, the Government announced its decision to allocate $12 million to the construction of senior citizens' centres in the three years 1980-81 to 1982-83. Of this, $4 million will be provided in 1981-82. Under the States Grants (Paramedical Services) Act 1969, .the Commonwealth shares on a $1 for $1 basis with the States the cost of approved paramedical services provided wholly or mainly for aged persons in their homes. Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania are participating in the program. Grants in 1981-82 are estimated to be $1 million. The Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970 is designed to assist. the establishment, expansion, improvement or maintenance of approved 'meals on wheels' services. The basic rate of subsidy is 40 cents a meal with an additional subsidy of 5 cents a meal payable for each meal with an approved Vitamin 'C' supplement included. Expenditure under the Act in 1981-82, is estimated to be $4.13 million, compared with $3.62 million in 1980-81, because of the full year effect of an increase in the basic rate of subsidy announced in 1980-81 and an increase in the number of meals delivered. Personal Care Subsidy Under the Aged or Disabled PersnCs Homes Act 1954, the Commonwealth pays it personal care subsidy of $20 a week to -\,igible organisations for persons aged 80 years or over and other residents of hostel-type accommodation provided by those organisations who require, and are receiving, approved personal care. The number of persons who qualify for the subsidy is estimated to increase from 20373 at 30 June 1981 to 21 000 at 30 June 1982. Expenditure on the subsidy is estimated to rise from $19.6 million in 1980-81 to $21.6 million in 1981-82 as a result of the increase in numbers and the full year effect of the increase in the subsidy from $15 to $20 a week effective from 18 October 1980. Disability Pensions and Allowances Disability pensions and allowances (and certain other benefits including medical treatment) are available to certain veterans and their dependants. The term 'veteran' includes any man or woman eligible for consideration under the Repatriation Act 1920 or associated Acts by virtue of service in the Australian armed forces. The term 'service' includes service in the 1914-18 War, the 1939-45 War, the Korea and Malaya Operations, the Far East Strategic Reserve, special service in South East Asia (including Vietnam), and service with the Defence Force on or after 7 December 1972. The Government has decided to extend Repatriation benefits to former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and New Guinea Police Force who operated under Australian Army Command from 7 December 1941 to 31 December 1945. It has also decided to extend from 1 November 1981 Repatriation benefits to all representatives of Australia who suffer death or incapacity while serving with the United Nations or other recognised international bodies engaged in such duties as those of peacekeeping, observation and monitoring. Basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with 'active service', incapacity or death resulting from 'any occurrence' during service may be accepted. For those with 'home service', however, the criterion is narrower, in that incapacity or death must have arisen out of, or be attributable to service. Incapacity or death arising from a condition existing prior to enlistment may be accepted if contributed to or aggravated by the conditions of service. Disability pension is not subject to personal income tax. Classes of Disability Pensions Pensions are paid to eligible veterans in three main categories: The Special Rate (known as the T & PI) Pension, payable to a veteran who, as a result of service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a living wage; The Intermediate Rate, payable to a veteran who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to service, can work only part-time or intermittently and in consequence is unable to earn a living wage; and The General Rate, payable to a veteran who has an incapacity accepted as related to service but who is still able to work full-time. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per'cent of the maximum General Rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. Pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated veterans and to their children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran's incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow's rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at 'orphan' rates and other benefits. If a veteran's death has not been accepted as related to service but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the Special Rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service. Other dependants of deceased veterans may qualify for pensions in certain circumstances. Allowances Various allowances are provided to supplement disability pensions. These allowances vary according to the type or severity of disablement and the special needs of the pensioners. Rates of Pensions and Allowances The Special, Intermediate and General Rate disability pensions and the war and defence widow pensions are automatically adjusted each May and each November in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. The existing and proposed rates of the main disability pensions and allowances are shown in the following table: From November Benefit Existing 1981 $a week $a week Disability PensionsSpecial Rate 127.65 133.50 Intermediate Rate 87.85 91.90 General Rate (100 per cent) 48.15 50.35 War and Defence Widow 66.65 69.70 Wife ...... . 4.05 4.05 Each Child .... . 1.38 1.38 War Orphans Father dead-each child 13.80 15.00 Both parents dead-each child ............. . 27.60 30.00 Allowances payable under Schedule5 to the Repatriation Act for certain amputations and/or loss of visionItems 1-6 79.50 83.15 Items 7-15 3.95 4.30 to 25.80 to 28.05 Clothing AllowanceHighest rate 1.65 1.80 Middle rate 1.10 1.20 Lowest rate 0.80 0.85 Attendant's AllowanceHigher rate 38.65 42.05 Lower rate 19.32 21.02 Domestic Allowance . 12.00 12.00 Recreation Transport Allowance (a month)Higher rate ... . 44.00 48.00 Lower rate ... . 22.00 24.00 Gift Car Allowance (a year) 528.00 576.00 Funeral Benefit. . . . 300.00 400.00 A Temporary Totally Incapacitated (TTl) pension is an additional rate of pension paid to a veteran who has been classified as temporarily totally incapacitated by service-related incapacity and unable to earn other than a negligible percentage of a iivingwage. A Temporary Incapacity Allowance (TlA) is paid to veterans who undergo hospitalisation and are totally incapacitated by that hospitalisation and consequential convalescence or treatment of a service-related incapacity for a continuous period of more than four weeks. A Loss of Earnings Allowance is paid to veterans who have suffered loss of earnings during the investigation of a claim or while receiving medical treatment for a servicerelated disability. In certain circumstances it may also be paid in respect of loss of earnings caused by any illness or incapacity. The allowance is paid at a rate not exceeding the Special Rate pension less any pension payment at the time, or actual loss of earnings, whichever is lower. The increases in the rates of disability pensions in November 1981 and May 1982 are estimated to cost $17 million in 1981-82 and $46.8 million in a full year. At 30 June 1981, there were 423 300 veterans and their dependants in receipt of disability pensions. During 1981-82 the number is estimated to decrease by 12900 to 410 400. The effect on expenditure of this estimated decline in numbers is more than offset by the full year effects of increased rates of benefits introduced in 1980-81 and the increase in benefit rates in November 1981 and the expected increase in May 1982 in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. It is expected that the number of veterans receiving disability pensions will continue to decline. This trend would be consistent with the expected reduction in the number of ex-servicemen and wome!} in Australia over the next three years. The following table provides an estimate of the number of ex-servicemen and women at 30 June in the years 1981 to 1984. Numbers of Ex-servicemen and Women 1981 636500 1982 618000 1983 600200 1984 580800 Source: Department of Veterans' Affairs Service Pensions Service pension may be payable to: a male veteran who served in a theatre of war and who has attained the age of 60 years or is permanently unemployable; a female veteran who served in a theatre of war or embarked for service abroad and has attained the age of 55 years or is permanently unemployable; ex-members of the Defence Forces of British Commonwealth countries who satisfy the above criteria and have at least ten years residence in Australia; ex-members of formally raised Armed Forces of Allied countries who meet the same criteria which apply to members of the forces of a Commonwealth country, providing they have not served at any time in the forces of a country which was at the time at war with Australia; from February 1982 Service pension will be extended to Australian mariners who served in a theatre of war during the 1939-45 War and who were domiciled in Australia at the time of their Service. Service in a 'theatre of war' means, in respect of the 1914-18 War or 1939-45 War, service 'at sea, in the field or in the air in naval, military or aerial operations against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war ' In respect of certain later service, 'service in an operational area' and 'special service' as defined are the qualifications equivalent to service in a 'theatre of war'. A service pension is the broad equivalent of an age or invalid pension. The advantages to the veteran are availability of the service pension five years earlier and, in certain circumstances, eligibility for a wide range of repatriation medical treatment services. Service pensioners are eligible for the same range of pensions and allowances as age pensioners and the rates of benefits are the same. Like age pensions, service pensions will be increased in November 1981 and in May 1982 in line with movements in the CPI. Also, consistent with the treatment of age pensions, the Government has decided to raise from February 1982 the maximum level of supplementary assistance and vary the basis for payment. Service pension is paid, subject to income test, to eligible veterans under the age of 70 years. A basic rate (that payable as at 1 November 1978) of service pension, not subject to automatic indexation, is paid, free of income test, to eligible veterans aged 70 years and over. Increases in the rate of service pension as a result of automatic indexation are paid to such veterans subject to an income test. For eligible veterans under 70 years of age and in the assessment of the income-tested supplement for veterans aged 70 years and over, 50 per cent of any disability pension received is disregarded as income for service pension income test purposes; this will be increased to 60 per cent from January 1982. With this exception, service pensions are subject to the same income test arrangements as social security pensions. Service pensions are subject to income tax. At 30 June 1981, there were 272 000 service pensioners (including wives) and in 1981-82 the number is estimated to increase by 28000 to 300000. The increase in estimated expenditure in 1981-82 reflects this estimated increase in numbers, and increases in pension rates in line with the CPI. The increases in rates of service pensions in November 1981 and May 1982 are estimated to cost $33.3 million in 1981-82 and $99.1 million in a full year. The changes to supplementary assistance are expected to cost an additional $0.9 million in 1981-82 and $2.7 million in a full year. It is expected that the number of veterans receiving service pensions will continue to grow in the short term. The age profile of ex-servicemen is illustrated in the following table.

Invalid Pensions and Allowances Invalid pensions are payable to people aged 16 years or more who are permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of not less than 85 per cent or are permanently blind. Pensions are subject to the income test except in the case of people who are permanently blind. No period of residence is necessary if the permanent incapacity or blindness occurred in Australia. If the permanent incapacity or blindness occurred outside Australia, the residence qualification is the same as for an age pension. Invalid pensioners are eligible for the same additional payments as are age pensioners and the rates of payment are the same. Wife's pension is payable, subject to the same income test, to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is not eligible for an age, invalid or service pension in her own right. Invalid pension paid to a person of age pension age and wife's pension paid to the wife of such an invalid pensioner are subject to personal income tax. Pensions payable to an invalid pensioner below age pension age are not subject to tax. Additional payments are not subject to tax. At 30 June 1981 there were 279000 invalid pensioners (including wives of invalid pensioners in receipt of wife's pension) and during 1981-82 the number is estimated to increase by 1 000 to 280 000. The average amount of invalid pension (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from about $58.80 a week in 1980-81 to about $64.75 a week in 1981-82, an increase of 10.1 per cent. The main reasons for this rise are increases in pension rates in line with movements in the CPI and increases to supplementary assistance. The estimated cost of the automatic increases in the rates of invalid pensions is $39.3 million in 1981-82 and $99 million in a full year. The estimated cost for changes to supplementary assistance is $4 million in 1981-82 and $9 million in a full year. Sheltered Employment Allowances Sheltered employment allowance is payable to disabled people engaged in approved sheltered employment who are qualified to receive an invalid pension or who would become so qualified if they ceased to be provided with sheltered employment. The allowance is subject to the same. income test as is applied to the invalid I pension and the rates of payment are the same. An incentive allowance is paid (free of income test} to the recipients of sheltered employment allowance. From February 1982, the rate of incentive allowance will be increased by $3 to $8 a week at an estimated cost of $0.6 million in 1981-82 and $1.4 million in a full year. Neither sheltered employment allowance nor incentive allowance is subject to tax. Handicapped Children's Benefits and Allowances A handicapped child's allowance of $73 a month is payable to parents or guardians in respect of severely handicapped children under the age of 16 years who are cared for at home and need constant care and attention. The allowance continues to be payable in respect of dependantfull-time students aged 16-24 years except where the student is in receipt of invalid pension. It is also payable, wholly or in part, in respect of handicapped children who need marginally less care and attention than severely handicapped children. In these latter cases, the allowance may be paid if, by reason of the provision of care and attention, the family is subjected to severe financial hardship. A handicapped child's allowance is not subject to tax. The number of recipients of handicapped child's allowance at 30 June 1981 was 26000 and this number is estimated to increase to 26600 by 30 June 1982. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $19.1 million in 1980-81 to $21.3 million in 1981-82. The Commonwealth pays a handicapped children's benefit to non-profit organisations and local governlllent bodies conducting approved homes providing accommodation and care for intellectually and physically handicapped children. The rate of benefit is $5 a day for each child undert6--years of age. The benefit may continue to be paid to an eligible organisation when a child is absent from the institution for a short period only, such as a week-end home visit. Expenditure is estimated to increase from $1.8 million in 1980-81 to $2.1 million in 1981-82. Handicapped Persons' Facilities Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, the Commonwealth provides subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis to approved non-profit organisations and local government bodies for the purchase, construction, extension, alteration, rental and maintenance of premises that cater for physically or intellectually handicapped people. Services qualifying for subsidy comprise day training centres for handicapped children, activity therapy centres and sheltered workshops for handicapped adults and residential facilities for people who use these services. Residential facilities for people who, because of a disability, need special accommodation to allow them to engage in normal outside employment, also qualify for subsidy. Subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis are available also for the cost of furnishing and equipping the various types of centres, while assistance with operating costs may be provided by means of staff salary subsidies. The latter are usually on a $ for $ basis, although a higher proportion, up to 100 per cent, may be paid for the first two years of operation of new services. A training fee of $500 is paid to eligible sheltered workshops for I(ach· former employee who, after completing more than six months sheltered employment, graduates to and retains employment for 12 months or more. In December 1979, the Government announced its decision to further expand the number of services subsidised under the Act by allocating $33 million over the three years 1980-81 to 1982-83 for the establishment of new services. $11 million will be provided in 1981-82 towards the establishment of new services. In addition, a further $0.3 million will be made available in 1981-82 to upgrade the effectiveness and quality of services for the handicapped. Expenditure under this p-ogram is expected to rise from $51.4 million in 1980-81 to an estimated $55.5 million in 1981-82 due to the combined effects of cost increases affecting approved services and the completion of new facilities which will become operational during this financial year. Rehabilitation Services The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) provides treatment ana training to enable disabled persons to realise t-eir full potential in the physical, mental, social and vocational spheres. Treatment and training are provided free to persons if there is a reasonable prospect of their being able to undertake full-time, part-time or sheltered employment or household duties or of their becoming capable of leading an independent or semi-independent life at home. The following broad categories are accepted for rehabilitation: pensioners and claimants for pension who would be likely to derive substantial benefit from that treatment and training; beneficiaries and claimants for benefit who, without that treatment and training, would be likely to become unemployable; persons being paid allowances under Section9 of the Tuberculosis Act 1948 and who would be likely to derive substantial benefit from that treatment and training; persons of 14 or 15 years who, without treatment and training, would be likely to become qualified to receive invalid pension on attaining the age of 16 years; and men aged from 16 to 65 or women aged from 16 to 60 who would be likely to derive substantial benefit from that treatment and training. Persons who do not fall within these eligibility criteria may be accepted for rehabilitation on a paying basis. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $25.0 million in 1980-81 to $29.5 million in 1981-82 mainly as a result of the full year effect of price and salary increases during 1980-81. The number of persons accepted for rehabilitation and training is not expected to increase significantly beyond the 1980-81 level of 5622. Provision has been made within the Budget allocation for the Commonwealth's share of the costs of establishing and operating a rehabilitation centre in Hobart jointly with the Tasmanian Government ($1.5 million in 1981-82) and of the operation of a permanent rehabilitation facility in Newcastle in conjunction with facilities operated by the State Health Authority ($0.4 million). Preliminary.p18.JUling is also proceeding for the provision of a multi-purpose rehabilitation facility in the western suburbs of Melbourne in association with the State Health Authority. In addition to its multi-purpose centres, the CRS presently operates two Work Preparation Centres-one in Sydney and another in Melbourne-that aim to prepare mildly intellectually handicapped young people for open employment. A second centre will commence full operation during 1981-82 in each of these cities. In addition the Government has decided to establish a further three centreslduring 1981-82-one in each of Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. When in full operatiod, the seven centres will train up to 600 people a year for suitable employment. Other The Government is committed to supporting the observance of the International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP), 1981. In addition, the Government has decided to implement a number of measures to assist disabled persons. In support of IYDP, $0.4 million of administrative expenditure (included in the category, 'General Administrative and Other Expenditure') has been allocated to continue the national publicity and information program, and a further $0.2 million has been provided to assist the development of activity in the non-government sector through the National Committee of Non-Government Organisations and to support key national initiatives. Last year it was announced that up to $500 000 would be . provided to the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled towards the cost of a national headquarters building in Canberra. Of this, $449 800 has been paid to 30 June 1981; the balance of $50 200 has been provided for in 1981-82. Major measures to assist disabled persons are dealt with under relevant functional headings. Mentioned here are three initiatives. In 1980-81, $150000 was provided for interim assistance for the production of Braille books pending a review of arrangements for longer term assistance. The Government has considered the review and has decided to broaden assistance to include materials for the print-handicapped generally. Outlays in 1981-82 are estimated at $300000. In 1981-82, $250 000 has been provided to assist the provision of radio services for the print handicapped and $627 000 for payment to the Australian Caption Centre to establish facilities to sub-title television programs for the hearing impaired. Widows' Pensions and Allowances Pensions are payable to widows, subject to an income test. No period of residence is necessary if a woman and her husband were residing permanently in Australia when she became a widow. In other cases, there is a residence qualification of either five years continuous residence in Australia immediately prior to claiming a pension or ten years continuous residence in Australia at arty time. There are three classes of widows who receive pension: ClassA widow-a widow with one or more qualifying children in her care; ClassB widow-a widow without qualifying children who is at least 50 years of age or at least 45 years of age if her ClassA pension ceased after she reached that age because she no longer had a qualifying child in her care; and ClassC widow-a widow without qualifying children who is in necessitous circumstances within 26 weeks of her husband's death. . For all classes, the term 'widow' includes a woman who was the common-law wife of a man for at least three years immediately before his death. For ClassA and B, it also includes a wife who has been deserted for six months, a divorced woman and a woman whose husband has been imprisoned for six months. Widow pensioners are eligible for the same additional payments as are age pensioners (except that mother's allowance is paid in lieu of guardian's allowance) and the rates of payment are the same. These payments are subject to an income test. Widows' pensions are subject to personal income tax, although no tax is payable by those having little or no income apart from their pension. The additional payments are not subject to tax. At 30 June 1981 there were 88 000 ClassA widows, 78 000 ClassB wido'Ys and 120 ClassC widows in receipt of pensions. It is estimated that the number of ClassA widow pensioners will decrease by 5 000 to 83 000 during 1981 ""82 and the number of ClassB and ClassC widow pensioners will increase by 3 000 to 81 000. The average rate of pension for ClassA widow pensioners is estimated to rise from $83.80 a week in 1980-81 to $91.90 a week in 1981-82, an increase of 9.7 per cent. The average rate for ClassB and ClassC widows' pensions is estimated to rise from $61.70 a week in 1980-81 to $67.80 a week in 1981-82, an increase of 9.9 per cent. The main reason for these increases is the automatic increases in pension rates in line with movements in the CPI. The estimated cost of the increase in the rates of widows' pensions in November 1981 and May 1982 is $25.3 million in 1981-82 and $63.6 million in a full year. The cost of the changes to supplementary assistance is estimated to be $2 million in 1981-82 and $6 million in a full year. Supporting Parents' Benefits and Allowances A supporting parent's benefit is paid to sole parents who support one or more children without help from a partner and are not receiving another pension or benefit. The benefit is payable at the same rate as the ClassA widow's pension and subject to similar conditions. Supporting parents may also be eligible for supplementary assistance, additional benefit for children and mother's or guardian's allowance. There is a residence qualification if the claimant was not living in Australia at the time of becoming a supporting parent. At 30 June 1981, there were 107 000 supporting parent beneficiaries. It is estimated that the number will increase by 17000 to 124000 by 30 June 1982. This increase reflects the increased preference of many sole parents for supporting parents' benefit rather than ClassA widow's pension. The average rate of benefit (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from $85.70 a week in 1980-81 to $94.40 a week in 1981-82, an increase of 10.2 per cent. The main reason for this rise is the increases in benefit rates in line with movements in the CPI. The estimated cost of the increase in the rates of supporting parents' benefits in November 1981 and May 1982 is $18 million in 1981-82 and '$46.6 million in a full year. The cost of the changes to supplementary assistance is estimated to be $3 million in 1981-82 and $8 million in a full year. Other Expenditures recorded under this heading in 1980-81 were final payments under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act 1968. This scheme became redundant when the six months waiting period that applied to supporting parents' benefit in some cases was removed. Family Allowances Family allowances are payable to people with children under 16 years of age or dependent children aged 16 years but under 25 years who are receiving full-time education at a school, college or university and not in employment. Allowances are usually paid to the mother. Family allowance, orphan's pension and handicapped child's allowance are not payable outside Australia except where the child is: temporarily abroad; or living abroad pending migration to Australia (within four years). Parents of children receiving student allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and other related student assistance schemes are not eligible for family allowances. Family allowances are not paid in respect of students receiving invalid pension. The allowances are not subject to income tax. The following table sets out the actual number of children in respect of whom family allowances were paid at 30 June 1981 together with the estimated number at 30 June 1982. Rates of family allowance have been reviewed. The Government has decided to increase the rates of assistance for third and subsequent children by 50 per cent, and the rate for children in institutions from $21.70 a month to $39.00 a month for each child, effective from the entitlement period commencing 15 December 1981. The new rates will first be reflected in payments made in January 1982. The estimated cost of the higher rates is $62 million in 1981-82 and $124 million in a full year. Rates of family allowance are set out below: $a month Present Rates from Rates January 1982 First child 15.20 15.20 Second child 21.70 21.70 Third child 26.00 39.00 Fourth child . . . 26.00 39.00 Fifth and Later Children 30.35 45.55 Child in an institution . 21.70 39.00 Children in Families Total Full-time Children Per cent students in Instichange aged 16 tutions over Under to 24 including previous 30 June 16 years years Total students(a) Number year '000 '000 '000 '000 '000 1981 3938 279 4217 10 4227 +0.1 1982 (estimate) 3950 275 4225 IO 4236 +0.2 (a) At 30 June 198 I there were 660 students. Source: Department of Social Security. Outlays are estimated to increase from $950.4 million in 1980-81 to $1040 million in 1981-82 mainly because of the increase in rates of family allowances noted above and one additional payday charged to 1981-82. Children's Services The Commonwealth provides capital and recurrent assistance for services for children and their families-for example, day care, vacation care and after school care projects. Expenditure on children's services (excluding the block grants to the States and the Northern Territory to assist in meeting the costs of pre-school education) is estimated to be $47.1 million in 1981-82. The block grants for pre-schools are recorded under the functional heading 'Education'. Crisis Accommodation/or Families in Distress An amount of $2.0 million will be provided for the commencement of a program of crisis accommodation for families in distress. The Commonwealth will explore with the States and the Northern Territory possible approaches to the expenditure of funds under this program, with the objective of improving the stock of emergency accommodation available to families in distress. Orphan's Pension An orphan's pension of $55.70 a month is payable, free of income test, to the guardian of a child under 16 years of age or of a dependent full-time student aged 16 but under 25 years of age. It is paid in respect of a child both of whose parents are dead, or if the whereabouts of a sole surviving parent is unknown, or if its sole surviving parent or adoptive parent is in prison for at least ten years or in a mental hospital for an indefinite period. Orphan's pension is not payable in respect of a person who is receiving an invalid pension. The Government has decided to extend the eligibility criteria to include a refugee child both of whose parents are not in Australia or whose whereabouts are unknown. Orphan's pension is not subject to income tax. At 30 June 1981 there were 4000 recipients. As a result of the extension in respect of refugee children, the number is estimated to increase to 5800 by 30 June 1982. Expenditure is estimated to be $3.2 million in 1981-82 compared with $2.1 million in 1980-81, the increase mainly reflecting the increase in numbers in receipt of orphan's pension. Other The provision for the operations of the Institute of Family Studies in 1981-82 is $1.6 million, including $0.3 million for research grants approved by the Institute. A further $2.95 million is provided for grants to approved marriage counselling organisations and pre-marital education organisations. To maintain the level of educational activity and family planning, $0.78 million will be provided in 1981-82. Grants to family planning associations for clinical services in 1981-82, estimated at $2.5 million, are provided under Health Program Grants (see Section 3-'Health '). Unemployment Benefits Sickness and Special Benefits Unemployment benefit is available, subject to an income test, to persons without employment yet willing and able to undertake suitable work and who are making efforts tQ obtain work. Sickness benefit, also subject to an income test, is available for persons who lose income when they are temporarily incap-citated for work. A special benefit rnay be paid to persons ineligible for pension, supporting parent's benefit or for unemployment or sickness benefit if they are unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for themselves and their dependants. To be eligible for unemployment or sickness benefit, a person must be at least 16 years of age and under 60 years (females) or under 65 years (males). The person must also have lived in Australia for at least a year immediately prior to claiming benefit or intend to remain permanently. The Government has decided to amend the Social Services Act 1947 to prevent payment of unemployment benefits to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action or where the person has been refused an unemployment benefit or had an unemployment benefit cancelled or postponed. A person who has had unemployment benefit refused, cancelled or postponed will also be prevented from receiving special benefit but the spouse of such a person will still qualify for this payment in cases where extreme hardship would otherwise result. The basic rates of benefit are generally the same as for age and invalid pensions except for single people under 18 years of age and older unemployed people without dependants. Single people under 18 years of age are eligible for a maximum payment of $36 a week. The Government has decided that, from November 1981, the maximum rate of unemployment benefit for unemployed people aged 18 years and over without dependants should be raised from $53.45 a week to $58.10 a week. All unemployment and sickness beneficiaries with children are eligible for an additional allowance for each dependent child at the same rate as for children of pensioners. Mother's or guardian's allowance is not payable to unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries. After receiving benefits for six consecutive weeks, sickness beneficiaries become eligible, subject to a special income test, to receive supplementary allowance if they pay rent. The Government has decided that from February 1982, the maximum level of this allowance will be increased by $3 to $8 a week and will be payable on the same basis and subject to the same income test as supplementary assistance. Supplementary allowance is not payable to beneficiaries in hospital who have no dependants. The income tests for unemployment and sickness benefit are: in respect of unmarried persons ag-d 16 or 17 years with at least one parent living in Austrillia, benefit is reduced by 50 cents a week for each $1 of income in the range of $3 to $40 and by $1 a week for each $1 of income over $40 a week; and in respect of other persons, benefit is reduced by 50 cents a week for each $1 of income in the range of $6 to $50 a week and by $1 a week for each $1 of income over $50 a week. Unemployment and sickness benefits, including additional payments for children and supplementary allowance, are subject to personal income tax. Sickness beneficiaries who satisfy the Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits income test are entitled to receive Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits. As announced on 29 April 1981, unemployment and special beneficiaries will, subject to the same income test, be entitled from 1 September 1981 to similar concessional payment for health costs as holders of a health care card. These beneficiaries will not be eligible for other Commonwealth pensioner concessions. The cost of the automatic increase in the rates of unemployment, sickness and special benefits in November 1981 and May 1982 is estimated to be $17.5 million for unemployment benefit, $8.7 million for sickness benefit and $l.5 million for special benefit in 1981-82 and to be $47.2 million, $23.4 million and $3.9 million for these benefits, respectively, in a full year. The cost of increasing the maximum rate of unemployment benefits for persons aged 18 years and over without dependants is estimated to be $34 million in 1981-82 and $51 million in a full year. The changes to supplementary allowance are estimated to cost $1 million in .1981-82 and $2 million in a full year. The average number of unemployment beneficiaries underlying the 1981-82 estimate is 315000 compared with the average number of beneficiaries in 1980-81 of 310 000. The average number of sickness beneficiaries is estiinated to rise from 44 500 in 1980-81 to 50000 in 1981-82 and the average number of special beneficiaries is estimated to remain steady at about 21 000. Unemployment Relief The main activity under this heading, the Community Youth Support Sch-me (CYSS), is to be discontinued on 31 October 1981 when present funding commitments expire; an amount of $4.5 million will be available in 1981-82 to meet these remaining commitments. Under this scheme, introduced in 1976, financial support has been provided to representative community committees and local government authorities to conduct projects involving unemployed young people in a range of employment-orientation and skills development projects, recreational activities and community service work. More recently, the Commonwealth has taken a number of initiatives to increase the opportunities for young people to train as apprentices and to gain other more practical training and work experience .towards employment (details are under 'Labour and Employment'). For the future, these. education and training schemes are to be given a higher priority than supportive activities. Also under this heading are 15 other community-based youth support projects involving unemployed youth registered for employment with CES in a variety of voluntary community service activities and community speciaJ projects which also help the young people involved to maintain employable skills. An amount of $0.5million is provided to continue these projects through 1981-82. Relocation Assistance Scheme Assistance with relocation expenses is available, subject to approval by the Commonwealth Employment Service, to unemployed persons (or persons notified of impending redundancy) who have been unable to find continuing employment nearby within a reasonable time. Approval requires offer of a job in another area, for which no local CES registrants are suitable immediately or with training. The assistance covers fares, removal expenses (up to $1250), and re-establishment costs, legal and agent's fees (up to $1000) or rental allowances (up to $500). In 1980-81, 1500 persons were relocated under this scheme at a cost of $1.3 million. A similar provision is made in 1981-82, on the assumption that a similar number of applicants will be assisted. Funeral BenefitsA funeral benefit of up to $20 is payable to a person liable for the funeral costs of an eligible age or invalid pensioner or recipient of sheltered employment allowance or tuberculosis allowance. A funeral benefit of up to $40 is payable to an aged, invalid, wife or widow pensioner, a supporting parent beneficiary, or a person in receipt of sheltered employment allowance or tuberculosis allowance, who is liable for the funeral costs of spouse, a child or another pensioner. Funeral benefits are not taxable. For funeral benefit purposes a ""pensioner"" means a person who satisfies or had satisfied the Commonwealth pensioner ""fringe benefits"" income test. Expenditure is estimated at $1.45 million in 1981-82. Telephone Rental and Postal Concessions Pensioners, supporting parent beneficiaries and recipients of some other benefits who meet certain requirements, including, in most cases, a special income test, may be eligible for mail redirection concessions and a reduction of one-third in the basic annual rental for a telephone. Outlays on these concessions to social security and repatriation pensioners are estimated at $22.4 million in 1981-82. Assistance to Homeless Men and Women The Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1974 provides for the payment of capital grants to voluntary agencies and to local authorities for approved projects (night shelters, reception centres and hostels) in order to upgrade and replace inadequate existing accommodation and to build or purchase facilities for homeless persons. It also provides payment of a rental subsidy of up to 100 per cent, salary subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the salary of approved staff, an accommodation and meals subsidy of $1.20 a person a day and a basic rate of meal subsidy of 40 cents a meal in respect of nonresident homeless persons. Outlays in 1981-82 are estimated to be $6.3 million, of which $3 million is for the funding of new capital projects under the Government's $10 million program for the construction of new facilities announced in October 1980. Assistancefor Migrants In 1978 the Government accepted recommendations of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (Galbally Report) for new and expanded migrant and multicultural services, to cost $50 million over the three years. The results that have been achieved are being evaluated during 1981-82; meanwhile, funds will continue to be provided for these services at the rate recommended for the third year of the triennium. Grants to enable agencies serving ethnic communities to employ sociaJi'weifare workers will increase from $1.67 million to $1.87 million in 1981-82 and some 118 continuing or new grants are expected to be made to these agencies. These include grants under special schemes for the aged, grants to support on-going welfare rights information services and block funding schemes applying to larger agencies. Subsidies for self-help activities in ethnic communities are again funded at the level of $150 000 recommended in the Review. An amount of $1.49 million has been provided for contract translating and interpreting services, and a further $0.33 million has been provided under cost-sharing arrangements for services offered by New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. A provision of $1.02 million has been made in 1981-82 for the 23 migrant resource and information centres that are now operating throughout Australia. An allocation of $0.39 million will also be available to reimburse voluntary agencies providing material assistance to migrants arriving in needy circumstances; 16850 migrants received assistance through this scheme in 1980-81. The Community Refugee Settlement Scheme (CRSS) is a private, voluntary scheme which allows refugees to bypass migrant centres and go straight to the care of community groups. The Government has decided to make financial assistance available to voluntary bodies participating in CRSS in respect of second and subsequent refugee families, and has provided $135000 for this purpose in 1981-82. Overall provision for these services to migrants in 1981-82 is $5.7 million, compared with $5.6 million in 1980-81. Welfare Programs in the Australian Capital Territory The Commonwealth provides welfare benefits and subsidies to ACT residents on a similar basis to those provided by State governments (for example, rental rebates, care of foster children, rate remissions and pensioner travel). It is estimated that $7.6 million will be provided for these purposes in 1981-82 (compared with $7.9 million in 1980-81). This estimate includes the introduction in 1981-82 of motor registration concessions to pensioners in the ACT. Other The Commonwealth reimburses the Australian National Railways Commission for part of the cost of providing non-commercial concessional fares and freight rates, mainly to pensioners; the cost to the Commonwealth of these concessions in 1981-82 is estimated at $1.75 million, compared to $1.5 million in 1980-81. The Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs was established in 1979 to develop awareness and tolerance of diverse cultures through research, public information and other educational activities, and to provide advice to governments. An amount of $2.36 million is provided for this activity in 1981-82, including $0.53 million for renovation of accommodation in central Melbourne and $0.45 million for research projects. In 1981-82, $0.5 million has been provided for grants to community welfare agencies in financial difficulties or in need of support in providing emergency relief to persons. This item includes $47.8 million for payment to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). Within that total is $16.0 million for the provision of assistance to Aboriginal communities and groups to acquire land, to engage in business enterprises, to provide housing loans to Aboriginals at concessional rates of interest, and, more generally, to further the economic and social development of Aboriginals. On1 July 1981, the ADC assumed responsibility from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for direct grants to Aboriginal housing associations for the construction and purchase of homes for Aboriginal families. An amount of $22.8 million is included in the ADC's 1981-82 allocation for this purpose and it is expected that 550 new housing units will be constructed in 1981-82. A further $9 million is provided for payment into the ADC Aboriginal Entitlement Capital Account-Capital Fund, an accumulating investment fund. Income from this fund is available for expenditure on ADC programs. Also included is an amount of $25.1 million, to be provided in 1981-82 through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, for special assistance to Aboriginals, including grants-in-aid in the fields of employment, general welfare and training. Expenditure by the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) is estimated at $2.75 million in 1981-82. The NAC's role is to provide a forum for the expression of Aboriginal views, particularly on the long term goals and objectives of government in Aboriginal affairs. Grantsin-aid to Aboriginal communities for the improvement and maintenance of community amenities, previously included under this heading, now appear under 'Urban and Regional Development nec'. It is estimated that in 1981-82 an amount of $5.1 million will be payable by the Commonwealth in respect of royalty payments from mining on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory in accordance with section 63 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Payments are made to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account to be applied to or for the benefit of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This expenditure was previously included under 'Industry Assistance and Development-Other Mining (Net)'. This expenditure comprises the general running and capital expenses of the Departments of Social Security ($243 million in 1981-82), Veterans' Affairs, excluding expenses relating to repatriation institutions which are recorded under 'Health' ($69.1 million), Aboriginal Affairs ($17.4 million), and the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat ($0.6 million). These amounts include $8.8 million for the extra payday in 1981-82. 5. HOUSING The Commonwealth funds a range of programs to provide housing and to assist persons to attain home ownership. Some of this assistance takes the form of recycled funds, interest subsidies and tax concessions that are not reflected in Budget outlays. Factors contributing significantly to the increase of 17 per cent in outlays for 1981-82 are expanded eligibility criteria and the provision of family bonus grants under the Homes Savings Grants Scheme which were introduced from October 1980 and the 1980-81 Budget measure to increase the maximum loan under the Defence Service Homes Scheme. Outlays recorded lmder this function are also affected by the transfer of certain Aboriginal housing functions to the 'Aboriginal Development Commission' (see 'Social Security and Welfare'). 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Welfare Housing Assistance to the States and Northern TerritoryLoan Assistance 168.7 175.5 146.0 29.5 Repayment of Principal 33.5Cr 35.6Cr 37.9Cr 2.3 Net Loans 135.2 139.9 108.1 31.8 GrantsPensioner Housing 31.6 32.7 32.0 0.7 Aboriginal Housing 21.1 22.1 34.2 +12.1 Other Grants 52.6 56.2 50.0 6.2 Total Grants 105.3 111.0 116.2 + 5.2 Other Grants to States for Housing 5.5 5.5 8.0 + 2.5 Homes Savings Grants 71.6 44.6 74.0 +29.4 Repayments of Loans by Banks 40.8Cr 14.0Cr 4.6Cr+ 9.4 Defence Service HomesNet Payments 7.3 1.5Cr 64.1 +65.5 Interest Subsidy 29.7 34.1 40.2 + 6.1 Total 37.0 32.6 104.3 +71.7 Other General Housing ExpenditureCommonwealth Hostels 0.8 0.2 0.7 + 0.5 Other 4.3 7.3 6.0 1.3 Total 5.1 7.5 6.7 0.8 Housing in the A.C.T Dwellings Built for Sale or Rental 2.5 2.5 4.5 + 2.0 Other Gross Advances for Housing 17.5 18.4 22.6 + 4.2 Repayment of Principal 25.5Cr 31.6Cr 33.5Cr 1.9 Net Outlay 5.5Cr 10.8Cr 6.4Cr+ 4.4 Accommodation for Migrants 0.4 0.9 0.5 0.5 Housing for Aboriginals, nec 45.8 40.3 8.4 31.9 General Administration 4.4 4.7 5.8 + 1.1 Other Recoveries and Repayments 21.5Cr 21.2Cr 21.8Cr 0.6 Loan Assistance and Grants to the States and the Northern Territory for Housing Loan assistance and grants are being provided to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing purposes in 1981-82 in accordance with the terms of a new five-year Housing Agreement to be executed under the authority of the Housing Assistance Act 1981. These payments are to assist in the provision of concessional rental assistance and concessional loans for home ownership to low income earners. Under the Agreement, the Commonwealth will provide base financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory of $200 million in each year of the Agreement. The Commonwealth may also provide additional financial assistance; the amount being decided annually in the Budget context. In 1981-82, the Commonwealth is to provide a total of $262.2 million to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing compared with $286.5 million in 1980-81. An amount of up to $146.0 million is to be provided for loan assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1981-82. This compares with loans (previously called 'advances') of $175.5 million in 1980-81. The loans are repayable over a 53 year period and carry an interest rate of 4.5 per cent per annum. An amount of up to $116.2 million is to be provided to the States and the Northern. Territory as grants in 1981-82, compared with $111.0 million in 1980-81. In 1981""82 grants will be provided for three broad categories-pensioners, Aboriginals and untied grant assistance. Grants totalling $32.0 million are earmarked for rental housing assistance for pensioners. Eligible persons under the pensioners category include those in re-. ceipt of an age, invalid or widow's pension, a supporting parent's benefit, a special benefit, a sheltered employment allowance, a training allowance in certain. circumstances, and some classes of service pension. Grants totalling $34.2 million are earmarked for Aboriginals in need of rental housing assistance. This amount includes an additional $12.2 million in 1981-82 to take account of the transfer to the welfare hous-· ing program of grants to the States for Aboriginal housing previously provided by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (recorded up to and including 1980-81 under 'Housing for Aboriginals nec'). Untied housing assistance grants are to total up to $50.0 million in 1981-82. In 1981-82, all loan!I assistance and untied grant . assistance to the States and the Northern Territory is to be provided on a $1 for $1 matching basis. State and Territory expenditures on welfare housing and surpluses arising from the operation of the rental housing and home purchase assistance programs under the Agreement are eligible for matching purposes. The allocation ofloan assistance and untied grant assistance between rental housing and home ownership assistance programs will, under the new Housing Agreement, be determined by each State and the Northern Territory. Funds allocated to rental assistance programs will assist to provide concessional rental assistance for low income earners, and may be applied to the construction or acquisition of public housing for rental or sale and for innovative purposes covered by the Agreement, such as the leasing of dwellings from the private sector and private/public housing ventures. As under the previous Housing Agreement, the States and the Northern Territory have the responsibility for the design and conduct of their programs and are free to determine eligibility criteria, provided that assistance is directed to those in need. Emphasis continues to be placed on progressively moving rental ceilings to market rents. Rebates are provided to allow those unable to meet the ceiling rent to pay a rent geared to their income and· their family circumstances. This system aims to ensure that assistance is related to need. The Agreement does not impose a limit on the number of dwellings that may be sold, but all sales by the housing authorities are to be at market value or replacement cost, and on the basis of cash transactions. Funds allocated to home ownership assistance programs assist those who are unable to obtain mortgage finance in the private market. The Agreement does not impose specific means tests or pFescribe how assistance is to be provided; instead, each State and the Northern Territory is able to determine for itself the conditions of eligibility for home purchase assistance and to apply its funds to schemes of its own choosing. Assistance is provided on fiexibJy terms so as to limit concessions, as far as practicable, to the period of real need. Purchasers of public housing also have access to loans from the home purchase assistance program if they are unable to obtain finance in the private market. Details of the State by State and Northern Territory allocation of the $146.0 million 10al1 assistance and the $116.2 million grants in 1981-82 are shown in Budget Paper No. 7, ·Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities, 1981-82. Other Grants to States for Housing The States Grants (Housing) Act 1971 provides for housing assistance to the States by way of basic grants of $2.75 million a year, payable for a period of 30 years, in respect of the States' housing operations in each of the years 1971-72 and 1972-73. An amount of$5.5 million is provided in 1981-82 for this purpose. The payments are in lieu of an interest concession on funds ustfd by the States for welfare housing in those years. An amount of $2.5 million is included in the 1981-82 Budget for payment to Queensland as the Commonwealth contribution to losses incurred in rental housing operations under the 1945 Housing Agreement in respect of the years 1973-74 to 1977-78. Under the terms of the 1981 Housing Agreement, the Commonwealth will not be liable to contribute to any rental losses incurred under the 1945 Housing Agreement after 1 July 1981. Homes Savings Grants are payable to eligible persons to assist with the purchase or construction of a first home contracted for on or after 1 January 1977, on the basis of $1 for each $3 of savings held in an acceptable form such as deposits with savings and trading banks, credit unions, or building societies. A maximum basic grant of $2000 is payable in respect of savings over three years ending on the contract date, while basic grants of up to $1333 and $667 are payable in respect of savings over two years and one year respectively. A value limit on homes (including land) was introduced with effect from 25 May 1979. The current value limit for homes contracted for on or after 1 October 1980 is $60 000 ta$70 000. On that basis an applicant is eligible for a full basic grant in accordance with the amount saved if the home value does not exceed $60 000. The grant reduces progressively as the home value increases, cutting out completely at $70 000. In addition to the basic gtant, the Scheme has been extended to provide a family bonus of $500 for families with one dependant child and $1000 for families with two or more dependant children. The bonus is payable in respect of homes contracted for from 1 October 1980. An amount of $74.0 million has been provided for Homes Savings Grants in 1981-82, compared with expenditure of $44.6 million in 1980-81. The current nine months waiting period between receipt of an application and payment of a grant is expected to remain in 1981-82. 'Under the Banks (Housing Loans) Act 1974 loans of $150 million were made to savings banks and certain other banks to provide a short term stimulus to activity and employment in the home building industry. In response to a request from the Government in 1979, certain of the banks concerned have agreed to early repayments of all or part of their loans outstanding, adding substantially to repayments in 1979-80 and increasing 1980-81 repayments by $3.3 million above the amount formerly scheduled. Repayments for 1981-82 are estimated at $4.6 million. The balance of $5.1 million expected to be outstanding at 30 June 1982 is currently scheduled for repayment over the period , to 1984-85. The Defence Service Homes Scheme assists former and serving members of the Defence Force and certain other persons who meet the eligibility requirements to acquire a home by providing low interest loans. The maximum loan is $25 000. The first $12000 is available to borrowers at an annual interest rate of 3.75 per cent, the next $3000 at 7.25 per cent, and the remaining $10 000 at 10 per cent. The current ten months waiting period for loans to purchase existing homes is expected to continue in 1981-82. Total expenditure on Defence Service Homes loans is estimated at $160 million in 1981-82, compared to $101.6 million in 1980-81. This increase is largely the result of an increase of $10 000 in the maximum loan announced in last year's Budget. The expenditure in 1981-82 is expected to be financed as follows: (a) Non Budget Sources$85.5 million from repayments of principal retained in the Defence Service Homes Trust Account for re-Iending; and $6 million from a surplus in respect of previous years' operations retained in the Trust Account. (b) From the Budget$11.5 million in respect of excess payments by borrowers available to the Trust Account by way of the Special Appropriation under Section 39c of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918; and $57 million by way of a new capital appropriation from the Budget. In 1981-82 $15.1 million is being provided for the Defence Service Homes Corporation's administrative expenses, including salaries but excluding rent. An interest subsidy estimated at $40.2 million will be appropriated to the Corporation in 1981-82, compared with $34.1 million in 1980-81. The interest subsidy reflects the extent to which interest charged to borrowers of Defence Service Homes loans falls short of the interest payable to the Commonwealth on the Corporation's capital. Interest receipts from the Corporation estimated at $93.4 million in 1981-82 are recorded in the estimates of receipts (see Statement No.4). Provision is made for a capital repayment of$5. 7 million to be made from the Defence Service Homes Trust Account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1981-82 to reflect the proceeds of projected sales of surplus land holdings (this amount is offset against payments from the Budget to the Corporation). Repayments in 1980-81 amounted to $11.6 million. The Corporation has surplus land holdings as a result of the phasing out of the Corporation's estate development and construction activities. Receipts from the Corporation in 1981-82 in respect of administrative fees_and recoveries are estimated at $2.4 million and receipts in respect of excess payments to the Corporation by borrowers are estimated at $12.7 million. In 1981-82 $12.8 million of these and previous years' excess payments is expected to be drawn; $11.5 million for payment to the Defence Service Homes Trust Account and $1.3 million for other purposes specified in the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 such' as to meet borrowers' commitments for rates, repairs and other improvements. Outlays under this heading cover a variety of activities. Items of major expenditure include repairs and· maintenance of rental dwellings in the ACT ($4.1 million) and a provision of $0.7 million for a new dining room at the Wacol Migrant Hostel in Queensland, construction of which commenced in 1980-81. Dwellings Built for Sale or Rental The provision of $4.5 million in 1981-82 under this heading is for the commencement of 300 new houses and a continuation of works commenced in 1980-81 on the upgrading of older government houses and flats in the ACT. Other Gross Advancesfor Housing This item provides for loans under the ACT Commissioner for Housing Loans Scheme to means tested welfare applicants and for loans to public servants compulsorily transferred to the ACT and Queanbeyan (NSW). Eligible welfare applicants receive concessional interest rate loans and pay an effective rate of 5.75 per cent in the first year (with 0.5 per cent annual increases thereafter until the interest rate reaches the Commonwealth Savings Bank Housing Loan rate). A total of $22.6 million is expected to be available for these loans in 1981-82 compared with $18.4 million in 1980-81. Of the $22.6 million expenditure proposed, $19.2 million is for loans under the ACT Commissioner fCir Housing Loans Scheme ($17.0 million in 1980-81) comprising $6.1 million Budget appropriations and $13.1 million funds recycled through the ACT Housingllrust Account. The balance of the $22.6 million-$3.4 million-is for loans to public ser\.iants compulsorily transferred ($1.4 million in. 1980-81) and is being provided from Budget appropriations. The increase in funds for loans to public servants compulsorily transferred refiects the full year operation of revised arrangements for this program as well as an expected increase in 1981-82 in the number of transferees. The increase in funds in 1981-82 under the ACT Commissioner for Housing Loans Scheme provides for loans approved in 1980-81 but delayed because of difficulties in finalising finance and purchase arrangements. It is estimated that 750 loans (maximum loan $28 000) will be funded in 1981-82 and that the waiting period for welfare loans at 30 June 1982 will be about ten months. Repayment of Principal This item comprises repayments of principal in respect of loans provided for the purchase of private dwellings and of Commonwealth mortgages provided for the purchase of Government dwellings by tenants. The estimated increase of $1.9 million in 1981-82 mainly refiects the continuing trend for the early discharge of mortgages. This heading covers expenditure on minor works, new and replacement plant, and major items of equipment required in the operation of migrant centres and migrant transitory fiats. Expenditure in 1980-81 included $0.7 million for additional migrant accommodation. The number of migrants to be accommodated in migrant centres in 1981-82 is expected to increase by some 1700 to 26 700. However, as migrants' average length of stay in centres has fallen, no additional accommodation is required in 1981-82. The only expenditure included under this heading is that in respect of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd which will receive $8.4 million in 1981-82 for the provision of hostel accommodation for Aboriginals. The company now funds the operation of 101 hostels providing 2373 beds. From1 July 1981, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' (DAA) States Grants housing program was transferred to the Welfare Housing Program administered by the Department of Housing and Construction. The transfer followed the Government's decision, in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, to rationalise special housing assistance to the States. The transferred program, which previously appeared under this heading, will be maintained as an identifiable component under the Welfare Housing Program earmarking arrangements. In 1981-82 $34.2 million will be available to meet the housing needs of Aboriginals under these arrangements ($12.2 million of which represents the earlier DAA States Grants program) compared with $22.1 million in 1980-81. These figures are included under 'Aboriginal Housing Grants' in the Housing table above. In 1980-81 the Department of Aboriginal Affairs provided special housing assistance for Aboriginals through its grants-in-aid program ($22.1 million). In 1981-82 responsibility for this program will transfer from the Department to the Aboriginal Development Commission, and expenditure on the program now appears under the functional heading 'Social Security and Welfare-Aboriginal Advancement Programs nec'. Outlays of $5.8 million under this heading provide mainly for administrative costs of the housing function of the Department of Housing and Construction. Amounts under this item are derived mainly from rental of government dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory. The estimated increase of $0.6 million in 1981-82 is due to rent increases, partly offset by a decrease in the stock of rental housing through sale or demolition. The Government has confirmed its intention to sell the assets and business of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation subject to the understanding that the purchaser maintains the level of services currently provided. No allowance is made jn the 1981-82 estimates for the proceeds which may be received from the sale. 6. URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT NEC AND THE The Budget provides $78.6 million for activities covered by this heading in 1981-82, a decrease of $31.1 million or 28.3 per cent on 1980-81. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Urban and Regional Development necGrowth Centres (net) 27.0 23.6 32.4 + 8.8 Decentralisation Assistance (net) 10.2 7.0 5.8 1.2 Urban Rehabilitation (net) 0.8 1.7 4.9 + 3.2 Land Commissions/Urban Land Councils (net) 15.7 17.5 25.4Cr 42.9 Urban Flood Mitigation 0.8 1.0 1.0 Other Urban Development and Amenities 25.8 23.3 30.1 + 6.8 Total Urban and Regional Development nec 80.3 74.1 47.8 -26.3 Protection of the Environment 6.0 7.0 5.3 1.7 Sewerage and Garbage (net) 6.5 3.3 2.7 0.5 General Administrative Expenditure (net) 21.6 25.4 22.8 2.6 THE ENVIRONMENT 114.3 \09.8 78.6 31.1 This heading covers outlays related to urban and regional development which are not classified to other functions.' It includes assistance for the Alb-ry-Wodonga growth centre, general decentralisation, urban rehabilitation, urban flood mitigation and direct expenditure on development in the Australian Capital Territory. Growth Centres Of the gross provision of $32.4 million for growth centres, $27.5 million represents capitalised interest on advances to the States for Albury-Wodonga in 1981-82 and earlier years, and on earlier advances for the Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur growth centres. (These-and other capitalised interest provisions-represent, in effect, notional advances to the States which are offset by equivalent notional receipts from the States. The notional advances indicate. the ,extent of the concession actually afforded to the States by the deferment and capitalisation of interest payments.) An advance of $5 million-the same as in 1980-81-is provided for the Albury Wodonga growth centre in 1981-82. An additional $0.3 million-recorded as part of the General Administrative Expenditure item-is also provided in 1981-82, to meet the Commonwealth's one-third contribution to the estimated administrative expenses of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation in 1981-82. Decentralisation Assistance A gross amount of $7.8 million is provided in 1981-82 to meet the carry over of commitments from 1980-81 under the Commonwealth's Regional Development Program. The Program was introduced in 1977-78 to provide assistance of a capital nature to State, local government and community bodies, and private firms pursuing manufacturing and tertiary activities, in selected non-metropolitan centres. Under the Program, the Minister for National Development and Energy approved the provision of assistance to projects following consideration of recommendations made by the Decentralisation Advisory Board on applications for assistance. Financial assistance of $11.4 million was allocated for 20 projects during 1980-81, bringing the total amount of assistance allocated under the Program to 30 June 1981 to $36.5 million for 79 projects. Gross expenditure in 1980-81 amounted to $7.7 million. In April 1981 the Government announced the termination of the Program and the abolition of the Decentralisation Advisory Board. The funds being provided in 1981-82 are to meet commitments in respect of assistance already approved or recommended by the Board before that announcement. Repayments of, and interest payments on, loans made under the Program will continue for some years. Repayments during 1981-82 are estimated at $2 million and reduce the net outlay for the year to $5.8 million. In addition, interest payments on loans are estimated at about $2.5 million in 1981-82 (these are recorded with other interest as 'Receipts'). Urban Rehabilitation In 1974-75 the Commonwealth acquired, at a cost of $17.5 million, 700 dwellings aild about 30 commercial properties on 19 hectares of land at Glebe, Sydney, from the Anglican Church with a view to rehabilitating the Estate and preserving accommodation for low income families. In the context of the Review of Commonweath Functions, the Government announced that discussions would be held with a view to transferring the Estate to the New South Wales Government and that, if the State rejects the transfer, the Estate would be disposed of otherwise. It is not yet clear when transfer or disposal will occur. The 1981-82 estimates include $0.9 million for the continuation of rehabilitation work and $0.9 million for maintenance and administration costs-similar amounts were expended for those purposes in 1980-81. Income from rents is estimated at $0.9 million in 1981-82, similar to 1980-81. An amount of $4.4 million is provided to meet estimated expenditure in 1981-82 on further acquisition and site development-mainly for residential purposes-of land in the Woolloomooloo Basin of Sydney. Under a 1974-75 agreement, the Commonwealth undertook to provide grants of up to $17 million to New South Wales for the acquisition of 3.2 hectares of land and for planning and site development. Total payments to the State amounted to $12.2 million at the end of 1980-81. The agreement also provides for the State to make payments to the Commonwealth in respect of each unit of public housing produced and for the payment of receipts from any part of the property that is not retained for public housing. Such recoveries had amounted to $2.1 million by the end of 1980-81 and further recoveries of $0.2 million have been allowed for in 1981-82; these amounts have been offset against estimated outlays. In 1974 the Commonwealth advanced $3.5 million to Victoria to acquire, for rehabilitation, the Emerald Hill estate in South Melbourne. Repayments commenced in 1978-79 and are estimated to amount to $0.2 million in 1981-82. Land Commissions/Urban Land Councils (net) Under a program commenced in 1973-74, Commonwealth assistance was provided to several States for land acquisition, servicing the land acquired (where costs were not met from normal government subventions) and urban renewal and redevelopment. This program was terminated in 1977-78. Under the terms on which loans were provided under this program, repayments on the first of these loans are due to commence in 1983-84. However, a provision of an estimated $36 million is included in respect of an expected repayment in 1981-82 in settlement of loans provided in earlier years to South Australia for assistance to its Land Commission. This is partly offset by $10.6 million included in the estimates for 1981-82 representing estimated capitalised interest on loans provided to other States in 1977-78 and earlier years. Victoria has also proposed earlier settlement of loans provided for assistance for its Urban Land Council/Urban Land Authority. This matter is currently the subject of further consultations with that State. Urban Flood Mitigation Under the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974, $126000 was provided to Queensland in 1980-81 towards expenditure on the construction of flood mitigation works on creeks in the Brisbane metropolitan area. The Commonwealth also contributed $785000 in 1980-81 under the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 towards the cost of construction of flood mitigation wbtks on Kedron Brook in Brisbane and $75 000 towards the cost of flood protection fOlI)Launceston. The amount of any additional funds for urban flood mitigation works in 1981-82 will depend on allocations to be made for individual projects under the National Water Resources Program. These funds are classified under 'Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects' in the function 'Industry Assistance and Development '. Other Urban Development and Amenities An amount of $7.3 million is provided in 1981-82 for servicing ofland in the A.C.T. 'for commercial and industrial purposes. The 1981-82 provision for this purpose represents a decrease of $2.6 million on that for 1980-81, and reflects a reduced level of demand consistent with the stabilisation of Canberra's growth rate. This item includes $8 million for the Aboriginal Public Health Improvement Program (APHIP) as the first year's cost of the Government's new $50 million, 5 year program to improve Aboriginal environmental health. The APHIP is mainly concerned with the provision of clean water and sewerage for remote Aboriginal communities on a priority of needs basis, and will include direct payments to Aboriginal.communities and payments to the States and the Northern Territory for these purposes. The APHIP is, however, only one component of the ongoing programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for the improvement and maintenance of community amenities. Total expenditure on these programs in 1981-82 will be of the order of $22.3 million, including payments to the States and the Northern Territory of $5.5 million and direct payments to Aboriginal communities of $16.8 million. An amount of $5.3 million is being provided in 1981-82 for purposes related to protection of the environment. The reduced provision (expenditure in 1980-81 amounted to $7.0 million) reflects the completion of construction of the Baseline Air Monitoring Station in Tasmania and the transfer to the Northern Territory Government of financial responsibility for environmental regulatory services associated with uranium mining. An appropriate once only financial adjustment has been made to the Northern Territory General Purpose Assistance grant for 1981-82 to reflect this transfer. A significant component of the proposed expenditure under this heading relates to the support of the activities of the Supervising Scientist and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute in monitoring the environmental effects of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory ($4.3 million). Other outlays in 1981-82 under this heading are for air quality assessment ($56000), investigations into marine pollution ($97000), matching grants to assist conservation organisations ($350 000), and the operations of the Baseline Air Monitoring Station in Tasmania ($269 000). A net amount of $3.7 million is included in 1981-82 for the provision of sewerage, garbage and drainage facilities in the Australian Capital Territory. The reduction of $0.5 million compared with 1980-81 reflects the reduced demand for new facilities. Repayments of $0.9 million in respect of loans provided to the States in earlier years under a former program of assistance for sewerage works are offset against outlays under this heading. The major components under this heading are the administrative expenditure of the National Capital Development Commission ($11 million) and consultancy fees payable by the Commission for investigation, design and construction purposes ($7 million). The decrease of $3.4 million in outlays for these purposes by the NCDC reflects reduced activity on planning and development of new projects. Also included is that component of the administrative expenditure 9f the Department of Home Affairs and Environment (and in 1980-81 the former Department of Science and the Environment) which can be identified as relating to the environment ($3.1 million) and the Commonwealth's contribution to the running costs of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation mentioned earlier. 7. CULTURE AND RECREATION Provisions for the support of cultural and recreational activities are budgeted to increase by 15.0 per cent from $400.4 million in 1980-81 to $460.5 million in 1981-82. Most of the increase relates to the National Broadcasting and Television Service which, as noted below, will commence in 1981-82, payment of contributions in respect of its employer superannuation liability. Adjusted for this change, the increase in outlays on 'Culture and Recreation' in 1981-82 is 11.0 per cent. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change $miIlion$ miIlion$ million $ million National Broadcasting and Television Service 187.8 222.7 273.0 +50.3 Planning of Broadcasting 2.8 3.8 4.3 + 0.5 Regulation of Broadcasting Industry 2.9 3.4 3.7 + 0.3 Multicultural Broadcasting Services 7.1 27.0 26.0 1.0 Libraries 15.7 17.9 17.9 Australian National Gallery and Collection 16.6 23.5 25.4 + 2.0 Film Industry Development 5.8 6.2 6.2 + 0.1 Assistance to the Arts 26.8 29.9 31.7 + 1.8 War Memorials 2.4 2.7 3.3 + 0.5 Archives 11.1 9.5 9.6 + 0.1 Youth, Sport and Recreation 12.3 10.8 20.1 + 9.3 Other Cultural Organisations 1.8 3.0 7.8 + 4.8 Wildlife and National Parks 6.1 9.0 9.0 + 0.1 National Estate 2.4 3.1 3.4 + 0.3 Australian Heritage Commission 0.5 0.6 0.7 + 0.1 Cultural and Recreational Activities in the ACT nec 18.5 27.3 18.3 9.0 National Broadcasting and Television Service The radio and television programs of the National Broadcasting and Television Service (NBTS) are presented by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) and are broadcast through transmitters constructed and operated on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom). The existing arrangements between the Commonwealth and Telecom for the construction and operation of the transmitters are under review by the Government as part of its consideration of the recommendations in the Report of the recent Committee of Inquiry into the ABC. The overall net provision under tfils1i.eading is $273.0 million, an increase of 22.6 per cent on 1980-81. A large part of the increase is, as described below, related to special factors such as the Commonwealth Games and provision for the ABC to pay its employer superannuation liability. The allocations for the operational activities of the NBTS in 1981-82 total $237.2 million, comprised of $206.2 million for payment to the ABC and $31.0 million for payment to Telecom. Receipts from commercial stations sharing the national transmitter facilities at certain locations are estimated at $1.2 million. After allowance for cost increases, and for the provision of $16 million to enable the ABC to commence meeting its estimated employer superannuation liability, the provision for the ABC is expected to enable the Commission to undertake a slightly expanded level of activity in 1981-82. (Receipts from the ABC in respect of its employer superannuation liability are offset against outlays under the function 'General Public Services-Administrative Services'; consequently, there is no net effect on the Budget.) The Budget allocations do not take account of any recommendations by the Committee of Inquiry into the ABC, which are yet to be fully considered by the Government. Net capital outlays on the NBTS in 1981-82 are estimated at $25.1 million, compared with $20.5 million in 1980-81. The Budget provides $5.3 m.illion for the upgrading, and extension in country areas, of the NBTS transmitter network. An amount of $4.4 million has been provided for the rehabilitation of the Radio Australia station near Darwin (the total cost of this rehabilitation being estimated at $10 million spread over the three year period to 1982.. 83) and for minor works and equipment for other Radio Australia transmitters. As announced in 1979, additional funds are being provided to the ABC .over the period 1979 to 1983 to enable it to carry out the functions of Host Broadcaster for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The amount of $12.1 million provided for that purpose in 1981-82 is additional to expenditure of $3.9 million in 1980-81, and $0.21 million in 1979-80. Planning of Broadcasting The Department of Communications is responsible for overall planning of radio and television services in Australia, including the examination of technical matters relating to the adequacy and location of national, commercial and public broadcasting stations. Outlays by the Department on these functions in 1981-82 are estimated at $4.3 million, compared with $3.8 million in 1980-81. This includes an amount of $200 000 for field and laboratory investigations into the domestic earth stations to be used for reception of the proposed Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service, and $139000 for grants in support of public broadcasting, a function formerly undertaken by the Australian Film Commission. Regulation of Broadcasting IndustryA provision of$3.7 million is made for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to enable it to conduc;:t public inquiries into the granting and/or renewal of commercial and public broadcasting station licences, and to carry out other functions under the Broadcasting and Television Act relating to regulation of the radio and television industry. The Tribunal is also conducting a public inquiry into the question of whether cable television and/or subscription television should be introduced in Australia. Multicultural Broadcasting Services The total provision of $26.0 million for the Special Broadcasting Service in 1981-82 is designed to maintain multicultural television services and ethnic radio services at about the same overall levels as in 1980-81. The amount of $6 million to be provided for ethnic radio services is $1.2 million greater than expenditure for this purpose in 1980-81; as in 1980-81, it includes $400000 for grants of direct financial assistance to ceitain public broadcasters who transmit ethnic programs. An amount of $20 million has been provided to meet the estimated cost of the first full year of operations of the new multicultural television services in Sydney and Melbourne. This compares with a total of $22.0 million spent for this purpose in 1980-81; comprising $16.5 million for operational costs and $5.5 million for initial capital outlays on studio equipment and related transmission facilities. Libraries The 1981-82 provision for t.he expenses of the National Library of Australia is $17.9 million. The Canberra Public Library Service (CPLS), formerly included under this heading, is now administered by the Department of the Capital Territory. Expenditure on the CPLS (about $2 million in 1981-82) is included in that Department's administrative votes under the function 'General Public Services-Administrative Services'. In 1981-82 the Library will commence development of an Australian National Bibliographic Network. The Network will allow on-line consultation of the National Library's data base of cataloguing information by libraries throughout Australia. The provision for the National Library includes $10.6 million for salaries and related costs and $3.3 million for the purchase of library materials. The materials planned for purchase by the National Library as part of its ongoing program include a wide range of books and periodicals, a number of films, pictorial material, maps, sound recordings, music scores and manuscripts. These acquisitions are additional to the general collection through the requirement under the Copyright Act 1968 that copies of Australian publications be deposited with the Library. The Government has decided that no funds are to be provided in 1981-82 for proposed extensions to the National Library building. As announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the project has been deferred for two years. Australian National Gallery and Collection In recognition of the approach of the scheduled opening in October 1982, the Gallery's allocation for 1981-82 is $15.0 million compared with a provision in 1980-81 of $11.1 million. Of this amount $2.7 million is provided for acquisitions of works of art to supplement the growing National Collection and $5.7 million is provided for display fitout and loose furniture for the Gallery building as part of a program, now estimated to cost $9.0 million, to be completed in time for the Gallery's opening. Provision is made for the costs associated with a further increase in the staffing of the Gallery. Expenditure on the Gallery building in 1981-82 is expected to decrease from $12.4 million to $10.4 million. The total cost of the building is estimated to be $53.3 million at June 1981 prices. Film Industry Development The Australian Film Commission assists the industry by means of equity capital and loans for the production, promotion and distribution of Australian film, radio and television programs. In addition, grants are provided to encourage creative development in those media. The provision of $6.2 million will allow the Commission to maintain its activities at about the same level as in the past two years. Assistance to the Arts The Australia Council administers the Commonwealth's major programs of assistance to the Arts through Boards responsible for theatre, community arts, music, literature, Aboriginal arts, crafts and visual arts. The total allocation for the Council in 1981-82 is $29.3 million and consists of the following components: $ million Australian Opera 3.337 Australian Ballet Foundation 1.602 Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust Orchestras 2.741 General Support for the Arts 17.285 Administration 4.343 29.308 Included in the Council's General Support for the Arts program is $545000 to assist the Commonwealth Arts Festival planned to coincide with the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. Administration of the Public Lending Right Scheme, formerly controlled by the Council, has been transferred to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and is expected to cost $1.3 million during 1981-82. Artbank, which co-ordinates all lending programs of Commonwealth-owned art works and acquires works of art from Australian artists so that those works can be brought to public notice by placing them on hire in public places, is to be provided with $425 000 for its operations in 1981-82. The International Cultural Corporation of Australia Ltd, established in 1979-80 to manage international art exhibitions touring Australia, will receive $250 000 in 1981-82. Also provided this year is $500 000 as the Commonwealth's contribution towards a permanent building for the Australian Ballet in Melbourne. War Memorial An amount of $3.3 million is provided for operating costs, including necessary development of programs and maintenance of collections held by the Australian War Memorial in 1981-82, compared with $2.7 million in 1980-81. Archives In 1981-82 an amount of $9.6 million is provided to preserve and maintain archival material of national significance or public interest. The costs of increased archival work loads are largely offset by a reduction in capital expenditure on additional repository capacity, although provision is made for some further works on repositories (principally at Bellerive, Tasmania). Youth, Sport and Recreation The provision of $20.1 million under this heading in 1981-82 represents a $9.3 million or 87 per cent increase over 1980-81. This is largely accounted for by the inclusion of $6.6 million for a new program of assistance for the establishment of approved international standard sports facilities. The Government will provide $25 million for the program over the next three years on a $ for $ matching basis with the States and Territories. Other provisions for assistance to sport in 1981-82 include the following: $2.9 million for the Sports Development Program under which assistance is provided to national sporting bodies for administration, coaching and other activities such as participation in international competition; $200 000 for a new program of financial assistance for sport and recreation for the disabled; $185000 for preparation of the Australian team for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane; $2.5 million as the final instalment of a $10 million grant to the Queensland Government for capital costs associated with the 1982 Commonwealth Games; $200 000 to assist with the staging of a 'dress rehearsal' games event in Brisbane in October 1981; $420000 to Griffith University towards the 1982 Commonwealth Games Village; $2.6 million for the first full year's operating expenses of the Australian Institute of Sport which has been established in Canberra to give potential top class Australian sportsmen and sportswomen access to specialised coaching programs while allowing them to pursue their studies and careers; and $1.6 million to complete construction of a specialist gymnastics facility for the Australian Institute of Sport. It is also proposed to commence the National Swimming Training Centre for the Australian Institute of Sport. Total cost of the latter project is estimated at $7 million, with estimated expenditure of $0.4 million in 1981-82. Also included in 1981-82 under this item are $0.5 million for grants-in-aid to youth organisations, $440000 for grants-in-aid to life saving bodies, and $1.2 million for grants-in-aid to Aboriginal communities and groups for cultural, recreational and sporting activities. Other Cultural Organisations A major element of the increase in this item from $3.0 million in 1980-81 to $7.8 million in 1981-82 is the provision of $3.6 million for Australia's participation in the 1982 International Energy Exposition in Knoxville, USA. Also included is $2.8 million ($1.5 million in 1980-81) for the operating expenses of the Australian Bicentennial Authority which was established to prepare for the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988. Grants totalling $260 000 have been provided for the National Trusts and $266000 is included for the National Women's Advisory Council. Also included are provisions for the observance of Australia Day ($350 000), and administration of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 under which funds are provided for rewards as and when approved. The Government has decided that the provision of capital funds for construction of the Museum of Australia should be deferred indefinitely, but an amount of $0.4 million has been provided for continuing development of the Museum in 1981-82, including $0.1 million for the National Historical Collection. Wildlife and National Parks Under this heading $9.0 million is provided in 1981-82 (virtually the same as in 1980-81) for wildlife conservation and management and development of national parks. Outlays include $2.2 million for the operations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), $6.1 million for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), and $0.7 million for expenditure by the Department of the Capital Territory on nature reserves in the A.C.T. Expenditure by the GBRMPA in 1981-82 includes $130000 to meet the Commonwealth's half share of day-to-day management costs of the Capricornia Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments have agreed to share these operational costs equally. An amount of $150 000 is provided to meet initial capital works in the Section for which the Commonwealth is responsible. Of the allocation for the ANPWS, $3.8 million is for the development and operation of the Uluru and Kakadu National Parks in the Northern Territory. Consistent with recent Government decisions, the operational functions of the ANPWS are to be scaled down and discussions are being held on possible arrangements for the operation of the two Northern Territory parks by the Northern Territory Government. The arrangements are to ensure a continuation of Commonwealth influence in those aspects of the Parks of essential interest to it. National Estate As in 1980-81, an amount of $2.2 million is provided to finance programs of assistance for the restoration, preservation and improvement of buildings and areas of special significance. In addition, $1.2 million is to be provided to the Tasmanian Government on a $2 for $1 matching basis for the third year of a seven-year program to restore and develop the Port Arthur region. The cost to the Commonwealth of this program is currently estimated to be of the order of $6 million over the seven-year period. Australian Heritage Commission The Australian Heritage Commission is responsible for the identification of places of National Estate significance and for the development of measures for their protection. An amount of $0.7 million is provided in 1981-82 for the running costs of the Commission. Cultural and Recreational Activities in the ACT nec This heading covers the net cost of construction and maintenance of parks, gardens and reserves, and the provision of assistance for cultural, recreational and community activities in the ACT (including Jervis Bay). The reduction in estimated 1981-82 expenditure is mainly attributable to completion in 1980-81 of the National Indoor Sp-rts Centre ($6.4 million) and sundry works at the National Athletics Stadium ($1.0 million) as well as a non-recurring payment in 1980-81 for the discharge of the Canberra Showground Trust's loan liabilities ($1.0 million). 8. ECONOMIC SERVICES This category covers the various economic services and forms of economic assistance provided by the Commonwealth to industry and the community generally. It includes the provision of economic infrastructure, the regulation of private sector economic activity and more direct forms of Government participation in economic activity. A. TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICA nON The following table shows the Commonwealth's expenditure for transport and communication purposes in 1979-80 and 1980-81, and the estimates for 1981-82. In aggregate, these outlays are expected to increase by 11.2 per cent in 1981-82 and to represent 2.7 per cent of total outlays. A number of the Commonwealth authorities which operate transport and communication services now borrow on their own behalf. Transactions between these authorities and the Budget have in recent years been largely confined to the repayment of earlier loans from the Budget, together with interest and dividend payments to the Budget recorded in Statement No.4 under 'Interest, Rent and Dividends'. Figures for the Commonwealth sector as a whole, which take account of the activities of these authorities, are published in Budget Paper No. lO-National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million CommunicationAuthorities Providing Communication Services 14.0Cr II.7Cr -11.7 Radio Frequency Management 6.4 10.5 11.6 + 1.1 Administrative and Other 5.2 3.0 4.5 + 1.4 Total Communication 2.4Cr 13.5 4.4 9.2 Air TransportQantas Repayments 38.2Cr 24.5Cr 10.OCr+ 14.5 Australian National Airlines Commission Repayments 57.4Cr 6.8Cr 3.0Cr+ 3.8 Provision of Civil Aviation ServicesAdministrative and Operational 202.7 240.9 276.7 +35.8 Buildings and Works 10.3 38.2 54.5 +16.2 Plant and Equipment 12.3 11.7 17.7 + 6.0 Air Transport Subsidies 0.5 0.7 5.3 + 4.6 Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan 4.0 4.2 9.6 + 5.4 Other 0.8 0.7 0.9 + 0.2 RecoveriesAir Navigation Charges 84.0Cr 95.9Cr 115.8C': -19.9 Airport Rentals and Business Concessions 37.2Cr 35.8Cr 37.0Cr 1.2 Other 9.5Cr 10.2Cr 11.0Cr 0.7 Total 99.9 154.5 201.0 +46.5 Total Air Transport 4.3 123.3 188.0 +64.8 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Road TransportRoad Grants to States and Northern Territory 565.0 628.0 685.0 +57.0 Road and Related WorksIn the ACT 29.3 19.8 18.9 0.9 Other (net) 0.4 5.8 16.9 + 11.1 Public Transport Equipment in the ACT 3.3 2.8 5.7 + 2.9 Road Research and Investigations 0.3 0.3 1.9 + 1.6 Total Road Transport 598.3 656.7 728.5 +71.7 Rail TransportAustralian National Railways CommissionOperating Loss 58.1 56.0 56.5 + 0.5 Capital Works 38.2 20.0 5.0 -15.0 Alice Springs-Darwin Railway Preliminary Planning 0.1 0.3 3.0 + 2.7 Mainline Upgrading 5.1 14.8 24.3 + 9.5 Other Rail Transport 0.9 0.8 0.1 Repayments 4.8Cr 5.6Cr 5.2Cr+ 0.3 Total Rail Transport 96.8 86.4 84.3 2.1 Special Payment to Victoria for Transport 35.0 +35.0 Urban Public Transport 42.1 44.1 1.5 42.5 Transport Planning and Research 9.2 8.8 2.9 5.9 Shipping and HarboursAustralian Shipping Commission 12.6Cr 32.0Cr -19.4 Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme 27.6 29.5 32.7 + 3.2 Other Shipping Subsidies 2.0 3.8 3.8 Other 4.6 8.0 12.1 + 4.1 Repayments 0.3Cr 0.3Cr 0.2Cr+ 0.1 Total Shipping and Harbours 33.8 28.3 16.4 -12.0 PipelinesPipeline Authority 28.8 25.9 32.6 + 6.7 Repayments 16.5Cr 16.1Cr 17.4Cr 1.3 Total Pipelines 12.3 9.8 15.2 + 5.4 General Administrative and Other Expenditure 40.2 47.4 55.0 + 7.7 Other Recoveries 27.0Cr 29.0Cr 30.8Cr 1.8 Authorities Providing Communication Services Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom) Telecom is required to operate on a commercial basis with the financial objective of generating, by way of charges for services, such amounts as will enable it to cover its operating costs and to meet at least half of its capital expenditures. Since 1977-78, there has been no need to provide any capital advances to Telecom from the Budget. Receipts of interest on capital and loans provided to Telecom by the Commonwealth are recorded in Statement No. 4 under the heading 'Interest, Rent and Dividends'. The Government has decided, with effect from 1 January 1982, to increase to 10 per cent per annum the average rate of interest payable by Telecom on the outstanding capital advances provided by the Commonwealth at the time of Telecom's establishment (1975) In addition, the terms of Telecom's outstanding capital advances from the Commonwealth are to be consolidated to provide for regular conversions over a ten year period commencing in 1982-83 so as to, infuture, more closely reflect current commercial conditions. Telecom's capital works program in 1981-82 is estimated to be about $1265 million, compared with about $1180 million in 1980-81. To finance this program, Telecom will again borrow on the domestic capital market in 1981-82, although the bulk of the funds required will continue to come from Telecom's internal sources, mainly depreciation provisions and retained profits. Australian Postal Commission (Australia Post) Australia Post also is required to operate on a commercial basis with the financial objective of raising, by way of charges, such amounts as will enable it to cover its operating costs and to meet at least half of its capital expenditures. Since its inception in 1975, Australia Post has been able to finance all of its capital works from internal sources. Australia Post is expected to make a capital repayment of $11.7 million to the Commonwealth in 1981-82, bringing its total repayments of capital since 1975 to $77 million. Similarly to Telecom, Australia Post will be required to pay in 1981-82, and subsequently, increased rates of interest on its outstanding capital advances from the Commonwealth. Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) OTC also is required to operate on a commercial basis. In 1981-82, OTC is expected to pay dividends totalling $20 million to the Commonwealth, compared with $25 million in 1980-81 (see Statement No.4-Interest, Rent and Dividends). The reduction reflects OTC's commitments to financing the first stage of a new trans-Pacific cable-up to a limit of about $200 million-and to increased investment in the international satellite systems, INTELSA T and INMARSA T, as well as its normal capital works programs. Radio Frequency Management Administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 includes regulation of the operations of many radio communications licensees (including 'Citizen Band' licensees). The provision of $11.6 million for this purpose in 1981-82 allows for an increase in operational activities, compared with 1980-81, so as to enable improved surveillance, and hence more effective utilisation, of the radio frequency spectrum in future. Administrative and Other Expenditures This item consists largely of the salary and administrative expenses ($3.2 million) of the Department of Communications which have not been attributed to other functions. It also includes $1 million for salaries and other expenses relating to the proposed Committees of Inquiry i'nto the appropriateness of the existing monopoly powers and functions of the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission. These Committees are each expected to report to the Government in 1982. AIR TRANSPORT Repayments by Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian National Airlines Commission Past advances to these bodies comprised mainly the proceeds of loans raised by the Commonwealth on behalf of the airlines to assist in the financing of aircraft purchases. Amounts repaid by the airlines to the Commonwealth in respect of past loans (estimated at $13.0 million in 1981-82) are in turn repaid to the lenders. The forecast reduction (from $31.3 million in 1980-81) reflects the timing of repayments. The balance outstanding in respect of these loans as at 30 June 1981, about $59 million (based on exchange rates as at 30 June 1981), is expected to be repaid over the next five years. These bodies now raise loans on their own behalf, in some cases under Commonwealth guarantee, and have not borrowed from the Budget since 1976-77. Civil Aviation Services The Department of Transport provides many services to the air transport industry, including air traffic services and the operation of over 80 aerodromes and a network of air navigation facilities. These activities account for the major portion of administrative and operational expenditures and outlays on buildings, works, plant and equipment. Civil Aviation Services-Administrative and Operational Expenditure Administrative and operational expenditure on air transport activities in 1981-82 is estimated at $276.7 million, an increase of $35.8 million over 1980-81; salaries including overtime account for $196.8 million, up $26.1 million on 1980-81. The total provision represents a significant real increase in expenditure in 1981-82 and caters for the introduction of new aircraft types, forecast growth in air traffic (estimated at an average of 6.8 per cent in 1981-82) and other increases in demand for services. The estimates also include, for the first time, provision for the Department of Transport to pay radio communication licence fees. These charges were extended from 1 July 1981 to Commonwealth Departments which use the radio frequency spectrum. A provision of $516000 has been included in 1981-82 for this purpose. Civil Aviation Services-Buildings and Works Provision for outlays on buildings, works and related acquisitions totals $54.5 million in 1981-82 compared to $38.2 million in 1980-81. Estimated expenditure in 1981-82 on works currently in progress includes $28.0 million on the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport (stage one), $2.0 million on upgrading Norfolk Island Airport and $4.7 million on initial works at several airports associated with the introduction of wide bodied aircraft. In addition, approval has been given to the commencement of a new program of works costing $74.1 million in total, with expenditure in 1981-82 of about $14.5 million, including: additional facilities associated with the introduction of wide bodied aircraft by the domestic airlines at Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide and facilities for redeployed B727s at Hobart and Coolangatta airports; Brisbane Airport further dredging and reclamation works and extensions to the international terminal building; Melbourne Airport -servicing sites for heavy freight and executive jet aircraft; Adelaide Airport -provision of temporary international facilities; and Perth Airport -erection of operations centre and control tower. Other airport works, including those associated with the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport (stage 1) not yet put to contract, are subject to further consideration by the Government. Civil Aviation Services -Plant and Equipment An amount of $17.7 million is provided in 1981-82 for purchases of navigational, communication and other technical equipment. This is part of a $50.3 million program of equipment expenditures planned for the next four years. The program includes upgrading of radar installations at major airports, the continuing extension and replacement of the fleet of vehicles for the rescue and fire fighting services, the rationalisation and replacement of the Department of Transport's light aircraft fleet at an estimated cost of $8.8 million over three years, and the upgrading and replacement of Departmental computer equipment. Air Transport Subsidies As announced in April 1981, the Government is providing assistance to reduce air fares charged by the two major carriers on routes between Tasmania and Melbourne below the fares applicable on comparable routes on the mainland. A provision of $5.0 million has been made in 1981-82 for the purpose of equating the increase in Tasmania-Melbourne fares to the national average increase in fares following adjustment of the national air fare formula. Aerodrome Local Ownership PlanA provision of $9.6 million has been made in 1981-82 (compared with $4.2 million in 1980-81) to meet the Commonwealth's share of expenditure on approved aerodrome development and maintenance projects proposed by local government authorities and other aerodrome licensees under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan. Of this amount, $7.0 million is for development works including $4.2 million on new projects. The Commonwealth's commitment to the Plan over the next three years currently totals $40.8 million of which $37.8 million is for development works including $32.7 million on pre-transfer works at Government aerodromes subject to local authorities agreeing to accept ownership. The major projects under the Plan are at Cairns ($20 million), Tamworth ($7 million), Devonport ($5.5 million) and Karratha ($1.3 million). Civil Aviation Services-Other An amount of $460000 (47 per cent more than in 1980-81) is provided for a number of research projects, including continued support for the Navigational Aids Research Group at the University of Sydney. The estimates also include contributions of $380000 to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) , $28000 to the Gliding Federation of Australia, $25 000 to the Commonwealth Air Transport Council, $20000 to the Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia, and $10 000 to the General Aviation Association. The total provision for these aviation bodies represents a 12 per cent increase on 1980-81 expenditure:. Civil Aviation Services-Recoveries Air Navigation Charges. The forecast increase of $19.9 million over 1980-81 recoveries reflects expected growth of 1.6 per cent in airline movements and 7.5 per cent in general aviation sector activity, the full year effect of increases in domestic trunk air navigation charges in 1980-81, the expected receipt in 1981-82 of some arrears in collections from 1980-81, and the Government's decision, as announced in the Budget Speech, to vary air navigation charges for all sectors of the industry. With effect from 1 October 1981, charges are to be reduced by 5 per cent for international airlines and increased by 12.5 per cent, 25 per cent and 20 per cent respectively for the domestic trunk, regional airlines and general aviation sectors. These variations are estimated to yield net additional recoveries of $3.5 million in 1981-82 and $5.3 million in a full year. Overall cost recovery in 1981-82 is estimated at about 60 per cent. The recovery rate is expected to be more than 100 per cent for international airlines, approaching 100 per cent for the domestic trunk sector, nearly 30 per cent for regional airlines and about 15 per cent for the general aviation sector. Overrecovery from international airlines will continue to be credited to the cost recovery program and applied to the development of aviation infrastructure. Airport Rentals and Business Concessions Revenue from airport rentals is estimated to increase marginally to $16.0 million in 1981-82. Revenue from business concessions at airports in 1981-82 is estimated at $21.0 million, an increase of $0.8 million over 1980-81. The irtcrease is mainly attributable to expected improved returns from existing concessions at major city terminals. Other Recoveries Recoveries in 1981-82 from other Departments and organisations for services provided by the Department of Transport are estimated at $8.1 million, about the same real level as in 1980-81. Amounts totalling $0.5 million are expected in 1981-82 from charges levied on a range of regulatory services provided by the Department of Transport; recoveries from this source in 1980-81 were $0.3 million. ROAD TRANSPORT Road Grants to States and NT The Commonwealth is to provide $3650 million to the States and the Northern Territory for expenditure on upgrading the Australian road system over the five year period 1980-81 to 1984-85. Of this amount, $685 million is to be made available in 1981-82 under the Roads Grants Act 1981. This is 9.1 per cent more than provided in 1980-81. Amounts to be made available in later years are $734 million in 1982-83, $778 million in 1983-84 and $825 million in 1984-85. Road and Related Works in the ACT This heading covers outlays on the construction, improvement and maintenance of urban, arterial, and rural roads, highways and bridges in the ACT. In 1981-82 an initial payment of $0.3 million is to be made to the NSW Government as a contribution to the construction of the Burbong Bridge (which, although to be located in NSW, would replace an older bridge on the ACT side of the border). Other outlays under this heading include $8.9 million for construction of new roads and improvements to existing roads, $6.8 million for road maintenance and $2.9 million for improvement of street lighting. Road and Related Works-Other (net) The Commonwealth is funding (by way of special grants) the full cost of providing a second bridge across the Derwent River at Hobart. The total cost of the bridge and its immediate approaches is estimated to be about $43 million in June 1981 prices of which an estimated $17.5 million is to be made available in 1981-82. The bridge is expected to be completed in 1984. Expenditures under this heading are net of annual repayments of $0.6 million from Queensland in respect of advances provided over the period 1963-64 to 1966-67 for the construction of beef cattle roads. Public Transport Equipment in the ACT Expenditure under this heading includes the purchase of buses for Canberra's bus service (ACTION) and the purchase of special duty vehicles for the vehicle fleet operated by the Department of the Capital Territory. Estimated expenditure in 1981-82 is $5.7 million compared with $2.8 million in 1980-81. This increase is due to the payment in 1981-82 for new buses ordered during 1980-81 to meet operational requirements arising from increasing fleet age and patronage. Road Research and Investigations The provision under this heading comprises the Commonwealth's financial contribution of$1.6 million to the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) made through the Department of Transport and an amount of $259 000 paid to that Board by the Department of Housing and Construction. (An explanation of the changed basis for Commonwealth financial assistance to ARRB is contained under the heading 'Transport Planning and Research'.) RAIL TRANSPORT Australian National Railways Commission (ANR) The allocation to ANR consists of a subsidy to meet operating losses and advances for capital works. The Government is looking to ANR to continue efforts begun in 1978-79 to eliminate operating losses within ten years. While the provision for operating loss subsidy in 1981-82 of $56.5 million is $0.5 million more than in 1980-81, this includes $3.0 million to cover net interest payments on off-Budget borrowings for the Adelaide-Crystal Brook Railway which is not expected to achieve any revenue benefits until 1982-83. The estimated total cost of ANR's capital works program is $108.6 million. Expenditure of $58.0 million in 1981-82 is to be financed from outlays under this item ($5.0 million); from ANR borrowings on the domestic capital market ($37.9 million, comprising $13.9 million raised in 1980-81 and $24.0 million to be raised in 1981-82); and from internal funds ($15.1 million) which are derived through the subsidy to meet operating losses. Estimated expenditure by ANR on major projects in 1981-82 includes $2.0 million to complete construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs which came into operation in 1980-81. The total cost of the project is expected to equal the statutory limit of $145 million specified in 1974. The expenditure also includes $3.0 million as part of a ten year program (estimated to cost $20 million), begun in 1976-77, for the rehabilitation of railway lines in Tasmania. Both projects are to be financed by outlays under this item. In addition, a further $37.9 million is planned to be spent on the construction of the standard gauge railway between Adelaide and Crystal Brook; this will be financed by borrowings from the domestic capital market. The Government has,approved the extension of the standard gauge railway to service the shipping and industrial facilities on the Le Fevre Peninsula, Adelaide, as an integral part of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook project. The extension is estimated to cost $4.9 million bringing the total project cost to $77.9 million in March 1981 prices. Construction is expected to be completed in 1984 although initial standard gauge services are planned to commence in the second half of 1982. Alice Springs-Darwin Railway Preliminary Planning The Government has decided to provide up to $10 million for the planning stage of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin staqdard gauge railway. The route identification survey, detailed design and preparation of cost estimates are being undertaken by the Australian National Railways Commission. A total of $280 000 was spent on the project in 1980-81; prOVIsion has been made f6r expenditure of $3.0 million on the work in 1981-82. It is expected that the planning stage will take place over a number of years. Mainline Upgrading Under the National Railway Network (Financial Assistance) Act 1979, assistance of up to $70 million may be provided to the States over the five year period to 1982-83 to finance strategic, high benefit projects designed to improve the efficiency of the national mainline railway network. Loansrtotalling $68.6 million have been committed under agreements concluded with thofe States which operate their own nonmetropolitan railway systems. Of this lamount, New South Wales is to receive $22.8 million; Queensland $20.3 million; \fictoria $19.1 million; and Western Australia $6.4 million. As at 30 June 1981 amouhts drawn down against the loans tot-l $19.9 million. An amount of $24.3 million has been provided for loans in 1981-8-, le-v­ ing $24.3 million to be funded in 1982-83. , The agreements with the States provide' for the loans to be repaid over fifteen years commencing 15 June 1984 and to attract rates of interest approved"" by the Loan Council for the longest term private semi-government borrowing at the time of drawdown. Other Rail Transport The amount provided under this heading represents the Commonwealth's financial assistance of $0.8 million to the Australian Railways Research and Development Organisation (ARRDO) made through the Department of Transport. This amount is in addition to the Commonwealth's contribution to ARRDO through the Australian National Railways Commission. (An explanation of the changed basis for Commonwealth financial assistance to ARRDO is included under the heading 'Transport Planning and Research'). Repayments Repayments of past advances from the Commonwealth for State rail projects (mainly standardisation) are estimated to amount to $5.2 million in 1981-82, leaving a balance of $67.5 million repayable over the next forty-six years. The increase in the outstanding balance over the $58.0 million figure reported last year is due to loans provided in 1980-81 under the National Railway Network (Financial Assistance) Act 1979; a further increase will result from loans to be advanced this year. The Commonwealth has announced its intention to provide assistance to Victoria of $35.0 million in each of 1981-82 and 1982-83 for upgrading the Victorian transportation system. The. Government announced, in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that its urban public transport function would be transferred to the States. The provision of Commonwealth financial assistance to the States under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978 has therefore been terminated, subject to the provision of assistance in respect of commitments entered into by the States in 1980-81 on approved projects and not paid in that year. The estimates include $1.5 million for this purpose in 1981-82. Allowance was made in determining States' tax sharing grants in 1981-82, the base year under the new tax sharing arrangements, for assistance that would have been provided under the urban public transport program in that year. As part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, Commonwealth assistance to the States for transport planning and research under the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) Act 1977 was terminated at the end of 1980-81. Under this program, Commonwealth assistance was used by the States partly to supplement funds proviped from their own sources towards the costs of projects undertaken by the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) and the Australian Railways Research and Development Organisation (ARRDO). In lieu of assistance provided for this purpose, the Commonwealth, through the Department of Transport, is to make direct contributions to these organisations in 1981-82, amounting to $1.6 million for ARRB and $0.8 million for ARRDO. These payments are shown under the headings 'Road Research and Investigations' and 'Other Rail Transport' respectively. , Apart from departmental research projects, $2.9 million is provided in 1981-82 to finance the Bureau of Transport Economics, which conducts research into the economicsand operations of all modes of transport; this is slightly above 1980-81 expenditure of $2.6 million. ' Australian Shipping Commission Past advances to the Commission comprise borrowings by.the Commission from the Budget and the proceeds of loans raised by the Commonwealth on the Commission's behalf to assist in the financing of capital expenditure, mainly ship purchases. An amount of about $2.0 million will be repaid by the Commission in 1981-82 in respect of past loans raised by the Commonwealth on its behalf. Commercial refinancing of several ship purchases will enable the Commission to make an early repayment of $30.0 million in 1981-82 in respect of interest bearing borrowings from the Budget. These borrowings would normally have been repaid in 1984-85 and 1985-86. This will leave loans outstanding totalling about $118 million which are repayable over the next five years. The Commission now raises loans on its own behalf and has not borrowed from the Budget since 1976-77. Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme An amount of $32.7 million is provided in 1981-82 for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. The Scheme aims to bring the door-to-door freight costs of eligible cargoes shipped by sea between Tasmania and the mainland into approximate equality with the door-to-door costs of moving similar goods by road or rail over comparable interstate routes on the mainland. Of the $29.5 million paid under the Scheme in 1980-81, $27.4 million related to Tasmanian commodities shipped to the mainland and $2.1 million to materials shipped to Tasmania for use in local manufacturing industries. Tasmanian frozen fruit and vegetables, timber and paper (including newsprint) accounted for 57 per cent of expenditure in 1980-81. The Government is currently undertaking a review of the Scheme to determine whether it continues to meet the Government's objectives. OtherS hipping Subsidies An amount of $2.3 million has been included in the 1981-82 estimates to subsidise the operations of the Australian Shipping Commission's 'Empress of Australia' passenger service between Tasmania and the mainland. A further $1.5 million has been provided to subsidise the Commission's 'Darwin Trader' east coast/Darwin shipping service; this subsidy is to cease after September 1982 when new, more efficient wharffacilities should be in operation in Darwin. These provisions are the same as in 1980-81. Shipping and Harbours-Other Included under this heading is an allocation of $7.7 million in 1981-82 for capital expenditure on equipment and facilities, mainly in respect of marine navigational aids. This is for the third year of a five year plan to modernise and extend Australia's network of some 340 marine navigational aids to improve the safety and efficiency of commercial shipping. A major project involves the acquisition of four light vessels at a cost of $5.3 million over three years; expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated at $2.8 million compared to $0.6 million in 1980-81. Also included under this heading is an estimated payment of $4.2 million to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission in 1981-82 for the provision of maritime safety communications services; expenditure on this item in 1980-81 was $3.5 million. An amount of $184 000 has been provided for the Australian Shippers Council in 1981-82, the same as in 1980-81. Interest-bearing loans of $32.6 million to be made to the Pipeline Authority in 1981-82 are to meet the estimated shortfall between the Authority'S revenue ($25.7 million), derived primarily from the carriage of natural gas from Moomba in South Australia to Sydney and other cities in New South Wales, and its expenditures, including operation, maintenance and administrative expenses ($6.2 million); interest on private sector borrowings ($3.7 million); and interest ($31.0 million) and loan repayments ($17.4 million) to the Commonwealth. The $6.7 million increase in the Budget provision for the Pipeline Authority over expenditure in 1980-81 provides for increased interest payments on borrowings from both the Commonwealth and from the private sector. In 1980-81, the Authority commenced borrowing from the private sector, primarily to finance the construction of natural gas pipelines from Young and Dalton on the Moomba to Sydney line to Wagga Wagga and Canberra respectively. The Authority is continuing to seek a review of its Haulage Agreement with The Australian Gas Light Company to ensure that it will secure sufficient revenue to cover its costs. In 1981-82 the Authority is to borrow $4.5 million from the private sector, mainly for the completion of the pipeline from Dalton to Canberra. The commencement of other projects, such as the extension of the Young to Wagga Wagga line to Albury, and the possible line to Lithgow, Bathurst and Orange, is subject to negotiations with the Victorian and New South Wales State Governments, relevant local councils and The Australian Gas Light Company. The 1981-82 provision of $55.0 million includes $52.9 million for non-allocated running expenses of the Department of Transport (i.e. other than those related to the provision of air transport services ($276.7 million) and the functions of the Bureau of Transport Economics ($2.9 million) which are included elsewhere). Of the general running expenses, $38.3 million is for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries. This compares with 1980-81 running expenses of $46.0 million which included salaries and payments in the nature of salaries of $33.3 million. A major component of this item is the recurrent expenditure on the provision of marine navigational aids, which is fully recoverable (see below). Also included in the 1981-82 estimates is an amount of $2.1 million for the charter of Nomad Search master aircraft as part of a two year program to evaluate their suitability for coastal surveillance purposes. Most of the recoveries under this heading come from light dues levied on commercial shipping for the use of marine navigational aids provided by the Commonwealth. The present charge of 41 cents per net registered ton per quarter is expected to provide revenue of $23.8 million in 1981-82, a slight increase over 1980-81 revenue of $22.9 million, and to fully recover the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of these navigational aids. An amount of $2.6 million is expected to be received from other Departments for the use of Department of Transport vessels including $2.1 million from the charter of a Cape class vessel to the Division of National Mapping for bathymetric mapping. The costs of ser ;.::es provided to the maritime transport industry by the Department of Trallsport under the Navigation Act 1912 (estimated at $4 million in 1981-82) are partly r-covered by a system of fees and charges levied under that Act. In 1981-82 these. fees arid charges a:-e expected to yield. revenue of $2.5 million compared with $2.lmiltion in -h.e previous year. The increase is due to the effect of higher fees and charges to be introduced on 1 October 1981. The Office of Road. Safety provides technical and administrative support to the Australian Design Rule Certification system for new motor vehicles. The full costs of operating the system are recovered by charges levied on vehicle compliance plates ,which are estimated to provide revenue of $1.4 million in 1981-82. This represents an increase of $0.2 million over 1980-81 revenue and reflects an expected increase in the njlmber of vehicle certifications. B. WATER SUPPLY, ELECTRICITY AND GAS Outlays under this function are currently estimated to be $52.7 million in 1981-82, a reduction of 2.8 per cent on last year's outlays. It should be noted that part of the Budget provision for the National Water Reso-rces Program is yet to be allocated to specific projects, some of which may relate to this function. The unallocated portion is included under 'Industry Assistance and Development-Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects'. . 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Urban Water Supply 5.6 4.4 0.6 3.8 Electricity Supply in the NT 30.0 43.0 45.7 +2.7 Subsidy on Liquefied Petroleum Gas 20,3 20.2 -0.1 Other Payments. . . . . , 0.2 0.1 -0.1 Repayments ....,.. 1O.9Cr is.7Cr 14.0Cr """" 0.3 Urba-'. W«t-r . .'$upp/y . An amount of $0.6 million is being provided in 1981-82 for water storage and reticulatio'Il work in theACT. This continues the pattern of reducing levels of expenditure in recent years and reflects a levelling off of demand for new facilities. As noted above, assistance for urban water supply projects in the States will depend upon subsequent decisions on the allocation of the $35.0 million to be provided in 1981-82 under the National Water Resources Program. In.1980-81, $2.6 million was provided under this Program to assist with the construction of water treatment plants in the Adelaide metropolitan area, $0.4 million for additional water supply facilities for the West Pilbara region, $0.2 million for payment to the Mount Isa City Council .towards ,the Council's share of the debt burden associated with .the Julius Daand .$0.2 mill-on for the construct,ion of supplementary water supply facilities for Port Hedlan.d. Electricity Supply in the Northern Territory The 1981-82 estimate of $45.7 million is for a subsidy paymerit to the Northern Territory Government for the operations of its Electricity Commission. It represents an increase of $2.7 million on the 1980-81 provision, due mainly to increased expenditure on oil. The Commonwealth is providing a subsidy for the operations of the Commission up to 1981-82 based on the difference between operating costs and the revenues the Commission would receive if it had applied average North Queensland tariffs. Subsidy on Liquefied Petroleum Gas The Government introduced a scheme, effective from 28 March 1980 for three years, to subsidise at the rate of $80 per tonne certain non-commercial uses of liquefied petroleum gas. On4 December 1980 the Government annqunced the extension of the scheme, as from 30 September 1980, to certain commercial and industrial users in areas where natural gas, is not available. Expenditure from the Budget in 1980-81 of $20.3 million included the provision to the States of initial advances from which they reimburse claims, and reimbursements for subsidy payments in respect of the fifteen month period from 28 March 1980 to 30 June 1981. Estimated expenditure in 1981-82 of $20.2 million includes the full year effect of the extension of the subsidy to c,ertain commercial and industrial users. Other Payments An amount of $80 000 is being provided in 1981-82 for the costs of the Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generation and the Sharing of Power Resources in SouthEastern Australia, which commenced in April 1980. Expenditure in 1980-81 was $172 886. The Inquiry is expected to be completed in October 1981. Repayments Estimated repayments in 1981-82 include $6.9 million from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority (SMHEA) in respect of advances and interest accumulated during construction by the Authority, and receipts from the sale of surplus land. The SMHEA funds capital expenditure for the operations and maintenanoe of the scheme principally using loans from the private capital market. In 1980-81 the borrowing program amounted to $1.2 million; a further borrowing program will be undertaken in 1981-82, primarily for communication and protection works, and for the construction of staff housing. Repayments are also being made in respect of earlier loans for hydr6-electric schemes in Tasmania ($3.0 million), in respect of assistance provided to Queensland for the Gladstone Power Station ($2.4milliQn), and from the Northern Tertitoryin respect of electricity assets transferred to the Northern TerritoryElectricity Commission on 1 July 1978 ($1.3 million). C. INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE AND bEVELOPMENT The Commonwealth assists industry through a variety of measures including direct financial assistance, taxation concessions, guaranteed domestic price and other market· ing arrangements, financial guarantees, the customs tariff and import quota restrictions. Direct financial assistance from the Budget is provided in the form of bounties and subsidies, price support and reconstruction or adjustment schemes, development projects primarily in support of industry, disease eradication schemes, contributions to research and promotion, and other payments to or for the benefit of industry. It includes outlays of some departments and instrumentalities which service industry (eg the Departments of Industry and Commerce and of Primary Industry and the Australian Tourist Commission). These departments and instrumentalities provide many services either free of charge or for charges which do not fully recover the costs involved. Outlays recorded under some other functional headings also are of assistance to industry. Examples are the provision of airports and airway services, roads and shipping subsidies, expenditure to maintain or improve the defence capacity of industry and certain expenditures by the CSIRO. Apart from these direct outlays from the Budget, considerable assistance is provided from the Budget to industry through special provisions in the taxation system which, as they result in reduction of Government revenues, are as much a call on the Budget as are direct outlays. Some such provisions (eg those for the investment allowance and accelerated depreciation deductions) have been of wide application; others affect only particular industries (eg the exemption from income tax of incomes from gold mining; the averaging provisions for income arising from primary production) or specific activities of particular industries (eg the accelerated or immediate write-offs available to primary producers for certain capital expenditure). In many years, the revenue forgone under such provisions has been estimated to be at least of the same order of magnitude as direct outlays for industry assistance and development. Further information concerning such 'tax expenditures' is provided in Appendix II to Budget Statement No4 'Estimates of Receipts 1981-82.' Net direct assistance from the Budget (ie after deducting amounts collected by way of industry levies and charges such as the wool tax and livestock slaughter levies) is estimated at $957.3 million in 1981-82, an increase of $134.7 million or 16.4 per cent on 1980-81. Outlays on direct assistance to major industry categories are summarised in the following table. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Forestry and Fishing Industries 5.4 4.8 5.1 + 0.3 Agricultural and Pastoral IndustriesSpecific Industries , 83.7 50.3 107.0 + 56.6 General Assistance Not Allocated to Specific Industries 111.1 113.3 114.3 + 1.0 Total 194.7 163.6 221.3 + 57.6 Mining and Manufacturing Industries 309.9 477.4 523.9 + 46.4 Tourist Industry 8.5 9.1 9.8 + 0.7 Other Assistance to Industry 75.6 167.6 197.3 + 29.7 AND DEVELOPMENT 594.0 822.6 957.3 + \34.7 Detailed information on each of these industry categories is set out below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Softwood Forestry Development (net) 4.8 4.3 4.3 Other Forestry 0.3 0.2 0.3 + 0.1 Fisheries Research, Promotion and Development 3.1 3.9 4.1 + 0.2 Fisheries Charges 2.9Cr 3.6Cr 3.6Cr Softwood Forestry Development (net) The Commonwealth has provided loans to the States for the maintenance of softwood forests since 1966. Net Budget outlays totalled $4.3 million in 1980-81 and are estimated at $4.3 million for 1981-82. Under the Softwood Forestry Agreements Act 1978 the Commonwealth is assisting the States, during the five year period commencing 1977-78, to cover the cost of maintaining softwood forestry plantations established under the Softwood Forestry Agreements Acts 1967, 1972 and 1976. That assistance is provided by way ofloans repayable over twenty years, with repayments commencing fifteen years after the date of each advance. Depending on State preferences, interest is either capitalised over the deferment period or paid as it falls due. Other Forestry The Commonwealth agreed to provide loan assistance to Tasmania of $136000 per annum for a five year period commencing 1978-79 towards the cost of certain silviculture projects. The Commonwealth agreed subsequently to supplement that assistance, over the four years 1979-80 to 1982-83, by the provision of further loan funds of $100000 per annum to assist the establishment of eucalypt plantations on marginal farmland and for the purchase of such farmland. The loans are all repayable over forty years commencing twenty years after each advance is made. Interest is being capitalised during the twenty years in which repayments are deferred. Tasmania received $336000 in 1980-81 and will receive estimated payments of $236 000 in 1981-82. In the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government decided expenditure under the Softwood Forestry Agreements and the Tasmanian Agreements is to be discontinued when the current arrangements expire. Fisheries Research, Promotion and Development An amount of $2.2 million is provided in 1981-82 to reimburse the States and the Northern Territory for costs of observer, administration and patrolling activities carried out on behalf of the Commonwealth. The balance relates in the main to grants to match industry contributions for fisheries research ($1.1 million). Fisheries Charges The 1981-82 estimate of $3.6 million includes Commonwealth fisheries licence fees, and payments for access to the Australian Fishing Zone negotiated with foreign governments and foreign fishermen. Outlays on direct assistance to agricultural and pastoral industries are estimated to increase by $57.6 million in 1981-82. This increase reflects the repayment in 1980-81 of $27.4 million advanced to the Queensland Government for assistance to the sugar industry in meeting stock holding obligations under the International Sugar Agreement, together with net increases over the range of assistance programs. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Specific IndustriesWool Industry-Wool Marketing Assistance 71.6 87,9 87.5 0.4 Growers Levy 71.6Cr 83.0Cr 87.5Cr 4.5 Total Wool Marketing Assistance 4.8 4.8 Research, Promotion and Other Expenditures 58.0 76.5 81.6 + 5.1 Charges and Repayments 50.1Cr 50.lCr 52.8Cr 2.7 Total 7.9 31.2 28.9 2.4 Wheat IndustiyWheat Industry Stabilization 4.4 60.5 34.2 26.3 Wheat Board-Interest Subsidy 7.7 23.2 26.4 + 3.2 Research and Other 4.5 5.7 6.4 + 0.7 Charges and Repayments 3.ICr 70.3Cr 28.3Cr +42.0 Total 13.5 19.1 38.7 + 19.6 Sugar IndustryLoans to Queensland 27.8 Repayments 2.9Cr 27.4Cr +27.4 Total 25.0 27.4Cr +27.4 Dairy IndustryDairy Industry Stabilization 91.2 84.7 74.5 -10.2 Price Support for Dairy Products 17.7 1.6 1.4 0.2 Research, Promotion and Other Expenditures 6.2 6.7 7.9 + 1.2 Repayments 101.9Cr 91.0Cr 84.3Cr+ 6.7 Total 13.3 2.0 O.4Cr 2.4 Fruit IndustryStabilization, Research and Promotion 5.2 2.4 8.9 + 6.5 Charges and Repayments 2.8Cr 4.ICr 2.3Cr+ 1.8 Total 2.4 1.7Cr 6.6 + 8.3 Poultry IndustryStabilization and Research 18.6 21.0 21.0 Charges and Repayments 18.ICr 21.2Cr 20.6Cr+ 0.6.

Part of these funds may be allocated to urban water projects, past expenditures on which are recorded under the function 'Water Supply, Electricity and Gas'. WOOL INDUSTRY Wool Marketing Assistance The Government has authorised the Australian Wool Corporation to operate a minimum reserve price of 410 cents per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis for the 1981-82 wool sellinp; season, and a floor price of at least 410 cents for the 1982-83 season, compared with a minimum reserve price of 365 cents per kilo for the 1980-81 season. It is intended that the Corporation continue to regulate the flow of wool on to the auction market to improve the balance between quantities of wool supplied and demanded, and to purchase above the floor price where necessary to reduce random movements in prices. The Wool Tax (8 per cent on the gross returns from wool sold) is estimated to yield $140 million in 1981-82. This tax includes a special levy of 5 per cent on the gross returns from wool sold, which can be used to offset any losses which may arise from the operation of the reserve price scheme. It is estimated that the special levy will result in an amount of $87.5 million being collected and paid to the Corporation's Market Support Fund in 1981-82. Research, Promotion and Other Expenditures The 1981-82 estimates provide for Commonwealth contributions of $20 million towards wool promotion and about $8 million towards wool research. Commonwealth contributions to promotion are to remain at $20 million in 1982-83 and 1983-84. An estimated $52.8 million, which includes $52.5 million estimated receipts from the industry levy (a component of the Wool Tax) of 3 per cent on gross returns from wool sold, will be available to supplement the Commonwealth contribution towards research and promotion. WHEA T INDUSTR Y The current Wheat Marketing Plan covers the five crop seasons 1979-80 to 1983-84 and incorporates a number of revisions to the successive Wheat Industry Stabilization Schemes that have operated since 1948. Under the Plan, the Commonwealth guarantees a minimum pool return equal to 95 per cent of the average of estimated returns from the subject pool and the two previous pools. Growers receive a first advance payment on delivery of their wheat to the Australian Wheat Board equal to the guaranteed minimum price. Those first advance payments are financed by funds provided by the Reserve Bank, under Commonwealth guarantee, and/or by borrowings from commercial sources. The Wheat Industry Finance Fund established under the current Plan and financed from an industry levy of $2.50 per tonne on deliveries to the Wheat Board is being maintained at the maximum prescribed balance of $100 million. Excess levy receipts and interest earnings are refunded to growers on a first-in-first-out basis. Total Fund receipts .in 1981-82 are estimated at $34.2 million, comprising $25.25 million from the financing levy on the 1980-81 pool and $8.9 million in interest earnings, all of which will be refunded to growers. Moneys retained in the Fund are available, together with commercial borrowings as necessary, to refinance Reserve Bank borrowings. In recent years the Wheat Board has largely substituted commercial borrowings for advances from the Rural Credits Department (RCD) of the Reserve Bank. This has been undertaken at the request of the Government in order to reduce the additions to private sector liquidity and to money supply growth resulting from the RCD advances. The Commonwealth provides a subsidy from the Budget to the Wheat Board in view of the higher interest charges incurred in commercial borrowings than those available on RCD advances-effectively replacing part of the subsidy hitherto provided through the lower rates charged by the RCD with a 'direct' subsidy from the Budget. The 1981-82 estimate of $26.4 million reflects the reduced margin between RCD and commercial rates decided in the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions. The subsidy required could, however, vary substantially-depending on movements in commercial borrowing rates, the level of Reserve Bank finance which can be accommodated in the light of general monetary conditions, and 1981-82 production. The charges and repayments estimate comprises $25.25 million from the financing and stabilisation levies and $3.1 million proceeds from wheat tax levied to provide an industry contribution to research. Loans to Queensland and Repayments In 1980-81 Queensland repaid market support loans of $27.4 million advanced in 1979-80 to meet obligations under the terms of the International Sugar Agreement. DailY Industry Stabilization Marketing arrangements for dairy products, introduced by the Government on 1 July 1977, provide for an equalisation levy (equal to the difference between the domestic price and the assessed average export price) on the production of certain prescribed dairy products. The proceeds are redistributed among manufacturers with a view to protecting the domestic price structure and are designed to equalise the unit return to all manufacturers, based on total domestic and export sales. Stabilization Levy collections, and payments to manufacturers, each being estimated at $74.5 million in 1981-82, reflect a decline in levy rates due to a reduction in the differential between local and export returns. Price Support for Dairy Products In addition to the marketing arrangements referred to above the Commonwealth is continuing to underwrite equalisation values for certain dairy products (ie guarantee floor prices for them) for the 1981-82 and 1982-83 seasons, but under new arrangements. Consistent with the arrangements under other underwriting schemes, returns for production of prescribed products will be underwritten at 95 per cent 0f a three year moving average of gross equalised pool returns. This arrangement is to be further reviewed during 1982-83 with a view to determining the arrangements to apply in subsequent years. An amount of $1.45 million has been allocated in 1981-82 to meet price support liabilities in respect of the 1978-79 and 1979-80 seasons. Research. Promotion and Other Expenditures Levy collections paid to the Australian Dairy Corporation for dairy promotion and marketing are estimated to increase by about $1.1 million in 1981-82 to $6.8 million. The increase represents the full-year effect of an increase in the levy for domestic sales promotion from 6 to 9 cents per litre with effect from 1 January 1981. Commonwealth funds provided to match industry contributions for approved dairy research programs in 1981-82 are estimated at $584 000. Repayments This heading covers the levy referred to under 'Dairy Industry Stabilization' ($74.5 million), repayments by the States in respect of dairy industry adjustment programs ($2.6 million) and industry contributions to research and promotion ($7.2 million). Stabilization, Research and Promotion It is estimated that net stabilization and supplementary assistance expenditure in 1981-82 will amount to $6.6 million. Under the current arrangements, which apply for the 1981-85 export seasons, the Commonwealth underwrites apple and pear export returns in each season at 95 per cent of the weighted average return for the four immediately preceding seasons. The stabilization arrangements for pears terminated at the end of 1980, and those for apples are being phased out over four years with stabilization payments being reduced by amounts due under the underwriting scheme. The Commonwealth has also undertaken to provide supplementary assistance for apples and pears for the four seasons 1981 to 1984, on a $ for $ basis with participating States, with a view to facilitating structural adjustment within the apple and pear industry. An amount of $2.1 million, financed largely from special industry levies, is provided to meet the operating costs of various fruit industry marketing authorities, promotion activities and research. Outlays on stabilization (estimated at $20.2 million in 1981-82) are financed from industry levies which flow back to the industry through State egg marketing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Egg Industry Stabilization Scheme. The Budget provides for Commonwealth contributions towards agreed research programs ($0.4 million in respect of chicken meat and poultry) to match expenditure for those purposes from industry levy receipts. Eradication of Cattle Diseases and Compensation (net) Cattle disease eradication and compensation payments are estimated at a net $1.9 million in 1981-82. In 1981-82 $23.1 million is estimated to be payable to the States and the Northern Territory for the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. That amount comprises $20.0 million for eradication operations and $3.1 million in grants towards slaughter compensation payments. Recoveries from the $3 per head disease eradication component of the Livestock Slaughter Levy are estimated at $21.2 million in 1981-82; these receipts are offset against the Commonwealth's past expenditure for disease eradication operations. Although provisional freedom from bovine brucellosis is expected to be achieved by 1984, the achievement of complete freedom will require attention well beyond 1984. The question of the need for continued Commonwealth assistance has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report. Inspection Services (net) Meat export inspection and animal health services undertaken by the Bureau of Animal Health are estimated to cost $45.4 million in 1981-82, an increase of $3.2 million over 1980-81. Offset against this are estimated revenues of $19.3 million, comprising $15.1 million from charges designed to recover 50 per cent of export inspection costs for meat, $3.7 million from charges to exporters for meat inspection outside prescribed hours, and other recoveries of $0.5 million. Beef Industry Assistance As part of the Commonwealth's commitment to provide up to $6.0 million towards the cost of implementing a beef cattle carcase classification system, an amount of $1.1 million is to be provided in 1981-82 (assistance provided for this scheme in the four years to 30 June 1981 totalled $2.0 million). The remaining $0.8 million relates to the finalisation of payments under the beef husbandry incentive scheme and satisfaction of the Commonwealth's joint guarantee of 1978 with the Victorian Government of a borrowing by Co-operative Farmers and Grazjers Direct Meat Supply Limited. Research, Promotion and Other Expenditures The Commonwealth matches expenditure funded from industry levies on approved research projects for the meat and pig industries, and makes payments, fully recovered from industry levies, to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and for pig meat promotion. Estimated outlays in 1981-82, including industry contributions, comprise $9.6 million for research and promotion and $7.8 million for payments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. Charges and Repayments Included here are the industry levies in respect of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and of meat and pig research and promotion, and repayments of advances ($4.4 million in 1981-82) which were provided mainly in 1975-76 and 1976-77 under a beef industry assistance scheme. This heading covers outlays in respect of the honey, oilseed, tobacco, wine and barley industries, mainly for promotion and research. Industry payments to the Commonwealth in respect of these activities are included in 'Charges and Repayments nec'. Primary Industry Bank of Australia The Primary Industry Bank of Australia Limited was established in 1978 to increase the availability of longer-term loans to primary producers (including foresters and fishermen). Shareholders are the major private banks, State banks and the Commonwealth. The Bank operates as a re-financing institution, borrowing funds for on-lending to other financial institutions which in turn lend to individual primary producers. There have been about 4700 loans to primary producers, totalling some $360 million, since the Bank commenced operations in December 1978. Those loans have been primarily for land acquisition, loan restructuring, property improvement and purchase of plant and machinery. The Commonwealth subscribed $625 000 in equity capital to the Bank in 1978-79 and subscribed a further $78 000 in 1980-81 following the reallocation among the remaining shareholders of the shares formerly held by the Bank of Adelaide, following its acquisition by the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The Commonwealth has deposited a total of $101 million ($30 million in 1978-79, $45 million in 1979-80 and $26 million in 1980-81) with the Bank from the Income Equalisation Deposits Trust Account at a concessional interest rate. (The latter assistance is recorded in financing transactions rather than in outlays). Rural Reconstruction/Adjustment The Rural Adjustment Scheme established by the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act 1976 provides Commonwealth assistance, the amount of which is determined annually, to the States and the Northern Territory for purposes of farm debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation, carry-on finance and household support. Assistance for debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation is made available by the Commonwealth, 85 per cent of assistance being by Joan and 15 per cent by grant. The Commonwealth contributes a further amount towards administrative expenses. For the household support component, the Commonwealth finances all assistance and contributes towards administrative expenses; and the States and the Territory repay to the Commonwealth any principal and interest recouped by them. For carry-on finance, the States and the Territory share equally with the Commonwealth both the financing of loans (and administrative costs) and all principal and interest payments received from producers. Outlays under the Scheme in 1981-82 are estimated at $17.7 million, compared with $17.2 million in 1980-81. A further $10 million is estimated to be required in 1982-83 to cover approvals expected to be given in 1981-82. Fertilizer Bounties The estimate for 1981-82 includes $52.0 million for the phosphate fertilizer bounty, and $3.0 million for the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy. Current legislation provides for the phosphate fertilizer bounty to continue at the rate of $12 per tonne over the five year period ending 30 June 1982. The question of the future of the bounty after 30 June 1982 has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC). The future of the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy, which is due to expire on 31 December 1981, has also been referred to the lAC. Inspection Services nec In addition to meat export inspection services, the Commonwealth provides export inspections in respect of grains, fruits and other exports requiring quality certification. The net cost of these services is estimated at $4.8 million in 1981-82, after allowing for estimated revenue of $4 million flowing from the Government's decision to recover 50 per cent of all export inspection costs-for grains and wool from 1 July 1979 and for fish and dried fruits from 1 July 1981. Agricultural Extension and Research Responsibility for Agricultural Extension Services has been passed to the States with Commonwealth assistance being incorporated within general financial assistance grants to the States. The 1981-82 provision relates to minor agricultural research ($0.28 million) and projects sponsored by the Australian Agricultural Council ($0.21 million). Recoveries and Repayments The Commonwealth Development Bank is to make a special $10 million loan repayment to the Commonwealth, in addition to its normal $2.9 million repayments. Expenditure under this heading comprises Commonwealth assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for rural water conservation, irrigation, salinity mitigation and drainage, and flood mitigation. The Government is providing funds to the States for water-related purposes under the five-year National Water Resources Program (NWRP). A total of $74.4 million was spent in the first three years of the program, including $29.1 million in 1980-81. An amount of $35.0 million is being provided in 1981-82 for the NWRP including $0.1 million in respect of expenditure by the States in 1980-81. This is 20 per cent more than in 1980-81. Of the 1981-82 total, $31.4 million has not yet been allocated to specific projects, and is (pending allocation) included under the item 'Irrigation, Investigation and Other Water Projects'. Further details on the NWRP are contained in Budget Paper No.7, Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities, 1981-82. Irrigation, Investigation and Other Water Projects Final allocations for irrigation projects in 1981-82 have still to be settled. The Commonwealth's contribution under the River Murray Waters Agreement to the costs of the River Murray Commission is estimated at $0.94 million ($0.86 million for works and $0.08 million for administrative expenses). An amount of $0.6 million will be provided for water resources research in 1981-82 (an increase of 28 per cent over 1980-81), but allocations for water resources assessment and related studies in the States are still to be determined. The Northern Territory is expected to receive $1.94 million for water resources assessment projects in 1981-82, the same amount as in 1980-81. Salinity Mitigation and Drainage In 1980-81 the Commonwealth provided $6 million as further assistance for a coordinated program designed to alleviate salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley and $0.8 million for salinity control in the Collie River area of Western Australia. Assistance in 1981-82 under this heading will depend on the allocation of assistance under the NWRP. Flood Mitigation Assistance to the States for flood mitigation totalled $1.8 million in 1980-81, including $0.9 million for works on New South Wales coastal rivers, $0.8 million for flood plain management and works on Victoria's inland rivers, and $0.1 million for flood mitigation works at Proserpine, Queensland. Possible assistance under the NWRP for flood mitigation projects in 1981-82 is still to be determined. Recoveries and Repayments R<;:payments are estimated at $3.0 million in 1981-82 and include $2 million from New South Wales in respect of earlier advances for the construction of the Blowering Reservoir. LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS War Service Land Settlement The provision of $1.7 million in 1981-82 includes $1.1 million towards the operation and maintenance of the Loxton irrigation project in South Australia and $0.55 million for agent States to make credit facilities available to eligible settlers. Repayments Of the $3.3 million repayments estimated for 1981-82, $2.1 million relates'to War Service Land Settlement. This item includes the salaries and administrative costs of the Department of Primary Industry ($18.7 million), and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ($6.7 million) and the Commonwealth's contribution to the Australian Plague Locust Commission ($0.48 million). 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Mining IndustryUrailiumExploration and Development 1.7 2.4 8.2 + 5.9 Commonwealth Uranium Stockpile 34.1Cr 61.1 10.7 50.4 Bureau of Mineral Resources 13.3 15.2 19.0 + 3.8 Other Mining (net) 0,6 2.2 2.1 0.1 Total 18.5Cr 80,9 40.0 -40.9 Manufacturing IndustryShipbuilding Assistance 14.4 18.6 31.5 +13.0 Industrial Research and Development 34.6 51.4 49.9 1.5 Agricultural Tractors Bounty 8.3 7.0 8.0 + 1.0 Machine Tools Bounty 12.7 13.6 13.5 0.1 Book Bounty 13.7 15.0 17.6 + 2.6 Heavy Commercial Vehicles Bounty 6.2 6.3 7.1 + 0.8 Textile Industry Bounties 1.3 1.4 49.8 +48.4 Other Bounty Payments 4.9 5.4 7.9 + 2.5 Export Expansion Grants 170.0 200.0 197.0 3,0 Export Market Development Grants 45,0 60.0 84.0 +24.0 Development of Microwave Landing System 3.7 2.4 2.1 0.3 Other Assistance 4.8 4.0 2.4 1.6 General Administration (net) 9.0 11.4 13.0 + 1.6 Total 328.4 396.6 483,9 +87.3 In addition to the direct assistance outlined below, the Commonwealth assists the development 'of the mining industry through the taxation system by way of various' speclalprovisions applying to mining companies or to their shareholders. Examples of such special provisioris, which constitute a call on the Budget as much as do direct expenditures, are: special deductions for capital expenditure on mining and exploration activities and transport of certain minerals; . rebates to shareholders in respect of capital subscribed for both on-shore and·otfshore petroleum exploration and development (conditional on the company forgoing certaindeductions); and exemption from tax of income from gold mining. The. mining industry also benefits from the general investment allow-nce and accelerated depreciation rates allowed for eligible plant and equipment: Further details of assistance provided through the taxation system are included in Appendix II of Budget Statement No.4. Uranium-Exploration and Development . The Commonwealth's interest in the Ranger Uranium J()int Venture was sold in 1980-81 to Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) -for details see 'Sale of Existing Assets' in Statement No.4. The Commonwealth will, however, continue to meet the expenses (estimated to be $35000 in 1981-82) of the Ranger Assessor, who will estimate periodically the cost of rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area, and will also make payments in 1981-82 Of $0.65 million to the Northern Land Council in accordance with the Agreement entered into under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Both of these expenditures will be recouped from ERA. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory p,rovides that the Commonwealth will reimburse the Northern Territory Government for the additional capital and other expenditures incurred as a result of uranium developments, -o the extent that such expenditures are incurred by the Northern Territory Gdvenlment in accordance with prior specific arrangements'agreed between the two Governments. An' amount of $10.0 million is provided in 19-1-S2 in respect of approved State-type social infrastructure at Jabiru Township under that arrangement (compared with expenditure of $8.2 million in 1980-81). In recent years the Commonwealth has also reimbursed the Northern Territory for e-pendiiure'on non-environmental uranium mining regulatory services provided on behalf-f the Commonwealth. The amount expended for this purpose in 1980-81 was $318000. No specific provision is made for 1981-82, however, since responsibility for the fiharicing of these services as fr()m 1 July 1981 has been transferred to the Northern, Territory Government as part of a package involving an increase in the Northefn Territory's geheral purpose assistance grants. This transfer of responsibility, arising from th-, Review of Commqnwealth Functions, reflects the transfer of responsibilities for the regulation and control of nuclear activities to the States and the Northern Territory as far as possible, with the Commonwealth maintaining a co-ordinatingrole .. An amount of $166 000 is provided in 1981-82 for the direct administrative costs of the Uranium Advisory Council which provides independent advice to the Government, the Parliament and the public on all matters relating to the exploration, development and export of Australian uranium (1980-81 outlays $138 000). An amount of $346 000 has been provided in 1981-82 for the Australian Uranium Export Office -a reduction of 18 per cent from expenditure in 1980-81. During 1981-82, Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd is expected to complete repayments of a loan of $9 million made to the company by the Commonwealth in 1977. Repayments were originally scheduled to continue until 1984 but the company elected to make payments in 1980-81 totalling $6.8 million (compared with the Budget estimate of $1.1 million) and it is expected that the balance of $2.2 million will be repaid during 1981-82. Commonwealth Uranium Stockpile Under agreements entered into with certain Australian companies, the Commonwealth provides access to the Commonwealth's uranium stockpile to enable the companies to meet initial delivery obligations under approved contracts entered into prior to December 1972. The agreements provide for amounts equivalent to the net proceeds from the sale of these borrowed uranium concentrates to be paid to and held by the Commonwealth, pending the return of such concentrates. Receipts from borrowed uranium concentrates totalled $133 million to 30 June 1981 and are estimated to be $5.8 million in 1981-82. The return of borrowed uranium concentrates commenced in 1980-81 with an amount of $63.1 million being repaid to Queensland Mines Ltd. The provision of $16.5 million in 1981-82 is to meet reimbursement to Energy Resources of Australia Ltd for expected returns in 1981-82. These arrangements are expected to be completed in 1984 when the last of the borrowed uranium concentrates are scheduled to be returned to the Commonwealth. Bureau of Mineral Resources An amount of $19.0 million is provided in 1981-82 for the continuing activities of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics ($15.2 million outlay in 1980-81). This provision includes $2.0 million for a geological framework study relating to the assessment of the oil producing potential of the Bass Basin region. It also allows for the full-year effect of an acceleration in 1980-81 of the Bureau's program of airborne reconnaissance geophysical mapping and for the continuation in 1981-82 of an energy-related study being carried out in the Eromanga Basin in Queensland. An amount of $0.8 million is provided for Australia's membership contributions to several international mineral commodity organisations and to meet costs associated with Australia hosting the 1981 meeting of the Council of Ministers of the International Bauxite Association. Following the Government's announcement on the outcome of its Review of Commonwealth Functions, an examination is being made of the feasibility of requiring relevant industries to bear the full direct costs of membership of international commodity organisations and of withdrawal from such organisations where the industries are not prepared to meet these costs. An amount of $1.3 million is provided for the Commonwealth's contribution towards the administrative costs of the Joint Coal Board (1980-81 outlay $1.1 million). During 1980-81 an amount of $222000 was paid to the NSW Government to support the operations of the Chrysotile Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd over the 15 month period to 31 December 1979. This amount represented the balance of the $1.4 million assistance to which the Commonwealth agreed in 1978. No further funds are to be provided for this purpose. Shipbuilding Assistance A new bounty scheme for shipbuilding assistance commenced on 1 July 1980. Under the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980, bounty is assessed as a percentage of the cost of construction of vessels. The current rate of bounty of 27+ per cent applies until 30 June 1984. Thereafter, it phases down to a long term rate of 20 per cent which is to apply from 1 July 1986. Outlays in 1981-82 are estimated at $26.6 million and represent subsidies towards the cost of 75 ships. Bounty for vessels for which tenders closed before 1 July 1980 will continue to be provided under the Ship Construction Bounty Act 1975. Payments in 1981-82 under that Act are estimated at $4.1 million, being applied towards the cost of 46 ships. The $13.0 million increase in the shipbuilding assistance provision for 1981-82 reflects substantial carry over of payments from 1980-81 because of the postponement of some projects and delays by some applicants in meeting administrative requirements. Industrial Research and Development As part of the Government's response to the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia a further five-year program of grants under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976 was commenced on 1 July 1981, to encourage research and development by industry. In addition, the Minister for Science and Technology issued directives under the amended Act to give effect to certain Government decisions made in response to the report of the Committee of Inquiry. Under the amended Act companies can continue to apply for commencement grants (intended to encourage the build-up of a research and development capability) and project grants in respect of specific research projects. The maximum grant rate for commencement and project grants is generally 50 per cent of eligible research and development expenditure. The maximum annual grant payable to an individual company or group has been increased from $25 000 to $40 000 for commencement grants and from $500000 to $750000 in the case of project grants. Under the new directions issued by the Minister for Sciynce and Technology, project grant applications are to be ranked according to their potential contribution to industry policy objectives. Commencement grant applications, provided they meet the eligibility criteria, are generally to be funded in order of receipt. The coverage of the incentives program has been expanded to include research and development related to and carried out at a building site, and also computer software research and development (insofar as it relates directly to new products of and new or improved processes employed in manufacturing, mining or eligible on-site building or construction activities). 163 Assistance will continue to be provided for industrial research projects which are considered to be in the public interest and which normally involve the commercial development of the research results of public sector or non-profit research institutions. In addition, $0.7 million is provided in 1981-82 for pilot programs in the fields of innovation and technology transfer. Outlays for the above programs are estimated at $49.9 million in 1981-82. This includes $10.5 million for commencement grants, $32.68 million for project grants and $6.0 million for public interest projects. In addition to the above direct incentives for research and development, expenditure on 'scientific research', including expenditure on certain plant, equipment and buildings, continues to be an allowable deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Agricultural Tractors Bounty Under the Bounty (Agricultural Tractors) Act 1966, assistance is payable to eligible producers of certain agricultural tractors until 31 December 1984 or such later date as is fixed by proclamation. To be eligible for bounty, tractors must meet a minimum local content provision of 55 per cent. The bounty rates are indexed quarterly to reflect import price movements and cutrently range from $841 to $6403 per tractor, depending on the power of the tractor. Assistance to smaller tractors is being phased down to a long term rate of assistance equivalent to a protective tariff rate of 25 per cent-effective from 1 January 1982. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $8.0 million, compared with $7.0 million in 1980-81. Machine Tools Bounty Under the Bounty (Metal-working Machine Tools) Act 1978, bounty assistance is to be provided until 30 June 1984 to Australian manufacturers of non-portable power operated metal working machine tools, at a rate of 33t per cent of factory cost, subject to certain local content requirements. In addition a bounty, at the rate of 25 per cent of design costs incurred in Australia, is payable to machine tool manufacturers for the Australian design cost component of machines covered by the Act. Bounty payments are estimated to decrease from $13.6 million in 1980-81 to $13.5 million in 1981-82 reflecting a levelling out in demand by the motor vehicle industry in its current re-tooling program. Book Bounty Under the Bounty (Books) Act 1969, a bounty is paid on the cost of production of eligible books manufactured in Australia. Bounty assistance, currently at a rate of 331 per cent, is to be provided until 31 December 1986, with the rate of bounty gradually phasing down to 25 per cent by 1 January 1984. Payments in 1980-81 were $15.0 million; $17.6 million is being provided for 1981-82. The increase reflects higher production costs and a continuing trend for the industry to produce up-market books. Heavy Commercial Vehicles Bounty The Bounty (Commercial Motor Vehicles) Act 1978 provides for bounty payments on assembly of certain general purpose vehicles, including buses, which incorporate prescribed components used as original equipment. Bounty assistance will be provided until 31 December 1984 at the rate of 20 per cent of the into-store value of eligible local components. Bounty payments are estimated at $7.1 million in 1981-82, compared with $6.3 million in 1980-81, reflecting a higher into-store cost of vehicle components. Textile Industry Bounties Following consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's reports on 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear' a broad program of assistance for these industries, intended to encourage the development of a more efficient industry structure, will operate for a period of seven years from I January 1982. The program includes bounty -ssistance for a number of textile products. The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 provides for the payment of bounty on the value added by Australian producers of eligible yarns. The rates of bounty vary for different yarn types and range from 33 to 59 per cent of value added. It is estimated that bounty payments will be $47 million in 1981-82, increasing to $71 million in a full year. Under the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981 bounty assistance will be provided at a rate of 70 per cent of the value added· by Australian printers of certain lightweight woven fabrics. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $2.0 million and payments in a full year at $2.5 million. The Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977 will continue to provide bounty, at a rate of 20 cents per square metre and up to a maximum payment of $0.6 million per bounty year, on the production of bed sheeting made up into bed linen. Payments are estimated at $0.6 million in 1981-82. Bounty assistance on the production of yarns under the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Act 1978 will continue at a rate of $1.15 per kilogram until 31 December 1981. The bounty period under this Act was due to expire on 31 August 1981 but has been extended to provide assistance until the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 comes into operation on 1 January 1982. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $0.2 million. Other Bounty Payments Under the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Act 1977, bounty is payable until 28 March 1984 on eligible equipment, with the bounty being phased down from the current rate of 15 per cent to 7t per cent on 28 March 1982. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $1.5 million, compared with $0.9 million for 1980-81. Under the Bounty (Paper) Act 1979, bounty is payable (at the rate of $90 per tonne on specified coated paper and $70 per tonne on specified uncoated paper) up to a maximum of $2.5 million per year until 5 February 1987. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $2.5 million, compared with $1.2 million in 1980-81 which reflected a fall in production in that year. . The Bounty (Injection-moulding Equipment) Act 1979 provides for the payment of a bounty on the value added by Australian manufacturers of eligible equipment. The bounty rate is currently 25 per cent and this rate will be reduced by 10 percentage points each year for the remaining two years for which the Act applies. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $2.0 million. The Bounty (Drilling Bits) Act 1980 provides for the payment of bounty on the production and sale in Australia of down-the-hole hammer button bits exceeding 105 millimetres in diameter. The rates of bounty depend on bit size and range from $40 to $160 per bit, and are subject to local content provisions. The scheme commenced on 1 October 1979 and is to continue pending consideration of the lAC's final report on 'Cutlery, Industrial Knives and Hand Tools'. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $0.1 million compared with $0.05 million in 1980-81. The Bounty (Refined Tin) Act 1980 provides for the payment of bounty on the production of primary refined tin until 31 December 1982. Under the scheme, established miners must supply a specific proportion of concentrates to an established smelter. Concentrates supplied in excess of that minimum attract a subsidy at the rate of $50 per tonne of refined tin. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $0.25 million. Under the Bounty (Penicillin) Act 1980 subsidy assistance is provided to local manufacturers producing certain penicillin for the further manufacture of antibiotics in Australia. For 1981-82 a maximum payment of $0.9 million has been established. (Under the provisions of the Act, that limit and the bounty rates may later be altered.) After consideration of a report by the Temporary Assistance Authority it was decided to provide short-term bounty assistance, up to a maximum of $0.62 million in a twelve month period, to Australian producers of eligible non-adjustable wrenches. Assistance under the Bounty (Non-adjustable Wrenches) Act 1981, originally due to expire on 30 June 1981, will continue pending consideration of the lAC's final report on 'Cutlery, Industrial Knives and Hand Tools'. Payments in 1981-82 are estimated at $0.62 million, in part comprising carry over payments from 1980-81. Export Expansion Grants Scheme The Export Expansion Grants Scheme aims to encourage increased exports of Australian goods and services, industrial property rights and know-how. In general, a grant is based on the increase in the value of exports of eligible goods and services in the grant year over the average value for the previous three years. The enabling legislation for the Scheme expires on 30 June 1983, having been recently extended for an additional year with the grant rate being halved for that year. The Industries Assistance Commission is to report by 31 December 1981 on possible changes to the current export incentive arrangements. This should enable decisions on future export assistance to be annoilnced well before the extended date of expiry of the Scheme.. The 1981-82 Budget provision of $197 million is estimated to reduce commitments outstanding from $247 million at 30 June 1981 to $210 million at 30 June 1982 and to reduce the carry over of outstanding claims from $97 million to $50 million over the same period. Export Market Development Grants The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is designed to encourage exporters and prospective exporters to seek out and· develop overseas markets. The Scheme has recently been extended for an additional year (to 30 June 1983). Arrangements after 30 June 1983 will be determined in the light of the above mentioned Industries Assistance Commission review of the export incentive arrangements. The 1981-82 Budget provision is $84 million, compared with outlays of $60 million in 1980-81. The 1981-82 allocation is estimated to reduce commitments outstanding from $109 million at 30 June 1981 to $105 million at 30 June 1982 and to reduce the carry over of outstanding claims from $39 million to $25 million over the same period. Development of Microwave Landing System In the light of delays in the opening of the initial world market for the Interscan microwave landing system, the Government has decided to support a further three-year joint Commonwealth/industry program for the development of the system. Commonwealth support of up· to $4.9 million will be provided for the program concluding in 1983-84. An amount of $1.105 million is provided in 1981-82 for the first year of the ""further program together with $1.013 million representing a carry over of expenditure from the initial program. Other Assistance Other assistance provided to manufacturing industry in 1981-82 includes $0.5 million as a further Commonwealth contribution towards the Project Australia campaign ($2 million in 1980-81), $0.21 million in closure compensation under the Structural Adjustment Assistance program, $0.28 million towards several international commodity organisations in respect of Australia's continuing membership ($0.07 million in 1980-81), $0.2 million as the balance of the Commonwealth's expected contribution to the South Australian Iron Triangle study ($0.05 million in 1980-81) and $0.02 million in assistance to the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe ($0.32 million in 1980-81). A number of other programs under this heading were the subject of decisions taken in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions (RCF) to withdraw or scale down Commonwealth involvement and to appoint a committee of independent persons from private enterprise to investigate and report on the productivity development programs of the Department of Science and Technology. (The review also covers the pilot programs aimed at improving the innovative process and the assistance to inventors scheme.) A report is expected by the end of 1981. Provisions for 1981-82 include $0.65 million for Productivity Improvement Programs ($1.06 million in 1980-81), $0.18 million to support the Productivity Promotion Council ($0.21 million in 1980-81), and $0.14 million in transitional funding for the Industrial Design Council of Australia ($OA5 million in 1980-81). A provision of $0.29 million is made for the MATPAK 82 exhibition to be conducted by the National Materials Handling Bureau in Sydney in February 1982. In line with the Government's RCF decision to withdraw from this area, this is to be the last MATPAK exhibition funded by the Commonwealth. General Administration (net) This heading covers administrative costs of the Export Markt:t Development Grants Board ($2.2 million in 1981-82 compared with $1.9 million in 1980-81) and of the iridustry policy function of the Department of Industry and Commerce ($10.8 million in 1981-82 as compared with $9.5 tnillion in 1980""81). 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Australian Tourist Commission 8.2 8.9 9.2 + 0.3 Other Assistance to the Tourist Industry 0.3 0.2 0.6 + 0.4 The 1981-82 Budget provision of $9.2 million for the Australian Tourist Commission represents a 3.4 per cent increase over the Commission's 1980-81 outlays, or 7 per cent after allowing for the end of the two year Domestic Tourist Promotion Campaign. The provision of $0.6 million for 'other assistance' covers general operational expenses of the ACT Tourist Bureau and Australia's contribution to the World Tourism -rganisation. The increased provision reflects the Government's decision to provide an additional $0.4 million for promotional activities by the Bureau in 1981-82. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimates Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme 70.8 120.3 129.0 + 8.7 Energy Research and Conservation 10.7 12.7 26.1 + 13.4 Australian Industry Development Corporation 30.4Cr Export and Trade Promotion 23.0 26.0 28.8 + 2.8 Compensation Payments 5.9 5.3 0.6 EFIC 2.6 4.7 9.0 + 4.3 Other Assistance 1.5 0.6 0.8 + 0.2 Recoveries 2.6Cr 2.7Cr I.7Cr+ 1.0 Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme The Scheme, which has been operational in country areas since 1 July 1978, provides for the payment of a freight subsidy on the cost of distributing motor spirit, power kerosene, aviation fuels and automotive distillate. From1 April 1980 the Government extended the Scheme so that country consumers of these products pay a price which includes not more than 0.44 cents per litre of freight differential costs. An amount of $129.0 million is being provided for 1981-82 compared with expenditure of $120.3 million in 1980-81. The increase of $8.7 million reflects forecast levels of consumption, increases in freight differentials for eligible products, and the continuing extension of the area covered by the Scheme as the real value of the freight differential declines. Energy Research and Conservation The Budget provision for support grants for projects under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program has been increased by 10 per cent to $14.9 million. The appropriation is paid into the Energy Research Trust Account. Expenditure from the Trust Account is estimated to be $18.3 million in 1981-82, an increase of about 160 per cent on 1980-S 1 expenditure. Budget provisions will be required in future years for existing commitments of $4.5 million, and for new commitments of $10.3 million which may be undertaken in 1981-82. In addition to these provisions for energy research, coal research is also funded by an excise set at 5 cents per tonne of coal production and contributions on an equivalent basis received from Victorian and South Australian authorities in respect of their coal production. The Government announced last year that it proposed to continue the coal research levy at the current rate for a five year period from 1980-81. Receipts into the Coal Research Trust Account are expected to total $4.9 million in 1981-82,and expenditure from the Trust Account is estimated at $6.3 million, 42 per cent higher than expenditure in 1980-81. The Minister for National Development and Energy approves the distribution of funds for energy research, development and demonstration projects in the light of advice from the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. The Commonwealth provision for the National Energy Conservation Program is increased by 30 per cent to $1.3 million in 1981-82. This program involves advertising and publishing activities promoting liquid fuel conservation, conservation of other energy sources such as electricity, and energy conservation in buildings. A National Industrial Energy Management and Audit Scheme was introduced in 1980-81, with expenditure of $89 000 in that year. The provision of $0.31 million in 1981-82 is to fund seminars and workshops, publications and films, awards, and reimbursement of consultancy costs for small and medium sized firms to encourage and assist industry to use energy more efficiently and reduce energy costs. A provision of $0.3 million for the Energy Policy Information Program, $0.8 million less than expenditure in 1980-81, is for the promotion of LPG use in vehicles, for publications, education and information programs, and for a contribution towards the cost of an ABC series of programs on energy issues. Australian Industry Development Corporation The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) provides finance for industries concerned with the manufacture, processing, treatment, transportation and distribution of goods, and with the development and use of natural resources and technology. Its paid up capital of $62.5 million has been fully provided by the Commonwealth. In 1979-80 the Corporation repaid $30.4 million of an overseas loan to the Commonwealth, which was in turn repaid by the Commonwealth to the lenders. No further repayments are expected before 1983. Export and Trade Promotion Export and trade promotion outlays in 1981-82 are estimated at $28.8 million. This includes expenditure on the Trade Commissioner Service ($21 million), matching promotional grants to primary product marketing boards ($1.1 million), and general export promotion, trade publicity fairs, trade displays and trade promotion visits ($6.7 million). Compensation PaymentsA net provision of $5.34 million (payments of $6 million less recoveries of $0.66 million in respect of compensation and other assistance extended in 1980-81) is made in 1981-82 for payment of compensation or other assistance to persons or firms adversely affected as a direct result of the Government's actions during 1980 in respect of the situation in Afghanistan and Iran. This compares with net outlays of $5.9 million in 1980-81. Payments under the compensation arrangements are expected to be finalised in 1981-82. Export Finance and Insurance Corporation The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) provides export credit insurance and guarantee facilities, insurance cover for direct investment overseas against non-commercial risks and, where necessary, export finance for medium and long-term credit sales of capital goods. EFIC's export finance facility is financed by trading bank loans at commercial rates of interest. The Corporation lends these funds to foreign buyers at concessional interest rates. The difference between the commercial rates at which EFIC borrows and the rates at which it lends is met from the Budget by way of an interest rate subsidy payment to EFIC each year. The subsidy payment was $4.7 million in 1980-81 and is estimated to increase to $9.0 million in 1981-82. Of this latter amount, $1.7 million relates to the Ok Tedi Project in Papua New Guinea. The 'subsidy commitment authority', the mechanism to control future interest rate subsidy commitments on the Budget, has been increased from' $50 million to $60 million, with a separate subsidy commitment authority of $73 million being established for the Ok Tedi Project. These amounts represent the cost of interest rate subsidy payments that will fall on future Budgets if the authority is fully used. At 30 June 1981, the Corporation had entered into loans in support of capital goods exports amounting to almost $300 million, involving use of the subsidy commitment authority to the extent of about $49 million. The Corporation has made advance commitments to enter into loans of $18 million, involving use of a further $3.8 million of the subsidy commitment authority. In addition credit lines totalling $212 million have been offered to finance procurement from Australia for the Ok Tedi Project. On the basis of existing contracts already entered into by EFIC as at 30 June 1981, it is estimated that the minimum costs to the Budget in the financial years 1982-83 to 1984-85 will be $7.4 million, $7.5 million and $6.8 million for EFIC's general business, and an additional $6.2 million, $11.5 million and $13.7 million for Ok Tedi respectively. To these amounts will be added interest subsidies payable in respect of contracts entered into after 30 June 1981. Other Assistance This item includes $0.25 million for the promotion of Australian consultancy services in developing countries and $0.2 million for a technical support facility to meet the costs of Australian experts advising on and formulating development projects for countries of the Middle East. Also included is $0.3 million to meet the costs of the Canberra Development Board. D. LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT The Commonwealth funds a number of activities relating to the management and settlement of industrial disputes, oversight of industrial awards and agreements, manpower and training schemes, employment services and immigration services. The 1981-82 provisions for this range of activities are set out in the table below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Industrial RelationsConciliation and Arbitration 7.0 8.3 9.4 + 1.2 Industrial Relations Bureau 3.8 4.7 5.6 + 0.9 Payment to Stevedoring Industry 20.2 19.5 21.0 + 1.5 Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave 7.7 8.7 8.2 0.5 Trade Union Training 3.2 3.4 3.9 + 0.6 Administration 5.9 7.5 9.1 + 1.6 Recoveries O.ICr O.ICr 0.2Cr 0.1 Total 47.8 51.9 57.1 + 5.2 EmploymentTrade Training 46.9 68.1 76.4 + 8.3 Skill Training 12.2 14.9 20.2 + 5.3 youth Training 28.3 47.5 79.4 + 31.9 Special Training 12.0 16.6 17.9 + 1.3 Employment Services 62.2 73.8 82.8 + 9.0 Administration 41.1 46.9 52.0 + 5.2 Recoveries 0.7Cr 0.6Cr I.2Cr 0.6 Total 202.0 267.3 327.6 +60.3 ImmigrationAssisted Migration 18.8 28.0 27.0 1.0 Administration 36.8 45.0 51.5 + 6.5 Recoveries 3.3Cr 5.6Cr 4.0Cr+ 1.6 Total 52.3 67.4 74.6 + 7.1 Conciliation and Arbitration Outlays under this heading provide for the operations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ($8.0 million), the Public Service Arbitrator ($0.6 million) and the Remuneration Tribunal ($0.4 million), whose main functions are to settle disputes and determine wage and salary claims. The increase in expenditure in 1981-82 primarily reflects the full year effect of salary increases. Industrial Relations Bureau The role of the Industrial Relations Bureau is to facilitate the general supervision and observance of federal industrial law. Its main activities are examination of employing establishments and observance of regulations and industrial awards, together with review of and research into industrial matters. In the twelve months ended 31 December 1980, the Bureau conducted 20397 inspections, visited 13765 work places and detected 14419 breaches of awards. The increase of $0.9 million in the Bureau's provision for 1981-82 is mainly for salary costs. Payment to Stevedoring Industry Payments are made to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee from a levy imposed on stevedoring employers under the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977. The 1981-82 estimate is $21.0 million compared to $19.5 million in 1980-81. These funds are used primarily to fund the balance of the industry deficit on long service liabilities taken over from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority on 5 December 1977, to meet employer contributions to the Stevedoring Employees' Retirement Fund, for payments of award entitlements, for the provision of services and amenities for waterside workers, and to meet certain administrative costs. A matching receipt item records the stevedoring industry collections; details may be found in Statement 4-'Other Taxes, Fees and Fines'. Coal Mining Industry Long Service LeaveA Trust Fund was established in 1949 to finance long service leave payments for miners engaged in black coal production. The States reimburse employers for long service leave payments to miners and recoup from the Trust Fund the cost of these payments and administrative expenses. The Trust Fund's income is derived from payments made by the Commonwealth (estimated at $8.2 million in 1981-82) equivalent to a two-thirds share of its receipts from a 15 cents per tonne levy imposed on black coal production. In implementing the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Commonwealth will be negotiating with the States, industry and unions to terminate the current arrangements. Trade Union Training The Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975 provides for training services for unionists and for operation of State training centres and a national training college at Albury-Wodonga. The estimate of $3.9 million in 1981-82 provides for approximately 24 000 student training days to be offered by the Authority at its State Centres and the Clyde Cameron College at Albury-Wodonga. Administration This provision is for the administrative expenditure of the Department of Industrial Relations. The increase in expenditure by $1.6 million to $9.1 million in 1981-82 reflects the full year effect of salary and other cost increases. Also included here are estimated costs of legal proceedings towards union deregistration ($0.3 million) and provision for increased government consultations with industry managements. Trade Training The Commonwealth's involvement in trade trammg is directed to improving supplies of skilled labour to assist Australia's economic growth and development, and to provide training opportunities for young Australians. Assistance for trade training is provided by the Commonwealth under a number of schemes; proposed expenditure on the main schemes in 1981-82 is summarised in the following table. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Commonwealth Rebate For Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT) Employer Rebate -technical education 33.4 37.1 46.0 +8.9 -off-the-job training 6.0 9.5 12.8 +3.3 -$1000 cash rebate . 13.7 8.0 5.7 Trainee living away From home allowances 3.3 4.2 5.2 +1.1 Total CRAFT 42.7 64.5 72.0 +7.6 Special Apprenticeship Assistance 1.7 1.2 0.9 0.3 Group One-Year Training Scheme 1.4 1.5 1.8 +0.3 Support of Group Apprentice Schemes 0.4 +0.4 Special Commonwealth/State Trade Training Schemes 0.8 1.3 +0.5 Additional Apprentices in State Establishments 1.1 0.1 -0.1 Total Trade Training 46.9 68.1 76.4 +8.3 The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training (CRAFT) Scheme, introduced in January 1977, is the Commonwealth's major apprenticeship support program. CRAFT is a scheme of financial subsidies to employers to encourage them to employ and train apprentices. Through tax-exempt subsidies CRAFT aims to compensate employers for the cost of releasing apprentices to undertake technical education and other off-the-job training. The subsidies are: a Technical Education Rebate in respect of attendance at prescribed basic trades courses in technical and further education institutions; and an Off-the-Job Rebate in respect of approved full-time off-the-job training, other than prescribed basic trades courses, in an employer's establishment or other acceptable venue for up to 130 days of training. This training must usually be undertaken in the first year of apprenticeship. Assistance levels are set according to the trade concerned, year of apprenticeship and stage of technical education, and range between $15 and $27 a day. Employers can also qualify for a 40 per cent premium on the first year technical education rebate by engaging an apprentice who has completed an approved preemployment training course which results in a minimum reduction of six months in the normal period of apprenticeship. the first and second year of apprenticeship who are required to live away from home to take up or remain in apprenticeship. Weekly living-away-from-home allowance rates are $24 for first year apprentices and $10 for persons in the second year of their apprenticeship where course-work is not available locally. These allowances are taxable. A $1000 cash rebate (additional to the normal CRAFT rebate) continues to be payable during 1981-82 to employers for each first year apprentice indentured during the period 1 December 1980 to 30 June 1981 over and above the number indentured during the same period in 1979-80. However, this benefit is now limited to employers in the metal, electrical and building trades. This rebate, which is tax exempt, is conditional upon the employer not reducing the number of later year apprentices in his employment except through the normal completion of their indentures. The 1980-81 provision covered benefits for 13 700 additional apprentices to be taken on; for 1981-82 the provision will cover 8000 additional indentures. The $7.6 million increase in the 1981-82 provision for CRAFT reflects both expected growth in apprenticeship intakes and the full year effect of the 1980-81 increases in rebates and allowances ($13.3 million), offset in part by the more limited eligibility for the $1000 rebate. In all, employers are expected to receive assistance through CRAFT in respect of some 95000 apprentices in 1981-82, compared to 92 000 in 1980-81 and 78000 in 1979-80; increases on 1981 of 136000 apprentice days of off-the-job training and 165 000 days of technical education are being allowed for.

Under the Group One-Year Training Scheme, apprentices indentured to private employers may receive full-time training for the whole of their first year of apprenticeship in Commonwealth and State Government establishments which would otherwise have surplus training capacity. The costs (including wages) of this training are met in full by the Commonwealth, at a current average cost of $6500 per apprenticeAt the end of the first year the apprentices commence work with their employers. The number of apprentices trained under the scheme is expected to be 270 in 1981-82, the same as for 1980-81. Besides the assistance available under CRAFT, employers may also obtain additional support for group apprenticeship arrangements (ie where indenture is to an industry body rather than to a single employer). This scheme is jointly administered with the States, who also share the costs. It is expected that grants totalling $0.4 million will be paid in 1981-82 (the first full year) to employer groups to underwrite administrative support facilities for sixteen group apprenticeship projects. In 1981-82, 1200 apprentices are expected to benefit from the scheme compared with 50 apprentices in 1980-81. The Special Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme was introduced in 1975 to provide financial assistance to employers who need assistance to retain an apprentice in their employment or to engage an apprentice who has not been able to complete his apprenticeship with a previous employer for reasons of business hardship. Such a case would occur, for example, where work shortages would otherwise lead to retrenchment of apprentices; the employer could receive a subsidy for up to 12 months to continue on-thejob training. Jointly funded Commonwealth/State Special Trade Training Schemes, including accelerated training for adult apprentices, are also being developed in response to various geographic and skill-specific shortages of tradesmen, especially those arising as a result of present or projected development projects. The first such scheme is in Western Australia, and is aimed particularly at labour needs expected when the North-West Shelf natural gas project comes on stream. Arrangements have also been made with other States to overcome chronic shortages which have arisen in particular skills such as shortages of welders, boiler-makers, electrical tradesmen and fitters. The costs· associated with such schemes are expected to increase to $1.3 million in 1981-82, compared with $0.8 million in 1980-81. Skills Training The Commonwealth provides assistance outside the trade skills area to help overcome specific skills shortages, to train unemployed persons towards employment in occupations that are in demand, and to encourage industries' own internal staff training and other personnel development schemes. Estimated expenditure on these schemes in 1981-82, and earlier, is shown below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million 'Skills in demand' projects 0.5 8.0 +7.5 General training assistance for individualson-the-job . . . . . 6.9 8.5 4.9 3.6 in educational institutions 3.3 3.0 2.0 -1.0 Industry training services 2.0 3.0 5.3 +2.3 Total Skills Training 12.2 14.9 20.2 +5.3 In 1981-82, with an amount of $20.2 million being allocated, the main emphasis in skills training will be on joint projects with industry organisations, the major resourc.e developers, and other (private and State Government) sponsors to meet specific skills shortages where training arrangements are not adequate. In 1980-81 there was a total of 350 approvals for training; the estimate of $8.0 million provides for about 3000 approvals in .1981-82. As most training is on-the-job and existing training arrangements vary, a training 'package' for each project is negotiated with the industry participants; classroom training may also be supported, with allowances similar to those for general training assistance (see below) being paid to trainees selected from unemployed Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) registrants. Preference in selection is given to the unemployed, and project sponsors undertake to provide employment when training is completed and to meet the cost of ongoing training when the agreed shortages have been overcome. Assistance continues to be available for unemployed persons registered with the CES where further training would fit them for particular employment opportunities or help them find suitable employment. Where the CES cannot find experienced persons for jobs on offer, and training on the-job is an appropriate way to develop the particular skills required, the Commonwealth will pay a wage subsidy (currently $69.30 a week for adults and $50.80 a week for juniors) to employers who undertake to provide such training. Trainees are paid normal award rates. A higher level of subsidy ($157.10 a week) over a longer training period (a minimum of twenty weeks) is available for persons who are particularly disadvantaged in the labour market (eg migrants with language difficulties, single breadwinners with dependants, ex-prisoners). Assistance for formal training in educational institutions (ie off-the-job) is also available to unemployed CES registrants who wish to train for occupations where vacancies are expected to exist on completion of training. Full-time trainees receive an income-tested allowance equivalent to Unemployment Benefit and a training allowance (currently $37 a week for adults, $15.30 a week for juniors) income-tested on the combined income of trainee and spouse. Part-time trainees not in full-time employment receive a training allowance only. AU trainees are reimbursed (up to $220 a year) for costs of essential books and equipment and for fees. An amount of $6.9 million is being provided iri 1981-82 for these two categories of general training assistance for individuals, compared to $11.5 million spent in 1980-81, in line with the greater emphasis now on training to meet specific skills shortages. Expenditure on these schemes will also be less because general training assistance will concentrate more in 1981-82 on unemployed CES registrants who are over 24 years of age; those under 24 years are being catered for by substantially expanded youth training schemes (see below). Taken together, the funds for skills in demand and general training assistance are expected to allow for 11 000 on-the-job and 1100formal training approvals in 1981-82, compared to 15 600 and 1900 approvals in ·1980-81. Also under this heading is the support provided for Industry Training Services to encourage the systematic development of training programs through all sectors of industry and commerce, including small business. Expenditure for this purpose is estimated at $5.3 million in 1981-82, compared to $3.0 million in 1980-81. This assistancis mainly for the employment of manpower development executives and industrial training officers by industry training committees and industry associations; grants are also available for the development of new training programs, research into training needs, the production of basic training manuals (sales now average 60 000 copies a year) and group training schemes to allow groups of small firms to employ training specialists. These funds also support the operations of the National Training Council and tripartite industry training committees in industries throughout Australia. In 1981-82 it is estimated that about 100 Industry Training Committees in 25 industries will be supported and assistance will also be given to 70 industry associations. Youth Training Particular emphasis is now being given to increasing the opportunities for further education, training and work experience that are available to the young unemployed, especially those who have been but of work and away from education for a long period. Substantial funds are being provided for classroom-based transition education and training through the five-year School to Work Transition program begun in 1980. Details of this expenditure are given within the function 'Education'. As well as providing courses in educational institutions to help young people make the transition from school to work, the School to Work Transition program also provides for allowances to avoid the young unemployed being discouraged for financial reasons from taking up courses which would add to their skills, and their employability. Subsidies are also available to employers who provide work experience opportunities for the young unemployed. Details of expenditure on these schemes are as follows. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million School to Work Transition AllowancesEducation Program for Unemployed Youth 3.0 3.5t 'Transition' Allowance 13.0 + 8.3 1.2\ Pre·apprenticeship Allowance 1.1 1.6 1.3 0.3 Assistance for Work Experience (SYETP)standard 21.0 31.3 35.3 + 4.0 extended .. 1.9 21.6 + 19.7 in Commonwealth establishments 3.2 8.1 8.2 + 0.1 Total Youth Training 28.3 47.5 79.4 +31.9 An income-tested 'Transition' Allowance, equivalent to Unemployment Benefit plus $6 a week for fares and incidentals, has been available since the beginning of 1981 to participants in approved, Commonwealth-funded, school to work transition courses offered in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions-ie preapprenticeship, pre-vocational and pre-employment courses, and short Education Program for Unemployed Youth (EPUY) courses concerned with basic literacy, numeracy, social skills and motivation. Coverage has recently been extended to similar State-funded courses. Those eligible are CES registrants aged 15 to 19 years (15 to 24 years for EPUY courses) who have been unemployed and away from full-time education for at least 4 of the previous 12 months. Including recipients of the EPUY allowances now absorbed into this scheme, 8800 new trainees were assisted in 1980-81; 16000 are expected to be approved in 1981-82 at a cost of $11.5 million. The 'Transition' Allowance is also available for the longer-term unemployed (ie those who have been away from full-time education and unemployed for at least 8 of the previous 12 months, and aged 15 to 25 years) who undertake approved 'mainstream' T AFE courses that teach occupational skills and lead to greater employability. An estimated 1000 new trainees in this category will be assisted in 1981-82 at a cost of $1.5 million. As an encouragement to students to undertake training leading to an apprenticeship, an allowance of $20 per week continues to be available to students in full-time pre-apprenticeship courses at T AFE institutions where either the 'Transition' Allowance or assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is not available. Expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated at $l.3 million, providing for about 1650 new trainees. Complementing this support for classroom-based training, assistance for work experience under the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) provides opportunities for work experience in full-time jobs to young unemployed who lack the prior experience, specific job skills or personal qualities that employers require. Private employers who offer up to 17 weeks of work experience receive $55 a week towards the labour costs of each young person taken on. Participants are CES registrants aged 15 to 24 years who have been unemployed and away from education for at least 4 of the last 12 months. Since February 1981, SYETP has been extended to provide a higher subsidy ($80 a week) and a second 17 weeks of work experience (subsidised at $55 a week) for CES registrants aged 18 to 24 years who have been unemployed and away from full-time education for at least 8 of the last 12 months. full costs in this case being met from the program. Subsidies for places in State establishments have been discontinued. In 1981-82, it is estimated that 69600 new work experience placements will be made and 19300 existing placements continued at a cost of $65.1 million, compared to 76000 participants (61000 new and 15000 existing) and expenditure of $4l.3 million in 1980-81; a doubling (to 12000) of extended (8 month) placements makes up the bulk of this increase.

Special Training The Commonwealth provides special employment counselling and training, through the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), for job seekers disadvantaged because of mental or physical disability, different cultural or language background, or through being unemployed for lengthy periods. A variety of arrangements (similar to those for general training assistance to individuals) are available to assist Aboriginals to gain employment skills and experience, and so to aid their access to open employment. The main form of assistance is on-thejob training at Commonwealth expense (for up to twelve months) in clerical, semiskilled and technical areas of Commonwealth and State Government establishments. Expenditure in 1980-81 was $7.5 million (for 1600 new trainees) and a similar amount is provided for 1981-82. Training allowances and employer subsidies are also available to unemployed Aboriginal CES registrants on a similar basis to general skills training assistance; in 1981-82, $1.6 million is provided for formal training allowances to cover an estimated 650 new trainees, and subsidies to cover 2000 new trainees are expected to cost $3.3 million. Special projects are developed where no other forms of training are appropriate; 60 projects are expected to be supported in 1981-82 at a cost of $0.75 million (the same as in 1980-81). In all, $13.9 million has been provided in 1981-82 for Aboriginal training. An amount of $4.0 million is available in 1981-82 for employment and training programs to assist disabled persons whose social, physical or mental handicaps hinder their access to open employment. Allowances for formal training and employer subsidies for on-the-job training (along similar lines to assistance for the able-bodied) will account for an estimated $2.8 million, involving some 2000 new trainees. In addition, as an initiative for the International Year of Disabled Persons, community-based agencies serving the disabled are being encouraged to develop work preparation projects for individuals assessed as capable of open employment; $1.2 million has been provided for 14 projects in 1981-82. Employment Services The Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) provides a nationwide jobplacement and career reference and advisory service through a network of 305 local offices; it also provides the administrative support for the Commonwealth's employment and training programs, including selection of trainees from among CES registrants. During 1980-81, the CES processed 1 814930 registrations and assisted in 607563 placements and a similar level of activity is expected in 1981-82; 109000 participants are expected to be approved for employment and training programs (97 000 in 1980-81). Expenditure in 1981-82 on the CES network is estimated to increase by $9.5 million. The expanded provision of occupational information materials, through CES, which was begun in 1980 under the School to Work Transition program will be continued in 1981-82 at an estimated cost of $1.4 million. Further promotion of the availability of the Commonwealth's employment and training programs will also be undertaken in 1981-82 at a cost of $0.4 million. Administration Estimated outlays of $52.0 million under this heading cover the costs of administration of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs' central and regional offices, the Office of Youth Affairs and the Bureau of Labour Market Research.The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs is responsible for the formulation and implementation of national manpower policies including the operation of the CES. The Office of Youth Affairs, established in February 1977, has the role of improving coordination and consultation between the Commonwealth and State and local government organisations in respect of Commonwealth programs and policies which affect young people. The Bureau of Labour Market Research, established in December 1979, co-ordinates existing research and provides information and analysis on labour market matters. The objective of the triennial immigration program covering the period 1978-79 to 1980-81 was a net population gain of 210 000. In the event, the total net population gain from the program over the triennium was about 256 000. During 1980-81 the Government undertook an extensive review of migration requirements in the light of population developments and skilled worker requirements and commenced a review of the Numerical Multi-factor Assessment System (NUMAS) used to assess eligibility for migration to Australia (other than under the refugee and special humanitarian schemes). The Government has decided to adopt each year a rolling three-year forward program of gross migration intake and net migration gain based on current migration policies. Pending completion of the NUMAS review and determination of the forward migration program, the 1981-82 provision has been based ona gross migration intake of between 115 000 and 120 000 persons. Significant elements of the 1981-82 gross intake are the expected arrival during the year of 21 500 persons under the refugee and special humanitarian schemes (mainly from South East Asia, and Eastern Europe), 23 000 in the family reunion category, and 49 000 in the general eligibility category including those migrants with occupational skills in demand. {fssisted Migration Arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government decided to discontinue the Assisted Passage Scheme for migrants. From 1981-82, assisted passages will only be available to eligible refugees, and to those formerly eligible migrants whose applications were lodged prior to 1 May 1981. Provision has been made for 23 000 assisted passages for those who continue to be eligible, at a cost of $12.6 million in 1981-82 compared with $13.9 million in 1980-81. The contribution to the operating expenses of migrant centres managed by Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd is increased by $0.4 million to $13.0 million, to accommodate the expected migrant and refugee intake. Administration Outlays under this heading relate to the administrative expenditures of the Department ofImmigration and Ethnic Affairs. The increase of $6.5 million in 1981-82 is due mainly to increased salary costs and the full year effect of the resumption of deportation activities on completion of the Government's amnesty for illegal immigrants. Recoveries Recoveries from change of resident status applications and further temporary entry permits are estimated to fall in 1981-82 by $1.0 million as a result of the Government's decision to restrict eligibility for change in resident status and to lengthen the effective period applied to further temporary entry permits. Contributions to assisted passages are expected to decline from $1.2 million in 1980-81 to $0.65 million in 1981-82 as the Assisted Passage Scheme for migrants comes to an end. E. OTHER ECONOMIC SERVICES . This grouping covers outlays on economic services provided by the Commonwealth which are not readily classified to the more specific functional groupings. Included are outlays for certain forms of economic and trade regulation, and for specialised activities and administrative expenses not directly identifiable with specific industries or groups of industries. These outlays consist mainly of wage, salary and administrative costs; the increase in outlays estimated for 1981-82 mainly reflects an additional payday falling in the period and wage decisions. These factors are partly offset by reductions in regulatory activities arising from the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Economic and Trade RegulationPatents, Trade Marks and Designs Office 8.7 10.0 11.4 + 1.4 Industries Assistance Commission 7.9 8.5 9.4 + 0.8 Trade Practices 4.3 5.0 5.0 + 0.1 Prices Justification \.8 \.8 1.3 0.5 Consumer Protection nec 0.1 0.1 0.1 National Companies and Securities Commission 0.2 \.0 \,4 + 0.4 Other \.0 0.9 0.9 Recoveries 9.2Cr 11.0Cr 12.5Cr 1.5 Total 14.7 16.2 17.0 + 0.8 Specialised ActivitiesMeteorological Services (net) 31.9 34.1 42.7 + 8.5 National Mapping 7.8 10.2 11.3 + 1.0 Total 39.7 44.3 53.9 + 9.6 General Administrative and Other Expenditure (net) 61.5 66.1 70.9 + 4.7 The bulk of outlays for the various regulatory bodies listed under this heading is in respect of salaries and administrative expenditure. The Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office oversights and administers Australian property systems for the protection of inventions, trade marks and industrial designs, examines applications for Letters Patent of invention and for the registration of designs and trade marks and publishes details of successful applications. The increase in estimated expenditure in 1981-82 mainly reflects higher wage and salary payments resulting from arbitral decisions. The Industries Assistance Commission holds inquiries and reports to the Government in accordance with the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 on matters which affect assistance to industries and which are referreq to it. The expenditure increase is mainly attributable to wage and salary increases. The item Trade Practices covers the activities of both the Trade Practices Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal. The Commission administers the Trade Practices Act 1974, which proscribes restrictive trade practices and provides for consumer protection. The Tribunal considers appeals against decisions by the Commission on authorisation applications. Because of prospective staff reductions and some curtailment of activities resulting from the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the 1981-82 estimate is only slightly above 1980-81 expenditure. The estimate for Prices Justification in 1981-82 covers the provision of funds for the former Prices Justification Tribunal and the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. Although the Prices Justification Tribunal has been abolished, funds are required in 1981-82 to meet salaries and allowances of some Tribunal staff pending resolution of their employment status and to meet outstanding accounts. The Petroleum Products Pricing Authority was created in June 1981 to conduct inquiries and report to the Government on the prices for the supply of petroleum products and related services. To a large degree it will be taking over this function from the former Prices Justification Tribunal but, because of its narrower functions, the annual cost of $0.5 million in 1981-82 is much lower than the costs previously incurred by the Tribunal. The estimate for Consumer Protection nec in 1981-82 consists of a grant of $0.1 million (the same as in 1980-81) for the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, to assist in the cost of co-ordinating the activities of consumer bodies in Australia and presenting their views to governments and industry. The National Companies and Securities Commission, established to administer a uniform scheme of regulation of companies and securities matters, including the companies legislation and counterpart State legislation, commem;ed operations in March 1980. It is financed on a joint Commonwealth/State basis with the Commonwealth contributing half the funds required and the States providing the balance in proportion to their respective population sizes. The Commonwealth contributed $0.185 million towards an establishment cost of $0.37 million in 1979-80, and $0.95 million of the $1.9 million total contributions to the Commission in 1980-81. Of estimated total contributions in 1981-82 of $2.7 million, provision is made for a Commonwealth contribution of $1.35 million. The increase in contribution reflects the development of the Commission to its fully operational stage, following assent to much of the legislation which it was established to administer. The major item included in the Other category is expenditure by the National Standards Commission ($0.7 million). There is a slight reduction on 1980-81 outlays due to the termination of the Metric Conversion Board on 30 June 1981 and the assumption by the Department of Science and Technology of residual metrication activities. Recoveries comprise fees charged by the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office pursuant to the policy objective of full cost recovery for the services rendered by the Office. Meteorological services encompass the activities of the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology ($57 million) and the Ionospheric Prediction Service ($1.2 million). Estimated expenditure by the Bureau in 1981-82 is mainly for salaries and administrative expenses and includes an amount of $4.84 million for part of the cost of new computers to be installed in 1981-82 at a total estimated cost of $5.7 million. Costs attributable to some users of meteorological services (mainly civil aviation and Defence services) are recoverable, with receipts being estimated at $15.5 million in 1981-82. 182 Taking into account other minor revenues, the net outlay from the Budget on meteorological services in 1981-82 is estimated at $42.7 million (compared with $34.1 million in 1980-81). For National Mapping the Budget provision of $11.3 million includes an allowance for an enlarged bathymetric mapping program. This ongoing program was expanded in 1980-81, at an additional cost of$1.5 million each year, following the Government's decision to employ a surplus Department of Transport navigational aid vessel for bathymetric mapping, pending completion of a projected research vessel for the CSIRO. Provision is made for a once-only increase in the Division's capital program in 1981-82 for the purchase of two aircraft to replace two present aircraft (proceeds from the sale of the present aircraft are expected to more than offset this increase). These outlays relate to the operating and capital costs (other than those allocated to specific or regulatory functions) of the Departments of Business and Consumer Affairs ($23.0 million), National Development and Energy ($13.1 million), and Trade and Resources ($26.4 million), together with the working environment and productivity development functions of the Department of Science and Technology ($10.8 million). 9. GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICES This grouping covers a broad range of general public services and activities relating to the organisation and operation of the Commonwealth Government, including legislative services, administrative services, administration of the courts and law enforcement, and foreign affairs, overseas aid and administration of external territories. A. LEGISLATIVE SERVICES The most significant factor underlying the estimated increase of 15.0 per cent to $128.8 million in 1981-82 for outlays on legislative services is expenditure on the design and construction of the new Parliament House. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $mil1ion $ million Governor General's Office and Other Official Establishments 2.6 3.0 3.4 + 0.3 Parliamentary ExpenditureSalaries and Allowances of Members 12.3 16.7 16.9 'I0.2 Other (net) 46.0 52.9 60.4 + 7.4 Parliament House Construction Authority 0.7 8.1 26.3 + 18.2 ACT House of Assembly 0.4 0.5 0.6 + 0.1 Australian Electoral Office 16.8 30.7 21.3 9.5 Parliamentary Expenditure An increase of $1.2 million in the prOVISiOn for Salaries and Allowances of Senators and Members reflects the Government's decision to accept half of the increase in salaries and allowances of Senators, Members and Ministers recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal's 1981 Review. (The deferred portion of the recommended increase will not be payable until 1982-83.) This is largely offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in the estimate of benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 due to an expected reduction, compared with 1980-81, in the number of members retiring from Parliament. Outlays under Other. which include salaries, administrative costs and capital works associated with the functioning of Parliament and administrative costs of electorate offices of Senators and Members, are estimated to increase by $7.4 million in 1981-82. Of this increase $4.8 million relates to increased salary and allowance payments (including $2.3 million for Parliamentary and Ministerial staff) resulting from National Wage Case decisions and provision for an additional pay period. An increase of $0.8 million in the cost of special flights undertaken by RAAF No. 34 Squadron is mainly due to an estimated increase in hours charged by the Department of Defence. Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) Outlays under this item include an amount of $12.3 million for the administrative costs of the PHCA, architectural and professional fees and preliminary site works for the new Parliament House. In addition, an amount of $14.0 million has been provided in 1981-82 to allow commencement of work on foundations, basements, plant rooms, forecourt, sections of the main spine of the central building and House of Representatives Chamber together with construction of basic engineering services. ACT House of Assembly This item covers salaries and administrative costs of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. Australian Electoral Office Provision is made under this heading for outlays by the Australian Electoral Office for the administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the conduct of Commonwealth elections and referenda and industrial elections. The decrease of $9.5 million in 1981-82 reflects the cost in 1980-81 of holding the 1980 Federal elections and by-elections ($12.2 million) partially offset by an increase in salaries costs ($1.4 million) and provision for restocking Federal election forms and equipment ($0.6 million). B. LAW, ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY Commonwealth outlays on law, order and public safety functions for 1981-82 are estimated at $253.2 million, an increase of$31.7 million or 14.3 per cent on 1980-81. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Courts and Legal ServicesHigh Court 21.1 6.0 4.5 1.5 Federal Court 2.8 4.1 4.5 + 0.4 Commonwealth-State Law Courts Family Law 11.5 14.5 17.1 + 2.6 Courts and Registration Offices in the Territories 2.2 2.1 2.5 + 0.5 Bankruptcy Administration 3.5 3.1 4.2 + 1.2 Crown Solicitor 8.5 9.8 11.0 + 1.2 Australian Law Reform Commission 0.9 l.l 1.2 + 0.1 Legal Aid 28.7 33.7 37.5 + 3.7 Protection of Human Rights 0.4 0.4 1.5 + 1.1 Total 79.6 74.7 83.9 + 9.2 Police, Security and DetentionSecurity Services and Organisations 22.3 27.9 31.6 + 3.7 Police and Prison Services 63.3 82.1 94.6 + 12.5 Other 2.9 4.3 6.6 + 2.4 Total 88.5 114.3 132.8 + 18.5 Attorney-General's DepartmentGeneral Administrative and Other Expenditure 15.9 17.6 22.5 + 4.9 Reporting Branch 6.3 6.8 7.9 + 1.1 Total 22.2 24.4 30.4 + 6.0 Public Safety and ProtectionRoad Safety 0.8 0.9 0.8 0.2 Other 6.4 7.4 7.6 + OJ Total 7.2 8.3 8.4 + 0.1 Building, Works and Equipment nec 8.9 6.0 3.8 2.2 Recoveries 6.8Cr 6.2Cr 6.3Cr 0.1 High Court The jurisdiction of the High Court is exercised by the Chief Justice and six puisne Justices. The High Court of Australia Act 1979 provides for the Court to administer its own affairs, to control its staff and any buildings occupied by it and to receive moneys appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of the Court. The new administration came into operation on 21 Apri11980 to coincide with the move of the Court to the new High Court Building at the seat of Government in Canberra. Finalisation of contracts relating to the construction and fitting out costs of the new building totalled $1. 7 million in 1980-81. The provision of $4.5 million in 1981-82 is for the continued operations of the Court in Canbl.')rra and the States and includes an amount of $0.7 million for salaries and allowances for Judges. The Court is expected to sit for up to one week in each of four of the State Capitals-Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart-in 1981-82. Federal Court Under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the original and appellate jurisdictions of the Federal Court of Australia are exercised by a Chief Judge and twenty puisne Justices. An amount of $4.5 million is being provided in 1981-82 for the operations of the Court, of which $1.6 million relates to Judges' salaries. Family Law Under the Family Law Act 1975, the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Family Court is exercised by the Chief Judge, eight senior Judges and thirty one puisne Judges of the Family Court of Australia and by the Family Court of Western Australia in that State. The provision of $17.1 million for the Family Court in 1981-82 includes $1.9 million for the reimbursement to Western Australia of the costs of running the -tate Cour( and $3.8 million for the reimbursement to other States of the costs of undertaking family law services on behalf of the Commonwealth. Courts and Registration Offices in the Territories An amount of $2.5 million is provided for the operations of the ACT Supreme Court and Court of Petty Sessions in 1981-82, an increase of $0.5 million over 1980-81 expenditure. The original and appellate jurisdictions are exercised by three Supreme Court Judges and five Magistrates. (Before 1980-81 outlays for the Northern Territory Courts and Registration Offices were also included under this heading; responsibility for those functions has since rested with the Northern Territory Government.) Bankruptcy Administration An amount of $4.2 million is provided in 1981-82 for the administration of bankruptcies, an increase of $1.2 million over 1980-81 expenditure. Of the increase, $0.7 million relates to the acquisition of computer equipment to handle bankrupt estates that fall within the responsibility of the Official Receiver. Crown Solicitor The increase of $1.2 million to $11.0 million in 19in-82 for the Crown Solicitor's Office reflects increases in wage and salary costs, including the additional payday in 1981-82. Legal Aid The provision for the continuation of legal aid in 1981-82 is $37.5 miilion which includes $6.5 million for Aboriginal legal aid and $0.4 million for grants to voluntary legal aid organisations. Since 1976 it has been the policy of the Government to provide legal aid in Australia through a scheme involving co-operation between the Commonwealth and States (except for Aboriginal legal aid which is administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs). Under the scheme legal aid is to be provided in each State and Territory (except for community legal aid schemes) through a single independent statutory Commission established by State or Territory legislation. Commissions have been established in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales although the latter commission has not yet taken over the operations of the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) in that State. The Victorian Legal Aid Commission will commence operation on 1 September 1981. Approximately 65 300 people were provided with legal assistance in 1980-81; 12 400 through the services of salaried lawyers and 52 900 through referrals to private practitioners. It is. expected that some 68 000 people will receive legal assistance in 1981-82. Legislation passed during the Autumn Sittings provided for the replacement of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission by an advisory Council which will advise the Government on legal aid matters of relevance to the Commonwealth and of Australia wide significance. The Council will be serviced by staff of the Attorney-General's Department. Some of the existing staff of the Commission will be absorbed into the Department. The increase of $3: 7 million in 1981-82 for legal aid reflects the additional payday for officers of the ALAO and ACT Commission, arbitrated salary and wage increases, increased fees in respect of referrals to private legal practitioners and the Commonwealth's share of the establishment costs of the Victorian Commission. Protection ofHuman Rights The estimate of $1.5 million in 1981-82, an increase of $1.1 million, provides for the continuation of the Commonwealth's activities in the community relations area and the establishment of the new Human Rights Commission under the Human Rights Commission Act 1981. Security Services and Organisations This provision is for expenditure by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ($22.0 million) and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service ($9.6 million). Police and Prison Services The estimate of $94.6 million inCludes $91.2 million for the operations of the Australian Federal Police Force, which was established on 19 October 1979 by the amalgamation of the former ACT and Commonwealth Police forces, $2.2 million for antiterrorist equipment and training for Australian police forces and $1.2 million for the care of ACT prisoners in New South Wales institutions under the Removal of Prisoners (ACT) Act 1968. The increase of $12.5 million reflects increases in salaries costs (inCluding $2.3 million for the additional payday) and additional expenditure on overtime, travel and purchases of communications equipment associated with an increase in police operational activity and security arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 1981. Other This provision is for the operation of the Office of National Assessments ($2.0 million), the Australian Institute of Criminology ($1.2 million), the first full year of operations of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence established by the Commonwealth and State Governments during 1980-81 ($0.6 million), the Royal Commission into the Ship Painters and Dockers Union ($1.3 million), the Commonwealth's contribution towards the administrative expenses of the Central Fingerprint Bureau and contributions to international criminology organisations and police scientific research. Consistent with recent Government decisions, the question of sharing of the operational costs of the Institute of Criminology is under examination. General Administrative and Other Expenditure The estimate of $22.5 million in 1981-82, up $4.9 million on 1980-81 expenditure, reflects increased salary and wage costs including the additional payday ($1.6 million), the purchase of computer and associated facilities· ($2 million) and the hosting of the Fifth South Pacific Judicial Conference in 1982 ($0.15 million). Reporting Service The estimate of $7.9 million in 1981-82 reflects salary and wage increases including an additional payday for Court reporting staff ($0.8 million). Road Safety The estimates for 1981-82 provide $0.6 million for Commonwealth payments to the Office of Road Safety for road safety promotion and research on Road Safety. This is a reduction of $183 000 on 1980-81 expenditure and reflects completion of a major project. The estimates for 1981-82 also provide $153000 for grants to the States and the Northern Territory for the promotion of road safety practices. Other This provision includes the operating expenses of the ACT Fire Brigade ($4.5 million), fire protection services for Commonwealth property ($2.3 million), and amounts for bush fire prevention, control and supervision on rural lands and public reserves in the ACT ($0.5 million). Expenditure under this heading relates mainly to the construction and refurbishing of Commonwealth Law Court and Police facilities in the ACT and the States. Outlays include $0.3 million for Hobart Law Courts and $1.1 million on refurbishing the Conciliation and Arbitration Building, Melbourne. The decrease of $2.2 million in outlays reflects the completion in 1980-81 of the ACT Family and Juvenile Courts and the ACT Police College and Services Centre. Included under this heading are court fees for the High Court, Federal Court and Family Court ($3.2 million), fines and Court costs ($0.8 million), receipts of the . I Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office including debt recovery ($0.7 million), fees charged to Commonwealth statutory authorities and commercial undertakings l""\>f services rendered ($0.6 million) and fees fOf fire protection ($1.0 million). C. FOREIGN AFFAIRS, OVERSEAS AID AND EXTERNAL Total outlays on foreign affairs, overseas aid and external territories are estimated to increase by 17.3 per cent to $877.2 million in 1981-82. This total includes most of the Commonwealth's expenditures under policies designed to promote relations with overseas countries and to assist in the economic and social development of developing countries; net expenditure on external territories is small. (About three-quarters of all expenditure under this heading relates to various overseas economic aid programs to assist developing countries, including Papua New Guinea; a more detailed account of Australia's aid programs is provided in Budget Paper No. 8-Australia's Overseas Development Assistance Program.) 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Aid PaymentsBilateral AidPapua New Guinea 237.7 245.0 253.9 + 8.9 Projects and Disaster Relief 104.1 122.7 151.6 + 28.9 Training 14.0 16.8 21.6 + 4.8 Food Aid 45.7 64.9 78.3 + 13.4 Other 18.6 8.4 15.9 + 7.5 Total Bilateral Aid 420.2 457.7 521.4 + 63.6 Multilateral AidInternational Development Finance Institutions . 38.5 47.5 60.5 + 13.0 UN Programs, Regional and Other Organisations 39.8 47.2 71.2 + 24,0 Total Multilateral Aid 78.3 94.7 131.7 + 37.0 Total Aid 498.5 552.5 653.1 + 100.6 Membership of International Organisations and Other Non-Aid Expenditure 28.3 34.3 44.9 + 10.6 External Territories 2.8 4.9 6.0 + 1.1 General Administrative Expenditure 143.2 164.0 180.2 + 16.2 Recoveries and Repayments 8.9Cr 7.8Cr 6.9Cr+ 0.9 NAL TERRITORIES(a)(b) 663.9 747.9 877.2 + 129.4 (a) Referred to elsewhere in Budget documentation as 'Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid', (b) Some figures in the table differ slightly from those shown in Budget Paper No.8 because of the use of different concepts for recording Australia's overseas aid perf6rmance. AID PAYMENTS An amount of $653.1 million is provided for expenditure on overseas aid in 1981-82, an increase of $100.6 million or 18.2 per cent over expenditure in 1980-81. This substantial increase reflects the importance which the Government attaches to improving Australia's already creditable aid performance and to providing practical forms of assistance to developing countries. Taking into account 'Assistance Additional to Aid Payments' (see below), assistance to developing countries in 1981-82 is estimated to amount to about $704.3 million. This figure excludes the significant amounts spent by the Commonwealth and State Governments on the education and training of several thousand students from developing countries who. are attending various tertiary and other training institutions in Australia. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of providing assistance of this kind, which js not brought to account directly under the overseas aid program, is estimated at about $41 million in 1981. Australia also provides other indirect forms of economic aid through its contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations (eg the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation) that assist in the financing of aid projects in developing countries. The aid component of Australia's contributions to these organisations in 1981-82 is estimated at about $3.1 million. Other indirect economic assistance is provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation through the financing, in certain circumstances, of exports of capital goods on concessional terms. Papua New Guinea An amount of $253.9 million is provided for expenditure on aid to or on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government in 1981-82. This is $8.9 million more than in 1980-81. In 1980 a new five-year aid agreement was negotiated between the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea covering the period 1981-82 to 1985-86. Under the terms of the new agreement Australia will provide Papua New Guinea with annual budget support grants which will be determined on the basis of a formula involving a five per cent annual real reduction in Australian aid. The new five-year commitment, which is likely to involve expenditure of at least $1 200 million, will enable the Papua New Guinea Government to pursue its economic and social development policies in the knowledge that substantial Australian assistance will be provided over the five-year period, while at the same time allowing for a gradual winding down in Papua New Guinea's dependence on Australian aid. The grant for 1981-82 has been set at $241.3 million, an increase of $9.3 million over the 1980-81 grant. Outlays on the provision of education and technical assistance under the Papua New Guinea-Australia Technical Co-operation Program are estimated at $2.2 million in 1981-82, an increase of 26 per cent over 1980-81. Payments in respect of termination and retirement benefits and other pensions to expatriate officers (and their dependants) of former Papua New Guinea Administrations and the Australian Staffing Assistance Group are estimated at $10.3 million in 1981-82, $0.9 million less than in 1980-81. These payments, which are made under the Papua New Guinea,(StajJing Assistance) Act 1973, are expected to continue to decline over the next few years as the Commonwealth discharges its responsibilities under the Act. A review of all aspects of Australian aid to Papua New Guinea will be undertaken in 1983 to determine arrangements to apply after 1983-84. Projects and Disaster Relief Expenditure under this heading is estimated to increase by $28.9 million in 1981-82 to $151.6 million. This aid is directed towards a range of activities including projects, equipment and expert advice aimed at increasing agricultural productivity, providing general infrastructure and improving transport and communication facilities. Contributions to developing countries for natural disaster relief are also included. Project assistance has expanded rapidly in recent years, mainly reflecting increases in aid to A recent initiative under the bilateral aid program was the decision announced at the Zimbabwe Conference on Reconstruction and Development in March 1981 to increase Australia's contribution for reconstruction and rehabilitation purposes to the recently independent Zimbabwe from $lO million to $20 million over the period July 1980 to December 1984. Of this commitment, $3.3 million was provided in 1980-81 and $4 million is expected to be provided in 1981-82. In addition there will be a substantial increase in bilateral project assistance to African countries generally in 1981-82. It is also proposed to establish an Australian centre for agricultural research as a new statutory body which will contract research work to existing Australian institutions in the field of agricultural research for the benefit of developing countries. An initial provision of $1.0 million is made for this purpose in 1981-82. Bilateral contributions to developing countries for disaster relief amounted to $0.4 million in 1980-81. Training Expenditure in 1981-82 on training programs (excluding training provided under the Papua New Guinea-Australia Technical Co-operation Program) is estimated at $21.6 million, an increase of $4.8 million on 1980-81. This expenditure covers the direct costs (including student fees) of officially sponsored students from developing countries who undertake studies in Australia, in their home country or in a third country, together with support for training institutions in some ASEAN and South Pacific countries. The increase in the provision for this item will allow for an expansion in the number of sponsored students assisted under the training program from about 3000 in 1980-81 to 3300in 1981-82. Food Aid Outlays on bilateral food aid are estimated to increase by $13.4 million to $78.3 million in 1981-82. It is expected that 365000 tonnes of food grain will be provided bilaterally at a cost of $72 million, including $14.4 million to cover freight costs in emergency situations. This represents an increase of 42 000 tonnes over 1980-81 and will, together with Australia's contribution of 80000 tonnes of grain to the World Food Program (see heading 'United Nations Programs, Regional and Other International Organisations'), fulfil Australia's commitment under the Food Aid Convention of the International Wheat Agreement to provide a minimum of 400 000 tonnes of food grain aid annually. In addition to food grain aid, $4.1 million is earmarked for the provision of nongrain food items, an increase of $1.5 million on 1980-81. Also included under this heading is a provision of $2.1 million for a new program of cbmmodity aid and technical assistance to improve agricultural production in developing countries. Other Bilateral Aid Included under this heading is emergency humanitarian assistance: assistance in 1980-81 included emergency humanitarian relief of $5.0 million for Kampuchea and $0.3 million for East Timor. The Government attaches importance to Australia being in a position to respond quickly and effectively to emergency relief programs undertaken in different parts of the world. Provision has been made in 1981-82 for $8.5 million to cover contributions to special appeals mainly from international organisations active in humanitarian relief operations, including assistance to refugees. Also included is $2.0 million for the recently introduced Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) Scheme. The DIFF Scheme will provide aid funds in conjunction with finance from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to ASEAN countries to increase the concessional element in credit terms that Australian firms can offer when tendering for the supply of certain goods and services to those countries. Support for voluntary aid organisations is estimated at $5.2 million in 1981-82, $2.3 million more than in 1980-81. This includes grants for the Overseas Service Bureau and the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, as well as direct financial support for small-scale development assistance projects carried out by voluntary aid organisations in developing countries. Australia's contributions to a number of international voluntary aid organisations, also recorded under this heading, are estimated to amount to $1 million in 1981-82, an increase of $0.5 million over 1980-81. Included here are contributions of $300 000 to the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and $265 000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Commonwealth supports a wide range of international organisations, including development finance institutions, United Nations agencies and various regional organisations. Payments to these in 1981-82 are estimated at $131.7 million, an increase of $37.0 million on 1980-81. International Development Finance Institutions This heading covers payments by Australia to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank Group, thelnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IF AD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Interest Subsidy Account. Expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated at $60.5 million, compared with $47.5 million in 1980-81. The provision comprises capital subscriptions to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) ($6.5 million) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) ($6.9million) and contributions to the International De. velopment Association (IDA) ($35.6 million), the Asian Development Fund ($7.7 million), the IFAD ($1.8 million), and the IMF Interest Subsidy Account ($2.0 million). The increase mainly reflects the Government's intention to make subscriptions to the capital stock increases of the IBRD and the IFC-both part of the World Bank Group-and make a contribution to the IMF Interest Subsidy Account. Financial support for these institutions is provided under specific legislation (with the exception of the contribution to the IMF Interest Subsidy Account) and takes the form of cash payments and promissory notes which are drawn down by the institutions either as required to meet their commitments or on the basis of previously agreed schedules. After allowing for payment of the 1981-82 provisions, total outstanding obligations to these organisations will amount to some $405.5 million. The amounts included will be drawn down over a number of years and comprise $132.6 million for the ADB (including $114.6 million for its concessionallending facility, the Asian Development Fund), $267 million for the IDA (the concessionallending agency of the World Bank Group), $5 million for the IFAD and $0.9 million for the IBRD. United Nations Programs, Regional and Other International Organisations Total payments under this heading are estimated to amount to $71.2 million in 1981-82, an increase of $24.0 million over 1980-81. Australia's contributions to various United Nations aid organisations are estimated at $22.6 million in 1981-82, an increase of $8.3 million on expenditure in 1980-81. Consistent with the substantial overall increase in the aid program in 1981-82, proposed expenditure under this heading will provide for major increases in the level of Australia's contribution to several United Nations organisations including the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Provision of $5.4 million is also made for initial contributions to a number of other programs which are in the process of being finalised and are expected to be announced shortly. Assistance to regional and other international programs is estimated at $19.1 million in 1981-82, an increase of $8.3 million over 1980-81. Major regional organisations receiving support include the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the South Pacific Commission, and the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation; support is also given to a number of international and regional research and training centres. Provision has also been made for a doubling of Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation and for increased assistance to various South Pacific regional programs. Expenditure under the World Food Program (WFP) is estimated to increase by $2.0 million or 9 per cent to $24.1 million in 1981-82. As in 1980-81 it is envisaged that 80000 tonnes of Australia's annual commitment of a minimum of 400 000 tonnes of food grain under the Food Aid Convention will be provided for the WFP; the cost of this provision in 1981-82 is estimated at $12.5 million. Provision is also made to meet: the balance of $4.85 million of Australia's minimum biennial pledge of cash and commodities to the WFP for the 1981-82 biennium; freight costs on the food aid to be disbursed through the WFP ($4.8 million); and an additional cash contribution of $2 million to the WFP for projects to improve global food security. Although Australia's Defence Co-operation Program (estimated to cost $40.7 million in 1981-82) represents an extension of our own defence effort, it also supplements the overseas economic aid program to the extent that it releases for development purposes resources that recipient governments might otherwise have set aside for defence purposes. Australia's assistance in this respect is described in the section on Defence Co-operation under the Defence function. In addition, the administrative expenses of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau estimated at $10.5 million in 1981-82 and recorded under General Administrative Expenditure, represent an integral part of total expenditure on Australia's aid effort. These outlays relate mainly to Australia's membership of a large number of international and regional organisations. Participation in these organisations entails contributions to their administrative expenses and, in some cases, their functional activities. Total expenditure for these purposes in 1981-82 is estimated at $44.9 million including $9.2 million for the United Nations regular budget, $3.5 million for the World Health Organisation, $2.7 million for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), $3.2 million for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), $1.9 million for the International Labour Organisation (ILO), $1.5 million for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and $2.3 million towards the cost of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). This heading also includes provision for cultural relations overseas and exchange visits, together with expenditures by the Australia-Japan Foundation, the AustraliaChina Council and the Australia-New Zealand Foundation. Also included here is $10.0 million for costs associated with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to be held in Melbourne in SeptemberOctober 1981. This amount relates to the cost of security equipment, payment to Victoria to cover costs incurred by Victoria Police in relation to CHOGM and additional to those costs which would normally be incurred by them, leasing of accommodation, and administrative costs. Other costs associated with the hosting of CHOGM (security, Federal Police, furniture and fittings, etc) are included under their appropriate functional headings. The overall cost is estimated to be $15 million (some $4 million of which will be recovered when equipment is disposed oflater or put to other uses). Under this item are shown the costs (net of revenue) of administering the three external territories of Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands. Expenditure in respect of the Australian Antarctic Territory is primarily for scientific purposes, and is shown under 'General and Scientific Research nec'. Expenditure in respect of other external territories is negligible, and has not been separated from the expenditure items within which it falls. The net outlay in respect of each of the three territories is shown below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Cocos (Keeling) Islands 2.4 4.5 5.3 +0.7 Christmas Island O.ICr O.ICr 0.2 +0.3 Norfolk Island 0.4 0.5 0.5 The increase in estimated net expenditure on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1981-82 mainly reflects the upgrading of lighterage facilities on the Island and the replacing of the official launch and radio transmitter. The gross costs of administering Christmas Island in 1981-82 are estimated at $5.2 million and are recovered from Island revenue and the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission, except for an estimated cost of$0.2 million associated with the Administrator and his immediate staff. The Government accepted these latter costs as a Commonwealth responsibility from 1980-81. Estimated net expenditure on Norfolk Island again includes an amount of $0.3 million for the restoration and maintenance of historic structures. Outlays on administrative costs of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the Overseas Property Office of the Department of Administrative Services are' estimated to increase by $16.2 million in 1981-82 to $180.2 million. Recoveries and repayments are estimated at $6.9 million in 1981-82. The main amounts included are repayments in respect of loans provided to the Papua New Guinea and Fiji Governments on concessional terms under the overseas aid program. D. GENERAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NEC This heading covers the activities of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), general research grant schemes and a variety of other research programs and supporting services undertaken by Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities, all of which involve several functions and disciplines. Substantial elements of Commonwealth support for scientific, industrial and general research are directed to specific fields such as defence technology, medicine, education and industrj research and development and are accounted for elsewhere in this Statement under the appropriate functional headings. For the items included in this General and Scientific Research category, total outlays in 1981-82 are estimated at $380.9 million, an increase of 21.1 per cent over 1980-81. A large part of this increase ($33.8 million) relates to provisions for the AAEC and CSIRO to commence payment of contributions in respect of their employer superannuation liability. Offsetting receipts from these authorities in respect of superannuation liability are recorded under the function 'General Public ServicesAdministrative Services'. Adjusted for this special factor the increase estimated for 1981-82 in outlays on General and Scientific Research nec is 10.4 per cent. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Australian Atomic Energy Commission 26.2 29.5 38.6 + 9.1 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ...... . 195.1 228.4 281.1 +52.7 Antarctic Division ..... . 20.9 23.4 22.2 1.1 Research Grants. . . . . . . 13.9 18.2 2'0.3 + 2.2 Australian Institute of Marine Science 3.5 5.2 5.7 + 0.5 Anglo-Australian Telescope Board 1.1 1.5 1.7 + 0.2 Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 2.3 2.4 2.6 + 0.2 Other Research and Science nec (net) 8.0 5.9 8.6 + 2.7 Australian Atomic Energy Commission The Commission's functions include scientific and technical research and investigations into matters associated with uranium and atomic energy (including the running of the HIFAR reactor) and the production and sale of radio-isotopes. The Budget provision of $38.6 million represents an increase of 30.8 per cent or $9.1 million over 1980-81 outlays. Over half of this increase ($4.6 million) is accounted for by a provision to enable the Commission to commence meeting the employer's share of superannuation contributions for its employees. Most of the remainder of the increase is attributable to salary and wage rises, provision for an additional payday in 1981-82, an increase of $0.1 million in the Commission's contribution to the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and EngineeriIlg and an acceleration in the delivery of and payment for fuel elements for-the HIFAR reactor. These increases are expected to be offset in part by the full year effect of a reduction in the Commission's staff numbers. The provision allows for the continuation of a number of buildings and works commenced in 1980-81 and expected to be completed in 1981-82 or 1982-83. These include the installation of a new computer-based site surveillance monitoring system, a building to centralise safety management, and conversion of the oil-fired boiler to use electricity. There will also be once-only increases in expenditure of $0.4 million for the construction of a fire station near the Commission's Lucas Heights Research Establishment and $0.7 million for plant and equipment to improve safety. An amount of $0.52 million is provided for the second year of a program (estimated to cost $4.7 million over five years) for the safety upgrading of the HIF AR reactor; this compares with expenditure of $0.05 million for this purpose in 1980-81. As announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions context, some existing Commission resources are to be transferred from the Commission to the CSIRO. These resources will form part of the new Institute of Energy and Earth Resources established by the CSIRO and will be co-located with the Commission at Lucas Heights. At the same time the Commission's Head Office staff, presently located at Coogee NSW, will be transferred to Lucas Heights. An initial sum of $0.08 million has been included in the Commission's 1981-82 provision for these purposes. The scope for the Commission to increase cost recovery from the private sector is also being examined. Apart from direct Budget funding, the Commission receives funds under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program, referred to under the function 'Industry Assistance and Development'. Information on the sale in 1980-81 of the Commonwealth's interest in the Ranger Uranium Joint Venture and in the Ngalia Basin Joint Venture is provided under 'Sale of Existing Assets' in Statement No.4. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization CSIRO is the largest research organisation in Australia, employing over 7000 staff. Its main role is to carry out a program of predominantly strategic applied scientific research, which includes collaborative, commissioned and other forms of joint projects with Government bodies and Australian industry. CSIRO is organised into five Institutes-Animal and Food Sciences, Biological Resources, Energy and Earth Resources, Industrial Technology, and Physical Sciences-together with a Bureau of Scientific Services. Direct appropriations for CSIRO in 1981-82 total $281.1 million of which $21.8.4 million is for operations and $49.5 million for major capital projects including $35 million for the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and $6.9 million for a laboratory ,complex for the Division of Chemical Technology at Clayton, Vic. In addition $8.5 miilion is provided for major items of equipment and $4.7 million for repairs and maintenance to the Organization's plant and equipment and buildings. The increase of $52.7 million (23.1 per cent) over 1980-81 is attributable mainly to the provision of $29.2 million to enable the CSIRO to commen<;e meeting -ts employer superannuation liability, $8 million for the effect of wage and salary increases, $4.8 million' for major civil works, $4.6 million for the extra payday provision in 1981-82, and a $3 million progress payment for the construction of a new oceanographic research ship. Details of expenditure for operations and equipment and capital works and services, and from expected revenues of $7.5 million in 1981-82, are provided in Table 14 of Budget Paper No 4. The Organization also expects to receive $30 million in 1981-82 ($23 million in 1980-81) as industry contributions and other forms of private and Government support for specific research projects to bring its total estimated expenditure in 1981-82 to $318.6 million ($257.7 million in 1980-81). Antarctic Division The Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology carries out research programs in the Antarctic and organises and provides administrative and logistic support in that region both for its own scientists and for those from other institutions. The Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (involving each year about 140 expeditioners) operate from three stations on the Antarctic continent and one on Macquarie Island. The research programs focus mainly on the fields of atmospheric physics, cosmic ray physics, glaciology, biology, medical science, geology and geophysics; special attention is now being given to marine research in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean. Expenditure in 1981-82 is estimated at $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million in 1980-81. The reduction reflects the once-only costs in 1980-81 of the Division's move to its new Headquarters in Hobart and a lower funding requirement in 1981-82 for continued rebuilding of the Antarctic Stations. Approval was given in 1980-81 to a ten year $58 million (1980 prices) rebuilding program, the first stage of which is planned for commencement in 1981-82. (Provision has been made for erection costs and $1.6 million for building materials.) This, with continued study and design work on transport facilities to support Antarctic activities, represents a major long term commitment to activity in that part of the Antarctic over which Australia has sovereignty. . Research Grants Total assistance for research grant schemes and fellowships is estimated to be $20.3 million in 1981-82 ($18.2 million in 1980-81). This includes support for the Australian Research Grants Scheme and Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships ($18 million in 1981-82) which support research projects by teams and individuals in the physical, chemical, biological and earth sciences, in engineering and applied sciences and in the humanities and . social sciences. In the field of marine science, work in the Antarctic is separately provided for with other support of $2.3 million being provided through the Funding Advisory Panel of the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee (whose main emphasis is presently on research related to the Great Barrier Reef) and the Queen's Fellowships Scheme. Australian Institute of Marine Science The Australian Institute of Marine Science was established to carry out research in marine science, both directly and in co-operation with other institutions. The Institute has a laboratory near Townsville and is directing its research mainly to tropical waters, particularly coral reefs. The Institute collaborates with other institutions including the CSIRO and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Expenditure by the Institute in 1981-82 is estimated at $5.7 million ($5.2 million in 1980-81), which represents a slowing down in expenditure growth after a build-up of scientific and support staff in recent years. Anglo-Australian Telescope Board This item provides for the Australian Government's contribution to the cost of operations and instrument development of the Anglo-Australian 3.9 metre optical telescope at Siding Spring NSW, and its associated research facilities. The total cost of operations in 1981-82 (to be shared equally with the UK Government) is estimated at $3.5 million. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established in 1964 to promote, encourage and assist studies and research in relation to the Aboriginal people. The Institute also has a responsibility to monitor the social impact of uranium mining on Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. The provision for the Institute in 1981-82 is $2.6 million. The Government has agreed that the functions and operations of the Institute should be externally reviewed. The review will be undertaken during 1981-82 and will canvass any inter-relationship between the Institute, the Museum of Australia and the Heritage Commission. Other Research and Science nec (net) The estimated expenditure in 1981-82 of $8.6 million under this heading covers several smaller activities associated with the support of scientific research and development in Australia. The increase of $2.7 million is affected by an excess of receipts over expenditure in 1980-81 of $1.4 million in relation to the Australian operation of NASA space tracking stations. The largest single item is a grant to the Standards Association of Australia ($2.5 million). Other grants are being made to the Learned Academies ($0.5 million), Research Associations ($1.2 million) and the National Association of Testing Authorities ($0.8 million). Scientific and technical co-operation with other countries (mainly by way of exchange visits and seminars) accounts for $0.4 million of the estimate. Scientific service facilities provided for include the Australian LANDSAT station (gross expenditure of $1.8 million) and the National Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer ($137 000). Revenues from these two activities are estimated at $540000 and $137 000 respectively. The remaining substantial item is the administrative expenditure of the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) which provides advice to the Government on the development of science and technology policy. Expenditure in 1981-82 is expected to be $0.8 million compared to $0.6 million in 1980-81. The increased allocation for 1981-82 includes the cost of providing an independent secretariat for the Council's new Technological Change Committee ($0.1 million in 1981-82). E. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES This heading covers general administrative services not allocated to specific functions, and various common services provided for the general operations of Government. These outlays are estimated to increase by $125.5 million or 11.6 per cent in 1981-82 to $1206.7 million. Many of the items under this heading contain large wage and salary elements and hence are affected by the occurrence of an additional pay period in 1981-82. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Fimincial Affairs and Fiscal AdministrationCustoms and Excise Administration 73.8 85.2 102.4 + 17.2 Taxation Administration 185.7 213.2 243.0 + 29.8 Other 69.8 5104 64.3 + 12.9 Total 329.3 349.9 409.8 + 59.9 Statis'tical Services, 64.2 87.9 111.0 + 23.1 General Administration of the A.C.T. 31.2 36.5 46.7 + 10.2 Other Administrative Services, nec 73.9 88.7 95.5 + 6.8 Common ServicesConstruction Services (net) 103.9 126.8 151.4 + 24,6 Commonwealth Offices 27.3 33.2 32.7 0.6 Printing and Publishing 4.6 5.6 6.6 + 1.0 Property Management and Services 50.9 56.1 66,3 + 10.2 Government Purchasing 8.3 9.1 lOA + 1.3 Rent 61.8 68.8 78.6 + 9,8 Publicity Services 8.3 lOA 10.7 + 0.3 Storage and Transport Services 23.6 23.7 22.2 1.5 Other 4.6 5.8 5.9 Total 293.1 339.5 384.8 + 45.3 Net Superannuation Payments, nec 196.6 236.6 219.3 17.2 Recoveries, nec 56.3Cr 58.0Cr 60.5Cr 2.5 Customs and Excise Administration The .estimated increase of $17.2 million for 1981-82 mainly reflects wage and price increases, and expenditure on upgrading customs surveillance further to measures begun in 1980-81 following the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs; expenditure of $6.7 million (up from $0.4 million in 1980-81) is also proposed for a major computer re-equipment program. The customs launch fleet will be further upgraded with the acquisition of a number of replacement and new boats for coastal surveillance and port of entry work ($0.9 million compared with $0.7 million in 1980-81). Three Nomad surveillance aircraft based at Townsville, Darwin and Port Hedland will be fully operational in 1981-82 ($2.1 million compared with $1.3 million in 1980-81) and there will be further expenditure associated with a program to upgrade customs communications equipment ($0.7 million compared with $0.5 million in 1980-81). Taxation Administration The provision in 1981-82 for the operations of the Australian Taxation Office is $243.0 million. The increase of $29.8 million reflects increases in salary and related costs, in 1981-82 ($24.3 million) and the enhancement of computer facilities. Other This heading includes outlays of the Departments of Finance and Treasury, the Auditor-General's Office and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The $12.9 million increase in 1981-82 includes an estimated increase of $6.1 million for salary and allowance costs. In addition, loan flotation expenses are estimated to increase by $2.9 million mainly reflecting payments in respect of loan raisings in 1980-81. Net expenditure of the Royal Australian Mint Trust Account is estimated to rise by $2.4 million in 1981-82. This re.fiects higher overall expenditure of $14.5 million resulting mainly from higher wage and salary costs and a return to normal work levels following an industrial dispute at the Mint in 1980-81, partly offset by higher estimated net receipts (up $12.0 million) primarily from the sale of uncirculated and proof gold coins. This provision is for outlays of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The estimated increase of $23.l million on 1980-81 outlays primarily reflects higher salary and allowance costs other than for the Census of Population and Housing undertaken on 30 June 1981 (lip $6.7 million) and expenditure (including wage and salary costs) on the Census (up $23.2 million); it also takes account of a reduction ($5.9 million) in proposed expenditure on the Bureau's computer re-equipment program. The provision for the Census of Population and Housing of $26.8 million compares with expenditure of $1.5 million in 1979-80 and $3.6 million in 1980-81. Commitment to the Census will require further expenditure by the Bureau in 1982-83 estimated at $0.2 million in present prices making a total cost of $32.1 million. Outlays under this heading are for works and services of a general nature in the Australian Capital Territory undertaken by the Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) which are not readily classifiable to other functions. Expenditure in 1981-82 includes salaries and allowances ($29.1 million), administrative expenses ($3.4 million), plant and equipment ($1.6 million) and expenditure on works undertaken by the Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission ($6.3 million). Also included under this heading is expenditure from the ACT Community Development Fund (estimated at $4.4 million in 1981-82) which provides for the disbursement of funds derived from ACT gambling sources. Included here are the administrative expenses of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Central Office (excluding the working environment and productivity development functions) and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories of the Department of Science and Technology, and certain administrative expenditures of the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Home Affairs and Environment (excluding environmental activities). Also included are expenditures related to the running costs of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The expected increase of $6.8 million over 1980-81 expenditure results mainly from higher salary and allowance costs ($7.8 million), offset by a reduction of $2.9 million in expenditure on the new analytical laboratories at Pymble, construction of which is nearing completion. Construction Services (net) Outlays under this heading provide for the running costs of the construction function of the Department of Housing and Construction, and include salaries and allowances ($100.2 million), administrative expenses ($17.1 million), and consultants fees ($26.3 million). The estimated increase of $24.6 million reflects increases of $11.4 million in salaries and allowances and $5.7 million for new computer equipment together with an increase in consultant costs of $8.5 million required to meet commitments to defence and civil projects under construction, new design projects in 1981-82 and to provide for an increased proportion of the Department's design workload to be placed with consultants. Commonwealth Offices The major components of the 1981-82 estimate are $21.6 million for the construction and $9.3 million for the maintenance of Commonwealth Offices. Significant construction projects, all of which are in the ACT, include the refurbishment of the old Patents Office and the West Block and Administrative Building Offices. The lower provision for 1981-82 reflects the completion in 1980-81 of the McLachlan Offices at Barton and the Benjamin Offices in Belconnen. In addition, as part of its contribution to the International Year of Disabled Persons, the Government has approved a $5 million, three year program to provide signs, improved access and specialised toilet facilities in Commonwealth buildings for disabled persons. The estimated expenditure in 1981-82 is $1.5 million. Printing and Publishing This heading covers the salaries, administrative and plant and equipment expenses of the Commonwealth's printing and publishing activities. The estimated increase of $1.0 million in 1981-82 reflects salary increases and higher postal charges associated with the distribution of Parliamentary and Government pUblications. Property Management and Services Costs associated with the maintenance and security of Commonwealth office accommodation and the property survey program for Commonwealth departments and authorities are included here. Major components of the estimate are salaries and allowances ($23.2 million), contract cleaning ($6.0 million), office services ($13.1 million) and fitting out work in leased office premises ($12.6 million). There is an increase of $4.9 million in the last item mainly attributable to the fitting out costs associated with installation of a major computer for the Australian Taxation Office in Canberra, new premises in Canberra for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the fitting out of Department of Social Security premises for implementation of the Health Care Scheme for People in Special Need and the takeover of Commonwealth Employment Service functions. The preparation of premises in Melbourne for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is also included within this item. Government Purchasing The salaries and allowances of staff of the Purchasing Division of the Department of Administrative Services account for $9.7 million of the estimated expenditure of $10.4 million in 1981-82. Rent This item provides for rental costs for office and other accommodation leased for civil departments. The increase of $9.8 million reflects the full year costs of leases taken up in 1980-81, increased rentals on existing leases and proposed expenditure of $1.4 million on new leases in 1981-82. Publicity Services The 1981-82 estimate for these outlays includes provIsion for the publicity programs undertaken by the Australian Information Service ($6.2 million) and support for Film Australia ($4.5 million). Storage and Transport Services The operation of the Department of Administrative Services vehicle fleet, removal and storage costs associated with the transfer of civilian employees and bulk storage facilities for civilian departments are provided for in this item. The estimate for 1981-82 includes $14.7 million for vehicle purchases (mainly replacement vehicles), which represents a slight decrease on expenditure in 1980-81. Other Included here are the costs of printing Australian Government Gazettes, payments to Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd for food and beverage services provided to departments, and expenditure for the construction of staff housing for Commonwealth public servants in the Northern Territory. NET SUPERANNUATION PAYMENTS NEe This item covers the cost of superannuation benefits payable under the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976 to or in respect of former employees of the Commonwealth (excluding defence personnel and employees covered by arrangements with the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Commissions). In addition, it reflects the cost of benefits paid under the South Australian and Tasmanian superannuation schemes to or in respect of former employees of the South Australian and Tasmanian Railways: this liability was assumed by the Commonwealth under the arrangements for the takeover of railways in those States in 1974-75. The figures shown are net of estimated receipts from Commonwealth authorities as employer contributions towards the accruing cost of superannuation benefits for existing employees or as reimbursement of the employer share of benefits paid to former employees or their dependants. The estimated decrease in net superannuation payments for 1981-82 is due mainly to an increase in the number of Commonwealth authorities making employer superannuation contributions. These additional receipts will be partly offset by the cost of new benefit grants to be made during the year and the cost of pension increases payable from July 1981. In addition, payments for former railway workers in South Australia and Tasmania are estimated to increase by $2.5 million in 1981-82. This heading records various miscellaneous receipts, including administrative charges for work undertaken by the Department of Housing and Construction, rent from Commonwealth property, charges for the hire of computers, audit fees, customs fees; payroll charges and commission and other minor charges. 10. NOT ALLOCATED TO FUNCTION Outlays not allocated to specific functions comprise those payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities which are not elsewhere classified, natural disaster relief, public debt interest payments, and a bulk allowance for prospective increases in wages and salaries of Commonwealth Government employees, other than Defence Service personnel and employees paid from votes included in the Defence function. A. PAYMENTS TO OR FOR THE STATES, THE NORTHERN Outlays under this heading comprise general revenue funds for the States, State Government Loan Council programs, assistance related to State debt, assistance for local government and outlays for natural disaster relief. Similar forms of assistance in respect of the Northern Territory are also included. These payments, which mainly constitute general purpose Commonwealth financial assistance, amount to 70.4 per cent of total Budget funds to be made available to the States in 1981-82 and 80.9 per cent of those to be made available to the Northern Territory. Most specific purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory are not included under this heading, being classified elsewhere in this statement under the relevant functional headings. Details of total payments to the States and the Northern Territory are provided at the end of this section. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Payments to or for the States necGeneral Revenue AssistanceTax Sharing Grants 5415.9 601 I.3 6689.7 + 678.4 Grants in lieu of Health Payments 1130.0 + 1130.0 Special Grants 12.4 6.7 58.5 + 51.8 Repayments 2.5Cr Total 5425.8 6018.0 7878.2 + 1860.2 State Government Loan Council ProgramsCapital Grants 415.0 435.8 4-5.8 Advances 830.0 871.5 871.5.

STATES, THE NORTHERN NEC 7099.9 . 7970.6 9902.3 + 1931.7 The Commonwealth provides general revenue funds to the States for purposes determined by them. A total of $7878.2 million, representing an increase of $1860.2 million or 30.9 per cent compared with 1980-81, is expected to be provided to the States in 1981-82 in this form. Tax Sharing Grants Tax sharing grants make up the bulk of general revenue assistance to the States. From 1959-60 financial assistance grants were determined under a formula which took into account increases in the States' population and in average wages in the economy as a whole, and a further 'betterment' factor. In 1976-77, these arrangements were replaced by a Commonwealth undertaking to provide the States with a fixed percentage of personal income tax collections. Under 'Stage l' of these tax sharing arrangements, the States became entitled to receive: in 1976-77,33.6 per cent of Commonwealth net personal income tax collections (excluding the revenue effects of any special surcharges or rebates applied by the Commonwealth) in that year; in 1977-78, a fixed amount of $4336.1 million; and, in each subsequent year, 39.87 per cent of personal income tax collections in the preceding year. The 'Stage l' arrangements included a 'guarantee' provision to ensure that each State's entitlement in any year would not be less in absolute terms than in the previous year. In the four years 1976-77 to 1979-80, there was a supplementary undertaking (the 'formula guarantee') which ensured that the entitlements in those years would not be less than the amount which would have been yielded by the financial assistance grants formula in force before 1976-77. In anticipation of the expiry of the 'formula guarantee' on 30 June 1980, the Premiers' Conference in December 1979 adopted interim arrangements for the determination of the States' tax sharing entitlements for 1980-81 pending the outcome of it comprehensive review of the tax sharing agreement. These arrangements provided for the tax sharing arrangements to be supplemented by a 'real terms' guarantee. That is, the States were to receive in 1980-81 39.87 per cent of net personal income tax collected in 1979-80, distributed according to existing tax sharing relativities, with the guarantee that each State would receive no less in real terms than in 1979-80. This guarantee was invoked for three States-Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Following the Premiers' Conference of 4 May 1981, held to review tax sharing arrangements, significant changes to these arrangements for the States and the Northern Territory were made in respect of 1981-82 and later years. These changes were embodied in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. As a consequence, States' tax sharing grants for 1981-82-including the additional grants determined at the June Premiers' Conference-are estimated at $6689.7 million, or 11.3 per cent more than they received in 1980-81. This figure comprises: (i) a basic tax sharing grant estimated at $6551.6 million, which is based on the States' share of an amount calculated by increasing the combined (States and Northern Territory) 1980-81 tax sharing entitlement by 9 per cent; (ii) an amount of $69.1 million in respect of certain programs of financial assistance previously provided as specific purpose payments to the States, but in future to be 'absorbed' into general purpose revenue payments; (iii) an amount of $60 million in respect of additional tax sharing grants for 1981-82, to assist States to move towards the new relativities that may ultimately be instituted following full consideration of the Report by the Grants Commission on relativities; and (iv) an amount of $9 million for Queensland to cushion the effect of the estimated change in the grant to that State arising from the use by the Australian Statistician of 'de jure' rather than 'de facto' population estimates. From 1982-83 onwards the States' tax sharing grants, as determined under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981, will be calculated as a fixed percentage of the (relevant) previous year's total tax collections as defined under the Act. The relevant percentage will be derived by taking the finally determined tax sharing grants for 1981-82 (excluding the $9 million described in (iv) above) as a percentage of total tax collections for 1980-81. The only guarantee to apply in respect of tax sharing grants is that a State's grant in anyone year shall be no less than that received in the previous year. The Act provides for a review of these arrangements before 30 June 1985. From 1981-82, Commonwealth assistance in the financing of State hospital systems, community health and school dental services will also be provided by way of general revenue assistance. Details of these arrangements are provided in the following section. Grants in Lieu 0/ Health Payments From1 July 1981, under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will receive a general purpose grant identified for health that will replace separate specific purpose assistance previously provided on a cost-shared basis for hospital operating costs, community health and school dental services. In the case of South Australia and Tasmania, unless these States elect to terminate their Hospital Agreements, which will otherwise expire on 30 June 1985, specific purpose payments for hospitals will continue; however, a separate special health grant under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 will replace the assistance previously given to those States for community health and school dental services. Provision is made for the latter two States to abrogate their Hospital Agreements at any time and accept funding on the same basis as the other States. An estimated $1130 million is payable in 1981-82 as health grants for the six States; a further $20.6 million is provided for the Northern Territory. Entitlements/or Health Grants The States (other than South Australia and Tasmania) and the Northern Territory have entitlements for health grants in 1981-82 that are calculated by increasing the amount of similar assistance for 1980-81 by 10 per cent (to approximate the same real level) and then deducting from the sum an amount equal to 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's assessment of the capacity of a State or the Northern Territory to raise additional hospital revenue in 1981-82 from prescribed charges. For Queensland, an additional $16 million is provided as a once-only cushioning adjustment for 1981-82. Section 12 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 provides for a determination by the Treasurer, after having consulted with the Minister for Health, of the amount of additional revenue that a State could be expected to raise in respect of 1981-82 from public hospital services at charging levels to be specified by regulation for the purposes of the determination under that Section. These four States have a total entitlement for health grants in 1981-82 that is currently estimated at $1116.7 million; the Northern Territory is similarly entitled to an estimated $20.6 million. These estimates are based on a provisional assessment by the Commonwealth of each relevant State's and the Northern Territory's capacity to raise such additional revenue if, from 1 September 1981, it were to make charges for hospital services (other than to eligible pensioners, the disadvantaged as defined and their dependants) at the following levels: $80 per day for shared ward accommodation, $110 per day for private, room accommodation; $15 for each outpatient occasion of service; and average actual bed day costs in the previous year for compensable inpatients. The Commonwealth will review its assessment of the additional revenue from these specified charges towards the end of 1981-82. ' The estimates also reflect the level of hospital cost sharing budgets for 1980-81 in effect at 30 June 1981. A further and final review of 1980-81 cost sharing budgets is expected to be undertaken early in 1981-82 when figures for actual expenditures and revenues relating to recognised hospitals in 1980-81 become available. Some adjustments of health grant entitlements for these four States and the Northern Territory may be necessary in the light of any adjustment of Commonwealth payments under cost sharing for 1980-81. South Australia and Tasmania have, in addition to their entitlements to cost sharing payments. under Section 30 of the Health Insurance Act 1973, entitlements for general purpose financial assistance to replace the specific assistance previously given for the community health program and school dental services in those States. The two States will each receive in 1981-82 payments equivalent to 1.1 times the amount paid to them respectively for community health and school dental services for 1980-81. (In 1981-82 payments are estimated at $13.3 million.) . Health Grantsfor 1982-83 and Later Years Entitlements to grants for 1981-82 are based, inter alia, on existing State /Northern Territory relativities in effect at 30 June 1981 in respect of the.specific purpose health assistance which the grants replace. Recognising that some change to these relativities may be desirable in respect of the additional financial assistance to be provided henceforth in lieu of specific purpose health assistance, the Government has decided it should ask the Commonwealth Grants Commission to undertake an assessment of the distributional factors for the States and the Northern Territory for the purposes of calculating for the years 1982-83 to 1984-85 the distribution of the grants payable under Sections 16 (1), 18 (1) and 18 (2) of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. The States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 provides for an aggregate entitlement for these grants for the three years from 1982-83 to be distributed among the four States and the Northern Territory as prescribed under Section 19. The aggregate entitlement for 1982-83 will be ascertained by deducting from the total of payments to the four States and the Northern Territory as specific purpose assistance for 1980-81 for hospital operating costs, community health and school dental services, after adjustment by a factor based on consumer price index movement from the March quarter 1980 to the March quarter 1982, the amount determined for each State and the Northern Territory under Section 12 to be the amount that the State and the Northern Territory could be expected to raise in respect of 1982-83 from hospital charges at the levels prescribed in the regulations. The aggregate entitlement of the four States and the Northern Territory to grants for 1983-84 and 1984-85 respectively will vary in proportion to the ratio of the total amount of taxes collected by the Commonwealth in the previous year to the total amount of taxes collected by the Commonwealth in the year preceding that. Special Health Grants to South Australia and Tasmania/or 1982-83 and Later Years The amount of special health grants to South Australia and Tasmania after 1981-82 (not including payments for hospital operating costs under Section 30 of the Health Insurance Act 1973) will be separately ildjusted for 1982-83 and later years on a similar basis to the aggregate entitlements of the other four States and the Northern Territory. These two States' entitlements are, however, separately determined under the legislation until 1984-85 and are not, therefore, subject to future determinations on relativities among the other States and the Northern Territory for the health grants .. Conditions Attaching to Health Grants to the States (Other Than South Australia and Tasmania) and the Northern Territory The new health funding arrangements reflect the Commonwealth Government's objectives that: the States, having the constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services, should be able to determine their own priorities for funding the different elements of their health systems; individuals who can afford to pay for their health services should be required to contribute accordingly, either through health insurance or by personal payment; and government assistance should be directed primarily to those in the community who are in genuine need. Commonwealth health funding will therefore be provided from 1 July 1981 (other than for hospitals in South Australia and Tasmania) as additional general purpose financial assistance subject to minimum conditions. At least for the first few years, the additional financial assistance will be identified for health, (although there is no requirement that it be allocated by the States for health purposes), but ultimately the assistance may be absorbed into the tax sharing payments to the States and the Northern Territory. Relevant conditions as prescribed by Section 20 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 require that States (other than South Australia and Tasmania) and the Northern Territory will continue to provide hospital accommodation and services without charge to certain categories of eligible persons within the meaning of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Eligible persons include: pensioners and sickness beneficiaries with Pensioner Health Benefits and Health Benefits cards, and their dependants; migrants and refugees who have been authorised by means of an entry permit ih their travel document to remain indefinitely in Australia, and their dependants, during the first six months of residence; persons receiving unemployment or special benefits who meet the Pensioner Health Benefits income test, and their dependants; and Persons on specified low incomes and their dependants, for example: married couples with an income of less than $160 a week, plus $20 for each child, single parents with one child and with an income of less than $160 a week, plus $20 for each additional child, and single persons with an income of less than $96 a week. The States and the Northern Territory will be free to determine the level and incidence of hospital charges to apply to persons other than those in the prescribed categories above. If South Australia and Tasmania continue with hospital funding under their cost sharing Agreements, it is expected that new arrangements substantially in compliance with the above will be agreed for the purposes of new or modified Hospital Agreements. Special Grants Under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973, the States are entitled to apply for special grants which are paid by the Commonwealth on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Commission has recommended special grants totalling $58.5 million for payment to Queensland in 1981-82. This amount consists of a completion grant of $33.5 million in respect of 1979-80 and an interim grant of $25.0 million in respect of 1980-81. As announced by the Treasurer, it was agreed at the June Premiers' Conference that there will be no application by any State for special grants in respect of 1981-82. Repayments The repayments shown under this heading, which were completed in 1979-80, are in respect of special repayable interest bearing advances which were made to New South Wales in 1971-72 and 1972-73 in the context of arrangements to assist that State to cope with its prospective budget deficit at that time. . The Commonwealth underwrites the State Government Loan Council borrowing program by raising loans on its own account and paying the proceeds to the States from its Budget. At its June 1981 meeting, the Loan Council approved a total State Government program of $1307.2 million for 1981-82, the same amount as in 1980-81. As in recent years, two-thirds of this program will comprise interest-bearing advances and one-third will be by way of interest-free capital grants from the Commonwealth. At its June 1981 meeting, the Loan Council also approved a borrowing program for the larger State semi-government authorities (which is not reflected in the Budget) of $2098.3million for 1981-82-$211.6 million, or 11.2 per cent, greater than in 1980-81. This total includes an amount of $1225 million (the same as in 1980-81) for the basic program of the States' larger semi-government authorities, $66.6 million for special non-infrastructure additions, and $806.7 million for infrastructure borrowing programs. The infrastructure program was introduced in 1978-79 to facilitate borrowings for economically viable projects that have a special significance for national development and are for the provision of services of kinds normally provided by government or public utility enterprises which cannot reasonably be accommodated within the resources made available under 'normal' Loan Council programs, and which require outlays relatively quickly. No borrowings were approved in respect of new infrastructure project proposals and individual States are to determine the allocation of their part of the 1981-82 infrastructure program among projects already approved by Loan Council. Total 1981-82 Budget and off-Budget borrowings, comprising the State Government borrowing program, the borrowing program for State Semi-Government larger authorities, including the infrastructure program (all of which are subject to Loan Council approval), and those expected to be undertaken in 1981-82 by smaller State authorities (which are not subject to Loan Council approval), are summarised in the following table: 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Per cent Loan CouncilBorrowing Programs for State Governments 1245.0 1307.2 1307.2 Borrowing Programs for State SemiGovernmentLarger Authorities (including infrastructure) 1690.0 1886.7 2098.3 +211.6 + 11.2 Smaller Authorities 472.3 526.3 523.2 -3.1 -0.6 Total 3407.3 3720.3 3928.8 +208.5 +5.6 Under the Financial Agreement the Commonwealth is to pay $15.17 million to the States each year until 1985 as a contribution towards interest payable on their debt. The Commonwealth also makes sinking fund contributions under the Agreement in respect of State debt; these payments are estimated at $41.9 million in 1981-82. Under the tax sharing arrangements introduced in 1976-77, the Commonwealth provides funds to the States for general purpose assistance to local government authorities. The assistance is provided as a proportion of Commonwealth net personal income tax collections in the preceding year. The proportion applying from 1976-77 to 1978-79 was 1.52 per cent. This proportion was increased to 1.75 per cent in 1979-80, and to 2 per cent from 1980-81. These grants are estimated to increase by $50.1 million, or 16.6 per cent, to $350.9 million in 1981-82. Under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978, the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory has power, with the assent of the Administrator or the Governor General, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory. Ministers of the Territory have executive authority in respect of specified functions of a State-type nature. An outline of the financial arrangements applying to the Northern Territory is provided in ChapterV of Budget Paper No.7, Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities, 1981-82. Under the Memorandum of Understanding agreed to by both Governments, Commonwealth financial assistance to the Northern Territory has been on a State-type basis since 1979-80. The main payments to be made to the Territory in 1981-82 which are not included under other functional headings are described below: Tax Sharing Grant The bulk of general purpose revenue assistance is provided as a tax sharing grant in a similar manner to arrangements applying in respect of the States. The Territory's grant of $315.1 million in 1981-82 is to be appropriated under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. That amount includes $4 million in lieu of terminated specific purpose programs and is $40.9 million more than the 1980-81 grant. After 1981-82 the Territory's grant will change each year in proportion to changes in the population of the Territory and to changes in total Commonwealth tax collections (as defined in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 )-lagged by one year. Payment in Lieu of Health Grant Under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 the Northern Territory (along with New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) will receive, from 1 July 1981, a general purpose grant that will replace separate specific purpose assistance previously provided on a cost-shared basis for hospital operating costs, community health and school dental services. Details are provided under the functional heading 'Health' and under the heading 'States General Revenue Funds' within this function. Additional Assistance For the six years from 1979-80 the Northern Territory receives either a special grant after consideration of the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, or an additional assistance grant, whichever is the greater. The additional assistance grant is determined by a formula contained in the Memorandum of Understanding and is $20 million for 1981-82. As the special grant recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for 1981-82 was $3.3 million, the additional assistance grant of$20 million will apply. Grant in Lieu of Uranium Royalties The Commonwealth makes a grant to the Northern Territory Government of an amount in lieu of uranium royalties. The payment in 1981-82 is estimated at $1.02 million. Payments in Respect of Recreation Leave and Furlough Entitlements Commonwealth payments to the Territory in lieu of the accrued recreation leave and furlough entitlements of its officers who transferred to the Northern Territory Public Service are estimated at $1.75 million for 1981-82. These payments are made on an emerging cost basis and the 1981-82 provision relates to entitlements of officers who retired or resigned in 1978-79 and 1979-80. General Capital Assistance The Commonwealth provides general purpose capital funds to the Northern Territory. on the same terms and conditions as apply to the State Loan Council programs. One-third of these funds is provided as grants and the remaining two-thirds as advances from the Commonwealth at rates of interest and on similar terms to those applying to the States under the Financial Agreement. The level of general purpose capital assistance to the Territory changes each year in proportion to changes in State Government Loan Council programs, excluding any special additions. The level of assistance may, by agreement, be supplemented by temporary or permanent additions to the Territory program. The Territory's general purpose capital funds are expected to remain the same as in 1980-81 at $114.9 million. Debt Charges Assistance The Northern Territory pays debt charges to the Commonwealth on its general purpose capital advances. These charges are rising rapidly in the early years of self government and the Commonwealth is currently fully funding them by way of annual _ specific purpose payments to the Territory. The Budget provision of $24.5 million is equal to the debt charges estimated to be incurred by the Territory in 1981-82 and is an increase of $12.1 million on the 1980-81 payment. Assistancefor Local Government A specific purpose payment of $1.7 million will be provided to the Northern Territory for distribution as general purpose assistance among local government authorities in the Territory in 1981-82. The payment in 1981-82 represents an increase of over $0.2 million on 1980-81 and is in line with the agreement that annual payments are to vary in proportion to changes in net personal income tax collections (lagged by one year) and changes in the percentage of personal income tax payable to local authorities in the States. Under arrangements introduced in 1978-79, the Commonwealth provides assistance on a $3 Commonwealth to $1 State basis for expenditures by each State (and the Northern Territory) on approved relief and restoration measures in cases of major disasters where such expenditures exceed the annual base amount established for each State in terms of its assessed financial capacity. In addition, the Commonwealth meets half of the cost of assistance provided by the States on approved measures for the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress. A provision of $33.7 million is made for natural disaster relief payments to the States and the Northern Territory in 1981-82. This provision relates to outstanding commitments and continuing assistance in respect of disasters occurring in previous years in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania (particularly the recent drought), and also makes some allowance for likely payments in respect of possible new disasters of which some, on the basis of past experience, can be expeCted to qualify for Commonwealth assistance in 1981-82. Repayments Repayments by the States of advances made for natural disaster relief are estimated at $8.9 million in 1981-82. Commonwealth assistance is provided to the States as interest-free advances in respect of eligible expenditure by the States on those relief measures which take the form of concessional loans to individuals and business enterprises affected by natural disasters. These advances are normally repayable in eight equal annual instalments, with the first instalment due for repayment two years after the end of the financial year in which the advances were made. THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES The payments described above are largely of a 'general purpose'-as distinct from 'specific purpose'-nature. Detailed information on both categories of payments is provided in Budget Paper No 7, Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities, 1981-82. Estimated total Commonwealth payments to the States and the Northern Territory in 1981-82are summarised below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Per cent Payments to or for the States and local authoritiesGeneral Purpose Revenue Funds 5428.3 6018.0 7878.2 + 1860.2 +30.9 General Purpose Capital Funds 1245.0 1307.2 1307.2 Total General Purpose 6673.3 7325.3 9185.5 + 1860.2 +25.4 Specific Purpose AssistanceAssistance Related to State Debt 53.3 55.1 57.1 + 2.0 + 3.6 Education Commissions 2037.5 2288.5 2561.6 + 273.1 +11.9 Housing-Advances 160.0 166.5 138.5 28.0 -16.8 Grants for Rental Housing 100.0 105.5 108.7 + 3.2 + 3.1 Roads 546.0 606.9 662.0 + 55.1 + 9.1 Local Government Tax Sharing 221.7 300.8 350.9 + 50.1 + 16.6 Hospital Cost SharingI 119.2 1273.3 171.3 -I 102.0 86.5 Other 468.4 538.3 427.5 110.8 -20.6 Total Specific Purpose 4706.1 5334.9 4477.6 857.3 -16.1 Total Payments to or for the States II 379.4 12660.2 13663.0 + 1002.8 + 7.9 Payments Direct to Local Authorities 15.9 21.7 30.1 + 8.4 +38.7 Gross Payments from the Budget to the States II 395.3 12681.9 13 693.1 + 1 011.2 + 8.0 Repayments 276.4Cr 314.5Cr 331.1Cr 16.6 5.3 Net Payments to the States and Local Authorities 11118.9 12367.4 13 362.0 + 994.7 + 8.0 Payments to the Northern TerritoryGeneral Purpose Revenue Funds 228.9 295.1 358.5 + 63.4 +21.5 General ,Purpose Capital Funds 107.4 114.9 114.9 Specific Purpose Funds 105.0 144.2 145.9 + 1.6 + l.l Gross Payments from the Budget to the Northern Territory 441.3 554.2 619.2 + 65.0 + 11.7 Repayments 1.9Cr 2.9Cr 4.ICrl.l 37.8 Net Payments from Budget to the Northern Territory 439.4 551.2 615.1 + 63.9 + 11.6 TOT AL NET PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND B. PUBLIC DEBT INTEREST Interest payments from the Budget sector to other sectors are recorded under this heading. Offset against gross interest payments on Commonwealth securities is interest on Commonwealth securities held by the various Commonwealth Government Trust Funds. Public debt interest in 1981-82 is estimated at $2807.7 million, an increase of9.6 per cent on the outcome in 1980-81. As a proportion of total outlays, public debt interest in 1981-82 is estimated at 6.9 per cent compared with 7.1 per cent in 1980-81. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Gross Interest Paid on Commonwealth Securities 2349.3 2714.1 2935.9 + 221.8 Other Interest Payments 9.5 7.8 7.9 Gross Interest Payments 2358.8 2721.9 2943.7 + 221.8 Interest received on Government Securities and Cash Balances held by the Commonwealth Government on its own behalfLoan Consolidation and Investment Reserve 106.5Cr. I 32.0Cr. 110.OCr. + 22.0 Other 29.7Cr. 28.6Cr. 26.0Cr. + 2.6 Gross Interest Paid on Commonwealth Securities Recorded under this heading is interest paid on all Commonwealth securities including Commonwealth Bonds, Australian Savings Bonds, Treasury Notes, Treasury Bills and Income Equalisation Deposits. . The Commonwealth securities in question include those issued on behalf of the States and certain Commonwealth authorities. Reimbursement of interest paid on these Commonwealth securities by the States and the relevant authorities is recorded as receipts under the heading 'Interest, Rent and Dividends' (see Statement No.4). The estimated increase in interest payments in 1981-82 amounts to $221.8 million (8.2 per cent) compared with an increase of $364.8 million (15.5 per cent) recorded in 1980-81. The effect on interest payments in a particular year of securities issued in that year depends in part on the type of security issued and the timing of borrowing within the year. For example, the substantial rise in public debt interest payments in 1980-81 was heavily influenced by the high proportion of financing raised through the sale of Treasury Notes, which are short-term securities issued at a discount and repayable at par, so that the interest cost falls within the financial year of issue. The increase estimated for 1981-82, however, largely reflects the full year impact of the higher rates of interest applying to new raisings in 1980-81. Other Interest Payments The main items under this heading are interest paid by the Commonwealth on trustee moneys lodged with it at call ($7.5 million in 1981-82) and interest payments on borrowings from private lenders by theACT Commissioner for Housing ($004 million). Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve (LCIR) Interest is received by the LCIR on investments in Commonwealth securities which were issued mainly in Special Loans to assist with the financing of State Loan Council programs. These amounts, which represent the receipt of interest by the Commonwealth (through one of its Trust Accounts) from the Commonwealth itself, are offset against gross interest payments, in order to record only public debt interest payments to other sectors. The fall in estimated interest receipts in 1981-82 reflects a reduction in the LCIR portfolio holding of securities. Other This item comprises interest received by other Commonwealth Trust Funds, including the National Debt Sinking Fund, on their investments in Commonwealth Securities. These amounts also are deducted in arriving at public debt interest payments. The estimated decrease in these receipts for 1981-82 principally reflects reduction in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the National Debt Sinking Fund. C. ALLOWANCE FOR PROSPECTIVE WAGE AND SALARY Provision is made for the cost of prospective increases in wage and salary rates during the year by the inclusion of a bulk allowance of $60 million in the 1981-82 Budget estimates. This provision relates to all wage and salary appropriations other than those recorded in the Defence function. A separate allowance is included in the Defence function. Although these bulk allowances are not appropriated at this stage, they are included in the Budget estimates to refle-t prospective calls on the Budget. Appropriations will be supplemented as appropriate in the light of actual wage and salary rate increases. The allowances are necessarily approximate, especially given the additional uncertainty surrounding the future of wage fixation for 1981-82.

TAXAnON MEASURES The table below shows the estimated revenue effects in 1981-82 and in a full year of taxation measures announced both prior to and in the Budget. Most of the pre-Budget measures were foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's Election Policy Speech of 30 September 1980, in the statements by the Treasurer and the Minister for Health to the Parliament on 29 April 1981 , and in the Prime Minister's statement to the Parliament of 30 April 1981 following the Review of Commonwealth Functions.

For those measures that involve accelerated depreciation or the immediate write·off of assets which are otherwise depreciable, the full·year figure shown is the first full·year cost-i.e., the difference between the effects of depreciation of a whole year's expenditure under the old and the new arrange· ments.

(/) First full·year yield with expenditure equal to the estimated 1981-82 level. If annual expenditure remained at that level in subsequent years, the annual yield from the measure would increase from considerably less than $85 million in 1982·83 to approximately $250 million 5 years later. The increases in annual yield would be greater if annual expenditure increased. Rate Scale and Dependant Rebates For purposes of determining the 1981-82 personal income tax rate scale, a halfindexation adjustment of 3.8 per cent has been applied to the 1980-81 rate scale from 1 July 1981. This adjustment has also been applied to various dependant rebates-the rebate for a spouse, housekeeper or daughter-housekeeper has been increased from $800 to $830, the sole parent rebate from $559 to $580, the invalid relative rebate from $362 to $376, and the parent or parent-in-law rebate from $722 to $749. The notional rebates for dependent children which are taken into consideration in calculating zone rebates have been increased from $362 to $376 for each student child and one nonstudent child under 16, and from $272 to $282 for other non-student children under 16. In addition, the separate net income that a taxpayer's dependant may earn before any rebate for that dependant begins to shade out was raised from $272 to $282. The PAYE instalment deductions were adjusted on 1 July 1981 to reflect the increase in the spouse and associated rebates and the indexation adjustment of the rate scale. It was announced on 29 April 1981 that this would be the last indexation adjustment under the existing arrangements. In future, taxation adjustments are to be determined on a discretionary basis having regard to economic conditions. Provisional tax arrangements seek to achieve reasonable consistency between the treatment of PA YE and provisional taxpayers. As in 1980-81, in order to maintain consistency in times of rising incomes, the preceding year's income of taxpayers who do not self-assess will be increased by a standard percentage to obtain a notional current-year income on which calculation of the provisional tax payment is based. Specifically, the 1981-82 rate scale will be applied to 1980-81 incomes increased by 10 per cent while dependant rebates will be allowed at 1981-82 values. Provisional taxpayers, of course, retain the option of self-assessing, ie, of providing an estimate of their income for the current year which is then used in calculating their provisional tax payment. The provisional payment of those who self-assess will be derived by applying 1981-82 rates and rebates to their estimate of 1981-82 income. The rate scale for assessment of 1981-82 income tax is: Total Taxable Income Not less Not more than than Tax at General Rates on Total Taxable Income$ $ I 4195 Nil 4195 17894 Nil+ 32¢ for each $1 in excess of $4 195 17894 35788 $4383.68 + 46¢ for each $1 in excess of$17 894 35788 and over $12614.92 + 60¢ for each $1 in excess of$35 788 Rebatefor the Cost of Basic Health Insurance As announced by the Treasurer and the Minister for Health on 29 April 1981, contributions made after 30 June 1981 in respect of a period of cover after that date to a registered health fund for basic hospital and/or medical insurance for a taxpayer or dependants will qualify for a personal income tax rebate at the standard rate, currently 32 cents in the dollar. This rebate is separate from the general rebate, entitlement to which depends on the total of various classes of private expenditure, including net payments for medical and hospital expenses, exceeding $1590. Thus, a taxpayer may receive the new rebate even if he or she is not entitled to a general rebate. The benefit of the health insurance rebate will generally be received on assessment and the estimated revenue impact of this new concession in 1981-82 is, therefore, only $10 million. Home Insulation Expenses As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister on 30 September 1980, a deduction is allowable to certain taxpayers (including single taxpayers) for the cost of purchase and installation of materials principally for the thermal insulation of a home which is purchased under a contract entered into (or construction of which started) on or after 1 October 1980 and which is, or is intended to be, the sole or principal, and the first, home in Australia of the taxpayer or spouse. Gifts In the 1980-81 Budget Speech, the Treasurer announced a decision in principle to introduce a scheme authorising income tax deductions in respect of gifts to certain public funds maintained by eligible organisations for the assistance of persons in developing countries. Twenty two organisations, named by the Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 18 September 1980, currently qualify as eligible organisations, and gifts after that date to eligible public funds of those organisations are deductible. Other categories of gifts which have been included in the income tax gift provisions since the last Budget are: gifts made after 23 December 1980 toa public fund that is established and main"" tained exclusively for the purpose of providing religious instruction in government schools in Australia (this has the effect of placing on a general basis an earlier more limited concession); gifts made after 16 January 1981 to the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation; gifts made during the financial year ending 30 June 1981 to any public fund set up in Australia exclusively for the relief of persons affected by the November 1980 Italian earthquake; gifts made on or after 1 July 1981 to the Victorian Arts Centre Trust; and gifts made during the 1981-82 financ.ial year to the relevant committee appointed by the Commonwealth or a State or Territory Government for the purposes of observance of the International Year of Disabled Persons. Taxation ofSubsidised EmployeeHousing The Treasurer announced on 25 September 1980 and 13 October 1980 that legislation is to be introduced, effective from the beginning of the 1977-78 income year, to provide that the value of subsidised housing accommodation provided by employers to employees who reside and work in areas that are not in or adjacent to major population centres is to be assessable for income tax at 10 per cent of its free-market rental value, less the rent actually paid by the employee. This basis of valuation is to apply where employees are engaged in an occupation in which it has been customary and necessary for the employer to provide housing accommodation. Depreciation of Primary Producers' PlantA special depreciation allowance (20 per cent a year over 5 years, beginning in the first year of use of the plant) is available in respect of new plant contracted for on or after 1 October 1980 which is used exclusively in agricultural or pastoral pursuits or forestry operations. New fishing vessels, fishing equipment and shore-based plant that is used exclusively in fishing operations also qualify. Soil Conservation Expenditure An immediate deduction is allowable in the year of expenditure for the capital cost of a wide range of soil conservation measures contracted for on or after 1 October 1980 on land in Australia that is used for primary production. Mains Electricity Connection A deduction is allowable for expenditure of a capital nature incurred on or after 1 October 1980 for connection of mains electricity to a property on which a business is carried on and for upgrading existing connections to such a property. The deduction applies whether the expenditure is directly for the work or represents a contribution towards costs of a project involving connections to a number of properties. Expenditure by the owner of' the land, a lessee, a tenant or other person (including a sharefarmer) having an interest in the land may gl,1alify for the deduction. Storage Facilitiesfor Petroleum FuelA deduction, by way of a 100 per cent depreciation allowance, .is allowable for the cost of eligible new and second-hand facilities contracted for on or after 1 October 1980 that are for use wholly and exclusively for the storage of petroleum-based liquid or gaseous fuel held for use in a business as fuel or as trading stock for disposal. The deduction is allowable in the year of income in which the facilities are first used or held ready for use. Investment Allowance The general exclusion from the investment allowance of plant used for purposes of amusement and recreation, including plant for use in connection with sport, gaming or gambling and public entertainment, has been removed in respect of plant expenditure contracted for on or after 1 October 1980. A related exclusion of expenditure on plumbing fixtures and fittings associated with the provision of recreational facilities has also been removed. A further change enables entitlement to an investment allowance for tourist buses, this change being effective from the commencement of the investment allowance on 1 January 1976. Film Industry Incentives A deduction equal to 150 per cent of the amount of capital moneys invested by a resident of Australia in or by way of contribution to the production of a qualifying Australian film may be allowable where the expenditure is made under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980. An exemption of net receipts from an eligible film may also apply, up to an amount equal to 50 per cent of the taxpayer's capital investment in the film. For expenditure under a contract entered into on or before 27 May 1981, the deduction is available in the year of expenditure by the taxpayer. Expenditure under subsequent contracts is deductible in the year in which the film has been both completed and used in the production of assessable income. Investment Allowancefor Certain New Plant In respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 May 1981 on the acquisition or construction of eligible plant, the rate of investment allowance has been reduced from 20 per cent to 18 per cent, except where the expenditure was incurred under a contract entered into before 1 May 1981. Depreciation Loading The 20 per cent increase in scheduled rates of depreciation announced in the 1980-81 Budget has been reduced to 18 per cent for plant contracted for on or after 1 May 1981. Deductionsfor Costs of Converting Oilor LPG-Fired Plant The cost of a conversion of certain oilor LPG-fired plant to operate on alternative energy sources if contracted for on or after 1 May 1981 will be deductible in two instalments: 50 per cent of the cost in the year in which the expenditure is incurred, and the remaining 50 per cent in the succeeding year. For conversions contracted for before 1 May 1981, immediate deductibility continues to apply. Capital Subscribed to Petroleum Exploration or Mining Companies The rebate available in respect of moneys paid on shares by a taxpayer to an eligible petroleum exploration or mining company has been reduced from 30 per cent to 27 per cent in respect of inoneys paid on or after 1 May 1981, unless the moneys were paid in respect of calls made before 1 May 1981 in respect of shares owned by the taxpayer at 30 April 1981, in which event the 30 per cent rate applies. Capital Expenditure on the Development of a Mine or Oil Field Deductions in respect of allowable capital expenditure incurred under a contract entered into on or after 1 May 1981 for the development of a mine or oil field were to be calculated by reference to the lesser of the estimated life of the mine or field or 6 years (instead of 5 years). (See also Budget measures.) Australian Capital Territory Payroll Tax The maximum level of the exemption from payroll tax in the A.CT. was increased from $72 000 per annum to $80 400 per annum, with effect from 1 January 1981, thus providing an exemption for A.C.T. employers with payrolls below $76 200 in 1980-81. The maximum exemption allowable ($6700 in monthly returns) is reduced at the rate of $2 for every $3 by which wages exceed the maximum. There is no exemption if the monthly payroll is $16750 or more. Tax Avoidance On 27 May 1981, the Government announced the introduction of new general antiavoidance provisions to replace section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The new provisions are designed to operate against schemes of a blatant, artificial or contrived kind and to have an impact in respect of both domestic and international transactions. The provisions have now been enacted and apply in relation to schemes entered into after 27 May 1981. At the same time, the Government also announced details of amendments which are to be made to tighten section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the provision which deals generally with avoidance in international business transactions, including shifting income abroad by means of transfer pricing. Those amendments will apply in relation to income derived and expenses incurred after 27 May 1981. In addition, the Government has continued its program of legislative action against specific tax avoidance schemes as they have been identified. Zone Allowances Following its consideration of the Report of the Public Inquiry into Income Tax Zone Allowances, the Government has decided that new arrangements will apply from 1 November 1981, including the following: The basic allowances for both ZoneA and ZoneB will remain at their present levels of $216 and $36, respectively, while the proportion of the allowance related to dependants will increase from 25 per cent to 50 per .cent for ZoneA and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for Zone B. The external territories are to be excluded from the zone allowance arrangements and section 79B of the Income Tax Assessment Act which provides a rebate equivalent to the zone rebate to certain members of the defence forces serving overseas will be rescinded . The existing eligibility test is to be modified so that persons who reside in a zone for more than one-half of a calendar year but who at present do not satisfy the test in relation to an income year receive an allowance. Further details of certain other changes to the zone rebate arrangements will be announced shortly. Depreciation of Basic Iron and Steel Plant Special rates of depreciation will be available for plant used to produce basic iron and steel and first ordered under a contract entered into after 18 August 1981. The rate for eligible plant currently with a write-off period for taxation purposes of 5 years or more will be 20 per cent of the capital cost of the plant. For eligible plant currently with a write-off period of less than 5 years, the allowance will be 33t per cent. The special rates will apply until 30 June 1991. Further details will be provided at a later date. Capital Expenditure on the Development of a Mine or Oil Field Deductions in respect of allowable capital expenditure incurred in respect of the development of a mining property or an oil field are calculated at present by reference to the lesser of the estimated life. of the mine or field or 6 years. Under new arrangements to be introduced, annual deductions in respect of allowable capital expenditures are to be calculated by reference to the lesser of the estimated life of the mine or field or 10 years. The new arrangements are to apply in respect of capital expenditures incurred after 18 August 1981, unless contracted for on or before that date or, in respect of property constructed by the taxpayer, unless construction commenced on or before that date. Friendly Society Dispensaries Amendments are to be made to the income tax provisions which set the taxable income of friendly society dispensaries at a fixed percentage of certain gross receipts. Under the new arrangements, a friendly society dispensary will be assessed on the net profit attributable to: all amounts received from the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits; proceeds from the sale or supply to persons who are not members of the friendly society dispensary of pharmaceutical products, including those coming under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and other goods; and its investment income. The new arrangements will first apply to assessments of income derived by friendly society dispensaries in the 1982-83 income year. The rate of tax applicable will be the standard company rate which also applies to non-profit companies generally. Coal Export Duty The coal export duty at present applies only to coking coal, at rates of duty of either $3.50 per tonne or $1.00 per tonne. The higher rate applies to high-quality coking coal mined by open-cut methods at depths of less than 60 metres from collieries operating before 30 June 1980. The lower rate applies to the remaining exports of coking coal ie, other-quality coking coal and high-quality coking coal from underground mines, from open-cut mines at depths greater than 60 metres, and from open-cut mines that commenced production after 30 June 1980. These rates of duty will continue to apply to exports of coking coal. In addition exports after 8.00 pm on 18 August 1981 of black coal not at present subject to duty will also be dutiable at the rate of $1.00 per tonne. Sales Tax Each of the three existing rates of sales tax will be increased by 2t percentage points in relation to goods passing the taxing point (generally, the sale by a wholesaler to a retailer) after 18 August 1981. The 2t per cent rate will thus become 5 per cent; the 15 per cent rate, 17t per cent; and the 27+ per cent rate, 30 per cent. Various anomalies and inconsistencies in the sales tax law are to be corrected. These changes will apply to goods in the categories affected that pass the taxing point after 18 August 1981. Their effects will be to subject to tax some goods that are now exempt, to increase the rate of tax on certain other goods, and to exempt from tax yet other goods that are now taxable. They are summarised in Appendix III to this Statement. Under legislation to be introduced in the Budget Sittings, certain other categories of goods that are now exempt (but not because of anomalies and inconsistencies) will also be subjected to tax at a rate of 2t per cent, where they pass the taxing point on or after 1 January 1982. In summary only, and subject to maintenance of overriding exemptions applicable to particular industries and organisations (including Governments), the goods affected will include: clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester, etc.; building materials; books, magazines, newspapers; packaging and wrapping materials; hand tools; and a range of other goods not including food, medicines or wine. Stamp Duties in the Australian Capital Territory It is proposed to bring the levels and range of A.C.T. stamp duties more into line with those of the States. Most of the A.C.T. stamp duty rates have not been changed since they were introduced in 1969. This move wm place the A.C.T. more on a par with the States in this respect and will also help to reduce the avoidance of stamp duties imposed by the States. Increases in the current rates of A.C.T. stamp duty will apply after 18 August 1981 in respect of cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes, general insurance, the conveyance of land and the grant or assignment of a lease. In addition, new stamp duties will be imposed from 1 October 1981 on new life insurance policies effected in the A.C.T. and on new and transferred A.C.T. motor vehicle registrations. Departure TaxA departure tax of $10 is currently payable by persons 18 years and over on leaving Australia for destinations other than Australian overseas territories. The rate of the tax is to be increased to $20 and the taxable age lowered to 12 years. Both of these changes will take effect from 1 October 1981. Radio and Television Station Licence Fees Each radio and television station pays an annual licence fee presently comprising a base amount of $200 plus an amount calculated by applying a progressive rate scale to gross earnings of the previous year. Under revised arrangements to apply from 1 September 1981, the base amount of $200 is to be abolished and the annual fee calculated by applying to gross earnings a more progressive rate scale, with the effect that a lesser annual fee will be payable by those stations with gross earnings somewhat below $2.5 million. It has also been decided to increase the amount payable on the issue of new licences from $200 to $500 for new licences issued after 1 September 1981. Passport Fees The Government has decided that the fee charged for the issue of a passport will increase from $25 to $30 after 18 August 1981. The requirement for passports was extended to apply to trans-Tasman travel with effect from 1 July 1981, for other than revenue purposes. The following table compares estimated receipts in 1981-82 with actual receipts in 1980-81. Comparisons between the Budget estimate for 1980-81 and the outcome for that year are provided in Statement No 5. Figures for the years since 1971-72 are shown in Table6 of Statement No 6. 1980-81 Change on 1981-82 Budget Receipts Actual 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 $ million per cent $ million $ million per cent Taxation RevenueCustoms DutyImports 1799.5 + 17.0 1995.0 + 195.5 +10.9 Coal Exports 84.9 6.4 115.0 + 30.1 +35.5 Excise DutyCrude Oil and LPG 3107.9 + 36.9 3440.0 + 332.1 + 10.7 All Other 2725.3 + l.l 2810.0 + 84.7 + 3.1 Sales Tax 2102.3 + 12.7 2913.0 + 810.7 +38.6 Income TaxIndividualsGrossPAYE 15290.8 + 15.1 18640.0 + 3349.2 +2I.9 RefundsI 110.2Dr 3.8 1 385.0Dr 214.8 18.4 NetPAYE 14120.7 + 16.1 17255.0 + 3134.3 +22.2 Other 3422.6 + 18.8 3605.0 + 182.4 + 5.3 Total Income TaxIndividuals 17543.3 + 16.6 20860.0 + 3316.7 + 18.9 Companies 4694.7 + 37.8 5170.0 + 475.3 +10.1 Withholding Tax 161.0 + 14.1 175.0 + 14.0 + 8.7 Payroll Tax 17.0 + 8.3 17.0 Departure Tax 18.7 + 1.6 34.0 + 15.3 +81.7 Estate Duty 17.1 64.7 8.0 9.1 53.2 Gift Duty O.IDr 120.0 I.3 + 1.4 n.a.

TAXA TION REVENUE After taking account of Budget and other measures, total taxation revenue in 1981-82 is estimated to increase by 16.3 per cent, to $37768 million. Brief comments on the main components follow. Customs Duty (a) Imports Collections of customs duty on imports are estimated to increase by $196 million or 10.9 per cent in 1981-82, compared with 17.0 per cent in 1980-81. The slower growth rate reflects an estimate that the rate of increase in imports will slow down. (b) Coal Exports '"" Receipts from duties on exports of coal are estimated at $115 million in 1981-82 which includes $10 million in respect of coal not previously subject to the duty. The estimate assumes an increase in export t<;mnage of 17 per cynt in 1981-82 which reflects an expected expansion of the industry, including new projects and the recovery in exports from the effects of strikes in Queensland and New South Wales in 1980-8l. Excise Duty Total collections of excise duty are estimated at $6250 million in 1981-82, an increase of 7 per cent compared with an increase of 17 per cent in 1980-81. The main components are as follows: 1980-81 Change on 1981-82 Preliminary 1979-80 Estimate Change on 1980-81 $ million percent $ million $ million per cent Beer 991 -I 1015 24 2 Potable spirits III II 125 14 13 Tobacco products 704 I 719 15 2 Petroleum products 925 2 956 31 3 Crude oil 3019 36 3357 338 II LPG 89 107 83 -6 -7 Other (inel credits) -6 13 -5 I 17 (a) Crude Oil and LPG Duties Total receipts from these sources are estimated to increase by 10.7 per cent in 1981-82, compared with 36.9 per cent in 1980-81. The estimate for the crude oi/levy assumes the maintenance throughout 1981-82 of the import parity prices applicable since 1 July 1981, namely $30.79 per barrel for Bass Strait oil, $31.04 per barrel for Barrow Island oil and $31.98 per barrel for Moonie oil. The weighted average of these prices is 7 per cent higher than that in 1980-81, compared with a rise of nearly 35 per cent in that year. The projected rise of $338 million in the excise on crude oil is less than half the increase of $792 million in 1980-81 and reflects the slower growth in import parity prices for crude oil, only partly offset by a forecast rise in 1981-82 of over 5 per cent in excisable production. Receipts from the duty on naturally occurring LPG are estimated to fall slightly. The levy rate applying from 1 July 1981 was set at the equivalent of $69.26 per tonne, which is about 9 per cent below the average levy rate of $75.73 per tonne applying in 1980-81; the reduction reflects a decline in LPG prices. It is assumed that the lower levy rate will prevail throughout 1981-82 and that production will be at about the same level as in 1980-81. (b) Other Duties Revenue from excise duties other than on crude oil and LPG is estimated to increase by $85 million or 3.1 per cent in 1981-82, compared with an increase of 1.1 per cent in 1980-81. Against a background of continuing growth in real disposable incomes, the estima-es for excise revenue from alcohol assume a continuation of the strong recovery in clearances of potable spirits recorded in 1980-81 and moderate growth (2 per cent) in clearances of beer, compared with a decline in 1980-81. Over the 10 years to 1979-80 wine, which is not taxed, has increased its share of the alcoholic beverage market (measured in terms of alcohol content) from around 17 per cent to 27 per cent, although the slowing in growth in dry white wine sales in 1980-81 suggests that the rapid penetration of the market from that source may be slowing down. Clearances of tobacco products in 1981-82 are estimated to increase a little faster than in 1980-81, with the effect on demand of an estimated further decline in the real price of cigarettes being tempered by some hardening of community attitudes towards smoking. The estimated increase in total excise revenue from petroleum products assumes that demand for all products will be stronger in 1981-82 than in 1980-81. This assumption reflects the continuing firm growth forecast in economic activity and smaller price increases than in 1980-81. Rates of duty for the main items subject to excise are shown in the following table: Rates of Excise Duty: 18 August 1981 $ Beer(a) (per litre) . . . . . . 0.52 Potable spirits (per litre of alcohol)Brandy(b) ...... . 16.00 General rate For other spirits(a) 18.75 Spirits nei and liqueurs nei(a) . 19.25 Tobacco products(a) (per kilogram)Cigarettes . . . . . . . . 24.75 Cigars. . . . . . . . . 21.12 ManuFactured tobacco 12.58 Petroleum products(c) (per litre)Motor spirit 0.05155 Diesel Fuel ..... 0.05155 Aviation gasoline 0.04555 Aviation turbine Fuel 0.0419 Crude oil (d) (per kilolitre)Fields producing less than 2 million barrels per year 18.90 Barrow Island-parity-related oil: 2-15 million barrels per year 100.51 Barrow Island-controlled-price oil 175.71 Bass Strait-parity-related oil: 2-15 million barrels per year 99.73 15 million barrels per year or more 117.88 Bass Strait-controlled-price oil .. 177.53 Liquefied petroleum gas (e) (per kilolitre)Fields on stream beFore 17 August 1977 37.07 Fields on stream on or after 17 August 1977 nil (a) Rate has applied since 15 August 1978.

Sales Tax Revenue from sales tax in 1981-82 is estimated at $2913 million, an increase of 38.6 per cent, compared with growth of 12.7 per cent in 1980-81. Private consumption expenditure is forecast to increase by almost 14 per cent in 1981-82 and, in the absence of the measures annouriced in the Budget Speech, it is estimated that collections would have risen by 12.3 per cent. Estimated sales tax collections in respect of goods,-ithin the specified rate classes after the Budget measures and percentage increases by rate class for 1980-81 and 1981-82 are set out in the following table: 1980-81 Change on 1981-82 Change on Rate Class(a) Estimate 1979-80 Estimate 1980-81 $ million percent '$million per cent 2t per cent (previously exempt) n.a. 132 n.a. 5 per cent (previously 2t per cent) 78 16.4 150 92.3 17t per cent (previously IS per cent) 1636 12.2 2131 30.3 30 per cent (previously 27t per cent) 388 14.1 500 28.9 n.a. not applicable (a) In summary only, and subject to maintenance of overriding exemptions applicable to particular industries and organisations (including Governments), the goods covered by the new 2t per cent rate will include: clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings,manchester, etc; building materials; books, magazines, newspapers; packaging and wrapping materials; hand tools; and a range of other goods not including food, medicines or wine. Examples of goods covered by the other new rates include: . . 5 per cent rate: furniture, lIoor coverings, refrigerators and freezers, mattresses and pillows; 17t per cent rate: motor cars, commercial motor vehicles, soft drinks, stationery, potable spirits, boats and yachts; 30 per cent rate: cameras, radio and TV receivers, Furs and Fur garments, jewellery, gold and silverware, cosmetics, combs and hairbrushes, Fountain pens, ball point pens and propelling pencils. Income Tax-Individuals It is estimated that collections of income tax from individuals will increase by 18.9 per cent in 1981-82. This total comprises components which are based mainly on taxable incomes in 1980-81 (PA YE refunds and collections from other individuals), as well as gross PA YE collections which relate to earnings during 1981-82. (a) PAYE Instalment Deductions Gross PAYE receipts are estimated to increase by 21.9 per cent in 1981-82, compared with 15.1 per cent in 1980-81 and 16.2 per cent in 1979-80. The 1981-82 estimate is based on assumed increases of 13+ per cent in average weekly earnings and 2 per cent in wage and salary earner employment; these increases are similar to those estimated for 1980-81, so that total income subject to tax instalment deductions is expected to increase at much the same rate in both years. The stronger growth in revenue estimated for 1981-82 is accounted for largely by factors which affected growth between 1979-80 and 1980-81: namely, the reduction in the standard rate from the average of 33.07 per cent which applied in 1979-80 to 32 per cent in 1980-81, and the substantial increases in rebates for spouses, sole parents, etc in 1980-81. Those changes were in addition to the indexation of the rate scale by 3.8 per cent in 1980-81. The rate scale and rebates have also been indexed by 3.8 per cent in 1981-82; it is estimated that, in the absence of this half indexation, gross PA YE receipts would have increased by 24.6 per cent in 1981-82. (b) PAYE Refunds Refunds in 1981-82, which are in respect of tax assessed in 1981-82 on 1980-81 incomes, are estimated to increase by 18.4 per cent compared with an increase of 3.8 per cent in 1980-81. PAYE refunds in 1980-81 declined as a proportion of gross collections in the previous year. The estimated strong growth in 1981-82 reflects an assumed rise in this ratio in 1981-82 mainly because of the substantial increase in the spouse and other rebates allowable in respect of 1980-81 taxable income; some taxpayers choose to receive their rebate by way of a higher annual refund rather than by way of reduced instalment deductions during the course of the year and, in such cases, there will be a significant increase in the size of the refund payable. (c) Other Individuals Receipts from other individuals are estimated to increase by 5.3 per cent in 1981-82, compared with an increase of 18.8 per cent in 1980-81. The provisional tax component of this estimate was calculated by applying the 1981-82 rate scale to the estimated income of provisional taxpayers in 1980-81 increased by a loading of 10 per cent. Reflecting 1980-81 experience, the estimate includes a specific allowance of $220 million for revenue shortfalls attributable to tax avoidance practices. Several factors contribute to the slower growth in estimated receipts from other individuals in 1981-82, including: the full-year effect of 1980-81 Budget and post-Budget measures offset in part by measures arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions-the net effect of all these measures is an estimated reduction in receipts by $160 million in 1981-82, with about half of this amount being accounted for by the revised provisions in respect of superannuation for self-employed persons and employees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements; an estimated decline of about 5 per cent in primary producer income in 1980-81, the impact of which is magnified under the provisional tax system because many primary producer taxpayers will be entitled to credits in respect of provisional tax paid in 1980-81 based on higher 1979-80 income increased by 7.5 per cent, while provisional tax payable in respect of 1981-82 will be based on a lower 1980-81 income increased by 10 per cent; tax payable by primary producers (on current year assessments) is estimated to decline from $703 million in 1980-81 to $533 million in 1981-82; and forecast slower growth in other business income in 1980-81, on which 1981-82 collections are based, than that estimated for wage and salary income. ' Income Tax-Companies Company tax collections are estimated to increase by 10.1 per cent in 1981-82, compared with an increase of 37.8 per cent in 1980-81. The estimate includes a specific allowance of $80 million for revenue shortfalls due to tax avoidance. The exceptionally strong growth in collections in 1980-81 was associated with a marked and general improvement in company incomes in the 1979-80 income year and certain changes in tax provisions, notably the abolition of the trading stock valuation adjustment and the phasing down of the investment allowance, both of which added to taxable company income. In respect of the 1980-81 income year (the base for tax collections in 1981-82) the situation is somewhat different. First, although company assessable incomes increased in 1980-81, present estimates suggest that the increase was considerably less than in 1979-80. Second, there was no boost to taxable company income in 1980-81 of the kind which occurred in 1979-80 as a result of changed tax provisions. Departure Tax Collections from the departure tax are estimated at $34 million, $15.3 million or 82per cent more than in 1980-81. The increase results from the decisions to increase the rate of tax from $10 to $20 per passenger and to lower the taxable age from 18 to 12 years, both with effect from 1 October 1981. Estate Duty Collections are expected to decline by $9.1 million to $8 million. in 1981-82. The continuing decline refiectB lagged payments following the phased abolition of estate duty, with partial effect from 21 November 1977 and total abolition from 1 July 1979. Gift Duty Gift duty has been phased out in parallel with estate duty, with complete abolition from 1 July 1979. The estimate of $1.3 million in 1981-82 refiects an allowance for collections in respect of tax a voidance schemes that are in· dispute before the Courts. Other Taxes, Fees and Fines Estimates for the major items of other taxes, fees and fines are shown in the followingtable: 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Broadcasting and TV station licence fees 18.1 21.5 31.5 +10.0 Radio communication licence fees 12.5 11.3 14.9 + 3.6 Unfunded employees retirement contributions 67.1 72.9 72.3 0.7 Stevedoring industry collections 20.1 19,5 21.0 + 1.5 A.C.T -taxes and charges 30.1 35.3 43.3 + 8.0 Passport fees 11.2 11.7 17.6 + 5.9 Quarantine charges 2.9 3.9 4.3 + 0.4 Other 8.3 11.9 11.6 0.4 A new formula for calculating radio and television station licence fees is to come into effect on 1 September 1981. The estimated increase of $10.0 million in revenues from these fees in 1981-82 refiects the effect of both the new formula ($5.0 million) and the higher average gross earnings of stations in 1980-81 on which fees payable in 1981-82 are based ($5.0 million). Revenues from radiocommunication licence fees are expected to increase by $3.6 million to $14.9 million in 1981-82. Fees for users of the radio frequency spectrum were increased with effect from 1 July 1981. The new fee scale maintains the parity of particular fees with the estimated costs of administration attributable to specific categories of users. In addition, Commonwealth users of the radio frequency spectrum are now subject to equivalent fees or charges. Included in the 1981-82 estimate of unfunded employees retirement contributions are contributions paid during the year by Parliamentarians ($0.8 million) and Service personnel ($59.0 million) to their superannuation schemes. The remainder of this item comprises net amounts retained by the Commonwealth in respect of retiring Commonwealth employees who opt for a contributor-financed pension in lieu of a refund of their accumulated contributions to the Superannuation Fund. Stevedoring industry collections from levies on employers of waterside workers are expected to increase slightly in 1981-82. A matching outlay is made to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (under the functional heading 'Labour and Employment' in Statement No.3), which is responsible for making certain payments in respect of waterside workers (mainly for retirement benefits). Included in estimated 1981-82 revenues from taxes and charges in the Australian Capital Territory are estimates for general rates ($22.0 million), motor vehicle registration and drivers' licences ($8.7 million), imposts on gambling ($4.4 million), liquor lic-nces ($3.2 million) and fines for parking infringements ($1.6 million). The increase in estimated receipts for 1981-82 reflects increases in A.C.T. general rates and in the level of fines charged for parking offences. The substantial increase in estimated revenue from passport fees reflects the Government's decision to increase the fee from $25 to $30 per person with effect after 18 August 1981, and the expected increase in passport issues following the Government's decision to require passports for trans-Tasman travel. Quarantine charges are levied mainly in respect of animal and plant imports and for the disposal of waste from aircraft and ships. The Government has decided to increase these charges progressively to achieve full recovery of direct operating costs by 1 September 1983. Charges will then be adjusted annually in line with movements in direct operating costs. The 'Other' category includes estimated 1981-82 revenues from the diesel fuel tax ($2.2 million), bankruptcy charges ($3.8 million), and from the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Office ($1.5 million). Also included in this category are estimated revenues from the oil pollution levy. The National Plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil is to be extended in 1981-82; to facilitate this extension the levy has been increased from 0.8 cents to 2 cents per net registered ton per quarter with effect from 1 July 1981. The levy is estimated to provide revenue of $1.2 million in 1981-82 compared to $0.5 million in 1980-81. Interest, Rent and Dividends Included under this heading are interest received by the Commonwealth Government from sources outside the Budget sector, land rents collected in the A.C.T., dividends received from Government-owned companies other than financial enterprises and net amounts available from offshore petroleum royalties. Details are set out below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Interest receivedFrom the StatesOn advances ror State works and housing programs 1088.7 1258.3 1485.5 +227.2 On specific purpose and special advancesHousing agreements 176.0 182.4 188.1 + 5.8 Other 98.2 104.8 100.8 4.0 Total 1362.9 1545.5 1774.4 +228.9 Other interest receiptsFrom the TerritoriesHousing 27.4 30.6 30.0 0.6 Other 9.2 19.0 30.1 + 11.1 Derence Service Homes 76.8 82.5 93.4 + 10.9 Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority 47.2 49.5 54.8 + 5.3 Pipeline Authority 27.2 29.0 31.0 + 2.0 Australian Shipping Commission 18.2 16.0 17.2 + 1.1 Postal Commission 2.9 2.1 2.8 + 0.7 Telecommunications Commission 325.2 328.5 395.0 + 66.5 Qantas Airways Ltd 8.0 5.1 3.2 1.9 Australian National Airlines Commission 4.5 1.3 1.0 0.3 Australian Industry Development Corporation 5.7 3.1 3.1 Australian National Railways Commission 4.2 4.2 4.2 Other 37.6 33.3 63.0 + 29.7 Total 594.1 604.2 728.9 + 124.6 Total Interest ReceiptsI 957.1 2149.7 2503.3 +353.6 Rent, dividends, etc Offshore petroleum royalties (net) 43.3 54.6 60.8 + 6.2 Overseas Telecommunications Commission 20.0 25.0 20.0 5.0 Australian National Airlines Commission 6.0 2.2 2.2 Land leases-A.C.T. 3.6 5.6 4.4 1.2 Other 2.1 5.0 5.3 + 0.3 Total 75.0 92.4 92.7 + 0.3 The estimated increase in 1981-82 in interest received on advances for State Loan Council works and housing programs reflects the continuing growth in outstanding advances and the rise in the level of interest rates applying to new raisings for State works. The expected increase of $1.7 million in interest received on specific purpose and special advances reflects growth in the level of advances outstanding for housing offset by a number of reductions in amounts outstanding of other advances. Other interest receipts are expected to increase substantially by $124.6 million to $728.9 million in 1981-82; the main contributing factors are: The Northern Territory Government has received general purpose capital advances from the Commonwealth -ince 1979-80. The expected rise of $1O.5million in interest receipts from the Territories is mainly due to the continuing growth in the level of outstanding general purpose advances to the Northern Territory. (Arrangements in respect of these debt charges are summarised in Statement No.3, under 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'.) The increase of $10.9 million in 1981-82 in estimated interest receipts from the Defence Service Homes Corporation is attributable to interest charges on new capital advances the Corporation is expected to receive in 1981-82, and the continuation of the progressive conversion of the Corporation's existing debt to reflect current rates of interest more closely . Under provisions in the Telecommunications Act 1975 and the Postal Services Act 1975, the Government has decided to increase to 10 per cent the average rates of interest payable by the Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom) and the Australian Postal Commission (Australia Post) in 1981-82 on the outstanding value of capital advances from the Commonwealth which were vested in these authorities when they were established in 1975. The new interest rates will take effect on 1 January 1982, and are estimated to yield an additional $60 million in 1981-82. In addition, the Government has decided to change the terms and conditions relating to the repayment of these outstanding capital advances, with a view to ensuring that, in future, they will more closely reflect prevailing financial conditions. This will involve a shortening of the overall debt profiles, with one-tenth of the total debt outstanding being converted in each successive ye-r (commencing in 1982-83) at the public semi-government rate of interest applying on 1 January prior to the date of conversion. Included in the estimate of 'Other' for 1981-82 are expected interest receipts of $32.3 million (compared with $0.3 million in 1980-81) from a United States Federal Reserve trust account which holds Australian funds required to meet payments to contractors for the supply of military equipment under United States Government Foreign Military Sales arrangements. The large increase in 1981-82 reflects the first full year of operation of the arrangements. Also included in 'Other' is interest received on investments (other than in Commonwealth securities) by a number of primary industry trust accounts, which is expected to increase from $4.2 million in 1980-81 to $5.4 million in 1981-82. In total, receipts from rent, dividends. etc. are expected to increase slightly by $0.3 million to $92.7 million in 1981-82. The estimated net increase of $6.2 million in offshore petroleum royalties reflects the highey; average returns producers are expected to receive in 1981-82 from domestic oil production. To date, offshore petroleum royalties and permit and licence fees have been collected by the States. In respect of Bass Strait production, a proportion of the relevant royalties (about one-third) collected each year by Victoria has been transferred to the Commonwealth. Following the High Court decision to uphold the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973, legislation governing the collection of these revenues has been amended. Under arrangements now expected to commence on 1 January 1982, all revenues relating to offshore petroleum royalties and permit and licence fees are to be collected by the Commonwealth and passed on to the States after deducting the Commonwealth's share of royalties relating to Bass Strait production. The total dividend to be paid to the Commonwealth by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission in 1981-82 is expected to decline by $5.0 million, reflecting increased retention of funds to finance the Commission's involvement in the proposed new Pacific sub-marine cable project. Net Receipts/rom Government Enterprise Transactions This category includes receipts (other than taxation revenue ) from public financial enterprises and net operating revenues from certain activities carried on as business enterprises within the Budget sector, as shown in the following table. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Reserve Bank 226.4 197.7 254.9 +57.2 Commonwealth Banking Corporation 35.8 41.6 .38.8 2.8 Canberra Bus Service-loss on operations -10.1 -11.8 -12.2 0.5 N.T -electricity, water supply and sewerage 0.4 0.1 2.5 + 2.4 A.C.T -water supply and sewerage 6.7 6.2 11.0 + 4.8 Other 6.1 8.9 6:1 2.9 The receipts by the Commonwealth from the Reserve Bank in 1980-81 comprised an interim payment of $135 million from Note Issue Department profits for that year and a final payment of $62.7 million from 1979-80 profits. Estimated receipts from the Reserve Bank in 1981-82 comprise a final payment from 1980-81 profits of $124.9 million and an interim payment of $130 million from projected profits for 1981-82 of the Note Issue Department. The estimated receipts in 1981-82 from the Commonwealth Banking Corporation represent the Commonwealth's share of the net profits (after tax) in 1980-81 of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and of the net profits of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The decrease in receipts of $2.8 million reflects the slightly lower profits earned by the Commonwealth Trading Bank in 1980-81. The loss on operations of the Canberra Bus Service for 1981-82 is estimated to increase by $0.5 million to $12.2 million. The increase mainly reflects changed arrangements for accounting for superannuation, largely offset by the full-year effect of fare increases introduced in January 1981. Estimated receipts from Northern Territory electricity, water supply and sewerage enterprises relate only to recoveries in respect of operations prior to 1 July 1978 when responsibility for these activities was transferred to the Northern Territory Government. The increase of $2.4 million in 1981-82 reflects the anticipated payment of revenue relating to consumption of electricity before 1 July 1978. . Gross receipts from water and sewerage rates in the Australian Capital Territory are estimated to increase substantially from $16.0 million in 1980-81 to $22.0 million in 1981-82, reflecting increases in charges. Offset against these receipts are operational costs, estimated to be $11.0 million in 1981-82 compared with $9.8 million in 1980-81. The 'Other' category includes the operations of various government canteens, the Government Printer trust accounts, the publications trust account, business undertakings by the Department of Housing and Construction and dividends from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. Sale of Existing Assets Details of sales of existing assets are shown in the table below. 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Actual Actual Estimate Change$ million $ million $ million $ million Sale of Ranger Uranium Joint Venture .. 146.2 -146.2 A.C.T -Sale of leases 12.6 32.9 31.0 2.0 Other 11.5 15.7 20.0 + 4.3 During 1980-81, the Commonwealth completed the sale of its interest in the Ranger Uranium Joint Venture to Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA). (ERA also acquired the interests held in the venture by Peko Wallsend Operations Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd.) The assignment of the Commonwealth's interest was made on 12 September 1980. Total receipts from the sale were $146.2 million, comprising a sale premium of $125 million, reimbursement of direct expenditures on the project which were financed from the Budget in 1978-79 ($17.1 million), and other revenues associated with the sale ($4.1 million). ERA also reimbursed the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for expenditures which the Commission had incurred on the project from borrowed funds up to the date of assignment of the Commonwealth's interest, and for interest and other charges incurred in respect of those funds. The item 'A. C. T -sale of leases' records revenue from the sale of commercial and residentiaUeases in the A.C.T. Revenues in 1980-81 and 1981-82 include amounts received for commutation ofland rent resulting from a decision (which came into effect in March 1980) to permit commercial lessees in the A.C.T. to pay a lump sum covering the term of the lease in lieu of ongoing land rent payments. The level of residential lease sales is expected to taper slightly in 1981-82 following a substantial increase in 1980-81. Included in the estimate of 'Other' in 1980-81 are $4.85 million for the sale of all the issued share capital in the Fawnmac group of pharmaceutical companies and $0.6 million for the sale of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission's interest in the Ngalia Basin Joint Venture. The estimate for 1981-82 of $20 million relates to expected proceeds from the sale of land and buildings deemed to be surplus to Commonwealth needs. (Other surplus Commonwealth land is expected to be transferred in 1981-82 to the N.S.W. Government under land exchange arrangements agreed with that Government in 1978-79.) Following the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government has initiated action to sell a number of assets, including certain assets held by Commonwealth enterprises. Although some receipts could be obtained from such sales during 1981-82, it is not currently practicable (nor appropriate in view of possible effects on negotiations) to provide realistically based estimates of such receipts, as the necessary evaluations and commercial negotiations are still at an early stage, and these processes could affect the timing as well as the amount of such receipts. In previous Budget Statements, receipts from the disposition of the Commonwealth's uranium stockpile were recorded as sales of existing assets. These receipts resulted from an agreement giving certain Australian companies access to the Commonwealth's uranium stockpile to enable them to meet initial delivery obligations under approved sales contracts entered into prior to December 1972. The relevant transactions have now been re-classified as changes in stocks and are offset against outlays under the heading 'Industry Assistance and Development' in Statement No.3. AppendixI to Statement No.4 attached to the 1980-81 Budget Speech outlined the crude oil and LPG pricing and levy arrangements applicable in Australia at that time. This Appendix summarises the developments in this area since the last Budget. On 23 December 1980 and 26 June 1981 the Minister for National Development and Energy announced new determinations of import parity prices and associated crude oil levy rates to apply from 1 January1981 and 1 July 1981, respectively. The determinations of the import parity prices were in accordance with the policy announced by the Minister for National Development on 4 July1978. This policy is to base the import parity price for domestically produced crude oil on the official Saudi Arabian Light 'marker' price, adjusted to include quality differentials, freight, insurance and evaporation loss, and converted to Australian dollars; further adjustments are then made to allow for coastal freight, wharfage and credit terms. Australian refiners pay the resultant import parity prices for indigenous crude oil. Producers receive those prices less the levy payable to the Commonwealth. The determinations of the levy rates were in accordance with the arrangements announced by the Minister for National Development on 29 June 1979. Official prices of Saudi Arabian Light 'marker' crude and the equivalent Australian import parity prices for Bass Strait crude over the past three years are shown below: Saudi Arabian Light 'marker' Bass Strait crude oil crude oil ($US per ($A per barrel, fob barrel, fob Ras Tanura) Westernport) (a) I July 1978 12.70(b) 12.59 I January 1979 13.33(c) 13.66 I July 1979 . 18.00(d) 18.66 I January 1980 26.00(e) 24.77(f) I July 1980 28.00(g) 27.50 I January 1981 32.00 30.23 I July 1981 32.00 30.79(h) (a) Prices (and levy rates) are set in dollars per kilolitre but, for purposes of comparison, are converted to dollars per barrel equivalents. (b) Unchanged from I July 1977. (e) Increased to $USI4.55 per barrel with effect from I April 1979, and to $USI8.00 per barrel with effect from I June 1979. (d) Increased to $US24.00 per barrel with effect from I November 1979. (e) The increase to $US26.00 per barrel was announced in February 1980, with retrospective effect to I January 1980. (f) Based on $US24.00 per barrel, see footnote (e). (g) Increased to $US30.00 per barrel on 17 September 1980 with effect from I August 1980, and to $US32.00 per barrel on 16 December 1980 with effect from I November 1980. (h) This increase in the import parity price was due largely to changes in the $US/$A exchange rate. The Commonwealth Government's excise 'take' in 1980-81 was equivalenUo about 71 per cent of the average price to refineries, for domestically produced crude oil, of $28.89 per barrel. (In addition to the levy proceeds, the Commonwealth receives a share of the royalties paid by the producers. In 1980-81, that share amounted to $52 million and is recorded in 'Other Receipts'.) The excise rate varies according to the date of discovery and the size of each field. For oil discovered prior to 14September 1975(1l the producers' return and hence the excise rate vary according to the size of each field (large, medium or small) and the category of production (parity related or controlled). Producers of 'new' oil from fields discovered on or after 18 August 1976 are not subject to any levy and receive. the import parity price on the whole of their production. In 1980-81 producers of 'old' oil received a higher return, related to the import parity price, on 50 per cent of production or on 6 million barrels per annum, whichever was the greater, for each field or substantial new development within a field. For the balance of their production from such fields, producers received a controlled return, i.e. the Government-determined price which applied at the time of the 1977-78 Budget, adjusted for changes in the costs incurred by producers in extending credit to refiners. On 26 June 1979 the Minister for National Development announced an 'inprinciple' decision to continue the phasing-in of the parity related returns to fields producing less than 15 million barrels per annum. The Government has decided -hat such phasing should continue for 3 years in steps of 5 per cent each year, commencing from 1 July 1981, i.e. to 65 per cent from 1 July 1983. For fields producing more than 15 million barrels per annum the proportion of production attracting parity related returns is to be held at 50 per cent. The following revenue sharing arrangements apply in respect of parity related oil: for fields with an annual production of less than 2 million barrels (small fields) the levy remains at $3 per barrel and increases in price accrue entirely to producers; . for fields with an annual production greater than 2 million barrels but less than 15 million barrels (medium fields), the levy is $3 per barrel plus 75 per cent of increases in the import parity price after 30 June 1979 (producers therefore receive the $10.66 per barrel they were receiving at that date plus 25 per cent of increases in the import parity price since then); and for fields with an annual production greater than 15 million barrels (large fields), producer returns from 1 January 1980 have been determined by indexing the 31 December 1979 return of $9.59 by the cumulative increases in the Consumer Price Index after the December quarter 1978 or cumulative increases in import parity prices after 1 July 1979, whichever is the lesser. (This arrangement was subsequently reviewed and the September quarter 1978 became the starting point for calculating increases in the Consumer Price Index from the 1 July 1980 adjustment.) Both 1981 adjustments have been based on movements in the Consumer Price Index, with the levy taking up the balance of the increase in the import parity price. (I) Formally. the effect of the present excise by-laws is that this basis-pplies to oil discovered prior to 18 August 1976; this machinery provision reHects the fact that no discoveries between 14 September 1975 and 17 August 1976 have been identified. The import parity prices for crude oil, levy rates and (gross) returns to producers applicable to the different categories of oil during 1981 are set out below: (a) Small fields (less than 2 million barrels per annum) Bass Barrow Strait Island Moonie$ per barrel $ per barrel $ per barrel From 1.1.81 to 30.6.81Import parity price 30.23 30.61 31.81 Less levy 3.00 3.00 3.00 Return to producers 27.23 27.61 28.81 From 1.7.81 t031.12.81Import parity price 30.79 31.04 31.98 Less levy 3.00 3.00 3.00 Return to producers 27.79 28.04 28.98 (b) Medium fields (2-15 million barrels per annum) Bass Barrow Strait Island$ per barrel $ per barrel From 1.1.81 to 30.6.81Import parity price . 30.23 30.61 Less levy 15.43 15.64 Return to producers 14.80 14.97 From 1.7.81 t031.12.81Import parity price 30.79 31.04 Less levy 15.85 15.97 Return to producers 14.94 15.07 (c) Large fields (over 15 million barrels per annum) Bass Strait$ per barrel From 1.1.81 to 30.6.81Import parity price . 30.23 Less levy 18.69 Return to producers 11.54 From 1.7.81 t031.12.81Import parity price 30.79 Less levy 18.74 Return to producers 12.05 Bass Barrow Strait Island$ per barrel $ per barrel From 1.1.81 to 30.6.81Import parity price 30.23 30.61 Less levy 27.66 27.49 Return to producers 2.57 3.12 From 1.7.81 t031.12.81Import parity price 30.79 31.04 Less levy 28.21 27.92 Return to producers 2.58 3.12 On 23 December 1980 and '26 June 1981, the Minister for National Development and Energy announced new determinations of the domestically produced naturally occurring LPG price and excise rate to apply from 1 January 1981 and 1 July 1981, respectively. These determinations were made ih accordance with the policy announced by the Minister on 8 April 1980. For naturally occurring LPG, the pricing arrangements provide for the domestic price to be increased in line with the percentage movement in the import parity price for indigenous crude oil except that, if world price movements result in the export parity price for LPG falling below the crude oil related domestic price, the export parity price is to be adopted for domestic purposes. The Prices Justification Tribunal (PJT) was directed to follow these arrangements in setting prices for refinery produced LPG. The PJT was abolished on 26 June 1981 and its responsibilities for price surveillance in the petroleum products industry were transferred to the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. As a result of falling world LPG. prices, the domestic price applying from 1 July 1981 was determined, for the firsttime since the LPG pricing policy was announced, on the lower export parity basis, rather than on the crude oil index linked price. A price of $228.88 per tonne was calculated by the PJT for refinery produced LPG, having regard to international prices for LPG and the dealings of Australian companies exporting LPG. The price of naturally occurring LPG was then set at the price applicable to refinery produced LPG. On4 December 1980 the Minister for National Develppment and Energy announced that the $80 per tonne LPG subsidy payable to households, non-profit residential institutions and schools would be extended to commercial and industrial consumers in areas where natural gas was not readily available, This extension applied in respect of sales made on or after 30 September 1980. The subsidy arrangements, including the extension announced on 4 December 1980, are to terminate on 27 March 1983. Producers of naturally occurring LPG from fields in production prior to 17 August 1977 pay excise at a rate equivalent to 60 per cent of the excess of the weighted average of domestic and export prices over $147 per tonne. Naturally occurring LPG from fields brought into production on or after 17 August 1977 is free oflevy. Total excisable production of naturally occurring LPG in 1981-82 is estimated to be marginally higher than in 1980-81.The domestic price, excise rates and (gross) returns to producers from domestic sales of naturally occurring LPG during 1981 are shown below: Returns to Price.(a) Levy (h) Producers $ tonne $ tonne $ tonne From 1.1.81 to 30.6.81 250.23 68.09 182.14 From 1.7.81 . . . 228.88 69.26 159.62 (a) The prices charged to households, non-profit residential institutions, schools and industrial and commercial consumers in areas where natural gas is not readily available are reduced by the $80 per tonne subsidy paid by the Commonwealth. (b) Approximate dollars per tonne conversions of levy rates which are set in dollars per kilolitre. TAXA nON EXPENDITURES Individuals and businesses derive financial benefits from taxation concessions of various kinds. In the year(s) when they have effect, the concessions reduce, or delay, collections of taxation revenue, and are as much a call on the Budget as are direct outlays. They are comparable in other ways also with direct outlays and are often referred to as 'taxation expenditures'. This Appendix provides information on some major items of taxation expenditure. The inclusion of an item in the Appendix does not necessarily indicate that it is considered a departure from an equitable tax distribution. Rather, it implies no more than that it confers a benefit on recipients and could conceivably be regarded as an alternative to direct expenditure in the same way that family allowances confer a benefit comparable with that conferred by the dependent child rebates which they replaced in 1976. It would be possible to replace most of the tax provisions mentioned below with a direct expenditure program having an almost identical impact on both Budget· and taxpayer. Assistance to Individuals Concessional income tax rebates, deductions and other reliefs provide assistance to particular groups of individuals. Rebates The principal rebates are those for maintenance of dependants, for sole parents and housekeepers, zone rebates allowed to taxpayers residing in remote areas, and rebates for certain types of allowable expenditures. A concessional rebate is allowable where a taxpayer contributes to the maintenance of certain dependants and in certain other cases. The maximum rebates for the years from 1975-76 to 1981-82 are: Maximum Rebate 1978-79 and Dependant etc 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 $ $ $ $ $ $ Spouse, housekeeper, daughter-housekeeper 400 500 555 597 800 830 Parent or parent-in-law 400 452 501 539 722 749 Invalid relative 200 226 251 270 362 376 Sole parent 200 350 388 417 559 580 Children(a) Student 200 226 251 270 362 376 Non-student under 16-one such child 200 226 251 270 362 376 each other such child 150 170 189 203 272 282 Rebates shade out iF separate net income exceeds(b) 150 170 189 203 272 282 (a) From 1976-77 rebates in respect of children have relevance only to the calculation of zone rebates. (b) Where a dependant has separate net income in excess oFa specified amount ($282 For 1981-82), the rebate is reduced by $1 For every $4 by which that amount is exceeded. Zone rebates are allowed to taxpayers who live in remote areas. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81, eligible residents in ZoneA received a rebate equal to $216 plus 25 per cent of any entitlement to rebates in respect of dependants, sole parents and housekeepers (including notional rebates in respect of dependent children); eligible residents of ZoneB received a rebate of $36 plus 4 per cent of the rebates for dependants, etc. New arrangements to be introduced are referred to in the Taxation Measures section of Statement No 4. A rebate at the standard tax rate of 32 per cent is allowed on the excess of a taxpayer's aggregate expenditure on certain concessional items above a prescribed figure, currently $1590. Eligible expenditure includes certain expenditure in respect of the taxpayer and his dependants on medical and hospital services net of recoupments, funeral expenses up to $100, adoption of children, life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions up to a total of $1200, educational services in respect of the taxpayer, his children or dependants, up to $250 per person, and rates and land taxes up to $300 in respect of the taxpayer's sole or principal residence. Prior to 1 October 1976, contributions to a registered health insurance fund were also included in this category of rebatable expenditure. On the basis of income tax statistics for 1979-80, about 7 per cent of taxpayers had concessional expenditures in excess of $1590. Contributions made after 30 June 1981 in respect of a period of cover after that date to a registered health fund for basic hospital and/or medical insurance are rebatable at the standard rate. This rebate is outside the $1590 rebate block and is allowed regardless of the level of ,a taxpayer's other rebatable expenditures. Further details are given in the Taxation Measures section of Statement No.4. Deductions Gifts to the value of $2 or more to organisations covered by sections 78(1 )(a) and 78(I)(aa) of the Income Tax Assessment Act are deductible from assessable income. Between1 July 1974 and 31 October 1978, interest paid on home loans was deductible, subject to an income test and certain other conditions. Superannuation contributions made to a qualifying fund by self-employed persons and by employees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements are deductible from assessable income up to a limit of $1200 per annum. Contributions in excess of $1200 are reba table within the $1590 rebate block, up to the limit of $1200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions subject to rebate. . A deduction in respect of home insulation expenditure which carries elements of both personal and industry assistance is described in the Taxation Measures section of Statement No.4. Details of tax revenue forgone under most of the aforementioned taxation provisions in respect of income years 1975-76 to 1979-80 are shown in the table below.

In particular, amounts paid under the Social Services Act 1947 relating to the following are exempt from taxation: invalid pensions paid to persons under age pension age, supplementary assistance which is paid subject to a special income test to certain pensioners who pay rent or lodging charges, payments that represent mother's or guardian's allowance or additional pension for children, family allowances, funeral benefits, sheltered employment allowance, double orphan's pensions, handicapped child's allowance, and some training and living allowances under the Rehabilitation Service. Some repatriation pensions are also exempt income. A number of lump sum income payments made to individuals are either tax free or are taxed on a concessional basis. For example, no more than 5 per cent of retirement benefits received as lump sums from a superannuation fund is treated as assessable income. Similarly, lump sum retiring allowances paid, not from a superannuation fund, but directly by an employer to an employee are assessable as to only 5 per cent of their amount. The investment income earned by most superannuation funds is also either exempt from tax or is taxed on a concessional basis .. Industry Assistance Industry also has received considerable assistance over the years through various taxation concessions. The main concessions available in recent years have been investment allowances, accelerated depreciation and trading stock valuation adjustment, all of which affected a wide spectrum of industry, while special arrangements have benefited the primary production, tourism and mining industries. Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: A -those allowing the deduction of amounts that are not authorised under the general provisions of the law; B -those allowing certain taxpayers to alter the timing of tax allowances; and C -those exempting certain classes of income. Details of estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1980-81 in respect of some of these provisions are shown in the table below. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly 'Industry Assistance? These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their liyestock accounts for taxation purposes; deduction of the cost of converting stationary oilor LPG-fired plant to alternative energy sources; immediate deductibility for capital expenditure on water conservation and soil conservation by primary producers; deduction of the cost of connecting business properties to electricity mains; measures related to the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis· in cattle; income-spreading in the case of forced sales of livestock; the petroleum shareholder rebate; the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees' amenities; and certain sales tax exemptions.

The absence of precise information on the amounts that would otherwise have been deductible by way of depreciation of relevant plant makes it impossible to provide a reliable estimate of the effect of these deductions on revenue. Ca,tegoryA The present investment allowance applies to a wide range of plant and equipment, including leased plant. It provided originally for a deduction equal to 40 per cent of the cost of plant purchased under a contract made in the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978 and first used by 30 June 1979 and a deduction of 20 per cent after those dates. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, it has been reduced to 18 per cent of the cost of plant ordered in the period 1 May 1981 to 30 June 1985. The trading stock valuation adjustment was a special deduction equal to a prescribed percentage of most classes of trading stock including livestock. The prescribed percentage was based on half the percentage increase in the goods component of the Consumer Price Index between the June quarter prior to the year of income and the June quarter of the year of income and was applied to the value of the. trading stock at the commencement of the year. The adjustment was terminated with effect from the 1979-80 income year. Special deductions are allowable under section 75A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to taxpayers engaged in primary production in respect of certain classes of capital expenditure not subject to depreciation. The amount of the expenditure is allowed in equal annual deductions over 10 years. Ploughing and grassing the land for grazing purposes and the preparation of the land for agriculture are examples of the classes of capital expenditure. Primary producers are also allowed to write off capital expenditure on telephone lines over 10 years. The Income Equalisation Deposits scheme permits deposits by a primary producer, within specified limits, to be deducted against assessable income in the year the deposits are made, and withdrawals of deposits to be included in assessable income in the year they are withdrawn. (Deposits up to 31 August are deductible against assessable income of the preceding income year.) Interest is paid on deposits. Under the averaging provisions, primary producers effectively have their income from primary production taxed at rates corresponding to their average income (for the current and preceding 4 years) in a year when average income is less than taxable income. (Depending on the amount of their income not derived from primary production, some or all of that income may also be effectively taxed at the lower rates corresponding to average income.) In a year in which average income is greater than taxable income, primary producers are taxed at ordinary rates. The purpose of the averaging provisions is to ensure that fluctuations in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to primary producer taxpayers with fluctuating incomes bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but non-fluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward (eg inflationary) trend in money incomes over a number of years since, even if fluctuations in income are superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over an equal period of years are comparable. Furthermore, even in the absence of an upward trend in income, the provisions introduced in 1977-78 do more than remove the effect on tax of fluctuations in income, as averaging is applied only in years when to do so benefits the taxpayer, and tax is calculated at ordinary rates in other years. In those years when the application of averaging would result in a primary producer paying less tax than would be the case under the normal income tax rate scale, the income tax law allows a special 'averaging rebate' to be subtracted from ordinary tax equal to the difference in tax payable under the two systems. The cost to revenue of this rebate in 1980-81 was $215 million. Considerable assistance is now provided to the film industry. Details are provided in the Taxation Measures section of Statement No 4. CategoryB Double depreciation applied to new plant and equipment first used or installed for use by taxpayers in the manufacturing and primary production industry sectors on or after 1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975. The double depreciation scheme also applied in 1975-76 and was extended in coverage, but was discontinued after the 1975-76 income year. After 19 August 1980, the then existing scheduled rates of depreciation were increased by 20 per cent in respect of new or second-hand plant ordered. (The loading did not apply to motor vehicles of the types to which the investment allowance does not apply or to plant for which concessional statutory rates were available.) Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the special loading was reduced to 18 per cent for plant ordered on or after 1 May 1981. Provision also exists for fast write-off of capital expenditure on scientific research relating to a business. New arrangements for accelerated depreciation for plant used in production of basic iron and steel are outlined in the Taxation .Measures section of Statement No 4. Details of a special depreciation allowance in respect of new plant contracted for on or after 10 October 1980 which is used by primary producers are also provided there. Depreciation allowances are provided for certain new income-producing buildings (or extensions to existing buildings) commenced after 21 August 1979 that are used to "" provide short-term accommodation for travellers. The allowance is 2+ per cent per annum of the construction cost of the building. As regards capital development expenditure in the mining industry, allowable capital expenditure incurred in respect of the development of a mine property or an oil field that was incurred under a contract entered into by 30 April 1981 was deductible by reference to the estimated life of the mine or field or 5 years whichever was less. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, annual deductions in respect of allowable capital expenditures under a contract entered into on or after I May and before 19 ,August 1981 are to be calculated by reference to the lesser of the estimated life of the mine or field or 6 years. Changed provisions will apply to expenditures under a contract entered into on or after 19 August 1981 and these are outlined in the Taxation Measures section of Statement No.4. Expenditure on certain facilities for the transport of minerals is deductible in equal instalments over either 10 years or 20 years, at the taxpayer's option to be exercised with the first claim for the deduction. Certain incurred development and transport expenditure, however, is deductible under taxation provisions operative some years ago which continue to apply to expenditure made in those earlier years. The income tax rebate provision for petroleum exploration and development allows a company engaged in petroleum exploration and development activities to entitle its corporate and non-corporate shareholders to a tax rebate of 27 per cent (30 per cent before 1 May 1981) for share capital subscribed that is spent on eligible outgoings if the company elects to forgo its own right to income tax deductions for the capital expenditure incurred. CategoryC Exemptions from income tax as a form of industry assistance include the exemption of income derived from the production of gold and the exemption of amounts paid to employers who take on young people under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme (CRAFT). The table below sets out in summary form the various sales tax anomalies and inconsistencies, the correction of which, effective from 19 August 1981, was announced in the 1981-82 Budget.

It also presents details on how the 1980-81 Budget deficit was financed. . The 1980-81 Budget outcome is summarised in the following table: Budget Estimate(a) Actual(b) Difference . $ million $ million $ million Per cent Outlays 36029 36274 +244 +0.7 Receipts 34464 35146 +683 +2.0 Deficit 1566 1127 438 (a) The Budget estimates differ from those shown in the 1980-81 Budget Speech because the figures have been adjusted for classification changes introduced ,in the 1981-82 Budget. In particular, amounts received by the Commonwealth from transactions relating to borrowing of uranium from the Commonwealth stockpile have been offset against relevant outlays rather than shown as sales of existing assets on the receipts side of the Budget (see Appendix for further details). (b) The revised outcome differs from that shown in the Commonwealth Government Statement of Financial Transactions for 1980-81 issued on 8 July 1981, because of classification changes introduced in the 1981-82 Budget and adjustments provided by departments following detailed checking of accounting records. Major features of this outcome are: an overrun of $244 million or 0.7 per cent on outlays; for the sixth year in succession, actual outlays were withih one per cent of the Budget estimate; this result was achieved despite some large expenditures which could not have been foreseen at Budget time, including $68 million additional natural disaster relief mainly as a result of the prolonged drought ,and an additional $152 million in public debt interest payments, mainly on account of larger than expected issues of Treasury Notes during the year; receipts exceeded the Budget estimate by $683 million or 2.0 per cent; economic activity and incomes in 1980-81 increased somewhat more than forecast at Budget time and this wasrefiected in higher than estimated receipts for gross PAYE income tax (up $171 million); similarly,company tax and personal income tax on assessment exceeded the Budget estimates by $195 million and $173 million respectively, indicating that income growth in 1979-80 was stronger than suggested by the preliminary information available at Budget time; and with outlays held close to the estimate, and receipts significantly higher than forecast, the Budget deficit was $438 million less than forecast, resulting, as the Budget Speech envisaged, in the first Budget domestic surplus since 1973-74. The following table compares the actual outcome with the Budget estimates for each function, and is followed by comment on differences between the two.

Defence-down $5 million While total defence outlays were relatively close to the Budget estimate there was a number of significant variations within the function. Expenditure on naval construction was $24 million below estimate and reflected the effects of exchange rate movements coupled with delays in construction work on replenishment ships and in the destroyer escort modernisation program. Expenditure on aircraft and associated initial equipmentwas $23 million less than the estimate, mainly because of the deferment of a decision on a new tactical fighter and some slippage in Macchi and Mirage refurbishment programs; offset partly by the post-Budget decision to purchase replacement FIll aircraft. Outlays on the acquisition of sites and buildings were $11 million less than estimated because of delayin finalising a number of contracts; in particular, there was , a $4 million shortfall arising from delays in the purchase of houses in Townsville. After taking account of the allowance includein the Budget for prospective defence wage and salary increases, manpower costs (including the wage and salary component of Defence Science and Technology establishments) fell short of the Budget estimate by $21 million; On the other hand,outlays on supporting equipment and stores and on the repair and maintenance of equipment were, respectively, $35 million and $10 million greater than the Budget estimates. These increases were due mainly to cost increases and, in the former case, additional procurement. Administrative and operational expenses were $24 million more than estimated, a reflection of increased costs, particularly fuel costs, and increased activity. Outlays associated with the maintenance of industrial capacity were $14 million more than estimated because of wage and other cost increases not provided for in the Budget estimates. Education-up $60 million Total outlays on tertiary education were $35 million more than provided for in the Budget. The main factors contributing to this increase were a work value award for academic staff together with other wage and salary awards made outside the National Wage Case context and not allowed for in the Budget, which cost an additional $28 million, and unanticipated rises in other recurrent costs, which accounted for $5 million. Net outlays on schools in the States were $23 million .more than estimated. The main contributory factors were larger than estimated requirements for expenditure of Commonwealth funds on government schools in the States ($3 million) and higher than forecast enrolments in non-government schools, and a post-Budget decision to increase the per capita subsidy to non-government schools ($20 million). Wage, salary and general cost increases resulted in an overrun of $9 million in outlays on schools and pre-schools in the ACT. Payments of student assistance under Aboriginal education programs were $3 million more than estimated because more students than expected were eligible for assistance. At the same time, there was a shortfall of $9 million in outlays on the school-to-work tran-ition program due to difficulties in commencing the calendar year programs for 1980 and 1981. Health-up $6 million There were several significant variations within the health function. Nursing home benefits and payments were $16 million less than estimated, with fewer nursing home beds attracting assistance than had been allowed for. Outlays on pharmaceutical benefits and services were $12 million less, reflecting lower than assumed prescription volumes and lower than expected drug price increases of eligible drugs. These shortfalls were more than offset by overruns in a number of areas, including expenditure on repatriation hospitals (up $10 million due mainly to wage and salary increases), medical treatment and allowances for veterans and their dependants (up $5 million because of increased medical and transport costs and higher than anticipated demand for services), hospital payments (up $7 million due to additional requests from the States to cover wage increases outside National Wage cases, other cost increases and lower than expected revenue collections arising from fewer patients having hospital insurance), and domiciliary care benefits (up $2 million, reflecting increases in patient numbers). Social Security and Welfare-up $36 million Major variations within this function were basically attributable to differences between actual and estimated numbers of beneficiaries and differences between forecast and aCtual movements in the consumer price index. Adjustments to benefit rates for CPI movements were smaller than had been forecast at Budget time. Unemployment, sickness and special benefits were up $71 million on the Budget estimates, reflecting in particular higher than expected numbers eligible for sickness benefits and a rise in the proportion of unemployed people becoming eligible for unemployment benefits. Other overruns occurred in supporting parents benefits ($26 million) and pensions and allowances for veterans and their dependants ($11 million), while there were shortfalls in invalid pensions ($55 million), age pensions ($31 million) and widows pensions ($12 million). Expenditure on aged persons accommodation fell short of the estimate by $7 million, mainly because approved projects did not proceed at the rate originally assumed. Outlays under the heading General Administrative and Other Expenditure were $14 million more than estimated, mainly reflecting increased wage and salary costs. Other variations within the function related to children's services (up $7 million due largely to wage and price increases), personal care subsidies (up $4 million because of the Government's decision to increase the rate of subsidy from $15 a week to $20 a week with effect from October 1980), and assistance to the homeless (up $3 million and largely attributable to a post-Budget decision to increase capital grants under the program). Housing-down $24 million Net outlays on housing in the ACT were $9 million less than estimated. Repayments of principal were higher than expected both on government dwellings sold to tenants and on loans under the ACT Commissioner for Housing scheme, reflecting a greater than normal rate of mortgage discharge under both schemes. Net outlays under Defence Service Homes arrangements were $10 million less than estimated, largely because the average loan was lower than expected and early discharges of loans were higher than estimated, which meant that no capital contribution to the Corporation was required during the year. Homes Savings Grant payments were $7 million less than estimated, reflecting under-estimation of the effect of rising home prices on the number of applications for grants and on the average size of grant. Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment-down $7 million Expenditure on rehabilitation works at Woolloomooloo fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million, largely due to delays in the settlement of land purchases; under the arrangements for this scheme disbursements are dependent on the rate of expenditure achieved by the NSW Government. Outlays on the Regional Development Program were $3 million less than estimated; this largely reflected the Government's post-Budget decision to terminate the program. Culture and Recreation-up $17 million Net outlays on the National Broadcasting and Television Service were $7 million more than estimated; $3 million of this reflected increased salary costs and $3 million the purchase of previously rented film studios in Sydney. Expenditure on the Special Broadcasting Service was $6 million above estimate because of the need to meet production costs of multicultural television programs which were originally expected to be largely financed by advertising revenue. Outlays on cultural and recreational activities in the ACT exceeded the Budget estimate by $3 million mainly because of cost increases for the construction of the National Indoor Sports Centre, and expenditure on additional accommodation requirements for the Australian Institute of Sport. Transport and Communication-down $11 million Expenditure on civil aviation buildings, works and equipment was $14 million less than estimated; $10 million of this was attributable to delays on the Brisbane Airport Redevelopment Project. Outlays on railway mainline upgrading were $5 million below the Budget estimate due to under-expenditure by the States on approved projects. A curtailed construction program resulting mainly from industrial disputes led to a $4 million shortfall on payments for construction of the second Hobart Bridge. Payments to the Pipeline Authority fell short of the estimate by $3 million principally because loans raised from the private sector were finalised later than expected, with the result that the Authority did not need to meet estimated interest payments. These shortfalls were partially offset by overruns in other areas. Civil aviation administration and operational costs were $13 million more than estimated, much of this reflecting wage and salary increases. Civil aviation recoveries, which are offset against these outlays, were a net $2 million less. The air navigation charges component was $6 million less, reflecting lower than projected growth rates in air traffic and some arrears in collections, while other recoveries were $4 million greater than estimated, principally because of higher than expected receipts from business concessions at airports. Payments to Australian National Railways to meet operating losses were $3 million more than estimated. Water Supply, Electricity and Gas-down $6 million A lower than expected increase in fuel oil prices resulted in a shortfall of $5 million in subsidy payments for the operations of the Northern Territory Electricity Commission. Outlays under the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy scheme were $5 million less than the Budget provision notwithstanding that the scheme was extended from 30 September 1981 to include certain commercial and industrial users; 1980-81 was the scheme's first year of operation and the initial estimate was based on what proved to be inadequate information on the extent of LPG consumption eligible for the subsidy. Industry Assistance and Development-up $10 million There was a number of sizeable variations from the Budget estimates within this function. Substantial net replacements of uranium concentrates to the Commonwealth's stockpile required the Commonwealth to make earlier than expected refunds of borrowing fees; accordingly, this item required $55 million more than was provided for in the Budget estimates. Wool Industry outlays were a net $4 million higher than estimated due to changed administrative arrangements, which reduced from one month to one week the lag between collection of wool tax and the corresponding payment to the Wool Research Fund and so permitted a higher than estimated expenditure from the Fund. Shipbuilding assistance was $13 million less than estimated, due to delays by some applicants in meeting administrative requirements, and postponements and cancellations of construction. Outlays on energy research and conservation were $10 million less than estimated primarily because of slower than expected progress on a number of projects financed from the Energy Research Trust Account. The interest subsidy to the Wheat Board was $6 million less than estimated due to a lower interest rate differential than assumed at Budget time; this shortfall was partially offset by an overrun of $4 million in payments to wheat growers from the Industry Finance Fund, largely reflecting the higher than estimated interest earnings of the fund. Loan repayments by Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited, which are offset against outlays, were $6 million more than had been expected at Budget time. Labour and Employment-up $40 million Total outlays on training schemes were $24 million greater than estimated. Outlays on apprenticeship training, mainly CRAFT, exceeded the estimate by $8 million; there were post-Budget increases in the rate of allowances to apprentices and intakes of apprentices were well above Budget expectations, resulting in additional expenditure on rebates to employers. Outlays on other manpower and employment training schemes accounted for $16 million of the increase, reflecting post-Budget decisions to pay allowances to certain participants in the school-to-work transition program and to extend the length of training under SYETP for those aged 18-24, increased numbers of trainees (particularly the young unemployed, Aboriginals and the handicapped), and increases in trainee allowance rates. Administrative and other expenses associated with the function exceeded the estimate by $12 million. General Public Services-up $35 million Law, Order and Public Safety outlays exceeded the Budget estimate by $7 million and included overruns of $4 million for Australian Federal Police (attributable to increased costs and increased activity) and $2 million for ASIO. An increase on the Budget estimate for food aid was the principal factor accounting for the overrun of $8 million in outlays on Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid-a major element of Australia's food aid commitment is pledged in terms of tonnes of wheat, and increases in the price of wheat directly affected the cost of this commitment. Increased wage and salary costs for the CSIRO accounted for most of the overrun of $8 million in General and Scientific Research nee. Outlays for Administrative Services exceeded the Budget estimate by a net $11 million reflecting variations to a large number of items. Net receipts from the Mint, which are offset against outlays under this function, were $17 million greater than estimated mainly reflecting numismatic profits on the sale of gold coins. There was a shortfall of $8 million in the purchase of computing equipment for the Department of Housing and Construction; long delays and administrative problems associated with the purchase meant that it was not finalised in 1980-81. These shortfalls were more than offset by other increases in a large number of items arising predominantly from increased wage and salary rates. Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nee-up $65 million The marked deterioration in the drought situation after the estimates were prepared, and the introduction of a range of new and expanded drought relief measures eligible for Commonwealth assistance, were the main factors leading to natural disaster payments exceeding the Budget estimate by $68 million. In 1980-81, tax sharing grants were subject to the guarantee that the grant paid to individual States would be no less in real terms than that received in 1979-80. In the event, movements in the Consumer Price Index (the ""real terms"" index used) and in population estimates (which affect individual State shares of total grants) resulted in a final determination of grants in 1980-81 which was $9 million less, in aggregate, than originally estimated. Tax sharing payments to the Northern Territory were $5 million more than estimated, mainly due to an upward revision of the estimated population increase between 31 December 1979 and 31 December 1980. Public Debt l-terest-up $152 million Significantly higher than estimated subscriptions to Treasury Notes, together with increases in interest rates offered on Commonwealth domestic securities, were the major factors causing the Budget estimate to be exceeded by $152 million. Allowancefor Wage and Salary Increases (Non-Defence}-$125 million The bulk allowance for prospective wage and salary increases was not apportioned by function at the time the estimates were prepared but was effectively apportioned during the year as actual increases occurred. As indicated in the preceding text, a number of the differences between estimates and outcomes at the functional level reflect spending arising from increases in wage and salary rates. Such increases in wage and salary appropriations were accounted for in Budget estimates by the bulk allowance. When the Budget estimates were prepared it seemed likely that the work value claim by Public Service clerical officers would be finalised in time for the total cost of the resultant increase to be paid during 1980-81. In the event, only the 4 per cent interim increase was paid during 1980-81, with the cost of the final additional 2 per cent increase to be met in 1981-82. Differences between the Budget estimates and actual receipts in 1980-81 are set out in the following table; the accompanying notes comment briefly on the main variations.

Customs Duty-up $25 million The increase of $30 million in customs duties on imports reflects a substantial increase in the value of imports over the estimate made at Budget time; this more than offsets the effect of a lower than estimated ratio of duty to imports. The shortfall in receipts from the coal export duty reflects reduced exports as. a result of strikes in Queensland and New South Wales in 1980-81. Excise Duty-down $69 million"" Receipts from the excise or!. crude oil were $35 million lower than the Budget estimate. On the basis of the production forecasts underlying the Budget estimate, the increase in import parity prices from 1 January 1981 (which was not allowed for in the Budget estimate) would have yielded additional revenue of about $160 million. However, actual production from Bass Strait fields was significantly lower than the Budget time estimate, mainly because of strikes which affected production. in November 1980 and again in May and early June 1981. Two factors contributed to the shortfall of $14 million on the Budget estimate of revenue from the excise on naturally occurring LPG, namely, a decrease in the excise rate from 1 January 1981 in response to a decline in export prices, and a shortfall in production of excisable LPG compared with the Budget estimate. Receipts from other excise duties· were a net $20 million lower than the Budget estimate. There was a shortfall in receipts from beer and tobacco products, partly offset by higher revenue from potable spirits. Preliminary clearance data for 1980-81 indicate a decline of about 1 per cent in beer clearances. Following an increase of about 2 per cent in 1979-80, it was assumed, at the time of the Budget, that growth would continue in 1980-81. On the other hand clearances of potable spirits increased much more strongly than was assumed at the time of the Budget. Clearances of cigarettes increased by about 1 per cent compared with an estimate of 3 per cent at the time of the Budget. A further slight decline in clearances of motor spirit was forecast at the time of the Budget following the decline of 1.3 per cent in 1979-80. In the event, preliminary figures indicate that clearances increased by about 1 per cent but the effect of this on revenue was largely offset by lower than expected growth in clearances of other petroleum products. The following table compares the 1980-81 outcomes for commodity groups with the Budget estimates for 1980-81 and the outcomes for 1979-80. 1980-81 1979-80 Budgel Preliminary Actual Estimate Outcome Difference $ million $ million $ million $ million Beer 997 1010 991 -19 Potable spirits 100 100 III +11 Tobacco products 700 717 704 13 Petrolel!m products 905 924 925 + 1 Crude oil and LPG 2270 3157 3108 -49 Other (including credits) -7 -6 -6 4965 5902 5833 -69 Sales Tax-up $42 million The rate of growth in private consumption expenditure in 1980-81 was broadly in line with the Budget estimate, with stronger than expected growth in real consumption being offset by a lower than expected increase in prices. Within private consumption expenditure, however, expenditure onhousehpld durables was higher while expenditure on non-durables was lower thilO expected; most expenditure on household durabIes is subject to sales tax whereas most expenditure on non-durables is exempt. Sales tax collections were also boosted by stronger than expected growth in sales ofcom mercial motor vehicles. Income Tax on Individuals-Pay-AsYou-Earn-up $301 million The overrun in P AYE receipts resulted from higher than estimated gross PA YE collections (up $171 million) and lower than estimated refunds (down $l30 million). At the time of the Budget it was assumed that average weekly earnings would grow by 12 per cent and employment by 1t per cent. In the event both grew more stronglyearnings by about l3+ per cent and employment by 2-!per cent. The shortfall of PAYE refunds reflected two factors. First, some taxpayers subject to tax instalment deductions do not present those deductions for crediting against tax assessed. The proportion of tax instalment deductions made in 1979-80 and presented (in 1980-81) in the form of group certificates or tax stamps for crediting against tax assessed on 1979-80 incomes was less than had been assumed at Budget time. Secondly, the proportion of tax instalment deductions presented that was refunded was lower than estimated at Budget time. Income Tax on Other Individuals-up $173 million The major factor contributing to the overrun was a higher collection rate than was estimated at Budget time-ie overall, tax liabilities were paid more promptly than originally assumed. The Budget estimate of the growth in incomes in 1979-80 (to which collections in 1980-81 mainly relate) was realized. Company Tax-up $195 million The growth in company income subject to tax in 1979-80 (the year to which the bulk of company collections in 1980-81 relates) is now estimated to have been about 39 per cent, about 4 per cent higher than had been assumed at Budget time. Collections on assessments of tax due in respect of earlier years were also higher than had been estimated at Budget time. Interest. Rent and Dividends-up $25 million The increase over the Budget estimates primarily reflects higher interest on advances for States' Loan Council programs (up $37 million) following interest rate increases during the course of the year. On the other hand receipts from offshore petroleum royalties were $6 million less than the Budget estimate. Net Receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions-down $34 million Receipts from the Reserve Bank were $35 million less than the Budget estimate. This reflected larger losses from bond sales than had been estimated, resulting in a reduced interim payment from 1980-81 Note Issue Department profits. Sale of Existing Assets-up $21 million A substantial resurgence in demand for residential and commercial land occurred during 1980-81 in the ACT andresulted in an increase over estimated revenues from sale of leases of $16 million. The manner in which the Budget deficit in 1980-81 was financed is summarised in Tables1 and 2 below. Table1 is the presentation of Budget financing transactions, as published monthly in the Statement of Commonwealth Government Financial Transactions, re-arranged to show domestic borrowings and their composition. The concept of 'Domestic Borrowings' is intended to indicate the increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth to domestic non-Budget sectors arising from Budget financing either by the issue of Commonwealth securities to domestic non-Budget sectors or by the use (ie runningdown) of Commonwealth cash balances with the Reserve Bank. While Table1 shows aggregate financing transactions, and the securities or financing instruments involved in those transactions, it does not bring out the net changes in the holdings of government debt of the various sectors with which the Budget sector transacts. These changes are shown in Table2 and are relevant to analysis of the monetary implications of the financing of the Budget. The changes reflect both net proceeds of sales of government securities (subscriptions to new issues less redemptions) and subsequent market transactions in these securities. Because of a sizeable reduction of $906 million in the Budget deficit in 1980-81, total financing transactions in 1980-81 were much below those in 1979-80. There was, however, a smaller fall in domestic borrowings in 1980-81; this reflected net repayments of overseas borrowings in 1980-81 compared with net overseas borrowings in the previous year, and less reliance on other financing transactions than in 1979-80 when there were large redemptions of government securities held by a government trust fund (thereby reducing domestic borrowings as measured).

(b) This item cannot be compared directly with the item 'Reserve Bank' in Table2 (Domestic Borrowings 1980-81). The Table1 entry refers solely to Treasury Bills whereas the Table2 entry encompasses all net changes in domestic borrowings by the Government from the Reserve Bank. Thus, for example, Reserve Bank purchases of Treasury Notes direct from the Commonwealth are recorded for the purposes of Table1 with other Treasury Note sales under 'Net change in Treasury Notes on issue' whereas, representing part of the Reserve Bank contribution to domestic borrowings, they are recorded in Table2 under the 'Reserve Bank' item. Brief comments on the main items in Table1 are provided below. Net Overseas Borrowings In September 1980 the Commonwealth undertook a private placement in Germany for the equivalent of $95 million and, in May 1981, made a public bond issue in Japan for the equivalent of $78 million. The proceeds of the September borrowing were used to redeem a DM200 million ($95 million) public issue which matured on 1 October 1980. Repayments during the year of previous drawings on behalf of Qantas, TAA and the Australian Shipping Commission amounted to $25 million, $7 million and $13 million respectively. A repayment of $1 million was also made to Eximbank. Other securities to the value of $123 million were redeemed in· the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan. In addition, repayments of $8 million were made on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. . In summary, total gross overseas borrowings amounted to $173 million while total redemptions and repayments amounted to $271 million, giving net overseas repayments of $98 million. . Ot her Financing Transactions Other financing transactions amounted to $23 million (net) in 1980-81. Positive contributions included $99 million as a result of the redemption of National Debt Sinking Fund investments in Commonwealth Government securities; $29 million in net proceeds from coinage transactions; $27 million received from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund towards the liability for benefits existing at 1 July 1976; and net receipts of $14 million from the Postal and Telecommunication Commissions, representing the Commissions' employer contributions to the Commonwealth Superannuation scheme deposited with the Commonwealth. These transactions were almost entirely offset by a payment of $107 million to the International Monetary Fund for an increase in Australia's quota with the Fund; a net payment of $16 million from the Income Equalisation Deposits trust account to the Primary Industry Bank of Australia; and an increase of $16 million in the investments of the Wheat Finance Fund. Loan Raisings in Australia There was a net fall of $325 million in holdings of Australian Savings Bonds and Special Bonds during 1980-81; this reflected gross subscriptions to Australian Savings Bonds of $2024 million and total redemptions of these securities and of the superseded Special Bonds of $2349 million. . Since December 1979, Treasury Notes have been issued under a tender systetri. Gross proceeds from the issue of Treasury Notes amounted to $12058 million in 1980-81 while redemptions amounted to $10 146 million; the resultant total Treasury Notes on issue (including Reserve Bank holdings) of $3527 million at 30 June 1981 was $1912 million higher than a year earlier. Towards the end of 1979-80, the previous system of selling bonds in 'cash' and 'conversion' loans was replaced by a 'tap' system under which bonds of particular maturities (tap stocks) are available on a continuing basis throughout the year. There were twelve tap stocks available at various stages during 1980-81 and sales of these raised a total of $2748 million. Total redemptions and repurchases of bonds during the year amounted to $2361 million to give net bond raisings of $387 million. An amount of $72 million was received in the form of Income Equalisation Deposits (IEDs) in 1980-81; redemptions of IEDs and the superseded Drought Bonqs amounted to $45 million, giving a net increase in IEDs of $27 million. This increase, together with States' domestic loan raisings of $55 million and the above-mentioned net bond raisings partly offset by small redemptions of other securities, brought total ""other"" loan. raisings in Australia to $458 million. Total loan raisings in Australia of $2044' million, which reflected the strong growth in private sector liquidity, more than accounted for the financing requirements of the deficit. Residual Financing Because of the high level of loan raisings in Australia, there was an increase of $242 million in Commonwealth Government cash balances and a reduction of $600 million in borrowings outstanding with the Reserve Bank in the form of Treasury Bills. Sources of Finance Table2 shows domestic borrowings from banks and non-banks and, within each category, provides information on the major institutional groups. Such a categorisation is useful as the economic effects of financing transactions depend importantly on which of the non-Budget sectors hold the stock of government debt and on the changes in those holdings. Private sector take-up of Commonwealth debt reflects a large number of influences on domestic liquidity conditions, including Commonwealth budgetary transactions, interest rates, private sector external transactions and Reserve Bank transactions with the private sector. Other things being equal, take-up of government securities by the non-bank private sector provides an offset to the direct increase in banking sector liquidity and the volume of money that would otherwise accompany an increase in the domestic liquidity base. Changes in debt by the main forms of security are also shown. This, too, is relevant information for the analysis of the economic impact of Budget financing transactions, although a full exposition would go beyond the fairly direct effects of those transactions reflected in Table 2. Other relevant effects include those on the maturity structure of the stock of government debt in private portfolios, the level and structure of interest rates and associated expectations.

For any given level of domestic borrowings, increases in such holdings reduce private sector and Reserve Bank portfolios of net government debt. (c) Includes net take-up of Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and other government securities, as well as the Commonwealth Government's use of cash balances. (Such cash balances are an asset. of the Commonwealth so that their use increases the net indebtedness of the Budget sector.) See also footnote (b) to Table 1. (P) Preliminary. Table2 indicates that total non-official holdings of government securities rose by $2072 million in 1980-81, comprising an increase in Treasury Note holdings of $1617 million and in holdings of other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds and Australian Savings Bonds) of $455 million. Of the non-official take-up of government securities, the private non-bank sector increased its holdings of Treasury Notes by $573 million, but decreased its holdings of other government securities (including Australian Savings Bonds) by $16 million, while the banking sector increased its holdings of Treasury Notes by $1044 million and of other securities by $471 million. ON ISSUE As is evident from Table 1, financing transactions involve the issue, repurchase, redemption or acquisition of Commonwealth Government securities, or involve changes in other assets or liabilities of the Commonwealth Government. A reconciliation of the deficit with the net movement in securities on issue can therefore be made. (Details of securities on issue are published in Budget Paper No.6.) For this purpose, total financing can be dis aggregated as follows: Net sales of Commonwealth Government securities (new issues, less redemptions, less net purchases from balances(l) in the Trust Fund); less net purchases of other investments from Commonwealth Government balances in Trust Fund, plus other items of indebtedness (such as transactions of superannuation funds, and transactions associated with the issue of coin), plus use of cash balances and borrowings from the Reserve Bank.

(b) Includes adjustment of Australian currency equivalent of overseas debt following variations in rates of exchange; see Government Securities on Issue a/ 30 June 1981. (I) A distinction is drawn in this connection between Commonwealth Government and other balances in the Trust Fund. Commonwealth Government balances are those which record the receipt, expenditure and investment of Commonwealth Government money, while other balances are those which record moneys held in trust and invested on behalf of other sectors. The latter include the insurance deposits fund and a number of smaller funds; their transactions do not affect the size of the deficit, as any increase in liability for moneys received is matched by purchases of investments or additions to cash balances. This Statement presents information on Budget transactions since 1971-72 in both the functional and the national accounting classifications. It also provides data on transactions of the Commonwealth Non-Budget Sector and other parts of the public sector. . The national accounts classification categorises Budget transactions by economic type, within a framework which is broadly consistent with conventions recommended in the United Nations System of National Accounts. These conventions provide a consistent framework for the aggregation of Commonwealth, State and local government transactions into consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole. Their use also facilitates an assessment of the interrelationships between the Budget, other parts of the public sector and the rest of the economy. Thefunctional classification categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. It aims to facilitate consideration of the nature and relative priorities of Government outlays. The functional classification is based on that set out in A System of National Accounts and follows the same conventions for the determination of Budget totals as the national accounts classification. Additional information on the two classification systems is presented in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. The table below shows increases in both money and real terms in Commonwealth Budget outlays in each year since 1971-72 and the proportions of gross domestic product (GDP) represented by total outlays.

(b) Adjusted to remove payday effects, the underlying real growth implied is 0.9 per cent. (p) Preliminary. (e) Budget estimate. Budget outlays are projected to increase by 12.6 per cent in 1981-82. Adjusted for the forecast rise in prices as measured by the non-farm GDP deflator, the real increase is estimated to be 1.9 per cent. Part of the increase results from the need to provide in the estimates for an addition!!,l payday for Public Service wages and salaries and certain pensions and benefits. Precise estimates for the effects of the extra payday on individual pensions and benefits and departmental and statutory authorities' wage and salary estimates are not available, but an approximate indication of the influence of payday effects on the growth in total outlays between 1980-81 and 1981-82 can be made by adjusting outlays in both years to a 'constant number of paydays' basis. The rate of growth in outlays on this basis is reduced by about 1 per cent-from an unadjusted 12.6 per cent to an underlying growth of about 11.5 per cent or from 1.9 per cent to 0.9 per cent in real terms. Over the five years to 1980-81, real growth in outlays averaged a little over one per cent per annum. Despite strong growth in GDP in 1980-81, Budget outlays as a proportion of GDP edged up slightly, the increase in outlays being the largest since 1975-76. Present estimates imply that in 1981-82, despite the additional costs flowing from the payday effect, the ratio will resume the general downward path it has followed since 1975-76. Budget transactions for the period 1971-72 to 1980-81, together with estimates for 1981-82, are shown for the major functions in Table1 at the end of this Statement. Table2 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by each function over the period and Table3 shows percentage increases for each function from year to year. Table4 presents outlays data from Table1 in greater detail. Between 1971-72 and 1980-81, total Budget outlays increased at an average annual compound rate of 16.7 per cent (compared with 14.8 per cent for GDP). Outlays on education, health, and social security and welfare all increased significantly faster than the total and accounted for more than half the total increase over the period. 'Together these categories represented 45 per cent of total outlays in 1980-81, compared with 29 per cent in 1971-72. While part of this increase reflects changes in arrangements such as the assumption by the Commonwealth of full financial responsibility for universities andcolleges of advanced education in 1973-74 and the introduction of a scheme offamily allowances in lieu of taxation rebates in 1976-77, the major part of the growth reflects increases in standards of services provided and in numbers of beneficiaries (whether because of liberalised eligibility criteria, demographic change or economic conditions) in a situation where the value of many benefits has been maintained at an approximately constant level in real terms. The rate of increase of outlays on housing is affected by changes in funding arrangements. In 1971-72 and 1972-73 housing allocations were met by the States out of their Loan Council borrowing programs (shown under 'Payments to or for the States, etc.'), whereas in later years funds were provided under Housing Agreements (and shown under 'Housing'). If adjustments are made for this factor, the average annual rate of growth of outlays on housing becomes 4.7 per cent, and on 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Authorities nec' 15.3 per cent. A substantial increase in expenditure in 1980-81 largely accounts for the relatively high rate of growth in outlays on legislative services. Major factors in the increase were expenses associated with the Federal elections and the gearing-up of the Parliament House Construction Authority. Another function for which outlays increased at a high rate was 'Law, Order and Public Safety', but those outlays, like those on legislative services, remain a relatively small proportion of the total and accounted for little of the overall increase. On the other hand, about one-fifth of the overall increase in outlays was accounted for by payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities which cannot be allocated to other functions-not so much because of their rate of growth as because they form a large part of total outlays. Over the period as a whole, there have been significant reductions in the proportions of total outlays devoted to defence and certain economic services. Defence expenditure over this period reflected, inter alia, Australia's involvement in, and withdrawal from, the war in Vietnam. From 1978-79, however, defence outlays have accelerated significantly. The reduction in the relative importance of Budget outlays on economic services since 1971-72 reflects many factors, including the completion of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme am} repayments in recent years of earlier advances to the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the Australian Wool Corporation. In the area of industry assistance and development, particularly assistance to primary. industry, outlays can fluctuate markedly according to seasonal and international trading conditions. The main factor, however, has been reductions in advances to the Australian Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and the Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA) consequent upon those authorities funding more of their capital expenditure through internally generated funds and by borrowings on their own account. The following table shows the increases in the main categories of outlays over the period 1971-72 to 1980-81.

It is emphasised that comparisons of relative movements in different blocks of expenditure are affected by a number of important factors including, in addition to those mentioned above, the transfer of payroll tax to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefits schemes, changes in health c-re funding arrangements, the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth, the granting of self-government to the Northern Territory, and off-budget funding of the capital programs of Commonwealth authorities such as the Australian Telecommunications Commission. These and other factors, such as differential rates of price increase, affect relative rates of growth and must be borne in mind when comparing movements in different categories of expenditure.

The national accounts economic type classification provides information on Budget outlays in terms of direct expenditure on goods and services and transfers of income and capital funds to other sectors, ,namely the Commonwealth Non-Budget Sector, (he State and Local Government Sector (including the Northern Territory), the private sector and· overseas. This format enables Budget Sector transactions to be related to transactions elsewhere in the public sector (see the final section of this Statement and Budget Paper No. 10: National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities) and in the economy as a whole (see Budget Paper No.9: National Income and Expenditure). Table5 at the end of this statement shows Budget outlays classified by economic type and the following table shows increases in the main components over the period 1971-72 to 1980-81. Direct expenditure on goods and services has grown more slowly than GDP over the period, indicating that the BUdget's direct claim Oil resources has fallen. However, transfer payments have grown faster than GDP. In particular, there has been a substantial increase (from 22.5 per cent in 1971-72 to 31. 5 per ,cent in 1980-.81) in the' proportion of total outlays represented by cash benefits to persons(a) and this category accounts for over one-third of the total increase in outlays over the period. This growth largely parallels the increase referred to above in the proportion of outlays devoted to the functions 'Health' and 'Social Security and Welfare'. While from the viewpoint of the overall economy these transfers do not rep!,esent a direct call on the nation's final output, from the Commonwealth's point of view they do represent outlays that have to be financed and will in most cases lead to demands'by the recipients on the resources of the economy. They have a direct influence on the tax burden. It has already been noted that a higher proportion of Budget outlays, and therefore of the overall tax burden, is now directed towards transfer payments and a smaller proportion to the direct provision of goods and services. The degree of Commonwealth influence over the final manner of spending of funds which it transfers to other sectors varies greatly. For example, cash benefits to persons are preponderantly a form of income supplementation in the hands of those who receive them and can be spent as they wish. Payments to other levels of Government, which are an even larger proportion of Commonwealth outlays than are cash beneijts, fall into two categories. Certain payments are made for specific purposes and the Commonwealth thus exercises a high degree of influence, even though it does not itseif disburse the funds to individuals or enterprises in the private sector. General purpose funds, on the other hand, form an untied supplement to revenues of State, Northern Territory and local government authorities. Total payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities (grants and net advances) have increased slightly as a proportion of total outlays. Over the period 1971-72 to 1980-81 the component of these payments represented by general purpose funds which cannot be allocated to specific functions decreased as a proportion of total outlays. In the mid-1970s there was a significant shift in emphasis towards specific purpose payments, but by 1980-81 this had been partially reversed. The effect of recent changes in health funding arrangements (see the Appendix following this Statement) is to produce in the 1981-82 estimates a very substantial shift from specific purpose to general purpose payments. There has also been a shift in economic type from net advances to the States to grants. . (a) Now titled 'personal benefit payments' in Budget Paper No.9, National Income and Expenditure 1980-81. As already mentioned, in recent years Commonwealth authorities such as the Australian Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and TAA have borrowed on their own account to help finance their capital programs. This is reflected in a decline in the proportion of total Budget outlays represented by advances to such authorities.

Details of Commonwealth Budget receipts for the period 1971-72 to 1980-81, together with the 1981-82 estimates, are shown in Table6 at the end of this Statement. Total Budget receipts increased at an average annual compound rate of 16.5 per cent between 1971-72 and 1980-81 (compared with 16.7 per cent for outlays and 14.8 per cent for GDP); there were, however, major fluctuations in rates of growth over this period.

(b) Includes interest received from the Northern Territory. The charts on the following page show the relative importance of the various major categories of receipts over the past decade. They show that, over the longer term, the increase in importance of income tax on individuals as a source of revenue has been accompanied by decreases in the relative size of most of the other categories. The figures for personal income tax in the past five years reflect the net effects of, inter alia, the Government's decisions on personal income tax indexation and rate changes, the abolition of tax rebates for dependent children which accompanied the introduction of family allowances, and the imposition and subsequent removal of the Health Insurance Levy. Receipts from the crude oil and LPG levy have more than offset a decline in the relative importance of other excise duties. The decrease in 'Other General Taxation' reflects, inter alia, the transfer of payroll tax to the States in 1971 and the abolition of broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licences in 1974.

THE DEFICIT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS The following table shows the size of the total deficit in relation to GDP since 1971-72.

(e) Budget estimates. There is no satisfactory single m-asure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. The Budget deficit (or surplus) is sometimes taken as a shorthand or summary measure of budgetary impact but its use for this purpose is subject to some important qualifications. The deficit simply indicates the difference in total between outlays and receipts; it cannot adequately reflect the differing economic impacts of the various components of total outlays and receipts, or of changes in those components. The mix of Budget outlays and receipts, as well as their total size, can be very relevant to the assessment of the Budget's overall impact on the economy. It is also important to recognise, as is pointed out in the next section, that the Budget deficit is only part of the total deficit of the Commonwealth sector. In terms of their economic effects it is useful to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions. Government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes or to the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. In the table above overseas transactions have been netted out to arrive at estimates of domestic and overseas deficits (or surpluses). With substantial reductions in the overall deficit in 1979-80 and 1980-81 (after it had been at historically high levels for five years) there was a domestic surplus in 1980-81-the first since 1973-74. A larger domestic surplus is budgeted for in 1981-82. The size of the Budget deficit is of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally, as are the transactions by which the overall Budget deficit is financed. Table7 at the end of this Statement provides a summary of Commonwealth Government Budget Financing Transactions for each year since 1971-72. Budget Statement No.5 provides more detailed information about how the Budget deficit was financed in 1980-81. THE BUDGET AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS A WHOLE The Commonwealth Budget is only part-albeit an important part-of the public sector as a whole. The make-up of the total public sector is shown in the following diagram. r-1 ALL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES rl r fr This section outlines briefly the linkages between the Commonwealth Budget and the other parts of the public sector and indicates some broad 'trends in the public sector and its main components over the past decade. Table8 attached to this Statement sets out, in national accounts form, transactions of the total Commonwealth Sector for the period since 1971-72. This Sector comprises Commonwealth Budget transactions and transactions of Commonwealth authorities that operate outside the Budget, including the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, the Australian Shipping Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation, Qantas and TAA. Further information about the coverage of the Budget Sector and the Commonwealth Non-Budget Sector is provided in the Appendix following this Statement. The following table summarises the transactions of the two elements of the Commonwealth Sector in 1980-81.

As the table shows, the Budget covers the great bulk of total Commonwealth Sector outlays and receipts, but Non-Budget Sector transactions make important contri-, butions in certain areas. In particular, some three-quarters of Commonwealth direct capital expenditure is attributable to Non-Budget authorities. Until the mid-1970s almost all capital expenditure by authorities operating outside the Budget was financed by advances from the Budget and by the internally-generated funds of the authorities, concerned. Since then, however, a number of these authorities have undertaken substantial borrowing on their own account to help finance their capital programs. One_ consequence of this has been a substantial decline in the' proportion of the 'Non-Budget' deficit being met by advances from the Budget. In 1971-72 Budget advances more than covered the Non-Budget Sector deficit whereas in 1980-81 only 34 per cent of the deficit was met in that way.

(a) The deficits of this Sector have been financed in part by advances from the Budget Sector. TOT AL PUBLIC SECTOR The transactions of the Commonwealth Sector can be consolidated with those of the States and local government authorities to derive transactions of the public sector as a whole. These consolidated transactions provide a summary indicator of the extent of public sector competition for real and financial resources. Outlays The following table and Chart1 show outlays as proportions of GOP for the public sector as a whole and for each of the two major levels of government. Total public sector outlays in this table comprise both final expenditures on goods and services and transfer payments and net advances made by the public sector to other sectors of the economy.

(b) From 1978-79 the Northern Territory is treated as part of the State and Local Government Sector; before that year, it is treated as part of the Commonwealth Sector. (p) Preliminary. Expenditures on goods and services represent direct claims on the real resources of the economy. Transfers and advances to the private sector constitute a shift in the pattern of demand and also influence the overall level of demand. This shift occurs both through the payments made to the private sector and through the funding of those payments by taxation and government borrowing. In terms of their impact on governments' funding requirements, transfer payments and advances by governments are no different from final expenditure by them. Thus the total levels of public sector outlays have obvious implications for the availability of resources to the private sector. In the short run at least, strong growth in total public sector outlays-especially if not matched by increases in revenue-will increase competition for resources and give rise to, or accentuate, inflationary pressures. Over the longer term, there are implications for the mix of goods and services which are produced and the way economic activity is conducted. The levels of taxation associated with increased government spending can also have implications for incentives, wage demands and the allocation of resources within the economy. Chart 1.

Since that time there has been little change in the proportion for either the Commonwealth or the State and Local Government Sectors. The public sector's direct expenditure on goods and services, expressed as a percentage of GDP, is shown in the following table.

(ti) Preliminary. From these tables it can be deduced that just over half of the increase in public sector outlays as a proportion of GDP since 1973-74 has stemmed from increased direct demand for goods and services by the public sector. Transfers and advances to other sectors of the economy-such as cash benefits to persons, subsidies, and interest payments-have grown more strongly as a proportion of GDP. They now represent about one-third of total outlays but have contributed just under half the increase since 1973-74. The tables also show that the composition of total outlays differs significantly between the Commonwealth Sector and the State and Local Government Sector. In 1980-81 expenditure on goods and services represented 25 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays and 86 per cent of outlays of the State and Local Government Sector. As a result, over two-thirds of direct public sector demands for goods and services derive from State and local government. About ninety per cent of total transfer payments from the public to the private sector are provided directly by the Commonwealth. In 1980-81 transfer payments accounted for 74 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays and only 14 per cent of State and local government outlays. This difference in composition reflects the funding of a large part of State and local government outlays by payments from the Commonwealth. About 43 per cent of total Commonwealth transfer payments in 1980-81 comprised grants to the State and Local Government Sector. Receipts Over the decade to 1980-81 total public sector receipts have been dominated by Commonwealth Budget receipts which, in turn, have been dominated by income taxes. The following table shows trends in major public sector receipts as proportions of GDP: Receipts of Public Authorities as Proportions of GDP All Commonwealth All State and Authorities Local Authorities Grants from Income CommonAll Public Taxes (a) Total wealth Total Authorities Percent Percent Percent Percent Percent 1971-72 4.1 24.3 6.4 14.1 30.4 1972-73 13.3 22.8 6.5 14.4 29.1 1973-74 14.6 23.9 6.7 14.3 30.1 1974-75 16.4 25.3 8.4 16.0 31.6 1975-76 16.3 25.9 9.8 17.7 31.2 1976-77 16.8 26.6 9.2 17.3 33.4 1977-78 17.0 26.8 9.7 17.8 33.6 1978-79 15.7 26.1 9.5 17.4 32.8 1979-80 16.2 26.9 9.3 17.4 33.8 1980-81 (P) 17.2 27.9 9.2 17.3 34.9 (a) Comprises income taxes on companies and individuals and withholding tax. (p) Preliminary. The table shows that public sector receipts did not jump as sharply as outlays did in 1974-75. They nevertheless represented a significantly higher proportion of GDP,in 1980-81 than at the beginning of the period. A large part of this increase was due to growth in income taxes (on individuals in particular) levied by the Commonwealth. The fact that the State and Local Government Sector has maintained the higher ratio of outlays to GDP it achieved in 1974-75 reflects, inter alia, the transfer of an increased proportion of Commonwealth receipts to the State and Local Government Sector compared with the early 1970s. The proportion of Commonwealth receipts transferred to the States has declined slightly in more recent years. The Deficit and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement Total public sector outlays normally exceed receipts, with the resultant deficit financed by borrowing. Such borrowing can take several forms, and the ultimate effect upon the economy will vary according to the form chosen. Generally speaking, however, the higher the deficit and the associated borrowing requirement, the greater will be the pressures on domestic capital markets and hence upon interest rates. In terms of the borrowing possibilities open to them, an important distinction can be drawn between the Commonwealth Budget sub-sector and all other sub-sectors within the public sector, ie Commonwealth semi-government authorities and all State and local government authorities. For the latter, financing possibilities are limited to domestic capital raisings, short-term financing in forms such as trade credit and promissory note issues, use of cash balances and, in some cases, including the infrastructure program, borrowing in overseas capital markets. As mentioned below, the Commonwealth, on the other hand, has the additional avenue of financing of borrowing from the Reserve Bank. The borrowing requirement of semi-government authorities has increased substantially in recent years. The effect of this has been to increase competition for available funds, with consequential increases in interest rates in domestic capital markets. The implications of unrestrained competition from the public and private sectors are now widely understood in the markets and this has led to more frequent calls for greater restraint on public sector loan programs, especially in the semi-government area. It is perhaps less well understood that these pressures on capital markets and interest rates cannot be relieved by simply permitting semi-government authorities to raise their required funds in overseas markets. While such action may relieve immediate pressure upon domestic markets, any such relief will be very short-lived in the context of a given objective of monetary restraint. This is because as the overseas borrowings by such authorities are converted to Australian dollars through the banking system they result in an immediate injection of primary liquidity into the economy, and thus provide the basis for increased monetary growth. If those effects are to be offset, there will be a need for higher sales of Commonwealth securities to the non-bank sector than would otherwise be the case, and this will re-assert pressure upon domestic capital markets and interest rates. Thus there are considerations other than the size of its own deficit which also determine the extent to which the Commonwealth borrows from the non-bank private sector. In fact the Commonwealth's borrowings program is influenced by its objectives in relation to monetary management with the Commonwealth Budget deficit being an important factor in that regard. This is basically because the Commonwealth 'banks' with the Reserve Bank and the difference between the Budget's domestic outlays and receipts (the Budget domestic deficit or surplus) leads to a change in primary liquidity. Under current institutional arrangements the banking system operates on the basis of minimum LGS requirements and, to the extent that the change in primary liquidity is reflected in changes in bank holdings of LGS assets, there is a change in the rate of monetary growth both directly and through secondary credit creation by the banks. These changes result in an increase in money formation in the case of a domestic deficit and a decrease in the case of a domestic surplus. Given that the underlying task of monetary management remains one of restraining the growth of the monetary aggregates, it follows that the pursuit of that task is facilitated to the extent that the domestic Budget deficit is reduced or surplus increased. In other words, for any given set of economic and financial conditions a higher domestic Budget surplus reduces the need for liquidity to be withdrawn from the banking system by way of sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank 'sector. In that situation, pressures on interest rates will also be reduced below what they would otherwise be. While the Commonwealth Budget deficit is an important factor in monetary growth, it is not the sole factor in that growth, or in interest rate pressures. While reductions in the Budget deficit will result in a reduced need to sell Commonwealth Government securities to help finance the deficit, there could be a need to sell securities to achieve a particular monetary objective in the light of developments in respect of the other major money formation factors. If, for example, there were an excessive growth in primary liquidity through the external account there would be a need for this excess to be neutralised by sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank sector, whether or not there was a deficit financing requirement for such sales. There is also a distinction to be noted between the Commonwealth Budget subsector and other parts of the public sector in relation to overseas borrowing by each group. As noted above, overseas borrowings by public authorities other than by the Commonwealth Budget sub-sector lead to increases in primary liquidity. That is not the case for overseas borrowings by the Commonwealth where, again because the Commonwealth banks with the Reserve Bank, the conversion of foreign currency proceeds of overseas borrowings by the Commonwealth results in an increase in the Commonwealth's cash balances with the Reserve Bank rather than, as is the case for such borrowings by other parts of the public sector, in an increase in balances with the banking system. In summary, while there are distinctions to be noted regarding the effects of borrowing by different sectors and in different forms, it is true, of course, that reductions in the deficits of all parts of the public sector reduce governments' need to borrow and thus pressures on interest rates. Against that background, the following table indicates the progress that has been made towards reducing the public sector borrowing requirement in recent years. Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (Public Sector Deficit) Levels Proportions of GD P Commonwealth Commonwealth State State Budget Non-Budget and Local Total Budget Non-Budget and Local Total (a) (a) (a) (a) $ million $ million $ million $ million per cent per cent percent per cent 1971-72 134 -25 524 633 0.4 -0.1 1.4 1.7 1972-73 709 -46 333 996 1.7 -0.1 0.8 2.3 1973-74 293 72 460 825 0.6 0.1 0.9 1.6 1974-75 2566 -35 918 3449 4.2 -0.1 1.5 5.6 1975-76 3585 -40 454 3999 4.9 -0.1 0.6 5.5 1976-77 2740 306 979 4025 3.3 0.4 1.2 4.8 1977-78 3333 549 1568 5450 3.7 0.6 1.7 6.0 1978-79 3478 168 1891 5537 3.4 0.2 1.9 5.4 1979-80 2034 416 2\08 4558 1.8 0.4 1.8 4.0 1980-81(p) 1127 344 2708 4179 0.9 0.3 2.1 3.2 (a) Because the deficits of Commonwealth non-budget authorities and of State and Local authorities are financed in part, by advances from the Commonwealth Budget the borrowing requirements of those authorities are reduced to that extent. The figures shown here are net of these advances, to indicate the residual borrowing requirement of those sub-sectors. (b) Preliminary. The main features of the table are: the sharp increase in the total PSBR in 1974-75, associated in the main with a marked increase in the Commonwealth Budget deficit; the steady decline in the total PSBR in recent years, again attributable largely to developments in relation to the Commonwealth Budget deficit; and the tendency for the PSBR of the State and local sub-sector to expand, both in nominal terms and as a proportion of GDP, in recent years. The substantial reduction in the Commonwealth Budget deficit estimated for 1981-82 will contribute to a further reduction in the total PSBR this financial year. The total borrowing requirement of the State and locai sub-sector in 1981-82 cannot be estimated at this stage. The Loan Council borrowing programs for these authorities have been determined and provide for a smaller increase than in recent years. Their overall requirements, however, will depend also on the extent to which their capital expenditure programs are restrained and/or recourse is had to increased internal financing or short-term financing methods. On present indications, however, the total PSBR is likely to decline somewhat in 1981-82, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP. Wherever possible, the definitions and concepts adopted for the historical series are the same as those used in Statement No.3 and Statement No.4 (although the tables of outlays presented here provide less detail than do those in Statement No.3). To the extent practical, historical data have been adjusted to eliminate major breaks in series; however, some important changes affecting comparability cannot readily be removed and are mentioned below. Major discontinuities are indicated in the tables where appropriate. In the case of outlays (Tables1 to 4), changes to the functional classification from time to time require revisions to historical data in the tables. The figures therefore differ in some respects from those shown in the Budget Statements in previous years. Significant changes to the financial classification are noted each year in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations were to be met by States out of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. Tables1 to 4 show these amounts classified to 'Payments to or for the States, etc.' instead of 'Housing'. At the Premiers' Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth Government would cease to levy payroll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own payroll taxes as from that date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth payroll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, the Commonwealth reduced its financial assistance grants to the States in 1971-72. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of Commonwealth Budget outlays and receipts below the rates that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and by about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. The assumption by the Commonwealth Government in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education contributed to an increase in outlays classified to 'Education' but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. As a consequence, the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown for the function 'Education' in 1973-74;, is somewhat over-stated. A similar effect occurred in 1974-75, which was the first full financial year of the new tertiary education arrangements. Changes in the operation of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect outlays for 1973-7iland subsequent years under the relevant functions and receipts under the heading 'Other Taxes, Fees and Fines-Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions'. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of a new Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme on 1 July 1976 gave rise to similar effects. The scheme of Family Allowances introduced in 1976-77 involved the abolition of taxes rebates for dependent children and students, offset by substantial increases in family allowances in place of child endowment. The effect of this measure was to increase significantly the level of outlays under the 'Social Security and Welfare' function in 1976-77, and to increase receipts from personal income taxation above what they would otherwise have been. On1 July 1978 the Northern Territory became a self-governing territory. Responsibilities transferred to the Ministers of the Territory from that date were mainly of a State-type character, as were the responsibilities transferred on 1 January 1977. In terms of financial arrangements, 1977-78 and 1978-79 were transitional years. During those years the Commonwealth provided the bulk of its assistance to the Northern Territory through global (general purpose) allocations which were recorded under the heading 'Not Allocated to Function-Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. Prior to 1977-78, outlays on the Northern Territory were undertaken as direct Commonwealth outlays, rather than payments to the Territory, and were classified under appropriate functional headings. From 1979-80 Commonwealth financial arrangements with the Northern Territory miror those which exist between the Commonwealth and the States. In place of a global allocation, the Territory receives a combination of specific purpose and general purpose payments, the former classified to the relevant functions and the latter to 'Not Allocated to Function-Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. Grants to the States for pensioner accommodation in 1977-78 and previous years are recorded under 'Social Security and Welfare'. In 1978-79 the scope of this scheme was extended to allow wider eligibility and to give the States greater flexibility in the application of the grants. In the light of these changes, grants under this program in 1978-79 and later years are now classified to the 'Housing' function .. The estimates of outlays for 1981-82 shown in the tables reflect changes in health funding arrangements. Specific purpose payments in respect of hospital operating costs (for N.S.W., Vic., Qld, WA., and the N.T.), and community health and school dental services, recorded under the function 'Health' in previous years, have been replaced by general purpose grants, shown under 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec'. -....

This Appendix briefly describes the coverage of information and the basic principles and uses of the classifications. Most of the information in the Budget Statements relates to the Commonwealth Budget sector. The Commonwealth Budget sector comprehends those transactions which are recorded in the Minister for Finance's statements prepared pursuant to section 50 of the Audit Act 1901. It includes all transactions passing through the Commonwealth Public Account, whether recorded in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund or Loan Fund. All transactions of the National Capital Development Commission are also analysed within the Budget sector. Other transactions of Commonwealth authorities (i.e. largely those transactions which are not directly recorded in the Public Account), with the exception of transactions of Commonwealth-owned financial enterprises, constitute the Commonwealth Non-Budget sector. la ) In addition, transactions of the Defence Service Homes Corporation, which pass through a Trust Account within the Public Account, are analysed in the Non-Budget sector to allow consistency in the an!l.lysis of transactions over the period covered; from June 1975 to December 1976 the Australian Housing Corporation, which operated outside the Public Account, administered the Defence Service Homes Scheme. All the transactions of departments are recorded in the Public Account and are accordingly part of the Budget sector. Furthermore, many Commonwealth authorities, such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the CSIRO and the Industries Assistance Commission operate largely or wholly through the Public Account; to the extent that they do, their transactions form part of the Budget sector. Those of their transactions which do not pass through the Public Account (e.g. independent income and expenditure financed from that income) are recorded in the Non-Budget sector. By far the larger part of the Non-Budget sector, however, consists of the transactions of authorities which operate wholly or largely outside the Public Account; these are mainly business enterprises such as the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and the Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA). Most of the transactions of such authorities are not reflected in the Budget Statements. There are, however, some transactions between (a) Transactions of Commonwealth financial enterprises, which include the Reserve Bank, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, are analysed in the National Accounts as part of the Financial Enterprises Sector. the Budget sector and the Non-Budget sector (e.g. advances from the Budget to an authority, repayments of advances and payments of interest, dividends and, in some cases, company tax by the authority to the Budget sector). These transactions by authorities with the Public Account are reflected in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions recorded in the Commonwealth Non-Budget sector is presented separately and also consolidated with transactions of the Commonwealth Budget sector in the document National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities published as Budget Paper No. 10. In addition, some information on this sector is included in Budget Statement No.6. Underlying the classifications of information in the Budget Statements are national accounting conventions used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in producing data for the Commonwealth sector and for the economy as a whole. While there are some differences between the treatment of data in the Budget Statements and the treatment in Australian Bureau of Statistics publications (see below), the basic principles are generally the same and are those set out in the 1968 United Nations publication A System of National Accounts, which provides a widely accepted international standard. The use of national accounting conventions allows a consistent treatment of Budget transactions, other public sector transactions, and the transactions of the private sector. Their use thus facilitates an assessment of the interrelationship between the Budget and rest of the economy. A basic distinction is made in the Budget Statements between 'above the line' transactions-outlays and receipts, the difference between which is the deficit-and 'below the line' transactions-transactions undertaken to finance the deficit. Budget financing transactions are transactions in, or giving rise to, financial assets or liabilities and consist of borrowings and changes in holdings of financial assets such as cash and investments recorded in the Public Account, but excluding advances to other sectors. Such advances are more akin to direct expenditures and transfer payments in their impact and are accordingly classified above the line as outlays. Budget outlays consist of expenditure on goods and services, transfer payments (such as cash benefits(Q), grants and interest), and advances. Budget receipts consist of taxes together with interest, dividends, gross operating surpluses of Budget sector business enterprises, and proceeds from sales of existing assets. These categories are used in the National Accounts presentation of information in the Budget Statements. The adoption of national accounting conventions requires that the receipts and outlay figures in the Statements show the net transactions of the Budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important implications of this treatment are as follows: (a) The transactions of the three Funds forming the Commonwealth Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, an appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund paid to a Trust Account through which ordinary government expenditure is channelled (e.g. the Housing and (a) Now titled 'personal benefit payments' in Budget Paper No.9, National Income and Expenditure. Construction Services and Transport and Storage Trust Accounts and various research funds) and the receipt of that transfer from Consolidated Revenue by the Trust Account are netted and not themselves shown as part of either aggregate receipts or outlays; rather the expenditure of the Trust Account is shown in outlays. Thus only transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy are presented. (b) Budget outlays are intended to show the net extent to which resources are directed through the Budget to other sectors of the economy. Therefore, recoveries and repayments (usually recorded as Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts) are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net figures. For example, air navigation charges paid by airlines are offset against outlays on the provision of civil aviation services. Similarly, repayments of principal on advances are offset against the corresponding advances. (c) Budget tax receipts are shown net of refunds. Thus income tax receipts, for example, are shown net of refunds of PAYE deductions. Similarly,remissions and reimbursements of import duties and sales tax are offset against taxation collections. Budget receipts include gross operating surpluses from activities in the Budget sector which are carried out as business-type enterprises, i.e. operating revenues less operating expenses other than depreciation. Dividends, etc. from Commonwealth business enterprises outside the Budget sector (which are usually paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund) are also included in Budget receipts. (d) Some Consolidated Revenue Fund transactions are classified as financing transactions. For example, some loan redemptions are met by appropriations . of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. (e) Certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important . of these are interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading 'Public Debt Interest', while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. A reconciliation between total outlays shown in Statement No.3 and the appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund is set out in Tables1 and 2 of Budget Paper No.4, Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure. A fuller account of the principles and methods used in the national accounting presentation of Budget data is set out in the Appendix to the supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities, September 1974. As mentioned earlier, the principles are essentially conceptually consistent with those used by the Australian Statistician in his publications but with the significant difference that outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements net of the relevant primary industry levies and charges whereas the Statistician shows these outlays on a gross basis. It should also be noted that in the Statistician's publications separate data are not provided on transactions of the Commonwealth Budget sector and transactions of the Commonwealth Non-Budget sector; the two sectors are aggregated to show the transactions of the Commonwealth sector as a whole. THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION The functional classification brings together outlays directed towards like objectives or purposes. It thus facilitates presentation of information on the functional nature of Government activities and on the total resources devoted by the Commonwealth to those objectives or purposes. The classification is based on that set out in A System of National Accounts referred to earlier, and is essentially the same as that used in Australian Bureau of Statistics publications. The contents of each function are described briefly in the final section of this Appendix. The major functions are, of course, relatively aggregative in nature, but Statement No.3 also shows outlays under each functional heading further dissected into sub-functions and individual expenditure blocks which lend themselves to more detailed comment and analysis. Within each function a separate line shows any departmental administrative outlays which are classified to that function but which cannot, for practical reasons, be allocated to particular sub-functions. One limitation on the extent to which data can be dissected into detailed purpose oriented sub-functions or programs arises from the need to monitor and report monthly on actual outlays and receipts on a basis consistent with the annual estimates. To meet this need it has been necessary in practice to work largely from existing central accounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than being detailed costing documents. The figures in the functional classification, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented by a limited amount of additional data on large appropriation items which cover more than one function or purpose. Functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. For this reason, votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department lJlay be classified under more than one functional heading, and it is not always possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Budget Statements. Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the allocation of Government outlays to the broad purposes for which they are undertaken, such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions: military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme therefore requires that an outlay be classified to a particular function; in this classification, that which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example quoted, the primary function is considered to be defence; this treatment is in line with United Nations recommendations. Any single classification system cannot, of course, focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to all users. Statement No.3 brings together all Budget outlays undertaken for similar purposes, whichever department is responsible for them. To provide information on Ministerial responsibilities in relation to each function, a separate document shows a detailed functional breakdown of the outlays within each Minister's portfolio. This document, Functional Classification of Outlays-Departmental Estimates, which is made available shortly after the Budget, indicates how much is contributed by each department to functions in which more than one department is involved. Supplementary information on particular aspects of outlays is also provided in other documents. The document Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure has already been mentioned; it presents detailed information on receipts, special appropriations and Loan Fund expenditures, and also provides details of estimates for some statutory authorities which are largely financed from the Budget. A separate Budget Paper is provided on Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities.· Other Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech deal with the Civil Works Program and Australia's Overseas Development Assistance Program. From time to time it is necessary to amend the functional classification to reflect changes in the organisation and coverage of government activities. Furthermore, additional information sometimes becomes available that leads to appropriation items being reclassified or allows items that had previously been classified to a single function to be split between functions. Changes have been made this year to the classification of expenditures on a number of programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs: grants-in-aid for community management and services ($14.5 million in 1981-82) have been reclassified from 'Aboriginal Advancement Programs nec' within the 'Social Security and Welfare' function to 'Other Urban Development and Amenities' within 'Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment'. This change brings the treatment of these grants-in-aid into line with that accorded to similar grants to the States; the operating expenses of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner ($0.2 million in 1981-82), which relate to claims by Aboriginals for traditional land, have been reclassified from 'Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment' to 'Social Security and Welfare-Aboriginal Advancement Programs nec'; payinents to the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account of amounts equal to royalties in respect of mining on Aboriginal land ($5.9 million in 1981-82) were previously classified as 'Industry Assistance and Development-Mining'. These payments primarily serve a welfare purpose, and have been reclassified to 'Social Security and Welfare-Aboriginal Advancement Programs nee'. The Budget treatment of transactions relating to borrowings by companies from the Commonwealth uranium stockpile and subsequent returns of concentrates to the stockpile has been altered to accord with that adopted by the Australian Statistician 'in his publications dealing with public sector transactions. Amounts equivalent to the net proceeds of sale of the borrowed concentrate are paid by the companies to the Commonwealth and repayments are made when the concentrates are returned. Previously Commonwealth receipts from this source were shown as receipts from sale of existing assets. In the 1981-82 Budget statements these amounts are treated as reductions in stocks and netted off outlays within the mining industry section of the 'Industry Assistance and Development' function. (Payments made in respect of returned concentrates continue to be shown within that function, but in terms of the national accounts classification are now treated as increases in stocks rather than purchase of existing assets). The effect of this change is to reduce both Budget outlays and receipts by the amounts concerned ($5.8 million in the estimates for 1981-82). In addition to these changes in the classification of certain items, minor amendments have been made this year to the structure of the functional classification. The blocks within the function 'Labour and Employment' have been restructured to allow a fuller presentation of information on outlays on employment programs, particularly training schemes. Within 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec', the General Revenue Assistance block takes account of changes in health funding arrangements under which certain specific purpose payments have been replaced by general purpose grants. Historical data for the period 1971-72 to 1980-81 classified by function are presented in Statement No.6. Because data classified by function are derived from the appropriation accounting system, adjustments to the historical series are constrained by the availability of data in that system. In particular, significant changes to departmental administrative arrangements have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent series of outlays for the period covered in the Budget Statements. Wherever possible the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by sub-costing and regrouping appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies. Information on the significant discontinuities that remain in historical data is given in the section 'Notes on Tables' at the end of Statement No.6. The following notes indicate briefly the nature and scope of the net outlays encompassed under each functional heading; they are not intended to provide a definitive listing of the contents of each category. 1.
