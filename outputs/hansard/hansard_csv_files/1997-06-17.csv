All shareholdings of less than 1% in the company are treated as if they were held by a single notional entity. This means that the company does not have to trace through to the persons who beneficially own those shares. A similar rule applies if another listed public company is interposed between the company and those persons. All shareholdings of less than I % in the interposed company are treated as if they were held by a different single notional entity. This means that the company does not have to trace through the interposed company to the persons who beneficially own those shares in the interposed company.

Ms HANSON (Oxley) (4.31 p.m.)-In rising this afternoon to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98, I would like to acknowledge that fiscal responsibility is essential if we are to attempt to bring the economy back into balance and reduce our foreign debt. It is one of the most unfortunate elements of the Labor Party's recent 13-year tenure in government that this nation was brought to the verge of financial ruin by the Labor Party's policies. These policies were implemented in an environment where arrogance, political correctness and public vilification became standard operating procedures for the Keating regime. The Labor Party became distant from the people of Australia and suffered the consequences that it deserved. But what has changed? The Labor Party and its tame lobbyists have continued to operate as if the Labor Party was still in government, attacking anyone who would dare to think that the Keating government's solutions were not the sole legitimate path that this nation should follow into the foreseeable future. As a critic of Keatingism, and all of the unsavoury things that it stood for, I have been publicly attacked by Labor in unison, even though a good percentage of the Labor Party would rather dance on the former Prime Minister's grave than on mine. Members of the coalition would do well to consider what is happening. The things I have said have been taken out of context and twisted for simple political gain. Almost every attack on me has also been used as a camoutlaged attack on the coalition and especially on the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). What this government needs to do-and this budget is the most appropriate vehicle-is to change direction and move away from the proven failure of Keatingism.",112,Adjournment Organised Hy The Church
235,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 4.30 P.m.,"5456 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 The coalition must recognise the frustration that many people in Australia feel. Even many of those who do not support me recognise that there is something wrong with our political process and with the recent performance of governments. It is not good enough on the one hand to talk about fiscal responsibility and balancing the books whilst on the other allowing government agencies to operate in a way that goes on to waste hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. My condemnation of the performance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is well known. I do not continue these statements against it out of hatred or even dislike for Aboriginal people. Anyone who has listened to what I have had to say will know that I want to abolish ATSIC because it does not work. I accept that there have been some successes that ATSIC has achieved. These have generally been small successes in the areas of cultural and artistic development. I do not wish to demean these achievements but I do ask why Australians have spent billions of dollars on Aboriginal welfare over the past 20 or 30 years to achieve outcomes many of which are worse than before the money was spent. If ATSIC were any other government department, it would have been dragged kicking and screaming into the public eye, where its senior management would have been sacked and public accountability would have been forced. Now, to say that ATSIC should in some way perform to public expectations on expenditure of public money becomes a racist act. What better way to hide the poor performance of ministers, public servants and members of ATSIC? I believe that there has been such an enormous waste of taxpayers' money that the public need to know what has happened. They also need to know the extent to which government, especially the Labor government, has been involved in this waste through inaction. To this end, I call upon this government to immediately set up a royal commission into the operations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I would like to see such a royal commission investigate all aspects of Aboriginal welfare and funding. Calling for such a royal commission is not a racist act, though I am sure it will be reported as such by the time. I finish this speech. WhatI want to see is an investigation to let us know what has been going on so that we can fix it. Aboriginal people and the broader Australian population deserve it. Unless we fix the way that ATSIC operates we will never see any improvement in the welfare of Aboriginal people. They will never get the support from government that they deserve as Australian citizens unless government shows the courage to treat Aborigines in the same way as it treats other Australians. Aboriginal health is the best example of how a policy of deliberate affinnative action without responsibility has failed. It has been estimated that Australian governments have poured over $30 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Aboriginal industry since the late 1960s. Of that, $69.7 million was spent on Aboriginal health in 1994 alone. Even one of my critics, the Governor General, has reported that health outcomes in many aspects are now worse than before the money was spent. How can that be? Where has the money gone? What mistakes are we making? How can we stop making these mistakes'? What should we be doing instead so that we can improve the welfare of Aboriginal people? Surely these are all realistic questions that need answers. I believe that the political correctness that now passes for debate in this country has taken such a hold that a royal commission is perhaps the only way that we will get to the bottom of this issue. Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5457 But there are more aspects that need investigation than Aboriginal health. The New South Wales government's Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into the New South Wales Land Council has shown that over a period of many years there has been systematic incompetence, lack of accountability and evidence of substantial fraud related to Aboriginal funding. The vast majority of Aboriginal people who this money was meant for have never seen, and will never see, any benefits from it. Whose fault is it? Was it the fault of the people who wasted the money, or of the governments who refused to put in place the proper kinds of measures to safeguard the interests of the Aborigines this money was to go to? Who are the real racists here: the people who claim that what has been happening is wrong or those who want to perpetuate it? Many people in the Aboriginal community are just as frustrated with what is happening. Sharon Firebrace has called for a royal commission because something has to be done to stop certain leaders and factions betraying their own people. A royal commission is necessary to determine the full extent of mismanagement of services to the Aboriginal community. Beatrice Faust says that giving money to ATSIC is like carrying water in a basket. The Aboriginal defence against greater accountability is typified by something said by Lois O'Donohue: 'I ask why indigenous Australians never need to be more accountable than anyone else, for comparatively small amounts of money.' This is one of the people who have accused me of being out of touch with reality. It is demonstrably clear to anyone who will keep an open mind that in fact the standards of accountability are lower for Aboriginal people. The truth is that they should not be. We do not want an Uncle Tom mentality and not require transparency and accountability. Aborigines must take responsibility-but anyone who, like me, has stood up and insisted on equal treatment and on greater accountability is accused of racism. Like the rest of the Australian community, Aborigines want their representatives to listen and act in the best interests of their constituents. We here in parliament know of the public's obsession with parliamentary travel expenses and accusations of travel rorts which have filled the press in recent times. We have determined that we need to be subject to special accountability to ensure that the taxpayer has a transparent view of how we spend the money given to us for these purposes, but what about ATSIC commissioners? They are paid far more than members and senators, they represent a much smaller and less diverse constituency, and yet we are not to ensure that they are also accountable for their travel expenses. We really have to get serious about this. As honourable members know, I believe that all Australians need to be treated equally. We cannot continue to fund an organisation which does not achieve the objectives for which it was set up and seeks to divide our nation. The second aspect of my speech that I want to cover today deals with native title and Wik. I was born in this country and am proud to be an Australian. I do not like to be accused of being responsible for things that were done by other people. I was not responsible for the stolen generation, although I am genuinely sorry for those who have suffered. I know that these things did happen, but I cannot apologise to those people on behalf of others because I have no right to. I believe that it would simply add to the politicising of an issue which has been deliberately manipulated by a minority. I am also sorry for those Aborigines who have lost access to traditional lands since colonisation, but I am opposed to any move by an intellectual elite to tum this country upside 5458 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, l7 June 1997 down by giving Australia back to the Aborigines. Clarrie Isaacs, who is one of my Aboriginal critics in Western Australia, actually proposes handing back 100 per cent of this country to an Aboriginal government and then having the rest of us lease it back under a crown land lease arrangement. Recently, we have seen Aboriginal claims on more than just the land. Fishing rights in Australia are also under threat. Claims now extend over significant parts of the sea. In August last year an Elcho Islander, Mr Terry Yumbulul, said that because white Australia has been responsible for 150 years of scraping and fishing on the bottom of the sea, we should pay compensation for the loss of fish. There are 150 claims involving water-60 in Western Australia and 30 in Queensland. Who is going to pay to defend the rights of the fishing industry, and what will the effect of these claims be on investment in one of Australia's premier export industries? I am criticised for speaking out because it is alleged I am affecting Australia's trade, an allegation made up in the minds of Australia's two great representatives, Tim Fischer and Alexander Downer. Here is another example of how Mabo and native title are destroying prospects for Australian jobs. Another area that I wish to talk on today is the child support scheme. The child support scheme has become a very unworkable scheme. Children are being used as pawns in an often bitter and unpleasant experience which often results in the non-custodial parent being left angry and frustrated by what appears to be an arbitrary and unjust system. Those who perceive themselves as losers in the process sometimes become suicidal, depressive and vindictive. It is no coincidence that some have turned to murder or other forms of violence as a consequence. On the other hand, some custodial parents are left with the full financial burden of raising the children of the relationship with little or no help from non-custodial parents. In many cases, non-custodial parents will throw in their jobs and go onto welfare to avoid paying excessive maintenance. I would like to see the use of net wages as the basis for the calculation of child support to make the system fairer and more likely to be honoured by non-custodial parents. Custodial parents can earn up to $42,000 before maintenance calculations are affected. If they are living in a de facto relationship, the partner's income is not taken into account. This is grossly unfair. In many instances, the maintenance-paying parent is living in virtual poverty, while the custodial parent can afford to have a relatively higher standard of living. This was not the intent of the process in the first place. Non-custodial parents' wages should only be calculated on a normal working week's pay, without overtime or penalty payments being taken into consideration. If non-custodial parents choose to have a second job, this also should not be taken into account. There should be an incentive for non-custodial parents to feel able to reorganise their lives to take their new circumstances into account. Maintenance should not be a ticket to poverty for non-custodial parents. Ironically, those who do the right thing are virtuaIIy punished for their troubles, while those who walk away from their responsibilities seem to get away with it. When kids spend school holidays with non-custodial parents, unfortunately the effect is that the parents end up paying Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5459 twice because they not only pay to feed, clothe and nurture their children directly, but they are also stilI paying maintenance to the other parent. It is impossible to devise a fair scheme which relies on the judgment of officers of the department who are overworked, unsympathetic and, in many cases, burnt out by the sheer volume and nature of the inquiries they are handling. This means many parents are treated in an arbitrary way which puts them under unnecessary stress and makes a difficult situation even worse. How can you honestly expect officers under these conditions to respond in a way that can soothe the anger and frustration of parents in the system? The Australian Family Court should show more support for joint custodial arrangements because, according to research by Professor WilIiam Bender of Georgia University, children adjust much better to divorce when they are cared for in joint custody. There are over 400,000 non-custodial parents in the community. The government must take action and not leave the child support system in the too hard basket. The government should have a good look into the child support scheme because a lot of parents-custodial parents and non-custodial parents-are hurting. The government must take a good look at the system. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.50 p.m. to 5.02 p.m. were absolutely brilliant, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the last point made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) regarding the Child Support Agency. I could comment on a number of the things she said here today, but I will not take the opportunity. In regard to the Child Support Agency, the government has had a backbench subcommittee set up for the past six months, and we have reported to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). We have already stated in the press that the government, the Prime Minister and the cabinet have made a commitment to address this problem on the Prime Minister's return from overseas and that we will endeavour, to the best of our ability, given the time constraints and the amount of legislation to go through the parliament, to have the legislation reforming the Child Support Agency come into the parliament before the end of this year. I would hate to think that the member for Oxley is being an opportunist in trying, once again, to ride on the back of the fine work that has been done by the government. She tends to take credit for everything that others do and, in the meantime, merely puts up what are, in many cases, false arguments of her own. I must say, though, that some of the points she raised today are very accurate. There is obviously a lot of discontent and concern with the Child Support Agency. But, unlike the member for Oxley, this government is actually addressing the problem for the betterment of the people concerned, and particularly the children. My purpose in rising today is to talk about the Australian inland rail expressway. Australia is a wonderful country which has many great assets: our weather, our open and clean environment, and the many rights that we enjoy here. When foreigners come to Australia, either for tourism or any other purpose, they are often struck by the enormous distances that they are faced with in travelling from one place to another. We take it in our stride, but the reality is that, for every plus that we have in being such a large, open nation, we also have the negative of the great distance and, therefore, the cost of transport of our goods and",115,Represent Atives Main Committee
236,Mr Brough (Longman) (4.49 P.m.),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speak.er",119,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Brough,"BeforeI recommence my speech proper, the first three seconds of which5460 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 services, both to our domestic and export markets. It takes both time and money for Australia even to get its exports to the ports before they leave our shores bound for overseas markets. The Australian inland rail is not a new idea and I certainly cannot claim it as my own. I believe it was Ben Chifley's government that first said that we did not have the money as a nation to go ahead with this project. That was after World War II, when it was decided it was needed for defence. I think that particular reason has not changed to this day. With us moving more of our troops to the north, we realise that our roads are already at capacity and that if we do not control the seaways in any time of conflict, how do we resupply ourselves? Aircraft is not the answer, given the great distances and the amount of goods that would be required to sustain any effort in the unfortunate event of us being attacked. More immediately, we have a concern as a nation that we have export earnings being wasted because we are not competitive. There are many reasons for that, but the one that I want to focus on today is our transport cost. In my electorate, the Lockyer Valley is a small crops area where we have the potential to be part of the supermarket to Asia program, which can realise $2 billion worth of exports for Australia. Unfortunately, the cost of actually getting that product to the Asian markets in time for it to be used in a fresh state is so prohibitive that it makes that very difficult. There are some advances there. But the Australian inland rail express-which will be running from Darwin, down through Mount Isa, through central Queensland, west of the Great Divide, through the Riverina of New South Wales and finally into Victoria-can for the first time open up the west of the Great Divide and the great basin of inland Australia, which has such enormous potential. For one example, in the mineral industry, look at Mt Isa Mines. For this company, it costs four times as much to move ore from the Mount Isa mine to the port at Townsville as it does to move their ore a comparable distance from their mines in South America. It is actually quicker and cheaper for them to use road than rail here. That is an appalling state, where we are compromising our opportunities as an export nation because of the inefficiency of our rail system and our transport system. Furthermore, by having so many trucks on the road, we do enormous damage to our infrastructure. We have also seen many fatal accidents as a result of fatigued truck drivers working incredibly long hours simply to keep Australia on the move. This particular rail project is very visionary. It is estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of $10 billion. But the reason I am attracted to it is because they are not, as a consortium, asking for any federal or state government funding. I think that has been one of the reasons, from the time of Chifley, that this project has not gone ahead, because there has always been a great demand for federal and state funding. We have seen AN and its current demise. I guess that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that governments are not the best people to run rail. But this project we are talking about is not a conventional railway. We are talking about a railway line that can move heavy exports, heavy freight, from Melbourne to Darwin at over 160 kilometres an hour, with trains over a kilometre long. You can imagine the number of trucks that would be required to be able to move the same amount of freight. Ught freight, such as fruit and vegetables, can be moved at something in the vicinity of 250 kilometres per hour. This will ensure that we can get our products to the port of Darwin, a large deepwater port which can facilitate exports to our near northern neighbours, so that we can get fresh fruit, Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5461 vegetables and other produce, as well as the myriad of other exports, onto the shelves very quickly. A few of the other benefits of this project are that we will no longer be required to tie up our southern ports to the same degree. Currently, we have many of our imports and exports travelling via the Great Barrier Reef-and we all know the dangers should there be a spill of some consequence. I believe that it is only a matter of time before something disastrous occurs on the reef, to the detriment of us all. So if we can remove that potential for damage from the reef. that is yet another benefit that this project can have. There are also other benefits to Australia. Rather than just looking at the straight exporting of our beef, our wool and our grains, et cetera, we should also look at what has happened to the west of the Great Divide over the last 50 years. My grandparents moved from Charleville with my mother and her brother and sister approximately 50 years ago. I think it was about that time, at the end of the Second World War, when we first saw the demise of so many of these country towns; towns that were set up because of the distances in Australia. The towns were there to support the sheep stations and the cattle properties around them. But now, with the advent of very fast air travel, many property owners travel to other places to do their shopping. In Queensland they travel into Toowoomba to do their shopping. They bypass the country towns, and the very purpose of the existence of the towns no longer exists. You cannot make an artificial reason for having these towns-you cannot manufacture a reason. There has to be a purpose for them. I believe that the inland rail will provide that purpose. It will encourage business to relocate to these areas-whether it be Dubbo or Parkes or Deniliquin or anywhere else on the Queensland route-so that they can take advantage of the open spaces, the obviously cheaper land and the very quick access to foreign ports. I have made a promise to my whip and, being good to my word, I will keep my speech to about 10 minutes duration today due to the constraints of time. I want the House to appreciate that this is not a pipedream. People have looked at numerous projects over the years and decided that they were just too big and too unachievable. This is not just achievable; it will occur. I believe it will occur through the enterprise of private business, and that it will be running within the next decade. TomorrowI am attending a meeting in Sydney when a formal board will be set up and a company established. I am pleased to be able to announce that tomorrow should see KPMG begin the first revenue study to identify who can actually utilise this railway. This is a high risk venture, but I believe it will be the turning point in Australia's history. History will record its creation as the moment when Australia became a great nation and when we fulfilled our complete and total potential rather than the partial potential which we have been attempting to reach over the last two to three decades. on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98 by making a tremendous apology.

I understand that, at the weekend, people indicated to the minister that Glenn Close and Frances McDormand were not Australians, so he will be a real rival to these film commentators. But today in question time he made a more telling point against me: that I made the mistake of assuming that the budget expenditure on war graves overseas would do a lot",119,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (5.L3 P.m.),"I commence this contribution to the debate5462 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 more than now appears to be the case. He clarified, I have got to admit, a few days ago that the money will only be utilised in New Guinea. I have got to make a dreadful apology. Whilst commending this initiative-and, as he well knows, I have written to him about war cemeteries overseas-I made the comment that the money devoted by the current government to the improvement of war cemeteries was perhaps the greatest job creation program in this budget, and that it was ironic that the jobs would be created overseas rather than in western Sydney. He is correct in saying the jobs will be created in Papua New Guinea and not in Malaysia, and I apologise for that error on my part. But I think the minister should perhaps fully concentrate on the crucial matters in this budget. I am not disputing for one moment that commemoration is a crucial aspect of the portfolio, but bread and circuses are not the entire portfolio. Commemoration, war memorials and all these things which we all support and which have had bipartisan endorsement in this country for decades will not confuse the veterans of this country in regards to more fundamental challenges to their conditions. It is interesting to note that many speeches these days by the minister seem, for some strange reason, to be totally preoccupied with this aspect of the budget. I want to say here today that there are deeper concerns with this portfolio than the questions of Paradise Road and how many presentations of cheques he is going to make around the country. I want to cover some aspects of that. In regard to the overall DVA resources, the average staff numbers for the Veterans' Affairs portfolio for the 1997-98 financial year will be cut by 61 O-from 3,400 down to 2,796. This includes a loss of 275 positions as a direct result of the government's imposition of an efficiency dividend for the portfolio of 14.3 per cent over three years. That is the first fact of life, far more important than any attempt to go on SBS television. The fact of life is that this portfolio, which the RSL, other service groups in this country and both parties have consistently endorsed, is now going to be subject to very significant downsizing. The fact of a separate department providing this service has been a position that all parties have traditionally endorsed. The secretary to the department, Dr Johnston, told the Senate estimates hearing on 12 June that, due to the combined effect of a number of changes instituted by the government, DV A staffing could be reduced by up to 30 per cent over the next three years. In the Hansard on page 329, he said: We need to identify areas where we can contract out some of our business ... It is impossible to believe that cuts of this magnitude can be made without seriously reducing the level, quality, extent and timeliness of service to veterans. We also know that the government has followed through with its predecessor's mortality study of Vietnam veterans. That showed suicide rates 21 per cent greater than in the comparative Australian population, an overall mortality rate seven per cent greater and a cancer rate of 21 per cent. There has been a follow-up study. This side of the House remains concerned that 1.805 veterans out there are not Dart of that study, have not been identified and are not part of the input. We join with the government in asking the veterans to make sure they do respond to this. When he released the report, the minister promised: Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5463 The federal government will implement a comprehensive program of health research, education and counselling to supplement existing benefits and services available to Vietnam veterans. Now we discover, based on answers from the secretary to DV A, Dr Johnston, to questions from Labor senators at last week's Senate estimates hearings, that no additional budgetary resources have been allocated to follow up the findings. It was bad enough stuffing up the returns and causing a great degree of furore out there amongst these veterans by putting a gun at their head and telling them they had to get the returns back in a week or two. I am glad to see that he has rescinded that and actually given them a longer period to respond. The secretary to the department said on the record that there will be no additional budgetary resources for the follow-up to the findings. That was on 12 June. It is on page 349 of the Hansard. It is difficult to believe that the minister is truly intending to: ... supplement existing benefits and serviceswhen he has allocated not one additional dollar to do so, and the department itself is facing significant downsizing and looking at contracting out. Similarly, the government has been loudly proclaiming its intention to provide a vocational rehabilitation scheme for younger ex-service men and women. The idea behind it is quite worthy, quite commendable. However, at the same time, as part of the coalition's overall public service cutbacks implemented in recent legislation, they have cut the number of staff at the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service from 152 to 137. This is the very body that is central to the government's rehabilitation scheme. This means the service has to be taken as a new priority initiative with 15 fewer staff than they had in 1996-97 to deal with a regular workload. We have on previous occasions-and I am not the only person to raise this; the RSL has taken it up in recent weeks-had concerns about other aspects of this budget and its predecessor that are very much affecting veterans. It is all right for the minister to go around the country and say that he is not regarding the gold card as being in the too hard basket. The fact of life is: when Costello's got anything to say in this government-and I think he has a bit more to say than the minister-there is not going to be any change in the gold card. He knows it as well as I do. To start saying that he is in there fighting for them is really just totally irrelevant to the overall debate on what has happened in this last budget in regard to pharmaceuticals, what is happening in aged care and what is occurring around a broad frame of aged care as well. What we do see, as I have indicated in other speeches, is savings of nearly $33 million over the next four years through the introduction from February 1998 of therapeutic goods premiums whereby veterans will have to pay the difference between higher price drugs within the group and the base price set. Another saving of $6 million over four years will come from the deli sting in February 1998 of medicines for so-called less serious medical conditions including antifungal and antidiarrhoea items. The budget for this portfolio is going to be slashed by $40 million over the next years. It is all right to keep talking about how many canons he has patted on the back, and how many medals he has given out, and how many cheques he has handed over, et cetera. That is all very commendable but he does not have a position out there. People do not perceive that he is out there fighting on these more fundamental issues that affect the daily lives of aged veterans in this country. 5464 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 It is also interesting to note that there will be savings of nearly $10 million over four years on the service pension outlays due to the introduction in July 1998 of a bonus plan to encuurage eligible individuals to defer for up to five years applying for the pension. There are concerns that the veterans' affairs element of the plan is likely to focus on Vietnam veterans, who were shown in the recent Vietnam mortality study to have above average levels of mortality, particularly from cancer and suicide. As I said, there is a variety of concerns. I have also had a number of approaches from Vietnam veterans' organisations-and others, to be honest-about the new panel diagnosis for certain conditions. Once again, the reality is that this is going to occur under the pretext that all of these veterans are supposedly cheating the government. These are people who have essentially given their service in very difficult circumstances, under fire, many of them. We have this allegation by this government, and I hear the departmental figures to groups that they have had discussions with that 5 per cent of them they regard as rorters. We are going to have this new attempt, particularly with regard to PTSD, basically to ensure that certain psychiatrist's medicals are not worth the paper that they are written on, to try to make it difficult for people to get through the process, difficult to win. Another matter that veterans organisations have taken up with me is legal aid. I admit that some of these changes are not directly related to the minister's portfolio but we have a situation where veterans are concerned about things such as panel diagnosis and possible changes to tribunals. At the same time, this government. under the pretext of difficult arrangements and confusion between state and federal powers with regard to legal aid, and whether 5c too much was spent on a state matter, is dramatically slashing access to legal aid in this country. Some of the people that will be crucially hit will be veterans. These are the more fundamental issues of concern to the veterans of this country. These are issues that are more important to their livelihood, to their families. These are issues that are more important to their widows than some of the aspects that the minister seems to believe are worthwhile diversions from the fundamental issues. We know that the widows of war veterans are going to be hit very hard in the area of aged care, and there is some speculation as to the charge that is going to be introduced. There have been estimates of an average of $80,000. Those estimates are not from the Labor Party shadow minister. They are not from the ACTU or any of the other so-called bogey men out there; they are from the industry that will be gaining this money. Obviously, those people who are paying that kind of figure are being forced to sell their house under pressure from this government. That is because Mr Costello's National Commission of Audit report says that there are too many asset-rich people out there avoiding responsibility for aged care. The veteran community in this country thinks that the minister's hard end should be going to such matters as the death tax. That is what he should be combating. He should be fighting for those sorts of matters and not worrying about the peripheral bread and circus diversions. A subject of recent months has been this toing-and-froing over the recognition of overseas medals. This fits in with the question of the credibility of the government. We had the former shadow minister, Mr Tuckey, running around every possible RSL conference that he could get a leg in, for a year or two beforehand, saying that he did not care if people got imperial honours, that he was going to be in there as soon as he got his seat on the cabinet benches getting them another award because they deserve 'a distinctly Australian award'. It is quite Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5465 obvious that he knew that they were already receiving an imperial award and he was saying they should get a second one. I am very pleased to see the level of discontent and the level of criticism in the newspaper columns in this country, both from individuals who have had their heads kicked in over this issue and from a variety of service groups, with the last-minute excuse by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel ( Mrs Bishop). They have suddenly found this new capital offence called double medalling. This is a very serious matter, this double medalling, despite the fact that the predecessor had made it emphatically clear that he was aware of it and he was saying there should be a second medal. The minister herself of course went around the RSL national conference saying that she was still there with Wilson Tuckey and she had the same policy. On 23 September 1996, the minister issued a press release at the national conference saying, 'I am pleased to announce that the government's policy is largely in place, with the Governor General having already approved changes to the determinations for the medals under his authority and Her Majesty's consent is being sought for other changes.' Subsequently, the minister was forced to admit in question time on 28 May 1997 that the coalition would not honour this commitment to those who served in the Korean war, the Malayan emergency and the Indonesian confrontation. Eight months after she had said everything was on track, that all the necessary approvals were in train and after thousands of applications had been received, the minister pleaded that, 'It was indeed then discovered that those people had been awarded an imperial medal at the behest of the Australian government and therefore it was an Australian medal rendered in respect of that active service in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation. Accordingly, the government made a decision that that would represent double medalling and that that would not be done.' A fortnight later it looks like there is going to be another backflip because a significant number of opposition backbenchers are a bit embarrassed around the place. They are getting a bit of heat. They are getting a few phone calls and of course in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 11 June we see a little leak there that the government would announce a medals about-tum in two weeks time. Once again, there is a question of the degree of honesty in this government and the degree of belief in what they are saying. I want to return to the point on which I originally had trouble with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. That is the question of employment in this country. I note at the outset that I have to quote these figures from June 1996 because the government is incapable, in response to a question on notice from myself, of giving me any updated figures. I want to say to this minister that whilst it is commendable that we actually do honour the dead and we do recognise those who died overseas for this country, I still say very clearly that unemployment in this country and particularly in western Sydney is fairly important. Quite frankly, it is a major indictment of this government that the only job creation scheme they did come up with in the last budget was in fact this thing for war graves overseas. I wish they had many other schemes. The figures of June 1996 show that in Auburn municipality there is unemployment of 19.4 per cent, Holroyd 9.9 per cent and Parramatta 10.5 per cent. There are a few qualifications in the minister's answer on that question. He says, 'They are not exact and accordingly should be read with caution.' They are 'subject to greater variability', et cetera. All of the quibbling, all of the prevarication and all of the qualifications in the world do not take away from this 5466 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 government's slashing of labour markcl programs by $l.8 billion in thc previous budget. It does not get away from the fact that this government, unlike its predecessor. does not have a target like Labor did of five per cent unemployment. For all of the attempt by the Prime Minister to talk about average figures over the years of Labor government, it can not escape the fact that in the first 15 months of the Labor government, unemployment in this country went down from 10 per cent to 8.9 per cent. In contrast in the same period of time the Howard government has managed to drive it upwards to 8.8 per cent. As the Prime Minister said, and I very rarely agree with his comments, on television last week, 'The government in power is seen as responsible for this'. More than ever, if there is a government around the place that is responsible for unemployment, it is this one. What we have seen is a slashing of labour market programs by $1.8 billion. That is in contrast to its predecessor's very graphic lifting of expenditure on active labour market programs. It had not been a trend previously in this country to be preoccupied with active programs, but Labor did that. They lifted it from 0.27 per cent of GDP to 0.73 per cent by 1994-95. But what we have seen from this government is a tax on export market development grants; a tax on research and development assistance; a tax on DIFF; a tax on bounties; and a tax on every possible assistance to industry in regard to unemployment. This government has slashed labour market programs. They have slashed a variety of positions for young people, and they are now coming out with the concept of amalgamating the CES and other government instrumentalities into so-called one-stop shop agencies. Last week, we had the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) on TV saying that small business, and even the prospective employees, can pay $250. I want to quote a constituent of mine, Miss Alarna Tufrey of Merrylands. She wrote: Due to government changes that I was not aware of, I found that I """"as ineligible for a youth allowance. so I went back to school to attempt year II but found I it very difficult and left. She goes on to say: My mother has taken time off work to help me. We went to Granville T AFE and asked for some information on different courses to be mailed to me for the next semester. It was then that we were informed that the Merrylands CES officeand, I might add, not only the CES but the Medicare office as wellwill be closing, and that I should take advantage of any help they can offer me until then. More importantly, she says-and I well understand that, in the last election, the perception of youth unemployment in this country critically hurt Labor: As a teenager I have no confidence in the Liberal Federal Government, and I have no intention of voting for them. I have friends who also use the CES services to look for jobs and training, and I can assure you that they feel the same way. We need the CES to help us, their advice is invaluable and the security of knowing that they are there to help anyone who is unemployed goes a long way to the peace of mind of the younger people. This is my first letter to a Member of Parliament, and I can only hope that this shows you the importance of the services that the Government is taking away from us. When I finally gain employmentand let us hope she doesI will have to pay taxes and vote. I can only hope that I can make a small difference now. Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5467 That is the reality out there: after 15 months, the public can average out what happened under Labor. The fact of life is that Labor's figures were in a time of contemporaneous international recession. The situation now is that this country is obviously very much affected by its trading partners. The fact of life in the United States and in most of the Western world has been a far better employment situation than that which was concurrent with the Labor regime and, despite that, we have got a situation where unemployment is growing continually, and we have hit a record in 23 months with regard to long-term unemployment. That is the kind of agenda that the government has had in this budget. That is the kind of policy that they have employed. (Time expired) budget, in Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98. BeforeI commence, I will make a couple of passing comments in answer to those that have just been made by the member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson). I note that most of his address was directed towards the issue of veterans' affairs. I would say, in defence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Scott), what a splendid job he has done in the past 16 to 17 months. Without the fanfare of Australia Remembers marking 50 years, he has diligently applied himself to the task at hand. 'Their Service-Our Heritage' has gone down as an excellent program in the electorate. I do note, though, the member for Reid's comments about the gold card, and the anticipation that is out there amongst some of the veterans. If we can deal with some of the remaining issues that have been cropping up in more recent times with regard to the Vietnam veterans, I am certainly totally supportive of that. My principal comment in regard to the member for Reid is in terms of his claim about Labor's record on unemployment. The fact which has been neglected in all of this is that the average rate of unemployment that Labor had from 1990 to 1996 was-and despite all of the claims that they make-somewhere around 8.6 per cent: that was their average, their unemployment record. They can stand here and talk about the Howard government's recordor lack of record, to use their words-in terms of unemployment. But, after 15 months of economic reform, as compared with their 13 years, we certainly can hold our heads up high. We have managed to bring down this budget without increasing taxes. This should never be forgotten by those on the other side, and I know that the Australian public in tum also acknowledges this point. There are no increases in petrol tax, there are no increases in personal tax and there is no increase in the Medicare tax. This is a budget which has consolidated the efforts of the budget that was brought down last year in August. It delivers ongoing policy consistency and it delivers certainty for all Australians. More particularly, the budget confirms our solid commitment to the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians: those working men and women, their families, the aged pensioners and the self-funded retirees-the very people who make up my electorate of Deakin. Through this budget the Howard government has reaffirmed its credentials as a responsible economic manager. It is a government that is willing to tackle the longer term structural reforms so desperately needed. In stark contrast to our approach, we have Labor's policy of inconsistencies and reversals. By jettisoning past policies, the opposition have shown themselves for what they really are-political opportunists.",121,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (5.33 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the coalition government's second5468 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 In an international comparative sense, many Australians may not realise the abundant opportunities that are available here in this country. In contrast to those looking to the politics of blame and for scapegoats-and we have seen a few of those in this House-I would like to highlight the fact that Australia continues to be a great place to live and work. RecentlyI had the good fortune to travel to Taiwan. The message I brought home from this trip was that the quality of Australian products and services should never be underestimated and should never be talked down, particularly by members of this federal parliament. They are as good as those anywhere else in the world. The coalition's approach to government is to prepare the way for a strong, vibrant, cohesive society-a society that can more than match it with the tiger economies to our north. This massive task is ongoing, and I am glad to say that the report card to this point in time is quite favourable. The Herald-Sun newspaper in my city of Melbourne said on 14 May: Peter Costello has decisively buried the Keating legacy-in more ways than one. It very clearly establishes his fiscal and economic and political ... credentials. It consolidates our nation's finances around a small government dynamic. Of course, it is not only Peter Costello who has decisively buried the Keating legacy, but the Australian Labor Party has also decisively buried the Keating legacy and, as I say, jettisoned its previous policies. The days of debt and deficit spending are over. Labor's approach gave us, as a nation, an increase in government debt of billions of dollars. The reality of a less than responsible budgetary approach is that financial problems only get worse. As every mortgagee knows, paying interest on interest already accrued will over time become very costly. The longer the debt is not responsibly managed, the larger it grows. A downward spiral of deficit and debt leads to a feeling of frustration, hopelessness and finally desperation as one loses control. The public knows our nation was heading down this path. They demanded responsible economic management, and the Commonwealth has responded by ensuring that the budget is balanced across the economic cycle. Two excellent and very responsible budgets have been brought down by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and by the Howard government. Unfortunately, this simple principle was lost on Labor. Despite economic growth, their budget was in deficityear after year their budgets were in deficit. Through this budget, the coalition has placed Australia on the path to increased savings. Governments and companies, as well as individuals, need to be encouraged to put aside more financial resources. Through increased savings, our reliance on foreign borrowings can be drastically reduced. The bottom line with increased savings is faster economic growth and, importantly, jobs. These two budgets have been all about jobs. There has been a multi-dimensional attack on the issue of jobs, not the one dimensional attack that Labor employed of simply pouring money into labour market programs. Nobody knows better the waste of the labour market programs than me. I was one of the subcontractors who had to stand at the front of a room and deliver a message of hope and possible success once the two weeks, six weeks or eight weeks was over. It was hard to take. It was hard to have to look into the faces of the young kids, the retirees and those who were retrenched later in life knowing that, when they walked out of the room, Labor was not offering another job; Labor was simply offering another training program. This budget is a multi-dimensional attack, and we will succeed. As I said before, Tuesday, l7 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5469 I am pleased to say that, after 15 months, the budget report card is quite favourable and getting better by the month. For its part, the coalition has set a good savings example. This budget predicts that the Commonwealth budget will be in surplus over three years. We have gone from a $10.5 billion deficit to a $1.6 billion surplus. Most importantly, this position has been achieved in a just and fair manner. All sectors of society have contributed, which is in contrast to the ideology driven, high spending 'tax the rich' New South Wales Labor budget. The New South Wales budget is a reminder at state and federal level that Labor's old taxing and spending habits do die hard. This budget makes it easier for individuals to save. All taxpayers in the Deakin electorate will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate. Once the scheme is fully implemented, the rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings, whatever the source, be it bank interest, superannuation contributions or dividend income. The maximum rebate of $450 will accrue on $3,000 worth of savings. Put another way, that is a $450 tax cut. Around six million people will benefit from this incentive scheme, and most benefit will go to those with taxable incomes under $40,000. In my electorate this represents approximately 45 per cent of households. They will receive the maximum benefit of $450. For those paying a 20c marginal rate, the rebate scheme offers a 15 per cent tax cut for every dollar of savings. Why is it that the most positive and beneficial policies attract the most strident criticismcriticism that is misinformed and misleading? Scare campaigns and misinformation, now characteristic of this opposition, are not appreciated by the average citizen. My constituents tell me they do not appreciate the ALP playing political games with their lives and the futures of their families. I pose the question: would all Australians potentially benefit from Labor's l-a-w tax promises as they benefit from this government's savings plan? The answer, of course, is no. But it gets worse for the opposition. On national TV the member for Holt( Mr Gareth Evans) said: I'm talking about the abandonment of the superannuation co-contribution, in favour of a little windfall tax break for those who don't need or deserve it. I will throw those words back at the member for Holt at an appropriate time. He has added another beauty to the ALP's quotable quotes list, and demonstrates once again Labor's 'we know what is best for you' uncaring attitude. It is obvious from that comment that Labor thinks the self-funded retirees of Deakin do not need or deserve a tax rebate on their hardearned savings. I take issue with that comment and the opposition's suggestion, and I am sure that the good citizens of Deakin think the same way. There certainly are quite a lot of other areas I could tackle but, in line with our time commitments made for this debate, I would say in conclusion that the coalition government is committed to doing the right thing by all Australians. This budget continues the strategy of repairing the mess left by Labor. It will also bring certainty, economic security and, above all, a climate for increased employment. I congratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) for their responsible solutions to Labor's 13 years of neglect. from the member for Deakin( Mr Barresi) who I think said in part of his contribution that employment was going up under this government. Fascinating! Members of the cabinet seem to be not only illiterate but also innumerate.",127,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (5.45 P.m.),"It was interesting to listen to the contribution5470 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 Recently, I have been reading a book called The Unconscious Civilisation by John Ralston Saul. While I do not agree with everything that Saul says in the book, I was particularly taken by some of his remarks, one of which I would like to quote here. Saul says at the beginning of his book: There is a general sense that our civilisation is in a long-term crisis. It can been seen from the political, social or economic aspect. From each angle, the same crisis can be seen differently. I would like to argue that it took on its actual economic form in 1973, when a first wave of political crises lead to an oil supply crisis. We have been in a depression ever since. It does not resemble a 1929-style depression, but then depressions have always been different, one from the other. Ours has been softened and evened out thanks to the life preservers gradually put in place by society after 1929 in order to give us more time to manoeuvre and act should a disaster repeat itself. It did, in 1973. Now, given our inability over the past two decades to deal with an unbreakable chain of unemployment, debt, inflation and no real growth, we have drifted farther and farther out into a cold, unfriendly, confusing sea. The new certitude of those in positions of authority-those out of the water-is that the certain answer is to cut away the life preservers. This might be called a childlike act. Or one of unconsciousness so profound as to constitute stupidity. Of course, I believe that the changes in this budget fit Saul's description and, without doubt, constitute stupidity. In particular, the government's failure to put in place mechanisms to stimulate the economy and thereby create employment is a prime example of the government cutting away the life-preservers. Last Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released new labour force data. To the shame of the Howard government, that data revealed that unemployment continues to grow. Indeed, in one month 40,000 jobs disappeared-40,000 jobs disappeared, and my colleague opposite says that this government has made progress! The continued climb in unemployment has resulted in more than 809,000 Australians being out of work today: nearly 1 million Australians out of work. Unemployment is the most insidious wound John Howard has inflicted on the people of Australia, because it affects every aspect of a person's life. It has implications for their standard of living, for their health, for their ability to plan and save for their future-and that, of course, is now an imperative, given the government's new policies on aged care-and for their ability to educate their children. The list goes on and on. I would like briefly to address a couple of the points that I have alluded to but first I would like to draw to the attention of the Committee the government's disastrous record on unemployment. In western societies, your job provides much more than your living. It provides you with social status, a sense of where you are in society. It is your identifier: 'I'm an electrician,' or 'I work for an insurance company.' The first inquiry we usually make of someone, once we know their name, is what do they do for a living. When we ask children what they want to do when they grow up, we expect them to name a trade or a profession. Labor has always recognised the importance to Australians of having a job. Our policies assured Australians that the safety net--or, in Saul's terms, the life-pre server-was always firmly in place. When restructuring threatened whole areas of this country's economy, Labor set about instituting policies and programs to re-educate the work force and reposition people into areas of job growth. Labor planned. It had a vision of where Australia was going, and we did all that we could to reduce the unemployment that was caused by us getting there. This budget was the government's opportunity to put in place its plan and to institute its own job creation policies. Unfortunately for Australia, the Liberal Party has no such plan. John Howard has no such vision. He does not care about the effect unemployment has on peopleTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5471 because, if he did, he would be doing something about it. Rather he is taking on those policies discredited following Margaret Thatcher's term in government in Great Britain: sink or swim policies, with no lifeboats or life preservers in sight. I think it is sad, in a sense, that the Prime Minister, on his current journey to Britain, will be going to have those unfortunate Thatcherite policies reinforced in his mind when he sees Baroness Thatcher. One can only hope that he will be more impressed, and have more of an effect made on him, by the policies of the new Labour government in Britain. In last year's budget, the government cut public sector jobs, abolished employment programs, cut skills training and slashed industry programs. Now that that has resulted in increased unemployment, the Prime Minister is giving Australians more of the same. The economy has become stagnant. Confidence is at an all-time low and business has stopped investing. Retail sales are down. Indeed, nearly every indicator is down. Without growth in the economy there can be no growth in employment. It is not just the Labor Party saying this; business is saying it, small business is saying it, the retail sector is saying it. Everybody is saying that this government is running the country into a recession. When BHP's closure of the steel mill in Newcastle saw 2,000 Australians dumped out of their jobs, what did the government do? The Prime Minister did nothing, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) went to a casino opening, and the Prime Minister still has not found time to visit Newcastle since it happened. He has time to go to Lord's and he has time to go to stay at the Savoy Hotel in London. He can find time for the cricket in England, but he cannot find time to visit Newcastle. Two thousand Australians have lost their jobs, and the Prime Minister does not care. The government can give us no plans or policies about what they will do for Newcastle, just platitudes. If there is a metaphor for John Howard's government, it is in the very tardy approach that they have taken to what has happened to the people in Newcastle. In fact, the only response the Liberals can make when they are questioned about unemployment is to say they are changing Australia's industrial laws; that is supposed to be how it works. Well it has not been enough and it will not be enough. The Liberal's new industrial relations environment will deliver lower wages and longer working hours for those Australians who are lucky enough to still be in a job. Forty thousand jobs lost last month; 800,000 Australians out of work; and all the government can say is, 'Somehow or other, if you'll allow people to find a way to sack people quicker and more efficiently, that will create work.' I have always found that rather circular argument a bit strange. None of the changes that the government has made in the industrial relations area will result in a rise in employment. They have not so far, and they wilI not in the future. Australians at all levels of society are becoming disillusioned with this government's attitude to jobs and are now starting to drop out of the work force. In Thursday's job figures we saw a huge fall in the participation rate, but my colleague over on the other side says that it is all going well. Indeed, the participation rate'Just wait.' That is a terrific answer for the people in my electorate who do not have a jobjust wait. The problem is going to be that if you are a male who is in your 50s and you lose your job under this government, you will have a long, long wait until you find another job.",129,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Barresi,"The policies are there, mate; just wait.",131,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Leo Mclea Y,"The participation rate for males is at its lowest on record and he says,5472 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 You will have a long, long wait, you will not have anything coming in and life will cost you more. Most Australians are too busy swimming to be able to wait; without life preservers they cannot afford to stop long enough to be relaxed and comfortable the way the Prime Minister would like us to be. It might be very relaxing and very comfortable flying first class to Britain to see the cricket. The view from Lord's or Kirribilli might be pretty cosy, pretty rosy, pretty relaxed and pretty comfortable. But the view from Kingsgrove in my electorate most certainly is not. What happens to those people who lose their jobs? Along with the loss of their pride, identity and confidence, often comes a worsening in their health. One of the greatest contributors to your health, or otherwise, is your employment status. Unemployed people are much more likely to suffer from illness and, once ill, to take much longer to recover. How does this government help social security recipients and low income people when their health is compromised? They make them wait. In this budget the government has selected the less fortunate and targeted them with a new drugs tax. Under the government's new scheme, those Australians seeking access to the safest and most effective drugs will have to pay more, up to $30 a month more. Low income earners wanting to use these drugs will be forced to pay more or accept second-rate drugs. The drugs affected by the government's new drug tax make up around one third of pharmaceutical benefits scheme spending as they treat chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers and depression, in patients who have often been on these drugs for years. In another move which will unfairly affect low income earners, the government is also closing 44 Medicare offices in urban areas. Those on tight budgets will now have to travel further to claim their rebates. Another of the life preservers put in place by Labor governments over the decades, and even by Liberal governments, to protect the vulnerable has been aged care, and the people on the other side say 'Rubbish'. They obviously think that is rubbish because they do not want to see anything done to protect aged Australians, the generation of people who went through the Depression, the Second World War, and who are now in their 70s and 80s and wanting to go into a nursing home. This government's answer to them is, 'Come up with $80,000'. That is what they are going to have to do. The government commenced that process in the last budget and continues down that road now. The government has introduced a scheme of accommodation bonds for elderly people which will be the cruellest thing any government has done to old people in Australia since the Second World War. Those who are in a position of authority, those who are out of the water, who have had no experience of being at the mercy of others because of their financial status or poor health, are the ones who have forced these older Australians to have to sell their houses, or else have their children put up the money. These elderly people are people who have struggled all their lives to purchase a home yet now they will be placed in the invidious position of having to sell that house in order to purchase a place in a nursing home. Those who have not been fortunate enough to earn enough money to buy their own home will be in an even worse position. They will be at the mercy of nursing home owners and operators who will be able to pick and choose between applicants who have the money and those who have not. Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5473 Even nursing home owners and operators have objected to the government's policies in this area. One example in my electorate is St Basil's Home. They have written to me setting out a large number of concerns that they have with the government's program. Amongst the issues noted by Father Kapetas, the director of that service, as being of concern are appropriate prudential arrangements for the accommodation bonds, inadequate funding levels, a lack of indexation of those funding levels to meet the care needs of residents, and the lack of an external complaints handling process for residents. During the debate on these bills, the Minister for Family Services( Mrs Moylan) did nothing to allay these concerns and many others raised by members. The government sees nothing wrong with making people pay their way, even if those people cannot afford it. There goes another life preserver. The Prime Minister's lack of vision was never more evident than in relation to education. In 1996 the government took huge chunks out of the education budget, using the argument that those benefiting from education should pay. What he fails to appreciate is that Australia needs a better educated work force now than ever before. Countries seeking to grow their economies can only do so with a work force which is well educated and able to be retrained throughout their working lives. By preventing or punishing those seeking to gain an education, this government is doing the country a huge disservice. And this year's budget is no better than last year's. An amount of $72 million has been cut from vocational education and training grants to the states, and that is on top of the $183 million cut last year. The situation in relation to Austudy remains confused and is still a stumbling block to the children of low income earners seeking a tertiary education. Some 4,700 places are being cut through the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, and a further one per cent cut to funding to universities, coming as it does on top of last year's five per cent cut, will mean even fewer student places. Universities are slowly but surely being forced to giVe places over to fee paying students, those there on the basis of ability to pay rather than merit. Of particular relevance to my electorate and the students who live there was the announcement by the University of New South Wales that it is closing its St George campus. This means that those wishing to study must travel much further to access relevant courses. The St George campus closure is a direct result of the cuts to university funding by the Howard government. Australia is going backwards to the period when all students paid fees and only the children of the rich or those lucky enough to win a scholarship could gain access to the highest level of education. Society's life-preservers of a better educated citizenry seem to be in the process of being jettisoned. I could go on and on listing those areas where this government has attacked the very basis of our society-the safety net which was so carefully put in place over the decades by the Menzies government, the Whitlam government, the Fraser government and the Hawke and Keating governments. The unravelling of that safety net is happening at a very fast pace. Every time the people from my electorate look around, another life-preserver has been cast adrift. Without the security provided by those life-preservers, society is starting to tum in on itself. People are looking for scapegoats, and this government, by its inaction, has created the monster of the One Nation Party. Unfortunately, I do not think the government is capable of nor willing to do anything to ensure that the problems it has created can be corrected. The government has allowed the Pauline Hanson cancer to spread across Australia5474 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 honourable member referred to members by their electorate. The appropriate title is the member for Oxley. of the One Nation Party, which was formed by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The One Nation Party cancer that she has spread across the country is something which will do Australia harm both at home and overseas. The government has been unwilling or unable to do anything about that. That is a shame for Australia. It is a shame for this parliament, and it is a shame that there are so few members on the government side who will stand up to this cancer. When we look at where Australia will be going at the tum of the century, where our country will be at the centenary of Federation and what sort of a country we want to hand over to our children, it should not be a mean-spirited and mean-natured country. It should be a country that, rather than jettisoning the lifeboats and cutting away the life-preservers, offers a helping hand to those who come here, to those who live here who are not as well off as some, and to those who want to make Australia the best country in the world to live in. I believe it is only by adopting that approach that we can progress as a nation. When one sees the Prime Minister using the metaphor of Sir Robert Menzies and the tradition of the Liberal Party, one wonders whether Menzies and the people of his generation are turning in their graves. While there were very significant ideological differences between them and the Labor Party, I am sure that we agreed with many of the social things that the Menzies government did. I was a member of this parliament in the years that Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister of Australia. I always gave great credit to former Senator Margaret Guilfoyle, a very senior minister in that government, who always used to ensure that, while Fraser talked about axing and not taxing, the safety nets in this country were kept at such a level that those who were not as well off as others could survive and prosper. Unfortunately, the budget last year and the budget this year have seen a very radical change from the approach that Liberal governments tended to take. The quote we saw in the paper last week from the Prime Minister when he arrived at cabinet many years ago, saying, 'I'm not a Liberal; I'm a large 'C' Conservative,' was shown to be very true in the structure of this year's budget brought down by the government. second Howard government budget. Through the passing of Appropriation Bill (No.1) 199798, we will see some more way-ahead programs in place and opportunity for more Australians, as detailed in this budget. That go forward is certainly detailed in the bill before us. It is a bill which offers an integrated approach. It is not a series of disparate ideas; it is a coordinated approach with the future in mind. It is all about Australians investing in themselves, their country, their companies and their jobs. It is about the creation of real jobsjobs which can be sustained because industries will grow and confidence will return. It is all about people in small business in my electorate of Moreton who are concerned about a lot of the things that most average Australians are concerned about. There is a dent in the Australian psyche after 13 years of Labor government, which the honourable member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) is trying to revisit and trying to revise in his contribution here tonight. There are people in my electorate who remain hurt and scared, whose confidence is",131,Representatives Main Committee

245,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (6.05 P.m.),"I am very pleased to be associated with theTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 5475 dented. They have been hurt by the false starts and the promises of that Labor regime. What do Labor say these days: if only they had a fourteenth year, it would have been okay. I certainly do support the approach that the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has offered. We do not need any more boom and bust in this country; we need no more kick in the guts economics as one lever is pulled here and something else is pulled there to just go on and produce more hurt and confusion. This government instead is working on the big structural changes, sustained and substantial economic growth and a return of a sense of security for Australians. We are talking about low inflation. We are talking about steady growth over the next decade. We are talking about repairing the financial situation that Labor left us. We are talking about reducing debt. We are talking about boosting investment. All of this equals job creation, and that is what it is all about. If throwing money at job creation would have solved the problems of unemployment, Labor would have fixed them. Instead, over 13 years they averaged 8.7 per cent unemployment in this country . Yet they stand here in their contributions to this debate and try and revisit the whole thing and suggest they have all the answers now. If only they had a fourteenth or fifteenth year, they keep saying. Let us face it, Mr Deputy Speaker, all Labor do is knock. All they want to do is knock, and prevent the government from getting on with its established program. If you look at the recent Yellow Pages business survey, it showed that 30 per cent of small business believes the economy a year from now will be better, and 13 per cent say it will be worse. For my money, I will go with the 30 per cent. In the survey, small business was also asked what its prime concerns were. Third on the list of prime concerns was cash flow, at 11 per cent. The second concern for small business was lack of sales at 21 per cent. According to that Yellow Pages small business survey, the number one prime concern of the small business sector, a concern for 28 per cent of small business people, was none; there was absolutely no concern for them. The number one concern of 28 per cent of small business operators was no concern at all. The Labor opposition in recent weeks has been touting the positive-negative indicators of that particular survey. Statistically, this outlines where the positives outweigh the negatives in the survey. This latest Yellow Pages index shows that negatives outweigh the positives to the tune of minus six per cent. That is a vast improvement on the last such survey under the previous government, where the result was minus 51 per cent. In other words, while small business would like to be happier-and I am sure most people on the government side understand all of this-the one thing that is for certain is that they are far more confident than when Labor was in power. We will keep working on that growing confidence. We will keep working on the job of restoring confidence to the small business sector and, as the policies and measures we have undertaken kick in, confidence will grow even stronger. Already we have seen evidence of the growth in confidence. The March quarter capital expenditure survey backs up the basis of the bill which is before us this evening: strong growth in business investment in 1996-97. Business is starting to gear up again. Total capital expenditure in the first three quarters of 1996-97 is 21 per cent higher than it was for the equivalent period a year ago. Business investment is very strong-at record levels-because of this government's lead. Interest rates are in fact at historic lows, and in addition the budget is turning from deficit to surplus. 5476 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 What is the Labor opposition's approach on all of this? They have basically opposed every point. The government's efforts to lock in monetary targets, low inflation, agreements between the Reserve Bank and the government: Labor just raved on and threatened to sue. The government's policy to take a $10.3 billion deficit and produce a $1.6 billion budget surplus was voted against on all measures by Labor. While this government stands for savings, low deficits, reduced debt and low interest rates, Labor is still the party of high deficits-who cares about that, they say-high debt, high interest rates, high taxes and no small business accommodation. No-one on the opposition side understands small business. There was evidence enough of that after 13 years of its dreadful government. While on this side we stand for small business, the return of confidence, investment and the creation of real jobs, in the Labor Party the contrast continues. Labor wants to slow down our programs of reform and thwart our efforts through the Senate. The Australian Democrats and the ALP should stand condemned for the hurt that their delays are causing. The great debate is starting-and we would like it to be a mature debate--on the question of reform of the taxation system. Everybody in this country, except the Labor Party, accepts that there is a need for reform. Already, it is showing it wants to play politics yet again. If Labor delays the reforms that may come out of the debate process, battlers in this country, people on average wages, are going to start paying the top rate of tax. Rather than grow up and participate in a mature debate on the taxation system, Labor would much rather see average weekly wage earners paying the top rate of tax. It would much rather see more job losses in the public sector, as well as the private, rather than face up to tax reform. After all, the evidence is there-elements of last year's budget were still being passed the day before this year's budget was introduced. A good example of the effect of that is the Mount Gravatt Training Centre in my electorate. Pat Milley and her team have been waiting for the new training regime to start. They have been putting time and effort in since this government came to power, planning for the future. That centre is committed to the training of people for new jobs, and yet the Labor-Democrat cabal and its delays in the Senate have caused lost staff, lost expertise, a decline in the esprit de corps, and lost morale. They will not pass those bills in the Senate. They have put them in a very long queue. What about the thousands of people in and around my electorate who could have been helped by the training that Pat and her team wanted to provide? Does Labor care? Obviously not, otherwise it would expedite matters in the other place. Compare this reckless approach to the devil-may-care, all risk, no responsibility approach of Crean and the $2 billion new work opportunities approach of the previous government. That $2 billion new work opportunities fiasco is part of the debt reduction program costs that we now face as a government. So desperate was the previous government to cover up unemployment before the last election, it threw money at it-$2 billion. One group which received funds in my electorate was the Brisbane South Community Group. Between 21 August and 7 November 1995, that group received $618,952 in three separate contracted amounts. It has received nothing since this government came to office. That was frustrating for me at the outset because I sought to represent their views and concerns, but now I understand why they have not received the money. It is because the earlier funds have not been acquitted. In other words, over $600,000 was thrown at this community group under Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5477 Labor-under its drunken spending spree on new work opportunities-and no money has so far been acquitted. Former employees of this particular organisation have raised matters with me, as have so many others in my local community who have lent moral support to Brisbane South Community Group--churches, service clubs, political representatives on all sides-and I now feel rather used and cheated by this organisation. Brisbane South Community Group failed to pay employees. It failed to pay the Australian Taxation Office PA YE collections. It failed to pay rent. It failed to pay Telstra bills. It failed to do a lot of things, and yet it was the recipient of money under the devil-may-care approach of the previous government. The Brisbane South Community Group has been kicked out of its Annerley office in my electorate. It has been kicked out of the Victoria Point office in the electorate of the honourable member for Fadden and Minister for Administrative Services( Mr Jull). It claims that the Mount Gravatt office is still operating-it is an office which we shared with the accounted for them. Past staff, community group members, service club members and local schools have all painted the same picture to me. Rosebud Hansen, a tireless worker in the Annerley area, and Kaye Bailey were two exworkers who took action, quite rightly, before the Industrial Relations Commission recently. They are seeking redress for their wage complaints. Last month the company chairman, Robin Whittaker, was ordered to pay $10,000 to those two women. If funds are not paid by the end of June, a warrant will be issued allowing police to seize property belonging to the company and to Mr Whittaker. The ATO is also after the Brisbane South Community Group for failure to pay $64,073 in group income tax. The company started to fail to pay wages in February 1996, just three months after the last dollop of Labor's NWO slush fund was received. The Queensland government has even chipped in with over $40,000 in funds last year for programs run by Rosebud Hansen, and yet she was not paid. I have been lobbied since the election by the group, especially by program coordinator, Aaron Lucas. I went in to bat for them because they presented themselves so well, had the backing of so many good, decent, committed citizens in my electorate, and had high aspirations. However, along with so many others, I know I have been used and misled. Where the funds have gone and why the hopes of hundreds of young unemployed have been dashed are questions which beg an answer. It is obvious to me that the Brisbane South Community Group was born out of an unreal environment prior to the last election. It was encouraged by a government which really was not interested in job creation, it was interested only in hiding the unemployed. So over $600,000 worth of taxpayers' funds have not been acquitted. Yet, down to their last breath, they are claiming the lack of acquittal of funds arises because of some obscure litigation involving their auditor. This Mr Aaron Lucas has also used my representations to Senator Vanstone seeking clarification of a lack of funds from the new government as an excuse to debtors. It also seems that he claimed constantly that more money was coming and that bills would be paid. Essentially, the imprimatur of the government's new programs was being used by this group. This government has not fallen for that, unlike the previous government. It has been frustrating to me that while my representations on behalf of so many other groups have been successful, this group was unsuccessful, but now we know. I must say that if only",134,Representatives Main Committee

This Organisation Has Taken Taxpayer Funds And Not,"5478 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 with the funds that it threw at new work opportunities prior to the last elections, this money would never have been wasted. Essentially, the whole episode disgusts me and so many others in my community. Local papers will be running this story tomorrow. I must say that when it is all said and done, in the context of this bill before us today, it is refreshing to see that we now have a government that has focused on real job creation, on long-term investment that is going to produce results, and is not prepared to just throw money at the problem and hope it fixes itself, as Labor did. There is no doubt that the Labor Party and the Democrats will stand in the way of so many more of this new government's efforts to do something genuine for the unemployed, and that amazes me. If this bill is not passed wholly in the Senate, then those two parties should stand condemned. the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98. For my electorate of Gilmore, this budget has been a good news budget as it acknowledges my three core commitments to the electorate: investment, infrastructure and jobs. The Treasurer's statements were well received as the people of Gilmore are fully aware of the pressing economic circumstances that make the need to balance the budget a government priority. It is something they understand in their own lives. They know that no-one can live beyond their means and that if you owe money, it has to be paid back. They understand that ultimately they will be the people who have to repay that debt. Therefore, it is certainly good news to see the government widen its ongoing commitment to Gilmore by providing solutions to the very real problems facing rural and regional Australia. However, a good budget alone, no matter how positive the initiatives, no matter how high the level of government financial commitment, is still not sufficient to address the real social problems faced by too many families in Gilmore. Although today I will speak about what Gilmore has gained, not for a moment have I lost sight of what is still to be achieved in an area in which unemployment and concerns for small business remain very high. After 13 years in which the difficulties faced by Gilmore were not recognised, I have always maintained that, given some assistance in providing infrastructure, then investments, jobs and self-reliance would follow. Whilst this budget makes no direct reference to our much needed major highway link, Main Road 92, the Shoalhaven Highway, work is continuing with the three tiers of government working together in preparing a feasibility study for making this major highway link a reality. There is no doubt that this access to the Hume Highway and Canberra is of vital importance to Gilmore's economic future. Our export markets are increasing and we need an alternate route through which to transport our goods. At the moment the beautiful, environmentally sensitive area of Kangaroo Valley is bearing the brunt of the traffic, and the trucks, and now double-B bogies, as there is simply no alternative to the Nowra-Canberra-Melbourne freight connection. Already there has been a commitment made by the Shoalhaven City Council in funding the initial studies that have proven the immense cost-benefit ratio to my electorate and adjoining regions and I congratulate the Shoalhaven City Council on showing the required leadership in dealing with such a pressing issue. There is no doubt that, with the commenced upgrading of HMAS Albatross, Main Road 92 will allow further gains to be made by easier, quicker access to defence links and embassies in Canberra. This will then become a road link of national significance.",137,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (6.18 P.m.),"I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate onTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5479 The commencement of the eastern gas pipeline also displays confidence in my electorate of Gilmore with the major part of its construction following the proposed Main Road 92 route. This would clearly provide for the expansion of those areas, thus guaranteeing future investment in the area and much needed job creation. Whilst the Department of Defence has been, to a great extent, immune to the hardship experienced by other departments, a great deal of internal restructuring has taken place. Fortunately for the people of Gilmore, this has meant increased spending on our defence operations, and with it the decision to strengthen the operations of HMAS Albatross, a major naval base located in my electorate to the south of Nowra. A stage 1 budget of $35 million was allocated, providing an influx of capital into the community in the course of this financial year. That will mean more jobs for local residents and businesses. But, more importantly, the government has kept its word on its long-term commitment to the area by providing capital funding for major works at Albatross for many years to come. The upgrading at Albatross will benefit our community in many ways by the extension to and maintenance of defence personnel housing. In fact, a further 52 houses will be built and/or replaced. These will either be purchased in the local market or built by local operators at an estimated cost of $5 1/2 million. All this contributes to giving the local economy the short-term kick-start it so desperately needs and long-term assurances that any business in the area cannot ignore. I thank the minister and his staff for their efforts to bring about an outcome so beneficial to my community. I have never subscribed to the view that development must come at the expense of the environment, and neither has this government. To date, some $280,000 has been received for Coastcare projects. I am extremely hopeful that the government's $1 billion National Heritage Trust will directly benefit our environment, with our pristine icon of Jervis Bay, a myriad of waterways and an unsurpassed ecosystem. In fact, the recent announcement of this government's funding of $6.9 million for the Nowra university will see it in operation by the year 2000. We are also quietly confident that our heritage fund will assist in making the technology for Jervis Bay the foundation of ocean medicine development, food cultivation and fish farming. There are many stakeholders in our coastal environment. They include developers, federal, state and local government, Aboriginal communities, commercial and industrial users and those who earn their living from the coast, such as our fishermen at Ulladulla and surrounding villages. Given such strong and competitive interests and commitment, there is obviously a need to balance these at government and community level. Therefore, I cannot stress enough the importance of a National Heritage Trust for my electorate of Gilmore. I have spoken in the House before about the level of unemployment in Gilmore. It is no secret that the number of jobless is disproportionately high in our area. This concerns me greatly. However, the message I get in my meetings with both the jobless and small business operators is unchanged: let small business employ, let it expand and create opportunities for the jobless and, above all, help small business remove the industrial shackles imposed by years of Labor neglect. This government has also contributed half a million dollars towards a business incubator in my electorate of Gilmore-another example of small business and the unemployed being recognised by this government. I am simply amazed by Labor's refusal to support our small business by the further reform of unfair dismissal legislation. It is well 5480 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 known that the demands of current unfair dismissal legislation are the biggest deterrents for businesses employing fewer than 15 employees. The launching of our supermarket to Asia project in the next few months will be yet another incentive for businesses in my electorate. The project will have the clear objective of devising a more effective strategy for marketing the produce of local farmers and businesses. This will be of particular significance to us, as there is no doubt that there is a market for our products in Asia and the Middle East. The supermarket to Asia project will expand our strategy and bring our products to the attention of importers throughout the region. This will be another example of three tiers of government working together for the long-term prosperity of our community. Still on the topic of investment, as of 1 July what all businesses have asked for is the capital gains tax rollover of funds with the $5 million for reinvestment into other business or for retirement superannuation. In a perfect world there would be no need for DSS offices in my electorate of Gilmore; everyone would have jobs and no-one would be in need of government assistance. Unfortunately, a perfect world is still a fair way off. Therefore, with the support of DSS manager David Tagg and his enthusiastic staff, I am pleased to announce that Gilmore has received the go-ahead for the establishment of a new one-stop shop DSS. This project is worth over $1 million to our community and again shows this government's commitment to regional Australia. I have reminded my constituents that it was this government that increased the allowance for carers-of which we have many. On top of that, in Gilmore we have received another 40 aged care places for those who wish to remain at home, with appropriate care, as opposed to going into a nursing home. Another issue which has raised debate in my electorate is the recent Bringing them home report, which has given all Australians a chance to reflect on our history and the role it plays in defining our national identity. An unfortunate outcome of the report has been a hardening of two philosophical positions. Some endorse what has been referred to as the 'black armband' view of our history, focusing on the sins of our forefathers. In so doing, people make no reference to the important and commendable achievements made in 200 years of European civilisation in this country. There is another school of thought that would have us believe that this history is irrelevant to our everyday lives, that the injustices suffered by our indigenous population are in no way connected to the plight of Gilmore's Aboriginal communities today. Like so many of those that I have spoken to in my electorate, I see myself as somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. WhatI advocate is a type of compassionate pragmatism and a total and frank recognition of what has happened in Australia, but always with an eye on the best way forward. Last week, an Aboriginal elder came to speak to me about recent developments. She explained that for her, the stolen generation is an example of history affecting the present. It is a wound that will not heal for many Aboriginal Australians; a pain which cannot be erased and will be part of the identity of indigenous Australians for generations to come. This is something I accept completely. I have no qualms in personally saying, 'Sorry', as there is no need to see a personal apology as a recognition of personal responsibility. I was not involved with the tragic events and my personal apology is merely a recognition that Australian history has been kind to me while forcing enormous hardships onto fellow Australians. As politicians, Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5481 we should be capable of acknowledging the emotional depth of the issues we discuss and responding to such issues with compassion and sensitivity. It is also important that while condemning the practice of the removal of Aboriginal children, we do not overlook the fact that in some cases at least, meaningful and loving relationships were formed between the removed children and their adoptive families. I now look forward to being part of a government that looks to the future, to the creation of a brighter future for all Australian individuals, and for all of Australia's most needy communities. In conclusion, as I stated earlier, for Gilmore it was certainly a good news budget, one that will create even greater opportunities as we pursue the potential for federation funding and the National Heritage Trust. pleased to respond to the debate in respect of the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98 on behalf of the government and the Treasurer ( Mr Costello), in particular. I note that some 40 to 45 members of the government have contributed to this debate and supported the budget measures introduced by the Treasurer. What that debate has shown is that there is enormous support from both within this parliament-particularly all members of the government-but more particularly from outside the parliament, from the business sector and from the Australian electorate generally. The reason for that is that, in an economically responsible manner, the budget builds upon and it extends the progress that is being made by the Howard-Fischer budget some nine months ago. First and foremost, this budget is about a fair and equitable approach to the government's accounts. The consolidated measures of the government have turned around a $10.3 billion deficit that was left to us, of course, by Labor and turned it into a sizeable headline surplus in the 1997-98 budget of some $5 billion and, by 1998-99, there will be an underlying surplus of $1.6 billion. For the first time in almost a decade-in fact, for the first time this decadethe Minister for Finance did not have to follow the Treasurer on budget night and introduce a loan bill. The fact is that in this coming year the Commonwealth will repay over $5 billion of government debt. That will free future generations of Australians from the debt associated with servicing the debt that was threatening to drown this particular parliament, this particular government and this particular operation of government. So successful is the government's strategy of addressing the overall structure of the budget that it has been estimated that in the period since the government came into office until the year 2000-2001, the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will almost halve. This will ensure that Australians can face the new millennium in the knowledge that the country's future has been secured. The remarkable turnaround has occurred without having to increase taxes, be it income tax, company tax, wholesale sales tax, or for that matter, excise on petrol. Despite the difficulties faced in addressing the structural problems in the budget left to us by Labor, we have been able to introduce a number of initiatives in this budget. I will just add a couple of those initiatives. We have introduced, for the first time by an Australian government, a broadly based savings rebate; improvements in the superannuation arrangements and the tightening of rules governing access to superannuation prior to retirement; the provision of greater choice about where Australians can invest their superannuation contributions; the introduction of a deferred pension bonus plan for older Australians; a commitment to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings; and",138,Representatives Main Committee

The main problem the Labor Party has with the budget strategy is its reliance on failed economic dogma. It very much reflects the coalition's wasted years in opposition and its inability to fashion a Â·':t'orm program outside the shortcomings of orthodox economic theory. In rclation to Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1997-98 and its budget stratcgy, it is very clear that a measure of the government's failure comes from its own determination to hold out tax reform as something of a distraction to the way in which the budget has been received around the country.

A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.02 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. demolishing the government's budget strategy and exposing its many flaws. Now, thankfully, I have been advised that the main purpose of this debate is to address capital outlays in the budget, so having dispensed with the general strategy I can move to the more specific. There is an item out of my electorate that is a capital works of great waste. The fact that the government in this budget and, I believe, in earlier budgets has been allocating funds for the construction of a hospital, an important capital facility, at the Holsworthy army base is an appropriation that needs to be questioned, more so with the Minister for Finance( Mr Fahey) present in the Main Committee chamber. How wasteful it is for a government to be outlaying some $20 million on the construction of a hospital at Holsworthy when the government also has these grievous plans for the construction of Sydney's second international airport on the same site. When this proposition was first raised, I had a concern that the hospital might in fact be adept forward planning; the idea that, with all that unexploded ordnance around at Holsworthy, the first plane that would land at such an airport may well require a modem, state of the art hospital nearby for the looming catastrophe. If the government is engaging in that sort of forward planning, I would ask them to desist. There is a better way to handle this matter, of course, and that is not to engage in the folly of Holsworthy, and to allow the $20 million to be well spent. I am sure the military hospital relocated out of my electorate, at Ingleburn, to the seat of Hughes, at the Holsworthy base, is a needed facility. There is no doubt about that. But it has to be a facility that is used for military purposes, not to literally mop up the tragedy of bad planning and bad decision making in relation to the site of Sydney's second international airport. I know, in making those comments, that that is a proposition that the Minister for Finance would support for two reasons. One is: why waste $20 million on the construction of a hospital when the government also has a plan for an airport? But I also know-and this is the second reason-that he is busting out of his skin to actually say something about Holsworthy and engage himself in the public debate. The only thing that is stopping him is said to be the release of the EIS. Why someone needs an EIS to tell them that an international airport with two 4,000-metre runways directed at large residential areas is a problem, I am yet to work out. But if the Minister for Finance can just use a bit of logic in this matter, and understand that his constituents are screaming for representation and screaming for him to say something about Holsworthy, maybe this issue of the capital outlay for the hospital is his entree to that particular debate. So, as Minister for Finance and member for Macarthur, at long last he can find a legitimate reason to enter the Holsworthy debate, to actually represent the people in his electorate who are so concerned, and to do it in a fiscally responsible fashion. That is, to say that the capital outlay for the hospital would be wasted if the airport goes ahead and the hospital and other major facilities need to be demolished, and that this is a poor allocation of Commonwealth funding.",142,Represent Atives Main Committee
253,Mr Latham,"In the one minute and 24 seconds I had prior to the division, I was5484 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 It is an issue that is alive in the south west of Sydney and, indeed, throughout the region of greater western Sydney, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of all the crazy things that have been said and done in relation to the Holsworthy site, there is nothing more absurd than spending scarce public funds on a hospital, knowing that the allocation of a site for the airport at Holsworthy could lead to the demolition of that facility. With all the hospital needs, the health care needs and the capital facilities that are required around Australia, how wasteful it is for the government to be allocating that money and having the prospect of folly being held out by the site of Sydney's second international airport. The whole question of capital funding in the health area is also critical out of this budget, because there is a clear instance of folly, cost shifting and resource shifting in the way in which the government is holding out $500 million worth of incentives for private health insurance, but at the same time is dramatically reducing, I think by $800 million, the funding that is going through to the states for hospitals. So right across the board, and with the hospital funding at Holsworthy and the misuse of those resources, there is a need for the member for Macarthur to launch himself into the debate on behalf of his constituents, and to do so in a fiscally responsible fashion. This is your clear entree. Come into the debate, represent your electorate and say that it is a bad waste of the $20 million to go ahead with an airport when the hospital is just being completed at Holsworthy. But you should also recognise that, in the south-west of Sydney, there is a sad legacy of the period of the Fahey state government. Hospital resources are so inadequate throughout the region because they would not do anything about the reallocation of capital resources in health from the centre of Sydney to where they are needed on Sydney's fringe-the great population region. So here is Labor again having to tidy up all the problems that were caused by mismanagement by the Fahey state government and now by lack of representation by the honourable member in the federal parliament.

260,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (8.24 P.m.),"In speaking to this set of expenditures, I mention that5486 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 As I indicated in my second reading speech, on the evidence of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Senate estimates committee, the Treasury has indicated-unlike the Treasurer-that perhaps there is some doubt about the potential effectiveness of the scheme as proposed, in that it may not have the required outcome on national savings. I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the saving scheme in relation to my electorate because I believe that it is a sick joke that will do nothing for the majority of my constituents. The latest available figures released by the Australian Taxation Office show that half of the taxpayers in Lalor, Thomastown and Epping-suburbs within my electorate-did not earn any interest from savings at all. These people will get no savings rebate whatsoever. Those people who had savings which earned interest earned an average of $492. This translates into an average annual rebate of $74 per year-about $1.40 a week, or less than 20c a day. ThisI believe to be a sad joke. Perhaps my constituents will be able to put this pathetic amount towards their child-care costs, which will increase because of cuts in this area. Perhaps they will be able to put it towards the increased costs of their medication because of the changes to the PBS. Perhaps they can put the 20c towards the nursing home entry charges for their parents that this government seeks to introduce. Perhaps it can be used towards their fee for employment services, which the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, seeks to introduce. Half of these people will receive an average rebate of 20c; the other half will receive nothing. This savings initiative is nothing but a shameful hoax. It is all the more contemptible because it comes at the expense of superannuation contributions which would have assisted these people in retirement and would have achieved a great deal towards boosting national savings. Those in their mid-30s on average weekly earnings who are lucky enough to get the 20c a day must be aware that it comes at the expense of $110,000 from their retirement income packages-that is, $110,000 less towards national savings. In putting together the statistics for the suburbs in my electorate, I was particularly disappointed to find that the Australian Taxation Office no longer gives the type of detail by postcode that it used to. I believe that, in the interests of meaningful analysis, the ATO should attempt to present the statistics in such a way that they are easily able to be compared. It is also interesting that, since the bringing down of the budget by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has gone into his kitbag of emergency notions to try to deflect from other issues and grabbed at tax reform, but tax reform in the minds of this government is a code for the introduction of a GST. At the time when a GST was previously proposed, it was contended by the proposers that a consumption tax in some way leads to an increase in national savings on the basis that, because it is a tax on consumption, people will be less likely to consume and, therefore, spend money and thus retain savings. The people in the suburbs that I mentioned earlier have very little non-discretionary expenditure. They will not be able not to decide to buy the things that they need for day-to-day living and, therefore, there will be no effect on national savings because of those people's expenditure and spending patterns. I believe that as the debate continues on the goods and services tax-because that appears to be the major plank that the government proposes to raise as part of its tax reform package-we will need to look at the experiences in other countries that have shown that these types of GSTs have not had the proposed effect on savings. Tuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5487 The debate that we are going to see about a GST is not a substitute for the government looking at policies in the area of employment. The GST and the types of tax reforms that the government is going to propose in the lead-up to the next election do nothing for the creation of jobs or to give people a greater sense of job security. (Time expired) Main Committee of the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, and the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98 to the foreign aid allocation for 1997-98 and, in particular, to the allocation for Africa. It is deplorable that for the second year under the Liberal government the ODA vote has been reduced in nominal terms and that it has been cut in real terms by 12.6 per cent over the past two years. As a percentage of GDP, it has fallen from 0.31 per cent to 0.27 per cent in that time-the lowest level for several decades. But even more deplorable is the cut in aid to Africa, aid which has been reduced in nominal terms from $108.7 million in 1995-96 to $87.7 million in 1997-98-a cut of $21 million or 19.3 per cent. In real terms, this amounts to a cut of 22.7 per cent. That is a reduction of almost one-quarter in just two years-almost double the real cut in total aid. Why was Africa singled out for especially severe treatment? The government, through its minister or in its budget papers, gives no explanation except to try to excuse the cut by pointing to the IDA contribution to the World Bank and saying that, as 40 per cent of the International Development Association funds are allocated to Africa, 40 per cent of our IDA contribution for 1997-98 of $121.5 million will be spent in Africa, resulting in a total Australian contribution to Africa of $140 million. However, this excuse ignores the fact that this point is true every year and that the allocation for IDA this year is actually $6 million less than for the previous year. The $140 million figure is also a rounding-up of an actual figure of $136.3 million. The reality is that there is no excuse for cutting funds to Africa, especially not to a greater degree than the cut to aid overall. This is especially so if, as the minister claims in his foreword to the budget paper on page xi under the heading of Australia's overseas aid program 1997-98, the principal objectives of Australia's aid program should be to ensure the reduction of poverty and the promotion of economic development as a permanent means of overcoming such poverty. If those are the principal objectives of the government's aid, how can it possibly justify slashing funds by one-quarter for the poorest continent in the world, the continent experiencing the greatest difficulty in achieving economic development? Just look at the facts: 33 of the 48 least developed countries in the world are in Africa. Most of these countries have a GDP per capita of less than $US2 per day. Indeed, World Bank figures show that, in 1993, there were 219 million people in sub-Saharan Africa-40 per cent of the region's population-living on less than $USI per day, and that that number had increased by 40 million in the six years up to 1993. In regard to poverty, Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is clearly well qualified for our aid. With regard to economic development, Africa's economic performance has been very poor until the past year or so. Over the 15 years from 1980-94, real GDP per capita for Africa declined by 15 per cent. Many African countries now have a level of real income per head less than in 1970.

As World Bank Vice-President Madavo said in Nairobi last month, what is needed is rates of growth of eight to 10 per cent if Africa is to eradicate crippling poverty. Clearly, that is not going to happen. World Bank forecasts are for growth in sub-Saharan Africa to be 3Y2 to four per cent in the near future. A major debilitating impediment to growth in many African countries is their extremely high levels of foreign debt and official debt. Of the 41 most indebted poor countries in the world in 1994, 27 had a foreign debt to GDP ratio of over 100 per cent, and 21 of those countries were African. Furthermore, 13 of those 27 countries-12 of them African-had scheduled interest payments on government borrowings of over 100 per cent of government revenue. Obviously, they cannot allocate anywhere near 100 per cent of revenue to their debt servicing, so their debt mounts inexorably and their financial predicament becomes even more excruciating. Of course, such countries obtain virtually no benefit from rapidly expanding private capital flows to developing countries, flows which all go to a handful of countries. Sub-Saharan Africa got 3.6 per cent of foreign direct investment to developing countries in 1994. Accordingly, the foreign aid allocation for Africa is highly unrepresentative of the need for economic development in that region. (Time expired) Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I am pleased to see in the chamber the Minister for Trade and Acting Prime Minister( Mr Tim Fischer). We are all conscious of the very important role he plays as the Minister for Trade. Of particular concern to me are the savage cuts that have been imposed on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by this budget. I know it is always difficult as you are dealing with competing interests, but I cannot see why we have closed our mission in Copenhagen. It played a very important role not only in Denmark but also in the other countries that it had responsibility for. I suppose this will be an extra burden now on the post in Sweden until they close that mission. I had always hoped that at some time we would be able to open an office in Helsinki and in that way deal with some of the countries nearby, such as Latvia. That hope, I suppose, is now fading even further. We have also closed our post in Nauru, not that that would have brought much here, but it sent an important message. What we are doing by cutting funds to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is sending all the wrong messages about Australia's interest in the area. The member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) spoke very eloquently about the cut to foreign aid to Africa. I notice in front of me the excellent report prepared by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Australia's relations with Southern Africa. I was the chair of that committee until the election and so someone else had the honour of bringing it down. The committee put a lot of work into that report and it has been very well received, not only here but also in Africa. We highlighted many of the points that the member for Gellibrand was making about poverty in Africa. Although we were dealing with the SADC countries, we had hoped that in bringing down that report we would rekindle Australia's declining interest in Africa. We made much, during the apartheid years, of our interest in southern Africa. However, since democracy has come to South Africa we seem to be withdrawing from there and not showing any interest at all.",147,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (8.35 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak on these appropriations for theTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5489 Apart from the cut to aid, my other concern is the cut to funds for population programs. I had hoped that we would restore funding to the IPPF and to the United Nations Fund for Population and Development that was so savagely and severely cut in last year's budget. At a time when Australia was increasing its funding in that area, we came in and cut massive amounts of money from those two programs. Although we did not cut more this time, neither did we put extra funds in there. I thought that at some time the cuts last year, savage as they were, would have only been a temporary measure and we would have started to redress the balance. These population programs are important, especially to our near neighbours in the Pacific. We are sending all the wrong messages. I said that last year, and nothing has changed my mind. We are sending the wrong messages to those Pacific countries. We are indicating to them that Australia does not care, that Australia has no concern for them. The one issue that I and everyone I speak to cannot understand is the cut to Radio Australia. Why do it? Minister, you more than most of us would know the important role that Radio Australia plays throughout Asia. It is not expensive-a couple of posts at a mission would pay for it. However, once we cut that service it will never recover. Do not think that by us cutting our radio service that there is not going to be a service there. The Brits are coming in, as are the French and the Chinese. Many nations are trying to come in there. At the very time when other countries are coming in and when Australia is making much of our relationship with Asia, we are cutting the cheapest and most effective way of getting across our message to Asia about what Australia is and what it stands for. We are doing that by cutting funds to Radio Australia. (Time expired) I want to indicate that I believe there is another reason why we should be maintaining, if not increasing, funds to Africa. That is, that this region, apart from being poor and having great trouble in establishing economic development, is currently facing the scourge of HIV/AIDS in a devastating way. Consider these facts: in October 1996 the UN estimated that, for the whole world, six million people have died of AIDS and that there are 22 million people currently living with HIVI AIDS, which number is increasing by 8,500 a day or 3.1 million a year. Of that 22 million, 21 million are adults, over 40 per cent of them women, and one million are childrenmost of whom have been HIV infected in their mother's womb or, post-birth, infected by their mother's milk. Despite the concern this disease has created in developed countries, it is the developing countries, which account for 90 per cent of HIV/AIDS sufferers, which have the real problem. Nowhere is this more true than in sub-Saharan Africa where 13 million people have HIVI AIDS-that is, about 60 per cent of the world total. The extent of this epidemic in a number of sub-Saharan countries is absolutely devastating. For instance, in Zambia, out of a population of 9.4 million, it was estimated in 1995 that 1-i2 million people were HIV positivethat is, 17 per cent of the population. This did not include full-blown AIDS sufferers. One in three of the population aged between 15 and 50 was HIV positive. In Botswania, population 1.4 million, an estimated 180,000 people, or 13 per cent of the population, were HIV positive. In Zimbabwe, population 10.9 million, there were an estimated one million HIV positive cases, or nine per cent of the population and one in four of the age group 15 to 50. In Malawi, population 9.6 million, an estimated one million people were HIV",148,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (8.40 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, further to my earlier remarks,5490 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 pOSltlve---over 10 per cent of the population. By way of comparison, Australia, with a population of 18 million, has about 11,000 people currently living with HIVI AIDS-that is, 0.06 per cent of the population. The impact of this pandemic on the sub-Sahara is already severe and will become more so as the vast numbers of HIV infected people become AIDS sufferers. Apart from the great increase in human suffering and loss of life, there are extremely serious social, economic and even potentially political consequences from this holocaust. Family life is being devastated by the death of parents, with many children ending up in crowded orphanages or becoming homeless street kids in the cities. Families are forced into debt and poverty through the extra health cost they have to bear and the loss of productive family members. Education levels are being reduced through the inability of stricken families to afford school fees or because children are needed to earn a living or to care for the sick, and also because of the deaths of many teachers. The health system of these countries is being overwhelmed. In Zimbabwe, in many hospitals over half of the beds are taken up with sufferers from HIVrelated illnesses. The economies of these countries are also being severely affected. Large additional costs are imposed on the economy through the need to fund prevention programs, as well as greatly increased health costs to care for those infected. This puts great pressure on already strained. if not overwhelmed, budgets and crowds out any other necessary expenditures for social and economic development. Furthermore, with the disease concentrated on the most productive age group, the widespread loss of skilled personnel is reducing both the quantity and quality of labour. This is especially the case for white-collar professionals, which group has the highest incidence of infection. Accordingly, these countries are losing many of their most skilled managerial and professional people in business, the public service, teaching and academia. Even parliaments are severely affected. For instance, in Zambia, which has a parliament of 155 seats, there have been 22 by-elections in the last two years due to deaths, of which 20 are thought to be AIDS related. Thus, institutional infrastructures and the quality of government are at risk of being undermined by the loss of such personnel. So too are the enterprises of these nations which face continual loss of their key personnel and management, loss of productivity through employees being ill on the job or absent because of their illness or the illness of other family members. The impact on some industries will be absolutely staggering. In Zambia, a study of the copper industry several years ago showed 60 per cent of the labour force in the industry were HIV positive-this in an industry which accounts for 90 per cent of Zambian exports and 25 per cent of its GDP. Exports from these countries will also be adversely affected by the impact of HIV/AIDS on agriculture and the likely diversion of tourism to less risky destinations. However, the statistic that perhaps best sums up the horrific nature of what is happening in these countries is UNDP's estimate that, without AIDS, African life expectancy would have been 62 years by the year 2000, but with AIDS it is expected to be only 47 years. How, one may ask, in the face of such a total calamity, can we in all conscience slash our aid to these countries? But that is what we have done. Shame on those who are responsible! is my maiden speech as a minister in this particular chamber.

In response to those views let me say that it is never easy, given the challenges of government, to work through an exact allocation of priorities within each portfolio and between portfolios. I am sure the memher for Gellibrand can well recall during his previous ministerial positions when in government just how difficult that process can be. You do have to make judgments on priorities. You do have to arrive at the right conclusions with regard to program allocations. This year Australia's aid budget under the provisions of this budget will be $1.430 billion. In the tight budgetary circumstances, as we build towards a surplus in next year's budget, this represents a decrease of only one per cent on the estimated 1996-97 outlays. It is a large amount of money; it is $1.430 billion. Yes, it has been shaved over the last two years and had we not been left with the huge Beazley $8 billion plus black hole, we would not have had to embark on this path. We are very conscious of the need to proceed with care. I take particular note of the comments of the member for Gellibrand with regard to the plague proportions and crisis proportions of AIDS and HIV. They are indeed very startling figures which he presented to the committee here tonight. The AusAid budget is a large budget, one carefully allocated and with a particular focus on countries in south Asia and other parts of Asia which are closer to home. That does not ignore completely the circumstances of Africa. As the member for Gellibrand has acknowledged, there is a continuing allocation, but it is one which he would like to see increased. I can only say that the government has, in the circumstances, done as much as it can do. Of course, we will continue to provide, through multilateral arrangements, additional aid with regard to HIV-AIDS worldwide. Turning to the comments of the member for Throsby, the closure of the Copenhagen and Nauru missions were difficult decisions, to be frank, and were ones which I know were carefully weighed by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, and myself and others before reaching that conclusion. In respect of Copenhagen I would point out that there are posts elsewhere in Europe in Athens, Belgrade, Berlin, Bonn, Brussels, Budapest, Dublin, Holy See, London, Madrid, Malta, Moscow, Nicosia, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, The Hague, Vienna and Warsaw. Locating posts involves getting the right balance between various parts of the world and within various regions of the world. It was not a decision taken lightly. Governments, from time to time, close posts, and governments, from time to time, open posts. For example, we have picked up on your decision of a couple of years back to reopen Beirut in Lebanon and retain that post. It is an important post in the Middle East. I note his comments with regard to Radio Australia that an additional $4 million was supplied from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to recover in part the reductions in budget allocation to Radio Australia. Radio Australia does have an important role to play. The real enemies of Radio Australia, I have since discovered, rested in the senior echelons of the ABC. If it were not for elements within the ABC and their agenda against Radio Australia, we would not have been presented with the shutdown circumstance we were confronted with. However, we have dealt with that, turned it around, and we have provided now for a continuing operation of Radio Australia, albeit on a reduced scale. 5492 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the estimate to the committee. I thank the member for Gellibrand and the member for Throsby for their deeply held views which they presented to the committee tonight. I also say to members of the committee, especially as they examine the trade side of things, to study the trade outcomes and objectives statement which I tabled at the start of this year. It gives a very good overview of our trading circumstance and it has a statistical backup. accept that the budgetary position excuses the cut in aid. The budget deficit that was left by the former government was one of the lowest budget deficits in the Western developed world, as was the level of government debt; and neither of those circumstances in any way justify cutting aid to people in tremendous need. As I have a bit more time now, I want to refer to a particular cut that was made in the budget in relation to a program which was advertised to non-government organisations last August. It was called the ANGOP, which I think is the African and non-government organisations program, and it has now been axed. But in February 1997, AusAID wrote to the Australian NGOs requesting project ideas by mid-April for a program that it had announced after last year's budget. They received 48 proposals. All the NGOs acted in good faith and put a great deal of effort and planning into the proposals. This work was matched by others in Africa, where communities and their leaders had also done a lot of work discussing and planning the types of projects which would respond to the needs of local communities. AusAID was due to announce the successful projects in the week after the budget was brought down. However, the NGO representatives were told, as part of a briefing on the night of the budget, that the program had been cancelled as a result of budget cuts. So a program was announced at the time of the last budget. Everyone worked like hell on it from August last year to May this year, and on the night of the budget they were told that all that was a waste, it was gone. This was not only work by people in the NGOs here in Australia, with their scarce resources allocated to working up good projects, but also work by people in Africa who had been very much involved in trying to work up those projects so that they were good, decent projects. World Vision has said that six of their projects have been axed as a result of the wiping of the scheme. They were: in Ethiopia, a project to improve the health of 41 ,000 people through clean water and improved sanitation; in Malawi, a project to provide HIV/AIDS education and home based care support to 62,000 people; in Malawi, a project to improve seed supply and to increase farm yields and food security for 30,000 people; in Uganda, a project to help 10,000 people affected by HIV/AIDS; in Mozambique, a project to improve the health of 20,000 people by improving water supply and sanitation facilities; and, in Mozambique, another project to improve the health of 37,000 people through improved water supply and sanitation facilities. That was just one NGO with six proposals. There were 48 altogether. The wiping of this program, announced in the last budget and knocked off on budget night this year, wipes out a whole raft of very decent projects which have been worked on assiduously by the NGOs. It has been a total waste of their time and effort in producing these projects and a total waste of the time and effort of a lot of people in Africa who have got better things to do in trying to make something of their lives than muck around with aid projects that do not come to anything. I think that has been a quite deplorable development.",150,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Willis (Gellibrand) (8.50 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, first let me say that we do notTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5493 In the report referred to by the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis), Australia's relations with Southern Africa, which was produced by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade last year, there are lots of recommendations, including recommendations for good governance. That is very important in Africa. There is no point in us just saying that we have got to hand money over to them to waste because they do not have good governing and administrative procedures. We want to make sure there are good administration and good governance principles applying in the various nations of that continent, and there are recommendations in that report for that to happen. In the case of Zimbabwe, for instance, a number of people have come to this country from the parliament and there have been quite beneficial impacts from what was called the small activities scheme and the good governance program that was run under that. But, as a result of this budget, that scheme was knocked on the head. So there will be no more in the way of us helping to improve good governance in Africa through that program. That is just deplorable. It is tremendously wasteful. This is an area which everyone agrees is fundamental. We say to the Africans, 'You've got to lift your own game. We're not going to keep giving you aid unless you operate properly, get rid of corruption, lift your performance in terms of your economy, make sure you apply democratic principles, et cetera.' But when you have got programs directed to that, to good governance, and you wipe them, how can you possibly justify that? It just goes against all common sense and against the report of the joint committee. (Time expired) the Internet as a potential market for small business in the country and in my electorate. One of the inhibitors of small business and commerce on the Internet is the concerns that consumers have about the security of commercial transactions. It is relatively easy for an informed Net nerd to intercept e-mailsandcommercialtransactions.This has led to a serious concern and a lack of consumer confidence in commercial transactions. Into this problem area emerges a company called Nexus, which has developed an encryption product which has been widely recognised in the industry as second to none. It is a 448-bit key encryption product which takes about 2,000 to 3,000 years to decrypt using a high-end conventional PC. Such an excellent encryption product has caused security organisations some concern, because it infringes on their assumed right to peruse the personal e-mails and transactions of citizens. Consequently, the government has refused to award Nexus an export licence after the company had landed a very significant contract with the World Health Organisation. Frankly, it is beyond me to know why the Australian government feels it necessary for their intelligence organisation to have the capability of inspecting the internal e-mails of the World Health Organisation. Nonetheless, it goes beyond a debate simply about whether intelligence organisations should be able to decrypt the private e-mails of citizens in Australia to citizens elsewhere. This is a debate about whether people have confidence in the Internet as a forum for commercial transactions. Australia has one of the highest take-up rates of technology in the world. Because of that, arguably, Australian business stands to lose the most, because of the lack of consumer confidence in the Internet as a vehicle for doing business. My concern with what has happened to this particular company with their product goes beyond simply the disadvantage caused to this company by the limiting of the export of its product. It goes to the potential that Australian business has of exploiting the emerging",152,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Darga Vel (Fraser) (8.55 P.m.),"My question goes to trade and the emergence of5494 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 opportunities presented on the Internet. This particular company, apart from being denied an export licence, asked what it would take to get permission to sell its product to Australian government departments. It was told that, if its software were vetted by an organisation, it could go on the list. The government has outsourced the vetting process to a private sector company--coincidentally, a company which also engages in the marketing of encryption software. It eventuates that the company that also markets encryption software has said that it will take a great deal of time to assess this particular company's software and that will cost the very small business in Australia some $250,000. This is a small business that is trying to pitch a product at under $250 per unit per twin-site licence. So, in that environment, you have a small business that really has to do better than a company like BHP to make itself worthwhile. To add insult to injury, in the system that the government is asking this company to go through, it is required to hand over its source code to the American private sector company-to vet it on behalf of the Australian government! Quite a situation, clearly, and one that is not sustainable. In my view, it is inconsistent with the self-professed ideology of members opposite that talks about the rights of the individual-the rights to privacy, the rights to individual freedoms and so on. acknowledge the generous amount of time that the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Tim Fischer) has given to the Main Committee, which reflects his capacities as a parliamentarian and, even though I might not agree with him as a politician, I respect him as a parliamentarian. I want to express briefly my concern about the climate change debate in Australia and Australia's attitude to it internationally. WhilstI realise that the meetings that will happen very soon, following the G7 meeting and the so-called Rio II, will not necessarily lock everybody in, they are very important in the run-up to the Kyoto conference in December. We have to get the balance right. I acknowledge that this has to be a whole-of-government approach to a fairly important question, but I also note that on page 52 of the portfolio budget statement of the department it says: Directions and outcomes of key international environment negotiations which safeguard or advance Australian economic, environmental and other interests ... When we talk about 'other interests' in this debate, we should not just talk about trade and industry interests alone; we should balance them against not only the world's environmental interests, but also Australia's environmental interests because, as I have said before, the environmental problems that the world has know no geopolitical boundaries. We have to keep that in consideration. The other thing I wish to touch upon briefly-and I know that the Acting Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister for Trade, has made his views pretty clear on this-is social clauses in trade agreements, whether they be multilateral agreements or bilateral agreements. Australia's role is to show leadership on these questions. It is in Australia's interests to develop some of these questions through trade agreements. One social matter that I have raised from time to time in this place is the question of child labour. This is a difficult problem for a number of countries within which child labour is practised. It is a very important problem for the economies of families and the like, but this is something on which Australia, in the best interests of Australia as a nation, needs to show leadership.",153,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (9.00 P.m.),"I will not delay the committee for very long. ITuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5495 I appreciate that, as Minister for Trade, the Acting Prime Minister has made his position clear. I note that that position does not necessarily deviate greatly from that of previous trade ministers, even in Labor governments. This is an ongoing debate that we continue to need to have. It is in Australia's interests to enter into these debates with countries, either at a multilateral level or at a bilateral level. thank the member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis), the member for Fraser( Mr Dargavel) and the member for Scullin( Mr Jenkins) for their additional contributions. With regard to NGOs, I advise the member for Gellibrand that additional funds of $3 million have been allocated to the AusAID NGO cooperation program, whereby government funds are used to subsidise the fundraising of the NGOs. This represents a real increase of 17 per cent, or nearly 20 per cent in nominal terms, on that aspect of the equation. I am honest enough to say that that is only a very small aspect, because total funding available to NGOs in the next budget will decrease to around $88 million, compared with $102 million. However, AusAID expenditure is still maintained at $1.4 billion. That is a fairly big-ticket item in a budget which has to be carefully weighed on all items. This is overseas expenditure. I often find myself in a hall having to argue about why we give any foreign aid. There is a great deal of logic, quite apart from humanitarian reasons, as to why we give foreign aid, and I will always defend a sensible, efficient, and effective foreign aid program. However, I take particular note of the member for Gellibrand's comments and they will be referred to AusAID. With regard to the member for Fraser, I invite him to give the names of the companies in respect of export and the Internet matter to Mr David Crook, an officer from Austrade who is here tonight. We will try to follow up that issue. With regard to the member for Scullin, I value his comments. On climate change, the tide has actually been turning a little in the last few days. A report in the United States from the energy department is putting a more realistic tilt on the whole business of uniform targets which elements of Europe and the United States would seek to impose, and which would so disadvantage our GDP and coal jobs in the Hunter Valley, Central Queensland and elsewhere. I am pleased that when I went to the OECD Energy Ministers' Conference we persuaded the Europeans to sign up to a communique which says that targets should be achievable and realistic and take into account each country's particular circumstance. Of course the environment of the planet earth is a fragile circumstance; of course it extends beyond national boundaries. Yes, we will make a genuine and cooperative effort towards Kyoto and an achievement of something that is going to be practical, realistic and something which will engage the developing countries, not just the developed countries-and that is also a part of getting the equation right. But I am not and the federal government is not of a mind to go down some suicide economic path which in tum would ultimately add to the greenhouse gas emissions problem. We must carefully weigh this. We are proceeding to fight and put forward our diplomatic representations and, in fact, we are gaining some support. Recently, Norway has joined with Australia and hopefully there are others to come. On the social causes and child labour, it is unacceptable that in the 1990s anywhere in the world there is slave child labour with its horrific abuse of children. I must say that I feel most strongly about it as did Michael Duffy, a former minister, who was part of a report which was completed just at the change of government last year.

My beef simply is that there is an organisation called the International Labour Organisation and it should get on with the task of doing, among other things, all that it ought to be doing with regard to child labour. I do not believe that it sits happily in the World Trade Organisation arena. The correct way to carry it forward is in the ILO and I have discussed this previously with the Minister for Industrial Relations. I nevertheless agree that this abuse of children anywhere in the 1990s is absolutely unacceptable as is the fact that the Internet is being abused for child pornography purposes. Again, that was pursued by Foreign Affairs and Trade and by me in the OECD setting just two weeks ago. I do thank members for their thoughtful contributions to this estimates debate for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Department of Primary Industries and Energy Proposed expenditure, $435,682,000 of the rural scene that demanded urgent attention from this government and which were not addressed in the budget. Happily, the government has seen fit to extend exceptional circumstances coverage for an additional three months for those whose coverage was due to run out in early June. However, with a new or a renewed drought hitting the tablelands of New South Wales and other parts of Australia, despite some recent falls there will be no pasture growth this winter and precious little run-off. Despite this help there needs to be a further review of this three months assistance and, in the longer term, I support the views of New South Wales Farmers Association which is not prepared to endorse any wholesale modifications to the overall drought assistance measures until full details are available which provide for transitional arrangements. The farm sector is looking forward to the government's integrated rural policy package to be announced later this year which was forecast in the budget. The rhetoric is fine but the delivery of this package is vital to achieve its aims and I certainly hope such lofty aims will be achieved. Let me quote from the budget papers. The integrated policy package will draw upon several reviews of Commonwealth rural policy undertaken recently and the government will consult with stakeholders, industry groups and states before finalising elements of the policy later in the year. The objective of this package is to promote a self-reliant productive rural sector supported by targeted government measures which focus on building the skills and capacity of rural industries and communities to manage effectively in an uncertain environment. The environment is certainly uncertain. I notice that the National Rural Finance Summit Activating Committee will have an input into this package. In the main chamber the other night, I mentioned the plight of farmers in my electorate faced with a lending regime of banks that are charging usury rates, denying access to small business",155,Representatives Main Committee

These views were aired by farmers, small businessmen and rural councillors at the Bathurst Bank Forum last Wednesday. There must be alternative avenues for farm finance and the government must be proactive in supporting such measures and, if necessary, underwriting where proposals are sound. It is one thing to talk about self-reliance in the farming sector; it is another to expect the farm sector to carryall the risks. The sort of support I envisage is tax breaks, rebates or credits for farmers for droughtproofing properties or for those contractors involved in such provisions as haymaking. The Premier of New South Wales suggested this idea to the Prime Minister recently. That is interesting, as I provided Mr Carr with a copy of my first speech in this parliament-at his request-which included that very idea. It may not have been original, but I suspect that is where the Premier got the idea, and I am happy to share it with him and anyone else. I also hope the rural package to be announced later this year addresses the farm assets question for an intergenerational transfer of farms because that, too, is continuing to cause hardship. The supermarket to Asia strategy means nothing if we do not help improve the infrastructure to export our produce. It is interesting to note the recent unveiling of the ABARE export potential for inland New South Wales, which was delivered with more of a fizz than a fanfare in Parkes recently by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Brownhill, telling the inland councils what they knew already-the enormous potential for export from inland New South Wales. Was it, I wonder, a bit of catching-up by a government that has failed to support the concept of a fresh food export airport at Parkes, to which over 30 inland New South Wales councils are committed-an inland marketing concept now three years old where the Inland Marketing Corporation has already researched the potential? It did not need ABARE to spell it out for it. The feasibility study which is now being completed-paid for by Parkes Council, with help from the New South Wales government-is likely to show not only that the inland marketing concept, airport included, is viable, but that it has enormous potential to generate wealth and employment for inland New South Wales, its towns and its farmers alike. Is it any wonder that this government, which reneged on its election commitment to support the study, is furiously trying to catch up and claim some ownership of those statistics when they are published? thank the member for Calare( Mr Andren) for his contribution. As is so often the case, it appears that there are not a lot of people with a great deal of interest in this particular-and I think, vitally important-portfolio and the things that it touches on. In the circumstances, I will confine myself to brief remarks about some of the issues that the honourable member raised. He talked about exceptional circumstances and our recent brief extension of some three months of the drought relief payment to those for whom it was to end on 10 June. He indicated that he hoped that the integrated rural policy package would address a wide range of needs. I want to make the point that the integrated rural package is something that we have been working on for quite a while. It does indeed draw on the work of a large number of reviews but putting the thing together is extraordinarily difficult. On the one hand, we have a",156,Representatives Main Committee
271,Mr Anderson (Gwydir,"Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (9.14 p.m.)-I5498 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 responsibility to be compassionate to faun families who cannot meet their needs. On the other hand, we do not want to continue to create an environment in which much of the spirit of resilience, independence and innovation that has made the rural sector in this country so great is undermined. Finding the right balance is not easy. Let me say at the outset that one of the other major reports that we arc drawing on makes it plain that, despite some of the anecdotal evidence to the contrary, there is currently prevailing no failure of availability of farm finance to the rural sector. Businesses that have a future are able to draw on borrowings or on debt equity, if that is the way they choose to finance themselves-and, indeed, having been very closely involved with this portfolio for a long time, I must say that that has been my experience. It is a welcome change. It is unquestionably different from the situation which prevailed during the times of extraordinarily high interest rates that we saw under the previous regime. I make the point, too, that of far more value than interest rate subsidies-which, of course, we announced in the budget that we would no longer continue with-is a regime under which interest rates fall for everyone. As a general rule of thumb, only around six per cent of farmers at any given time were receiving interest rate subsidies or business support under normal RAS. It was always difficult to target and it was always hard to make it fair. There were always people who, by the criteria, should probably have been getting assistance but were not, and there were those who were getting assistance but who did not need or deserve that assistance. It is far better to get interest rates down for everyone, to develop a level playing field in which all can have the opportunity to maximise their performance. In that regard I want to say that, firstly, the government's fiscal consolidation objectives are plainly reaping benefits for farmers, but perhaps they were grossly underestimated. Some people talk a great deal about the $40 million-odd that went. into interest rate subsidies. The interest rates cuts that we have seen since this government came to power just 15 months ago are worth some $350 million to $400 million to the whole of the farm sector. Those cuts are extraordinarily valuable: they are the key to stabilising debt and the key to recovery. I note with a great deal of pleasure that farm debt in some sectors is now being wound back. Unfortunately, that is not true of the troubled beef sector and, at this stage, it is still not the case in the recovering wool industry. But many other sectors, including grain, appear to be not only starting to reinvest but also winding back debt levels, albeit not at a high rate; nonetheless, that is a very welcome development. The integrated rural policy package will deal with a wide range of issues, including a more streamlined, equitable and less ad hoc approach to farm welfare. It will also deal more effectively with the business needs of farmers: training, skills, benchmarking, marketing skills and more effective savings mechanisms such as IEDs, farm management bonds and those sorts of things. Finally, let me say that the supermarket to Asia program is an important one. If only it were as simple as being a matter of infrastructure; but it is not. It is about constantly upgrading Australia's approach to food safety, quality, packaging and marketing, if we are to achieve our objective of being a premier supplier of quality foodstuffs to our increasingly able-to-pay Asian neighbours. councillor gave an example of farmers who were trying to access small business loans at 7.9 per cent being turned away by the major banks and told that in fact they were not a small",157,Representatives Main Commitiee

The asset backing these farmers were offering was in terms of land which was close to Sydney and had the potential for subdivision by the banks should they need, down the track, to foreclose-which many have the tendency to do-yet they were asked to pay 11 Y2 per cent overdraft rates and a one per cent service fee. They are also penalised a percentage point now by one major bank because they are under suspicion of having Ovine Johne's disease. If that is an example of supporting the farm sector to try to trade out of difficulty, given that it still has an asset backing, I do not believe that the financial sector is in any way supportive of the rural sector. There is one other point I would like to make and that is that any jobs for the dole program, which I would prefer to see called Jobs Australia, should include a farm employment scheme. It should have an adequate training component involving two to three days a week at award rates perhaps, and be aimed at backing up the family farm. Such a program would offer the lone farmer the flexibility he or she needs to climb back to prosperity and get those basic jobs done that are desperately needed, like weed control, that has not been looked at in many months. I am thinking here of some of the serrated tussock problems on the tablelands. At present, farmers cannot get out on the three-wheeler to do the work. Apart from the cost of the chemicals, they need the labour assistance. They need that farm help that they once had. They will still be viable if they can get that bit of help. I see this as perhaps one program that the National Farmers Federation and local farming groups could pick up and promote as an idea that can make a positive contribution to the work for the dole program. It will be help the family farm and at the same time soak up some of the 30 per cent plus of the keen, and very skilled in some cases, young, rural unemployed. would simply like to invite the member for Calare( Mr Andren), if he thinks he has evidence, and I say this in good faith, of banks being unreasonable to farmers, to feel free to approach me on those matters. Having said that I would just say that after many years of dealing in this area, knowing it inside out, I say to you to look very closely at the real circumstances in each of these cases. I often have them bowled up to me but when you look at them you find that perhaps their equity is extremely low or that they really have no management system in place, or that perhaps it is not a genuine farming operation. I have to say to you that it is my experience that a farmer who can demonstrate that he or she is competently running a business, that they have some equity left, that they have a prospect of trading, can secure loans that are fully equivalent to, in every way, loans that are offered to the small business sector. I raise that point because it is very important for farmers to recognise that the old days of great loyalty to banks and expecting that loyalty to be reciprocated and what have you, are gone. Farmers ought to be prepared to bargain. They have to be prepared to shop around. They have to be prepared to thump the table and sell their own case. In those circumstances I think that the overwhelming bulk of farmers today ought to be able to secure loans below 10 per cent. If there is evidence to the contrary, that would be most useful for me as I seek to represent the rural sector. I make that offer in good faith. That wraps up all I had to say.

They relate in particular to the relative funding and role of the Office of the Employment Advocate compared to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and what it reflects in terms of the priority of the government in comparing the significance of Australian workplace agreements to awards and other agreements which go through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We have in this budget increased resources for the Office of the Employment Advocate and reduced resources for the Industrial Relations Commission. On the face of it there is a budget notation which indicates increased resources for the Industrial Relations Commission to discharge the extra functions that it has achieved as a result of the amalgamation with Victoria. However, as the Senate estimates committee process made clear when questioning the Registrar of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, when, if I can put it in the vernacular, the ons and offs are taken into account, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is substantially worse off. The registrar says the net result is about a $300,000 reduction in the running costs appropriation. Given the increased responsibilities of the commission as it relates to the handover in Victoria, that is a cause of concern to me. There was an unwelcome hiatus in the provision of resources to support workers and small business people seeking assistance from what was traditionally done by the Victorian government through Wageline, but I welcome the fact that there is now funding for that. That is, I assume, to be covered by this increased funding, but the cuts that flow with that to the resources of the Industrial Relations Commission make it less able to discharge that obligation. But I make that comment only as a backdrop. My particular concern is the role of the Office of the Employment Advocate. Of course, everybody knows, I assume, or at least those involved in this debate know, that the opposition's position is essentially that it is an office that should not exist. Half of its function should be performed by the Industrial Relations Commission and could be better done there and some should be done by the department. But that is irrelevant to this discussion. My concern is about the way that it is functioning and about the evidence that is emerging about the Australian workplace agreements for which it is responsible. The evidence before the estimates committee indicates an organisation operating in a bizarre fashion. I think the Employment Advocate thinks he is actually the Director-General of ASIO rather than the head of the Office of the Employment Advocate. He has undercover people running around, but only pursuing matters to do with freedom of association. There is no evidence at all of any spot-check or any activity about any employees concerned about any Australian workplace agreement. He is refusing to disclose to the parliament the most basic information that should be supplied in the interests of accountability to the parliament. He refused to supply the I 1 Australian workplace agreements that he has approved, even though we all accept that he would need to delete all the identifying information to conform with the act.

We have this gentleman seeking to run an undercover operation hoping to deny accountability to the parliament in the way that is available only to the nation's security organisations. It is entirely inappropriate. It is an action by a public official the like of which I have not seen before, having had all too many experiences with Senate estimates committees in the past, which I do not miss one bit. But I have never seen anybody behaving in the manner that this gentleman did and it gives me great concern about the way the office is operating. (Time expired) consideration in detail, I would like to respond to a number of the things that the shadow minister has said so that the record is quite clear, particularly in respect of the Office of the Employment Advocate. The first general background point he made was that there is something sinister to be derived from an examination of the funding for the Office of the Employment Advocate and the Industrial Relations Commission. you do not agree. But in respect of the funding for the Industrial Relations Commission, clearly, the role of the commission is changing. We have made no secret of that. You talked about its responsibilities. The fact of the matter is that over time you are seeing an evolution where its responsibilities are changing and affecting its workload, not just as a result of the Victorian transfer, but as a result of the operations of the Workplace Relations Act. In many areas the commission will have less work than it has had in the past-for example, obviously in respect of unfair dismissals but also in some of the general work that the commission undertakes. But the government continues to support the commission. We continue to ensure that it is appropriately funded. It does have a very important task ahead of it, a task defined by the Workplace Relations Act. One of its essential tasks is to maintain a credible safety net for employees who are reliant upon the award system to provide them with base protections. There has been no hiatus, shall I say, in the delivery of services in Victoria. We had a seamless transition from the Victorian government's operations to the new Commonwealth operation. By doing so in a very cooperative manner with the Victorian government, we continue to maintain services. Yes, there have been savings there but they come from rationalising the two services into one and I think that is in everybody's interests. In respect of the operations of the Office of the Employment Advocate, I think it would have been also fair for the shadow minister to put as a background to his comments about the",160,Representatives Main Committee

For example, you make this extraordinary and, I must say, not becoming comment that you have never seen anything like the performance of the advocate before the Senate committee. In fact, you misrepresented what happened before the Senate committee. He did not say that he was not prepared to produce certain documents. He said that, before he produced anything, he needed to first take legal advice as to what his obligations were under the Workplace Relations Act. How can you accuse a public servant of refusing to be accountable to the parliament when what he was saying was that he wants proper legal advice as to what his obligations are? That is what he said. The record is quite clear on that. To say that he is in some way attempting to refuse to participate or to respond to the questions that were put to him is, quite frankly, a gross misrepresentation. What some of your colleagues in the Senate wanted was the disclosure of Australian workplace agreements when the policy intention of this parliament is quite clear, and that is that that documentation is to be confidential to the parties unless they decide otherwise. I think it is a quite unreasonable attack for you to mount against the advocate. By all means, you may have your disagreements about the Office of the Employment Advocate but why don't you run on those instead of these baseless, silly allegations you have been making? Sure, the unions do not like the fact that the advocate has certain functions given to him by the parliament to enforce the freedom of association provisions of the act, but that is no basis upon which you can mount the sort of attack that you have made. There was one incident and in that one incident you have also been a party to the union's attack on the advocate. Some of the things have been a complete nonsense. He did not represent himself as a driver's assistant, which the TWU has been going around saying. There were no secretive, underhand tactics, which you have been endorsing out of the comments of the TWO. There was no intention to conceal his identity-that is another baseless allegation that was made. The fact of the matter is that he went to check the veracity of certain allegations made, which is a function the parliament has given him, and he acted legally and in an appropriate manner. So have your disagreements but keep to the facts. (Time expired) I would like to take up two matters that were raised by the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Reith). First, I seek information from him because his understanding of a matter of fact is different from mine, and I would be interested if he could give me the information-not necessarily this evening but subsequently-relating to the seamless handover in Victoria. I accept that in some ways that happened, but I have a particular concern with regard to the wage line activities, the information advisory service. My understanding from information that was given to me-information that I thought up until now was uncontradicted-is that the Victorian government's wage line activity ceased on 31 March and that the Australian government's activities to replace that did not commence until 1 July because there was no budget appropriation. I understood that to be the case. I have been advised by people who should have known that that was the case. I am not challenging in this instance the minister's word on that. I would be very interested to get the alternative",161,Representatives Main Committee
280,Mr Mcmullan,DidI say that?,162,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mr Reith,Everything you say about the advocate is in fact coloured by your views about,162,Representatives Main Committee
282,Mr Mcmullan (Canberra) (9.34 P.m.),"I do not want to pursue that issue further, butTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5503 information from him. He may not have it tonight, and it is not a matter of such controversy that I seek it this evening, but I would appreciate his information. It is not an issue of great controversy. I am just interested in the facts of that matter. With regard to his attack on me about the Employment Advocate, I made it clear this evening that, while I disagree with his view about the making available of Australian workplace agreements, that is a matter on which there is a possibility that there will be some contention. I accept that he has taken legal advice. I think he is wrong, but I accept that there could be some controversy about that. The question of whether guidelines for decision making should be available to the parliament is a well established matter going back four years. The possibility that they should not be made available seems to me, on the face of it, to be extraordinary. If there is some special circumstance in this matter, I will be fascinated to see what it is. The point that leads me to rise for a second time is actually the substance of the Australian workplace agreements that are emerging from the shadow of secrecy with which the government tries to drape it. The Employment Advocate-and in this instance I will say to his credit-has before the Senate estimates committee made it absolutely clear that the so called rock solid guarantee that no-one's take-home pay would be cut is and always was meaningless and is not reflected in this legislation in any way. What he said quite explicitly and accurately is that you cannot get less than the award which covers your area. I actually think that in the way he is interpreting the act that is not going to be the case, but that is not my point. There will be some evidence about that subsequently and we will deal with that. But where people have been operating for years and years on the basis of agreements that operate over and above an award the guarantee that they will not lose their take home pay means nothing, because the no disadvantage test operates against the award, which may be hundreds of dollars less than the prior take-home pay of the employees in question. After hearing the Prime Minister e Mr Howard) say they had a rock solid guarantee that no-one could cut their take-home pay, I am sure they would be surprised to find that this is what it means. We are already finding examples in the 11 Australian workplace agreements that have been approved so far of workers who are substantially-to the tune of hundreds of dollars a fortnight-worse off. This is not denied by the Employment Advocate. He simply says, correctly, that his responsibility is to judge these matters against the award, and he has determined they are not worse off against the award. In one instance of which I am aware, I do not think he is correct but, as I say, that is not the point I am trying to make this evening. That will take more research before I establish whether I agree with his interpretation, and I will raise that on another occasion. There are many more concerns I have about Australian workplace agreements and about the way they are being reviewed. I am amazed that up until now in none of the matters which the Employment Advocate has approved has he been in such doubt that he thought any of them needed to be referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for advice with regard to their compliance with the no disadvantage test. I am sure some of them are quite clear, and he gave an example in the Senate estimates which seems, on the face of it, to be quite clear, and there is no reason why he should refer such a case. But that none of them, including the two of which I am aware, created sufficient doubt in his mind to warrant a reference is a source of amazement to me. 5504 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 I am concerned about the pattern that is emerging of the impact of these Australian workplace agreements on the living standards of Australian men and women working under them. It is a concern I always had about them, and I sadly say it seems to be being borne out. to establish it. He says he is absolutely shocked that there has been no case of doubt as yet, but he can only draw from that some sinister inference. The reality is that-and it is relevant to his second last point-he is entitled to obtain undertakings from parties where he is not satisfied on the face of the documentation. I cannot give you the details of one of the agreements that you have been referring to, but I did notice from Work Force this morning that they claim that further undertakings were given in addition to the documentation, which is quite a nice little point because when youyou claim were the first AWAs in Australia being at the casino, firstly, I am told that the first A W As were not at the casino and, secondly, you did not have all the facts and you did not have all the documentation if Work Force is right. So all I say to you is: by all means, run your arguments, but see if you can get the facts, because you will have a better and more informed debate if you do. I want to say a few other things. Firstly, the member for Canberra began his speech by saying he would not pursue the issue of the OEA further. I am not sure what he meant by that, seeing we had a few other comments from him, but I am pleased that he said that. He wants some further information on the transfer of the wage line. My memory is that it closed one day and we opened it the next. I note that something was said, I think, in an estimates committee which raised the spectre of a gap. There was no gap, but let me confirm that with the member. That is my genuine understanding of it. In respect of the evidence that Mr Rowe gave to the Senate estimates committee, I am glad the member for Canberra now says that he accepts that Mr Rowe is taking legal advice. I think he should have said that, in fairness to him, the first time around. The member keeps referring to the guidelines. The fact is that one aspect of this is that they are not concluded guidelines, they are draft guidelines, and at this point in time Mr Rowe personally is approving all of the agreements. So they do not perhaps have the same longer term relevance that they will have once the operation is fully under way. Finally, the honourable member referred to the guarantee that we gave. The guarantee that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) gave as the Leader of the Opposition in January 1996 was quite explicit: that people would not be disadvantaged against the award. The speech that he gave to the Young Liberals on 8 January is quite explicit. There has never been any question about it. In fact, the only time we had some controversy about it was in a very neat response to say that this was a no-disadvantage test against the award. In fact, it is the opposition's nodisadvantage test. By and large, we have made it more flexible and, in a sense, it operates better. Those opposite had a no-disadvantage test against the award. We have a nodisadvantage test against the award. I think we have made it a better one in terms of flexibility and the like, but the basic concept has not changed. Are people entitled to have a no-disadvantage test against what they were last earning, which was the honourable member's proposition? Our response to that in the 1996 election was:",162,Representatives Main Committee

It is a nice little point because when you got very excited about whatTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5505 'Well, we're not going to give Paul Keating a guarantee that he'll be earning as much after the election as what he was before the election, because his circumstances will have changed.' The guarantee has always been very clear: a no-disadvantage test against the award. I do not know why you would find it such a deficient no-disadvantage test when, for years, you were in fact in support of it. I conclude by thanking the shadow minister for his contribution. I presume he has completed his remarks. I will be happy to confirm what I have said to him in respect of the seamless transition from Victoria to the Commonwealth in respect of the wage line. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Industry, Science and Tourism Proposed expenditure $1,699,412,000. I take the opportunity to make a few observations about the recent announcement made by BHP to cease primary steel production in Newcastle in September 1999. BHP established the steelworks in Newcastle in 1915. Since that time Newcastle has become very clearly and very firmly established as a steel producing centre, and the character of Newcastle since that time has always been identified in relation to steel production. I think this particular issue illustrates better than most other developments the general attitude of this government to issues of this kind. Steel making is a core activity in Newcastle and is recognised to be so. Despite the fact that BHP proposes to cease primary steel production in September 1999, the response of the government, first of all from the office of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), was that the Prime Minister would hear any submissions in connection with that issue but he would not intervene. We did not expect the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle and demand that BHP steel production continue. We did not expect that to be the form of intervention. But we did expect the Prime Minister to act as a Prime Minister. The response of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) was that we have to accept the realities of the world market. The world market is such that the demand for steel is expanding. BHP, as a major Australian corporation, could have taken advantage of that. Despite the fact that 2,500 people will lose their jobs and 2,500 families will be disadvantaged directly, and in excess of 6,000 individuals and families at least will be disadvantaged indirectly, Mr Moore said, nevertheless, that it was a good day for BHP shares. I did not hear that said, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I have heard it reported; and I have not heard it denied. I am disappointed and disgusted if that was said. It was a good day for BHP shares and for BHP shareholders, and that just shows how crazy this whole position is. Within hours, the value of BHP share.> increased by $1 billion as a result of the announcement that it would cease steel making in Newcastle. In 1983, the Labor government inherited an industrial graveyard in Australia. Industry was inefficient and uncompetitive. The proportion of manufactured goods which we exported was relatively small. During the 13 years that Labor was in government that situation was turned around completely. That was largely as a result of the very dramatic restructuring which took place in the framework of industry in Australia to make it possible for Australian industry to become competitive and to export to a greater extent than it had before.",164,Representatives Main Committee
287,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (9.44 P.m.),"In dealing with this area of the budget,5506 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 At that time, in 1983, there was a possibility that primary steel production in Australia would cease altogether. As a result of that, the Labor Party in opposition before 1983 put together what we identified as a steel plan. We said that within 100 days of coming into government the steel plan would be put into operation. It took a little bit longer than 100 days, but it was put into operation. Taxpayers' funds of $90 million went into downstream users of steel. As a result of that, it was possible for us to encourage from BHP a major commitment to continue investment in steel production in Australia. I am pleased to say that, until relatively recently, BHP honoured those commitments. The decision that BHP has now made was made despite the fact that the former Labor government had a commitment from BHP, as recently as 1995, that it would continue steel production in Newcastle, it would invest $200 million, and it would, if necessary, put in an electric arc furnace in order to ensure that steel production would continue in Newcastle until at least 2002. I will take an opportunity shortly to add further to these remarks. (Time expired) the future of the CSIRO research facility at Narayen near Mundubbera. Mundubbera is in my electorate, but Narayen is actually just across the border in the electorate of Hinkler. This has been a long standing research station on a very large property watered by a fine river system, and it is certainly an excellent property. It has a fine group of buildings, now mostly several decades old, an excellent airstrip and so it is well serviced as a property of quality, and a property which has the capacity to offer a facility for research in a wide variety of areas. It has traditionally been working in pasture research. Its future has come into question because the Beef Research Committee and, indeed, the beef industry as a whole are suggesting that there are other higher priorities now for industry research than pastures. Many people in the industry disagree with that assessment and believe that it is still very important to the grazing industry for beef producers to have available to them a research facility that can do work on developing the best possible pastures and appropriate management of such pastures. The facility has also played a major role in the development of the Belmont Red breed of cattle and has been involved in quite a deal of other work. Because the native pastures have been significantly improved as part of the pasture research, even though it is a large property, it has been necessary over recent times to lease some surrounding land to undertake some of their work. But the CSIRO have given no indication at this stage as to what the future of that research facility will be and the staff are naturally anxious about their future. The facility has been steadily wound down over recent years and the staff are also disappointed that the CSIRO has not given them an opportunity to undertake research in other areas. On a number of occasions they have put together proposals to undertake particular activities and these have not been taken up by CSIRO management. So it is not just a matter of the funding coming from industry sources; it is also a question as to whether there is any longer a commitment from the CSIRO to make effective use of this facility. Even if it is decided that, for one reason or another, there is no longer a future role for pasture research, then the property would have potential for quite a deal of other activities. For instance, it is in one of the most successful citrus growing areas in Australia, perhaps in the world.

This area could potentially be used for citrus research. There is also quite a lot of interest in planting vineyards and other small crops, various fruit trees and the like, so the opportunity would be there to use this property for that kind of work. It is a versatile property. As I have mentioned, it is well watered and it has some good quality agricultural land, though it is mainly a grazing property. For all those reasons, it does offer considerable potential for future use for scientific research. The property contributes significantly to its own revenue and could contribute more if it was able to operate on a more commercial basis. Their stud cattle are in high demand, but they could also produce cattle commercially on a much more extensive scale than happens at present. I am sure that the staff and the people of Mundubbera and Eidsvold would welcome a visit from the minister at some stage-hopefully, fairly soon-so that he can see the property first hand. It has a fine airstrip, so he could fly in without delaying his schedule too much. I am sure he would be impressed not only with the quality of the property, but with the dedication of the staff and the way in which they have undertaken their activities. This research facility is very strongly supported by the Mundubbera and Eidsvold communities, their shire councils, the local graziers and the farm organisations, who are all very keen to see its future secured. I would encourage the minister to visit the property soon and to provide a new role for the Narayen research facility to secure its future for the people of the area. the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism and the section Grants-in-aid, which refers expressly to grants-in-aid to the Franchising Code Administration Council. If you look at that expenditure item, you will see that it is precisely zero. That is because this government has withdrawn, from 1996, funding for the Franchising Code Administration Council, the body set up by the previous government to administer the self-regulatory code of practice established for franchising in 1993. After the government withdrew this grant-in-aid, the council received legal and accounting advice that it could not be confident of its solvency under the new funding arrangements. It appointed an administrator and ceased trading so in fact it is now out of business. Further to that, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs( Mr Prosser) rejected the calls by a parliamentary committee which conducted extensive research into this area for legislation to regulate the franchise sector. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs said that, in his view, an industry code of conduct would be the best way to resolve disputes between franchisors and their franchise operators. He further said: People are missing the fact there are a whole lot of fairly successful franchise operations out there. The government has got to be mindful not to put in place any arrangement that would in any way disadvantage these successful operations. The House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading in Australia drew attention to the fact that unfair practices in franchising have been a source of concern for some time. The inquiry noted that the Franchising Code Council, for the period from May to November of last year, received 123 formal complaints and an additional 2,500 inquiries. We further find that the Franchising Code disputes review received a submission from the Australian Franchisee Association saying that it had taken action against 32 franchisors on behalf of 53 franchisees. Once again that is very strong evidence of the extent of concern in this area.",166,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9.54 P.m.),"I wish to address budget paper No.4, for5508 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 The committee was able to establish that franchising contracts typically impose very heavy obligations on franchisees, while leaving franchisors' duties relatively undefined. It also points out that the obligations of the franchisor are vital to the franchising relationship and that these contracts, and the fact that franchisees have sunk costs into the venture, necessarily involve the danger of opportunistic abuse. The report states: The incentive that causes a business with sunk costs to stay in operation despite losses makes franchisees vulnerable to franchisor behaviour known as 'opportunism'. Because the franchisee will continue to operate even if it is not recovering its sunk investments, the franchisor can make decisions that induce such losses without the franchisee going out of business. When these decisions benefit the franchisor at the expense of the franchisee, the franchisor opportunistically extracts a portion of the franchisee's sunk costs. Similarly, the Business Law Committee of the Law Institute of Victoria provided examples of abuses in this area. They include rolling audits of the franchisee to gather evidence of the franchisee's non compliance, and in site specific franchises taking advantage of the franchisee's development of its economic area to force the franchisee to pay goodwill again for its business by threatening to open new stores nearby. All of these things added up to the committee making a recommendation that the Commonwealth should enact specific franchising legislation, providing for compulsory registration of franchisors and compliance with codes of practice. This is something that the House urgently needs to consider. We need change. If we look at the bankruptcy figures for recent months, we will find that bankruptcy has risen in excess of 20 per cent. The vitality and lifeblood is being drained out of small business. Small businesses in this country are bleeding to death. It is my concern that this is because they have, in the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, effectively put Dracula in charge of the blood bank. would be contemplating at the present time the end of primary steel production because that is really what this announcement amounts to. At this point in time, Newcastle is being targeted. There is very little question that Whyalla will follow, and other centres of steel production in Australia could well be in the firing line. Some people might think that BHP is no longer investing in steel production. That would be wrong, because BHP is in the process of investing a total package of about $1 billion, but not in Australia. All of that $1 billion is going towards investment in steel production in other countries. All the capital investment is overseas; the job creation is overseas; the technology development is overseas; the development of export potential is overseas; and the infrastructure development is overseas. The income being generated by the big Australian will be overseas because it has now decided that it is time to abandon Newcastle and the people of Newcastle. As I said, there will be 2,500 jobs lost in the first instance, another 1,500 on-site contract jobs and at least another 3,000 to 4,000 jobs upon which those people in the rest of Newcastle are dependent will also go-a minimum of about 7,000 jobs; 7,000 workers and 7,000 families affected. BHP said, 'We're pulling the plug. We'll invest $1 billion, but we won't invest it here.' We expect more from the national government. Government is not about sitting on your hands, as this government has been doing, and waiting for BHP to get in touch with you, as the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has said. Leadership is about getting on the phone and calling these people together so that an opportunity can be taken to ask, 'What are the options? What",167,Represent Atives Main Committee
291,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (9.59 P.m.),"It is almost inconceivable that AustraliaTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5509 can we do? What are your intentions?' That is not what is happening at the present time. The whole thing is an absolute disgrace! Labor had a steel plan when we came into government in 1983, and it was put into operation. At the time, there were 9,000 employees in steel production in Newcastle. As a result of our steel plan there was a major increase in productivity, which was encouraged and supported admirably by the unions and the work force. From 9,000 people directly involved in steel production in Newcastle the figure has been gradually reduced to what it is at the present time, to about 3,000. Those changes were gradual and were absorbed. There was an output of about 160 tonnes of steel per employee in Newcastle in 1983. They were told that it had to be 500 tonnes per employee, otherwise steel production could be under threat. They passed through the 500 tonnes target and reached 650 tonnes per employee; it is now about 700 tonnes per employee, and they have been told that if steel production is to continue in Australia it needs to be 1,000 tonnes per employee. We know exactly what the implications of all of this are. I said it before: government is about taking positive action and taking the initiative. It is also about responding to individual, family and community concerns. Just a week ago we had one of a number of gatherings in Newcastle to which the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) were both invited. They sent the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles). I say nothing against the member for La Trobe. He was courageous, and he was treated with every courtesy. But at that meeting we had present the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley), the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham( Mr Crean), the President of the ACTU, two bishops, four federal Labor members, six state Labor members, the Lord Mayor and over 1,000 citizens. Yet the Prime Minister and the industry minister could not be there: they sent a backbench member of the government, the member for La Trobe-who, as I said, was treated with every courtesy by those people whose future is threatened. That is the sort of thing that we are getting from this government. That is the sort of thing that the Australian nation is getting from this government. The Australian people are becoming increasingly aware of just what that decision in March of last year meant. I said when I started that Newcastle illustrates it well. Newcastle does illustrate it well, and Newcastle's reaction will illustrate the reaction of the Australian people. honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) underlines the regional importance of proper industry policy. Those who have studied the Newcastle region know that what is really required is to put in place industry policies that take into account the effect on that region. Likewise, although the electorate that I represent is part of metropolitan Melbourne, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne there are two areas where there has been real need and real concern about the direction of this government with regard to industry policy. The areas are, of course, the automotive industry-the passenger vehicle assembly sector-and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. If we take the total number of jobs in the northern and westem suburbs of Melbourne that are in those two industries, the decisions that are made by government have a great effect in a regional sense. And whilst sometimes that is clouded when you talk about regions within a metropolis like Melbourne, it is still very important.",168,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (10.04 P.m.),"The contribution that we have just heard from the5510 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 One of the disappointing aspects of the past 15 months or so of the government is the confusion that we see within this government on industry policy. If we look at the debate that we had over bounties-the backflips that we saw in the shipbuilding bounty, the backflips we saw on the robotic bounty and the backflips on the book bounty-it is of real concern that businesses in those sectors cannot really sit down and plan right through. Last week I had a meeting, in conjunction with the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), with some of the people who are involved in the automotive components industries in our two electorates. We had the honourable member for Hotham( Mr Crean), as the shadow minister, talk to them. One of the things that came out was the relief that they saw now that there had been a decision made in respect of the automotive industries. There was relief that they were able to now sit down and plan for the future. The government has to take into account the psychological effect that the lack of leadership-as the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) has highlighted-has had on industry policy. There is a need for government, and not only Minister Moore, to really look at industries. For instance, earlier in the year we had decisions made about the pharmaceutical industry, decisions that had to be put in place so that there could be a continuation and certainty in policy decisions by those in the pharmaceutical industry post the factor F scheme. Whilst there has been put in place some recognition of the importance the pharmaceutical industry has to Australia and there are to be forms of assistance, what this government has lost the plot on is matching industry policy against the effect that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has on pharmaceutical companies within Australia. At the same time, successive governments, not only the Labor government before this one but the coalition governments before that, put the lid on the price of pharmaceuticals to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This, of course, has had an effect on the pharmaceutical industry. That has been acknowledged by all. That was the reason why the elements of the factor F were put in place, so that we could achieve two aims. They were to manage the level of expenditure under the PBS, but also keep a domestic pharmaceutical industry that could be then used for exports. We have had great success in that. That is always what in those dual senses we have to achieve with our policies. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) has gone to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Finding a balance. The discussion of this is of crucial importance to the small business sector which is such a large employer within Australia. At the end of the day what we need to see in industry policy is the emphasis on the employment outcomes. The emphasis on the employment outcomes is our ability to manufacture here in Australia and to open up export markets so that we can ensure sustainable jobs, especially in the manufacturing industry. If this government is to achieve its aim to have 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000, it has to keep that in mind. It has to protect manufacturing industry's ability to be able to make decisions that will ensure that we continue to achieve export markets. (Time expired) the members for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown), Wide Bay( Mr Truss), Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) and Scullin( Mr Jenkins) for their contributions. The matters raised by the member for Charlton on behalf of his electorate have been well canvassed in the main chamber in recent weeks and will again, no doubt, be raised many times over. In the same vein, the",169,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Mcgauran (Gippsland,"Minister for Science and Technology) (10.09 p.m)-I thankTuesday, 17 June 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 5511 matters surrounding industry policy raised by the member for Scullin also has had much airing in the main chamber. Again, it will be an ongoing debate between the government and opposition. To set the record right for the member for Charlton, he did quote the Minister for Industry, Science, and Tourism( Mr Moore) as having said, 'It was a good day for BHP shares when BHP decided to end steel making at Newcastle.' I have never seen that reported, and I would be more than confident, if not certain, in repudiating it on behalf of the minister. Such a callous disregard for the sensitivities of those directly and indirectly affected by the decision to end steel making in Newcastle is not part of his make-up. The other thing the member for Charlton mentioned was the recent rally held in Newcastle at which the government was represented by the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles). May I take the liberty of reminding the member for Charlton of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism's visit to Newcastle on 19 May. Much of the discussion at that meeting focused on how the federal government's $10 million commitment could be used to create long-term employment opportunities in the Hunter region. In the same vein, on 29 May the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) met with a delegation of steel workers here at Parliament House, and he expects to be visiting Newcastle soon after his return from overseas, presumably during July. Turning now to the very interesting and important matter raised by the member for Wide Bay: it is not an unfamiliar issue with me given that he has made strong representations on behalf of Narayen Research Station for a long while now, and in that he is joined by the member for Hinkler( Mr Neville). It was very fair of the member for Wide Bay to mention the changing nature of research, to the point now where there is a question mark by the beef industry itself whether or not it wants to continue-and especially to the same financial tune-the research conducted at Narayen that previously went on. After all, if industry withdraws its funding, we do have a serious problem at CSIRO in how to make up the shortfall. I am very interested in some of the alternatives canvassed by the member for Wide Bay. He suggested that the staff are disappointed that some of their innovative proposals for alternative research in different areas has not been taken seriously enough. I certainly undertake for the member for Wide Bay to pursue that with the senior management of CSIRO. We do naturally want to draw on the experience and ideas of the people at Narayen, like any other workplace, for solutions to problems such as this. He also put forward the possibility of tying in with the dynamic citrus growing region that Narayen is situated within. He also mentioned viticulture and horticulture. They are alternatives which I will direct CSIRO to pursue, if it is not already. But I do hasten to assure the member for Wide Bay that my earlier commitment to him and to the member for Hinkler will be honoured-which is that there will be no precipitous evacuation of Narayen by CSIRO. Everything is being done in full consultation with the industry and other interested parties. It sounds-if the member for Wide Bay is to be believed entirely, and I see no reason why he should not-as if the staff may not be consulted in the same fashion that other interested parties are, and I will move to rectify that.Thank you for the invitation to visit. I expect to visit Narayen some time in the future but am unable to make a commitment at this time. 5512 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 17 June 1997 The member for Wills who is no longer with us raised the hoary old chestnut of the Franchising Code Council. May I remind the member for Wills, in his absence, that the Franchising Code Council chose to close down itself. Also, in fact, the government increased the funding available to the Franchising Code Council. briefly. draw my remarks to a conclusion, again thanking all the members for the vigorous manner in which they expressed their strongly held views. response that was made by the minister and also to assure the minister that I have not found the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism an insensitive person. I did not hear him say that; I did not see it in print. That is widely believed in the Newcastle region that the minister made that response. I hope that if he did not make that response that he will deny it. I will await that denial. The $1 billion that the value of BHP shares increased by within hours of that announcement having been made came out of the pockets, out of the food cupboards and off the dinner tables of those 2,500 to 7,000 individuals and families who will lose their jobs in Newcastle as a result of that decision. That is where that increase comes from. It is a direct transfer out of their pockets and out of their budgets straight into the pockets of those people who have shares in BHP. John Prescott earns $2.23 million every year; he is the boss of BHP. As a result of that decision, his shares went up, within hours, by $1.42 million in value. That is not bad to pick up. Ron McNeily, another top executive in BHP, as a result of that decision, within hours his share value went up by $639,000. Brian Loton did not do too well-his only went up by $146,000. Gerry Ellis's share value went up by almost three-quarters of a million dollars within hours of the decision being made that increased the value of BHP shares by $1 billion. I repeat: the decision by BHP was that in September 1999 primary steel production -in Newcastle will cease, with a direct loss of 2,500 jobs, an indirect loss of another 1,500 on-site contract jobs, and another 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in the Newcastle area. I do not suggest for a moment that they made their decision for the purpose of achieving that personal windfall; I do not believe they did. But they achieved the windfall as a result of a decision that they made which was prejudicial in the extreme, not only to Newcastle but to Australian industry, to Australia's future capacity in steel making, and to its position as a major and potentially greater steel exporting nation. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Debate (on motion by Mr Sercombe) adjourned. to make one comment. On behalf of all members of the HouseI make the point that we are pleased that throughout this debate the relevant ministers have been here for the whole of the debate for each section. I am reliably informed that this is the first time this has happened in some decades. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Main Committee adjourned at 10.19 p.m.",170,Represent Atives Main Commitiee
