And what an authentic history it is. We all know the cliches about history: to the victors the capture of history, the narrative captures the history, and so on. This history is nothing like that. As I said earlier, it is authentic; it is a labour of love. It is nine years since I launched Ron Ritter’s previous work, Spanning Time and Tide, now sold out at the Port Adelaide Sailing Club. This second book continues the virtues of his first book: authenticity, accuracy, sound research and the presentation of rare photographs. However, it deals with a much broader range of topics, which include the following: the Port Adelaide New Year’s Day regatta; the history of Black Diamond Corner; leisure time activities at Semaphore and Largs Bay beaches; the circumstances surrounding Tragedy Dock; the fire and explosion on SS City of Singapore; Fletchers Slip, South Australia’s first slipway; the 1928 waterside workers strike; the saga of Outer Harbor and much more. On this last matter, the building of the Outer Harbor gave my grandfather Walter, Wattie, a second nickname: the Punt Man. Prior to the building of the Outer Harbor, my grandfather worked for the Marine and Harbours Board. After storms it was my grandfather’s job to recover the punts that broke away from their moorings, and he did this single-handedly in a longboat with oars, oar over the stern. In his book, Ron refers to Sawford’s crew on Native winning the working men’s race at the port regatta in 1895 and my grandfather being beaten by Robert Angelinowich in a dinghy sculling race, oar over the stern, in ketches for a prize of 30 shillings. He would not have been too happy about that. Ron Ritter’s book Triumph, Tragedy and Port Adelaide makes a significant contribution to the history of Port Adelaide. It must be said that a great deal of the history of the port has been lost and that our ancestors did not always record what we would have liked-the quite remarkable history of Port Adelaide. That loss has been addressed in recent years by the Friends of the Maritime Museum in their magnificent publication Port Adelaide Tales from a Commodious Harbour by John Couper-Smartt and Christine Courtney. Ron Ritter continues that tradition. He is to be heartily congratulated. He has researched topics thoroughly for nine years in his spare time and funded his book’s publication in South Australia. Hyde Park Press of Richmond has done an excellent job; and good friend Errol Chinner edited the book. The foreword was written by Brian Samuels, who, more than any other person, has encouraged the written history of Port Adelaide. The launch will most appropriately take place in the South Australian Maritime Museum, Port Adelaide, this Saturday, 23 June at three o’clock in the afternoon. I very much look forward to launching this most invaluable history of Port Adelaide, by a man who has shown again his great love for Port Adelaide.

The group of 10 students, accompanied by three staff members, will be leaving on 2 July for just over two weeks, returning on 17 July. Three projects will be undertaken by the group. The first task will be making bricks at the Maharagama National Youth Centre. Once completed, the bricks will be donated to various housing projects in Galle. The second project involves working at Lake Maduganga Environment Education Camp. Here students will be clearing tracks, working on simple construction tasks and assisting with the rebuilding of local housing. Finally, the students will be going on a three-day adventure expedition. During the trip, the students from Reynella East will be linking up with students at Nalanda College. These students will then be visiting Australia later in the year as part of a reciprocal exchange with Reynella East High School. The school has fundraised for the trip, and, as part of their curriculum, students are learning about Sri Lankan culture. The trip is being organised through the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award and Ausquest. Students, staff and their families are attending cultural nights sponsored by Adelaide’s Sri Lankan community in their temple at Oakland’s Park. This nation saw a massive outpouring of support for the nations devastated by the tsunami, but it is so easy to forget the tragedy once the news images stop and there are no longer any phone polls seeking support. This school in my electorate still remembers those who suffered and are still suffering in the tragedy on Boxing Day. The school is going to lend a hand in the rebuilding effort. I congratulate the students and staff at Reynella East High School for this very generous effort, and I congratulate their principal, Rob Mutton, on this outstanding effort.

Mr David Hicks David Hicks at Guantanamo Bay and the lack of effort on the part of this government to have him returned to Australia. I wrote an article in the Australian on 15 January 2003, and I have raised the issue on a number of occasions. Mr Hicks was captured by the US military in Afghanistan in November 2001. It is now 3½ years later. What is known is that Mr Hicks did not contravene any Australian law as it was then. A special American process has been defined for him, and others, where he has been labelled an ‘unlawful combatant’. That was done so that he might be excluded from the protections of the Geneva Convention. The US government has sought to use Guantanamo Bay, a piece of Cuban sovereign territory leased to the United States, to create a legal black hole where people can be excluded from the American judicial process and not have the protections of the American constitution. Guantanamo Bay should never have been established. Charges have been delayed due to appeals, and there is a question mark over the charges Mr Hicks currently faces. He should be released and returned to Australia. There is a suggestion that there are some continued security concerns about Mr Hicks. These should be dealt with by ASIO if and when he is returned to Australia. He should be MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members

We cannot condone the continued indefinite detention of an Australian citizen on the basis that there is some perceived threat to security. This is a national disgrace. Australian citizenship must count for something. Americans cannot be detained under this process, so Australian citizens at Guantanamo Bay are subject to second-class laws. Unlawful combatants are second-class citizens. American citizens must be dealt with under the American constitution. The Australian government must demand Mr Hicks’s immediate return to Australia. I repeat: he is being kept over there because there are no charges that can be laid within Australia. That is the paradox-we are punishing an Australian citizen because he did not breach any Australian laws in place at the time of his detention. It is inexcusable and it cannot go on. Baxter Heritage) (9.38 am)-This morning I propose a five-point plan to help with the development of the wonderful town of Baxter. Baxter is a tremendous town. People work hard and retired people and young families live there. In many ways Baxter has not been given the full respect and full resourcing that it deserves. The first of the five points is that we want to work to ensure that there are additional aged care places to meet local demands. Point1 is all about aged care for Baxter. The Baxter village, which has now passed from the electorate of Flinders to Dunkley, does a tremendous job and it has been getting great support from the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson. I am delighted to be working with Bruce on providing assistance with aged care places for Baxter and the surrounding area. The second issue that I want to raise is about working to deliver additional before school and after school child-care places for Baxter. This town has a lot of working parents, a lot of two-parent working families, and child care is an issue that needs to be focused on. One of the things that I want to do-and we have already been able to deliver some significant results for Baxter Primary School-is to work with the primary school and with any other providers on additional out of school hours care places for children. I think that is very important. The third thing I want to do is look at the facilities for both the preschool and Baxter Primary School. Baxter Primary School is a well-managed school. I think we can work with them through Work for the Dole projects or through other forms of assistance to try to upgrade some of the local facilities. I think that is important. We have already had tremendous success through a formal Commonwealth program with upgrading the facilities at Baxter preschool. But we can go further, and I have already spoken to the leaders at Baxter preschool about that. The fourth point-a critical one for Baxter-is working to upgrade the dangerous BaxterTooradin, Hawkins and Fultons roads intersection. It is a dangerous intersection, and everybody in the area knows it. It is one of Victoria’s principal black spots, and we will keep pushing until this is properly upgraded. This leads to the fifth and final point, that we need to upgrade the train station and beautify it-exactly the same sort of thing that we are proposing at Hastings. Taken together, these five points in terms of aged care, child care, the schools, the roads and the rail hub will all work to make Baxter an even better place.

277,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andAdelaide Airport Land residents in the electorate of Hindmarsh a great deal of grief. The Adelaide airport land is a large area right in the centre of the electorate, surrounded by about 15,000 homes. Unlike many airports around the world, Adelaide airport is located just six kilometres from the CBD. That is great if you are getting on or off a plane, but for the people who live next door it is not without its problems. Aircraft noise has been an issue for some time, but more recently another challenge has emerged. The land has been made available for commercial development. The federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services last year signed off on a master plan for the airport land which includes provisions for non-aviation related development, including retail, recreational and commercial uses. Because the land is owned by the Commonwealth, it is not a requirement that development on the land comply with state or local government planning laws. The upshot of this is that residents often feel powerless to make a difference when developments that affect them get under way. But the Adelaide airport developments are also creating a very active and aware community, and residents are not taking these things lying down. Instead, communities are becoming increasingly active. There are about six very active residents’ groups around the airport, but today I only have time to mention two. Recently, a group of residents in West Beach became aware that the Adelaide Airport Club would be relocated opposite their homes. Unhappy with this decision, they rallied together and formed a residents’ group. Before long, they came to see me. They also spoke with Adelaide Airport Ltd and with their local councillors and their state MP, the member for West Torrens, Tom Koutsantonis. They have also written to the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I was pleased that Adelaide Airport Ltd, particularly the Managing Director, Phil Baker, was prepared to discuss this issue at length with residents and with me, and he has been willing to request that the club makes several changes to the plans for the new premises so as to reduce the impact on residents. The residents’ group has also collected hundreds of signatures from those living in the immediate area and asked me to table their petition opposing the relocation, which I was able to do earlier this week. The core members of this group have dedicated their time and energy to fighting this decision and to representing the many other residents in the area who would be affected by it. Already, they have achieved much. Efforts are now under way to ensure that the club’s licence recognises the needs of local residents. Another challenge for local residents is that which faces the Netley residents’ group. Whitegoods and electronics manufacturer, LG, has a warehouse on the Adelaide airport land opposite residents. Residents have repeatedly raised concerns about noise at the warehouse, and now the developer, Australand, wants to expand the building. I am told the expansion plans are not consistent with what is outlined in the master plan, and residents have every right to be up in arms about the proposal. In the interests of good corporate citizenship, I believe Australand should think again. Their plan is not within the intent of the master plan, and the residents are far from happy about it. Given the track record of the residents living around the airport, I would advise Australand to bow out early and gracefully, because these residents understand how to be part of a democracy and take action.

I quote from the media release: “Phase One of our research found that the overwhelming majority of Australians believe the number of abortions is too high, and 87% want that number reduced without restricting legal access to the procedure,”... “Phase Two of our research examined exactly how the number of abortions could be reduced. Australians were clear that we first need to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies through education/information and helping women manage risk, and secondly we need to offer pregnant women more options so that abortion becomes the option of last resort. “Popular options for pregnant women included changes to policies on taxation, health and welfare; as well as options such as counselling, better information and family/community support,”... Dr Fleming said there was considerable discussion about counselling including: That counselling should be available on the alternatives to abortion as well as on the risks associated with the abortion procedure That there was strong support for further funding for counselling services That Australians believe health professions should be more active in providing information, advice and support for pregnant women That counselling should be provided on an optional basis “There is considerable common ground amongst Australians in their respect for motherhood and their desire to move forward with the debate on abortion. We believe this data, the second phase in a four phase project, provides the evidence and opportunity for change,”... Senator Santoro has suggested that, prior to Medicare funded abortion procedures taking place, there ought to be mandatory access to Medicare funded independent professional counselling.

I Want To Commend Senator Santoro, Dr Flem","Lilley Electorate: Detention Centre government’s litany of deception and distortions when it comes to their proposed detention centre at Pinkenba, in the Lilley electorate. I rise to inform the House of the government’s broken promise to engage in genuine consultation with the people of Lilley on their plans to build this unwanted detention centre at Pinkenba and to report on the continuing indifference of the government towards the legitimate concerns of local residents. The government has finally owned up and admitted that it recently bought the Damascus Barracks site in Pinkenba in late May to build a 550-bed medium-security detention centre. This is a significant revelation because it confirms the government’s determination to force a medium-security prison of 550 beds onto an unwilling local community. Since 2001 the government has refused to come clean with the people and to reveal its plans for the site. There has been one deliberate deception after another-one thing said before the election and entirely another thing said after it. There has been underhanded sneakiness of the highest order. During the 2001 election, Minister Ruddock promised that the government had no intention of forcing a detention centre on an unwilling community and that any decisions that would be taken would be taken after the completion of the community consultation processes. They gave residents hope-false hope in the end-that the government would take on board their views. But clearly this was all window-dressing of a decision that had already been made. Two public meetings in the electorate and 90 per cent of residents surveyed voiced their opposition to a detention centre at Pinkenba, but the government’s mind was made up. After the 2001 election, Minister Ruddock wrote to me in July 2002 and said that they would go ahead with their plans whether locals approved or not. So the people of Lilley quickly learned that the government would say and do anything to get them through an election. It was the same old story before and after the 2004 election. Before the election Minister Vanstone denied that a decision had been taken on the centre at Pinkenba, but the budget documents after the election belled the cat, showing that money had been set aside for the project. Of course, this was confirmed when the government purchased the Damascus Barracks site in the last month or so. The people of Lilley will not forget the lies and the distortions of the Howard government when it comes to Pinkenba, especially those local residents who have fought hard against this proposed detention centre, including Margo Canavan, Betty Baldwin and Sandy Spadotto. Now that the government have admitted to buying the site without any meaningful consultation they are one stop closer to building a medium-security prison right within the metropolitan area. Building this detention centre in the middle of a built-up community is simply ridiculous. It is even more ridiculous, given what the government have been saying more recently about the nature of detention. I just do not see the need to continue with a 550-bed medium-security prison for the centre if their policy has changed fundamentally. The government like to pretend that this facility is only for visa overstayers, but there are very few of those each night in Brisbane. This is not some small holding centre; this is a fully-fledged, 550-bed medium-security prison located close to the airport and close to built-up communities.

282,Mr Swan (Lilley) (9.47 Am),"I rise to bring the attention of the House to the HowardCharter Boat Operators fishing operators who are very concerned about the proposed impost of some $30,000 per vessel in annual costs to their chartering operations being determined by the state government. While I understand the need to tighten maritime regulations and introduce a sense of uniformity to national navigational and safety guidelines, the blanket application of these rules without reference to local maritime conditions or safety conditions is draconian and deeply unfair to local business people. The new rules, which are contained within part D of the National Standard for Commercial Vessels, came out of four years of work by the National Marine Safety Committee. This process sought to review and replace the uniform shipping laws and provide an updated framework upon which state and territory governments could base new codes. PartD provides for a national standard of crew competency as well as standards for minimum adequate crewing levels. Most of the charter fishing vessels operating out of the shire do so on a shoestring budget. Often these businesses are operated by people who have retired from their principal job and use their charter business as a way of ensuring they have fuel in their boat and a modest income in retirement. In other cases these businesses are full-time professional careers for residents trying to support young families. Adding between $30,000 and $90,000 to the annual operating costs of these businesses will ensure that most of the small operators will be forced out of business-in the short term and at great personal financial loss. The National Standard for Commercial Vessels does specify a minimum crew, but it also specifically provides for local equivalent solutions for crewing. I put it to the New South Wales Maritime Authority that it is within their power to ensure the continued viability of these local small businesses. When framing these kinds of rules, clauses that provide for a local solution are not inserted merely for fun; they are drafted to provide for specific instances of where risks are lower. In an area like Cronulla, where the boats are operating within sight of land and close to the best rescue facilities in Australia, I firmly support a local equivalent solution. There is no pressing safety requirement for these changes. There have been no fatalities in New South Wales waters which have been the result of a lack of crew. The only recent death on a charter fishing vessel was at Narooma in 2003, when the vessel capsized while crossing Narooma bar. In Cronulla, Botany Bay and Sydney Harbour there are no bars to cross, with deep channel entries to the ocean circumventing these kinds of problems. The New South Wales government and the New South Wales Maritime Authority need to look at proposals from local boat operators in a constructive way to ensure that they do not drive local operators out of business.

He has a talent that, for reasons best known to Wes, he himself has hidden, and that is that he is a very well-performed singer. We had the pleasure of listening to Wes on one occasion in my office and I would encourage Wes to display his talents more often. He is a great contributor and good on Wes for the contribution that he has made already over 35 years. The second person rewarded with life membership at the state conference in Queensland was Michael Eborn. Michael is one of nature’s gentlemen. He is always available and volunteers to help. Within the ALP he has organised all of the branches in the state seat of Woodridge for more years than most of us can remember. But, in a sense more importantly, Michael is a great contributor to the broader community. He is a regular attender at St Bernadine’s church, a terrific guy and, I think, an ornament to the local community in Logan City. He has made an enormous contribution, very quietly going about his business but always available to help those who need a helping hand. The third of the three amigos is Don Wilkie. Don too is a very gentle soul. Don works in my office. I met him in the early 1990s when I was being introduced into the local area of Woodridge. There were a lot of tough nuts in the suburb of Woodridge but Don had lived in and around the area for many years and he introduced me to the local characters there and that ultimately led to my preselection and entering parliament. Don has enriched the lives of so many people, particularly migrants, because he works very hard-and I must say very successfully-on family reunion programs. It is just so delightful to see the beaming faces of people when Don is able to help them. So good on all three of them. Pacific Highway to the issue of the Pacific Highway, a major element of our transport infrastructure that is producing problems along the east coast of Australia. Certainly within my electorate, and particularly in the community of Coffs Harbour, the issues of traffic congestion and the high rate of accidents along the highway are causing great concern. I welcomed a visit to Coffs Harbour on 27 May 2005 by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson, to discuss issues about the Pacific Highway with local government representatives and concerned members of the business community. I am pleased that the federal government is currently working hard to negotiate an ongoing 10-year agreement for the continued upgrade of the highway. I think it is vital that this work continue just as quickly as possible. I certainly welcomed the announcement last year of $765 million to continue the upgrade of the road until 2008-09. This is vital work that just needs to occur. One particular item of local infrastructure that can substantially assist traffic flows and substantially improve safety around Coffs Harbour is the completion of the Hogbin Drive extension. This road runs parallel to the existing highway, and completing the last elements of this road has the capacity to take some 15,000 cars a day off the Pacific Highway and allow for separation of local traffic from highway traffic. It is vitally important that people going about their local business are able to travel an alternative route to the highway and be separated from the large numbers of heavy vehicles that are commuting along the Pacific Highway. Council has already invested a substantial amount of funds in completing the northern section of this road but there is still one missing link in the project which will cost in the order of $15 million.

A further substantial benefit would be that travel times would be dramatically reduced, particularly from the airport to the resort developments on the northern side of Coffs Harbour. The completion of the Hogbin Drive extension will have substantial benefits through reduced congestion, improved safety and improved environment within the city of Coffs Harbour. It is a project that must go ahead. I have certainly been lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister to see in what ways the federal government can assist to provide funding for this muchneeded road upgrade. A partnership between state, federal and local government could achieve this much-needed work and these improvements in environmental outcomes and in traffic flows that our community so greatly desires and so greatly needs. I think that it is a vital piece of infrastructure that must be completed. (Time expired) to on 21 June 2005, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 23 May, on motion by Mr Baird: That the House take note of the report. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (10.00 am)-I am pleased to comment on the committee’s report, which focused on the first public hearing with the Reserve Bank governor since the formation of the 41st Parliament. Importantly, these hearings provide for public interchange and go some way towards satisfying the expectation that, although the Reserve Bank should make its decisions independently of government, monetary policy decisions should have some degree of transparency and accountability, given their potential impact on all Australians. In his statement, the Reserve Bank governor gave an overall picture of the national economy that was somewhat different from the rosy view we get in parliament from the Treasurer. But the main interest is always in the movement of interest rates, and at that hearing it was clearly evident that rates would rise-as they did in March, when they rose by 25 points, remaining at that level since. Significantly, the Governor of the RBA departed from standard practice and expressed concerns regarding some imbalances in the economy. He gave a clear signal to the government that, while monetary policy could influence the interplay between demand and supply to maintain economic growth, only the government could institute reform that would reposition the economy and allow it to take full advantage of the economic opportunities presented. The governor claimed that, without reform to address capacity constraints, infrastructureespecially ports and export transport chains-and skills, the risk of wage increases was high and the ability to maintain commodity and resource export levels could be compromised. Inconsistency in economic indicators was also canvassed by the committee when it was revealed that 2004 GDP growth actually came in at 1.5 per cent, much lower than the forecast of 3.75 per cent. This clearly suggested to some committee members that a slowdown was occurring and that therefore an interest rate rise would not be justified. However, the governor MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Statements By Members
285,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"In accordance with the resolution agreedwas of the view that anecdotal evidence suggested consumption and demand were continuing to increase, and that was worrying to him. Interestingly, the ABS have since revised their retail sales figures upwards for the last years, apologising for their deviation from their usual high standard of reliable statistics. However, upward trends in retail sales, consumer confidence and wage growth had at the time clearly convinced the Reserve Bank that there was a need to dampen demand. The Secretary of Treasury has put forward a conflicting view since the hearing, which is that capacity constraints and skills and infrastructure blockages will not damage the economy sharply-nor, he claims, will they fuel inflation. His confidence in the ability of the market to adapt to these constraints is not surprising, and I think the Port of Newcastle is an excellent example of that. However, it seems that any attempt to apologise for the failure of government to anticipate, plan for and respond to these important determiners of economic success through real reform would be indefensible. At the time of the hearing it was not known to us that the May budget would take on the supply constraint challenges by offering big tax cuts to the suppliers of capital for the economy-the wealthiest individuals, who could be counted on to increase their savings and their investments as a result-while providing very small tax cuts for over seven million taxpayers, ensuring that there would be no inflationary or expansionary impact from the tax cuts. That is the lazy approach to economic reform, matched by some equally ineffectual welfare to work measures and skilled immigration increases. I anticipate that the governor will be asked about that approach to reform when we meet again in August. I attempted unsuccessfully to gain some insight into the normalising of regional data by the Reserve Bank and into how the Reserve Bank responds to divergences in the economy. Now that area of concern has since taken on some very different dimensions. The new divergence evident in our economy is between the states, not just between the regions and the capital cities. Growth in energyand resource-rich states like Western Australia continues to be strong, whilst growth in the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria is significantly slowing. This is another area for future discussions with the governor. The current account deficit and the terms of trade conundrum will require further deliberations by the committee and the Reserve Bank of Australia. It has been suggested by some analysts that this presents a new dimension in our economy. We now have greater personal wealth, greater demand and consumption, increased ease of access to our markets by other countries, a continuing strong dollar, an exchange rate that favours imports and a domestic supply that does not match our consumption tastes or our demand levels. We are learning that some of the consequences of what some infer is the ‘Gregory effect’ may include continuing unfavourable current account deficits and lower GDP figures-figures which, according to the governor, we will have to become more used to. What must also be mentioned is what was not disclosed at the initial hearing with the Reserve Bank. After the announcement of the interest rate rise in March, public statements were made by some board members suggesting that the decision to increase rates was far from unanimous. This is unusual, but perhaps points to the need for more transparency in the deliberations and decision making by the Reserve Bank. In fact, some members of the committee were interested in the deliberations that preceded the decision by the Reserve Bank not to MAIN COMMITTEE raise interest rates in October 2004, when the housing boom was continuing apace. However, these were not disclosed. The complaint to the AEC by the Reserve Bank regarding the government’s interest rate election advertising material compromising, perhaps, the independence of the RBA was not raised during the hearing. However, clearly we would like to discuss such an important issue, given the importance this country places on separation of responsibilities. In concluding, I thank the Governor and the Reserve Bank of Australia for this important dialogue and express my appreciation to secretariat staff. I thank Bev Forbes in particular, David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library, economists Chris Richardson and Saul Eslake for their assistance to the committee. I also acknowledge the media and community interest-in particular, the presence of many high school students at the hearing. ber for Newcastle, Ms Grierson, noting the large number of school students at the Reserve Bank hearing in Sydney reminds me that many of these school students have a knowledge of economics that would put most professional economists to shame. One of the most challenging experiences I have in my electorate is visiting classes of senior economics students, who subject me to a grilling, the intensity of which I would like to think the standing committee on economics might be able to emulate at some point. In the course of the governor’s presentation to the committee he discussed, as the member for Newcastle has observed, the current account deficit. I wish to make a few comments about the nature of the current account deficit, reflecting on the governor’s observations. The current account deficit is at a record high-there is no question about that-but it is not producing a record high of anxiety either among the business community or the economics community. Some of the reasons for that were identified by the governor. Firstly, we have a floating exchange rate, which is able to absorb the changes in international investor sentiment and the changes in flows of investment around the world. That gives us a great deal more flexibility than we had in the past. Another feature of the current account deficit, or Australia’s foreign debt, today is that it is not denominated in a foreign currency. The vast bulk of our borrowings is either in Australian dollars or hedged into Australian dollars. So in that sense, the foreign lenders are taking the currency risk. That, of course, is an enormous change from previous periods of high current account deficits. There are two other features about the current account deficit today. Firstly, the composition of it has changed remarkably. If we go back to the early or mid-1990s, we see that the current account deficit was composed of a very large fiscal deficit. The government was running deficits. It was a net borrower. Now Labor’s debt has been largely paid off and the federal government is moving to be a net lender. So the fiscal deficit has been largely eliminated. At the same time, in years gone by, Australian businesses were net borrowers; now they are net lenders. The switch that has occurred is with Australian households, which have gone from being net lenders-on a modest scale, to be fair-to being relatively considerably more indebted. That level of indebtedness has caused considerable concern not least to the Reserve Bank, not so much because of its impact on the current account deficit but simply because of the fact that, if households are highly leveraged, they are exposed to greater risk if financial MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Committees
286,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (10.06 Am),"The closing remark of the honourable memconditions deteriorate, if income declines due to changes in the business climate or unemployment or if interest rates were to rise. The rise in this household debt has been largely driven by the property boom-some would say the property bubble-and there is a very instructive analysis of this in a speech made late last year by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, in which he looks at the change in Australia’s saving/investment position as a percentage of GDP over different periods where there has been an increase in the current account deficit. What is remarkable about the last period, which he sets out as being from September 2001 to September 2004, is that, as in previous periods, there was a decline in savings and an increase in investment-that is what produces the deficit-but the three per cent increase in investment, which consisted of investment in dwellings, was extraordinarily high. So, in the period from June 1997 to March 1999 there was a 2.9 per cent increase in investment as a percentage of GDP, of which only 0.7 per cent was investment in dwellings. In the more recent period, 2001-04, that change in investment was three per cent, of which 1.7 per cent was investment in dwellings. What has driven the change is our fascination with real estate. That is why, in my view, we have seen this increase in borrowings by households, because obviously homes-property-are very easy to borrow against. It is much easier to borrow against bricks and mortar than it is for a business to borrow against its own cash flow. More recently, there have been some signs that the air is leaking out of this bubble and, again, I refer to a recent speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who observed that this slowing in domestic demand, which is taking pressure off the current account deficit because there is less demand for imports, is driven by change in the housing sector. In the last year we have seen a flattening of house prices-in some markets, a decline-a slowing in mortgage lending and, so far, a relatively modest contraction in house building. All that represents a slowing in domestic demand and will, in due course, feed into a reduction in our current account deficit. The opposition have raised the current account deficit issue and sought to criticise the government over it, but, on the several occasions I have heard the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer speak about this issue, I have never heard them identify any measures that the government should take. They have not, for example, suggested that the government should promote a recession in the manner of ‘the recession we had to have’, which was the previous Labor tactic to address current account deficits. They have not suggested we should impose tariffs, I am pleased to hear. But they have rung the alarm bellsPorts seeking to ask a question? issue has been rather like somebody that calls out ‘Fire’ but does not nominate any exits or any measures that can be used to address this apparent emergency.

293,Mr Turnbull,"To return to my train of thought, the opposition when dealing with thisresponse for governments when facing a current account deficit has been to put their own house in order and to save themselves. The Howard government has already done that. Mr Danby interjectingfinish the point I am making, and you will then be much better informed. You may be no wiser, but you will definitely be much better informed. What are the measures that the government should be undertaking? In an MPI last week, the Leader of the Opposition quoted from an article in the Economist which referred to the current account deficit. Probably because of a lack of time the Leader of the Opposition was not able to refer to two other factors in that Economist article. They were the remedies or the measures that the Economist urged the Australian government to undertake. What were those? Taxation reform and workplace relations reform. Is the government undertaking those? Yes. Does the opposition support them? No. The Economist, which was relied upon by the opposition in that MPI, also cast its own judgment on Australia’s capacity to deal with this issue. It did so by predicting that next year the current account deficit will have been reduced from somewhere over seven per cent of GDP to around five per cent of GDP-and some forecasters estimate it will go below five per cent. What that very distinguished economic journal was saying was that the economic reform measures that the government should be undertaking to deal with the current account deficit-among other things-are exactly the measures that this government is undertaking and exactly the measures that are opposed by the Labor Party. The Economist cast its own judgment into the future and expected that those measures would be successful. BeforeI accept the question from my friend the member for Melbourne Ports, I make one last observation on the importance of tax reform. It is quite clear that a major driver of the property boom has been the fact that, for taxpayers on higher incomes in higher brackets, leveraged negative geared property investments have offered a very attractive form of taxeffective investment. That has been the subject of commentary by a wide range of commentators-not least among them, the Reserve Bank governor himself. There was a very perceptive article in the Financial Review on 20 June, which made the observation that in the budget we saw a welcome reversal of adverse recent trends in policy towards household saving. The author, Geoffrey Kingston, said: By abolishing the superannuation surcharge and cutting the proportion of households exposed to the top two marginal rates, it offers big incentives for middle Australia to save less for retirement via leveraged property and more via superannuation. It should help remedy the inordinate 63 per cent of our private net worth locked up in dwelling assets and the upsurge in our foreign debt to 50 per cent of GDP. In these ways, the 2005-06 budget truly brings home the bacon. Assuming the budget fulfils its promise of lifting savings in vehicles other than leveraged property, the task of future budgets will be to reinforce success. tion? MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Committees

297,The Deputy Speaker,"Will the member for Wentworth allow a question?member for Wentworth: does he agree with US congressmen who argue that floating the Chinese currency-the yuan-would be a way of handling their country’s deficit and might have an effect on ours. What is your attitude to the floating of the yuan? regret asking it. America has a very different relationship with China than Australia does. America has a wide range of manufacturing industries which are subject to increasing competition from China. China’s competitiveness in the manufacturing sector is extraordinary and, obviously, if the yuan is revalued, that will make, prima facie, Chinese exports to America more expensive. That is obviously what American manufacturers seek. There is a very interesting dimension to China’s manufacturing journey from Australia’s point of view. One of the reasons our terms of trade have improved is not simply because the price of our raw material has increased but because the price of our imports, particularly manufactured goods from China-the world’s leading manufacturer nowadays-have decreased. (Extension of time granted.) China’s ability to produce higher value, more complex manufactured goods, which have traditionally come from higher cost countries, will not only impact adversely on manufacturers in the United States but also benefit Australia’s terms of trade. We will benefit from that because, of course, we are not producing those capital goods and equipment ourselves anyway. is already a big producer of motor cars. There are obviously risks and threats from China to everybody in its domination of the manufacturing universe, but the risks to the United States are considerably greater than ours and the opportunities for Australia outweigh the risks. As China’s manufacturing activities move into higher value products, there is likely to be a continued improvement in our terms of trade both as the price of imports declines and as demand for our raw material exports from China increases.

Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee Report Debate resumed from 14 March, on motion by Mr Barresi: That the House take note of the report. Working for Australia’s future: increasing participation in the workforce tabled in the House some months ago. This report, the result of a significant amount of work by 10 members of the House of Representatives, points to some of the deficiencies we have currently in the way in which the government is handling very important matters and provides the government with an opportunity to attend to those deficiencies in its policy. First, I would like to express my appreciation to all members of the committee, who worked long and hard to produce a very significant report.

303,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (10.23 Am),"I rise to comment on the reportwell in its proceedings. I would also like to make particular reference to the members for Calwell, Shortland, Swan, Brisbane and Canberra, and the shadow minister for small business, Tony Burke, who also participated. This effort has covered two terms of this parliament. The report had its inception in the last parliamentary term, but much of the analysis and construction of the report, based on the evidence before the committee, was done in this term. So there are a number of members to thank. Along with the member for Deakin, there were certainly other government members who put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that this important committee handed down a very broad-ranging report on increasing participation in our work force. Parliamentary committees are a very important function of democracy and of our system. I am concerned about the revelations that were outlined by the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday and since then-and I understand that they may continue-that have highlighted the failure by government to respond to the majority of committee reports in recent years. I am most concerned about that because parliamentary committees are a reflection of how democratic our institution is. If the findings of parliamentary committees are not properly responded to and respected, it means the parliament is not being respected. I should not have to remind the government that enshrined in the Constitution are not only powers to the executive but also separate powers to the parliament. With the coming 1 July change to the composition of the Senate and the government’s political opportunities in having majorities in both houses, today is a good time to remind the government-in light of the Sydney Morning Herald’s articles on the abject failure by government to respond to parliamentary committees-that they have an obligation, not only by convention but pursuant to the Constitution, to respond to and respect the parliament and not allow the executive to run roughshod over the parliament. I say that because, as the member for Deakin already outlined, there are many unanimous recommendations in this report that go to fundamental issues concerning our economy. Yes, it is true to say that there were some significant areas of disagreement and dissent. Indeed, four members-opposition members, it so happens-felt the need to dissent particularly in areas that went to how industrial relations and disability pensions operate. I will firstly focus upon those areas that we agreed upon, because government and Labor members of the committee agreed on 20 of the 23 recommendations. I want to touch upon a number of them. The committee got it right when it said there was a real need for us to attend to the skills crisis in this country. The committee made some recommendations, firstly by listening to evidence not only from the ACTU and social institutions like ACOSS but from peak employer bodies, who quite clearly said that their No. 1 concern in the workplace was not industrial relations but the skills shortages-the skills that workers need for us to respond to the changes in the economy. We now know that there has been a revolution in the workplace as a result of the changes in our economy as a result of a rapid change precipitated by what is called globalisation. Indeed, the newer economies are growing at a much faster rate than what are termed the older economies. But unfortunately, the government has failed to anticipate the skills required. Therefore, it is brave, wise and proper that not only Labor members of the committee but also government members of the committee point to those deficiencies. Recommendation 2 is: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government in cooperation with the State and Territory governments, industry, unions and educational bodies expand programs to maximise the uptake of MAIN COMMITTEE apprenticeships in areas of skills shortages and ensure that the training is relevant to the apprentices, the businesses and the industry. That recommendation seeks to attend to the deficiencies that we currently experience and to get the executive of the parliament to respond to our concerns. Whilst there was passing reference by the Treasurer to some of these things, we think that what should have happened, if the executive had been listening to the parliament, is that the executive-indeed the Treasurer on budget night-should have announced in the budget in the second week in May some comprehensive response in the area of skill shortages and taken up the recommendations made by opposition and government members in relation to skills. Unfortunately they fell on deaf ears. We do not really believe to date that the government has properly responded to this recommendation or incorporated it into its thinking and its policy. There have been a lot of words spoken about skill shortages but little proper response. The government would be wise to start considering our recommendations in that area. The committee recommended unanimously: ... that the Australian Government establish, as a priority, a dedicated cross-portfolio approach to develop a coordinated long-term strategy, including a series of newly funded programs and defined outcomes, to address national skills shortages. We believe there has to be some proactive intervention by the government to attend to the deficiencies in the economy, to attend to a matter that they have neglected for nine years and to really start anticipating what every other commentator and participant in the economy has already anticipated-that is, as the economy evolves and as the skills mix requirements change, we must be proactive in anticipating those changes. Indeed, I applaud the government members who have come to that realisation, although they had no choice in this regard because they listened to the evidence. The evidence from the ACTU and ACOSS and, more significantly, the peak employer bodies was that employers have major problems in finding people to undertake new work and work that is evolving and developing in our economy. I do want to applaud all members of the committee in finding common ground in that area. I also want to quickly touch upon some other recommendations. There was a recommendation for the government to attend to the effective marginal tax rates. We really believe, again, that this was another opportunity lost by the Treasurer and by the government. It is very clear to us now that the effective marginal tax rates are way too high for lower to middle-income earners. They are effectively an institutionalised, entrenched disincentive to find employment, when you have a combination of taxes and subsidies that could actually lead to people paying 70 per cent and 80 per cent. In fact, there was one situation where the combination of an amount of income, youth allowance and Newstart allowance actually resulted in a 104 per cent tax impost upon a person. So in fact they lost money when they worked. I moved a motion in the House in 2003 on effective marginal tax rates and the need to reduce them. The committee has recommended that that matter be attended to. Again, six government members, along with four Labor members, agreed that the government should attend to this matter so that those people on middle and lower incomes who are in receipt of some government assistance would not be penalised because they seek work. Again, instead of looking to mitigate the problems associated with that matter, the government has decided to ignore the fundamental concern here, give 45 per cent of the $24 billion to 10 per cent of inMAIN COMMITTEE come earners and really not address the systemic problems in our tax system. I do applaud the wisdom, courage and good sense of all members of the committee in relation to those matters. I turn now very briefly to the three areas of dissent that existed. It probably does not surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we did have some difficulty reconciling our views in relation to industrial law, industrial relations and industrial governance. The evidence we heard from a variety of groups indicated a number of things. Firstly, flexibility in the workplace can be achieved in all manner of ways-through temporary employment, casual employment or part-time employment, for example. There are all sorts of ways for any employer with any wit at all to ensure that they have a flexible workplace. Indeed, what we were given by way of evidence was that amongst the OECD countries we have the most casualised work force. However, notwithstanding that, the majority of the committee decided, against the will of the four dissenting members, to recommend that government pursue strategies for further award simplification-by reducing the number of allowable matters and encouraging greater work force customisation. Indeed, they also recommended that the government examine mechanisms to remove barriers to part-time and casual employment in industrial awards and other industrial arrangements. If an employer in this country cannot use the current system in a flexible way then they really have no idea what opportunities they have under the current arrangements. You can employ people using fixed term arrangements, casual arrangements or part-time arrangements. What else is required to provide flexibility? I guess that when government members talk about flexibility they are talking about a one-way flexibility. Their idea of flexibility is really an assault upon the maintenance of some balance in the workplace for workers, who deserve a decent quality of life-and the capacity to balance work and family-and some decency and dignity when they spend so much of their time in their workplaces. Instead, on this occasion government members of this committee blindly followed the ideology of John Howard, Peter Costello and other government frontbenchers and actually contradicted the evidence provided to the committee. Finally, I had concerns about the disability support pension recommendation. We clearly see this so-called welfare to work proposition as a completely bogus proposition. There has been no money properly afforded to this area to ensure that people with disabilities will find genuine work. This is a way of placing people with disabilities-the most vulnerable people in our society-in a situation where they will not have the same amount of assistance. (Time expired) the member for Gorton, the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, on the excellent work he did on that committee. An increase in labour force participation is necessary to deal with the problem of Australia’s ageing population. With an ageing population and a higher proportion of the population not of working age, it is necessary to have more of the people who are within working age actually in work. On that the government and the opposition are in the white heat of agreement. We also agree on the benefit of work for individuals. Work can provide a sense of achievement and a sense of worth. There are few things worse for a community than a sense of welfare dependency. This is apparent in some of the public housing communities in my electorate and other electorates where three generations of welfare dependants live side by MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Committees
304,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (10.38 Am),"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulateside and young people have very few non-welfare-dependent role models. This report is a good exposition of the economic need to increase Australia’s participation rate. I do not agree with all its conclusions, but I do think it has put the case well for urgent action to increase the participation rate. BeforeI turn to Welfare to Work, I would like to talk about productivity and particularly research and development, which this report deals with in its early stages. As a nation, we need to invest more in research and development. I was drawn to the Australian Industry Group’s submission to this inquiry, which pointed out that Australia and New Zealand are the only two countries in the OECD where private investment in R&D is less than public investment. We have seen R&D investment levels in Australia in recent years much lower than they were in 1996, and only now are they approaching the levels that they were at when the Keating government left office in 1996. Personally, I believe this government’s decision to reduce the tax concession for R&D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent to be probably the most backward decision it has taken in the realm of economics. The report correctly highlights the need for more R&D. The committee makes no specific recommendation about going back to a 150 per cent tax concession, but I think the thrust of the committee’s report was certainly heading in that direction. The committee’s work lends itself to that conclusion, and restoring the tax concession to 150 per cent would be logical place to start. On another matter, the report correctly highlights the growing issue of brain drain, of people leaving Australia. Over the last five years, the number of Australian-born people leaving to live overseas permanently has doubled. Of course, many of these are young and welleducated people. There are two ways of looking at this. On the one hand this is a problem which the government and society need to address-and I do not make a political point about this, because there is no easy answer-but there are advantages and opportunities here. I was drawn to a recent report by the Lowy Institute called Diaspora-the world wide web of Australians, by Dr Michael Fullilove and Dr Chloe Flutter. The report deals with this issue of the growing number of Australians living permanently overseas and the wealth of talent and networking that Australians working overseas in very high-ranking positions can provide to Australia, particularly with the trade opportunities that that can create for Australia. The report calls on the government and the parliament to take this issue seriously, to develop those networks and to make it a major goal of our diplomatic corps to have links with the Australian diaspora living overseas. The Lowy Institute report actually recommends the establishment of a parliamentary committee on the diaspora. Whether or not that is a good thing, I am not sure. But it is certainly something this parliament needs to consider, and it lends itself quite easily to the work of this committee’s report-that the government and the parliament need to deal with the matter of more Australians living permanently overseas. On the one hand we need to take steps to encourage them to come back to Australia when they have learned great skills in places like America, Europe and Asia and to contribute to the Australian economy. But on the other hand, while they are living overseas, we need to encourage them to make the most of their experiences and the networking opportunities that are available. I would now like to turn to the major part of this report, which is of course the issue of Welfare to Work. The committee concentrates on the issue of disability pension and parenting MAIN COMMITTEE allowance, and it does this for good reasons. I wholeheartedly endorse recommendation 4 of the committee, which is: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the tax-free threshold, taper rates, effective marginal tax rates and income test stacking to maximise incentives to move from income support payments to increased participation in paid work. This was a bipartisan recommendation of the committee, as the deputy chair pointed out, but unfortunately it has not been taken up by the government. The government did not lift the tax-free threshold in the recent budget. Admittedly, it did propose a reduction in the lowest marginal tax rate from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, but this would be nowhere near as effective as Labor’s proposal of an extended low-income earners rebate, which would see the effective tax-free threshold at $10,000 a year. So Labor has taken up the committee’s recommendations; the government has not. In relation to taper rates, the government’s actions have been counterproductive. The taper rate for the so-called enhanced Newstart allowance is 60c in the earned dollar; however, the taper rate under the disability support pension is 40c in the earned dollar at low incomes. So the government has actually increased the effective marginal tax rate for people trying to move from the disability support pension into work. An opposition member-It is disgraceful. the government has not. The government has failed to act to improve the effective marginal tax rates. NATSEM modelling has shown that the effective marginal tax rates of over 60 per cent are a real disincentive to work. Tax rates are more than 60 per cent under the government’s proposed Welfare to Work changes. So, again, Labor has embraced the issue of reducing effective marginal tax rates, reducing taper rates and providing increased encouragement for people to move from welfare to work. This government has ignored the issue. Just this week, we saw the government ignoring a range of parliamentary inquiries and reports, and this is another one where the government had a golden opportunity in the budget to take up the bipartisan recommendations of this committee and it has completely ignored it. The OECD has also identified reductions in the effective marginal tax rates as one of the most pressing needs for the Australian economy. Reduced effective marginal tax rates were an important part of the welfare to work reforms implemented in the United States in 1996 and Great Britain in 1998. These two nations have introduced earned income tax credits, which is one way of reducing the effective marginal tax rate. Whichever way is chosen, the government must take action to reduce effective marginal tax rates. We will not see real welfare to work reform until this happens. In relation to the parenting allowance and the transition of sole parents from welfare to work, the committee also received some interesting submissions. I was drawn to the submission of Associate Professor Austen of the Women’s Economic Policy Analysis Unit of Curtin University of Technology. I endorse her submission. Part of that submission says: ... women’s ability to successfully respond to labour market opportunities, without sacrificing fertility, will depend on support given to them as they try to balance their paid and unpaid working roles. The gender division of unpaid labour; institutional support such as childcare and elder care, and availability MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Committees
305,Mr Bowen,"It is disgraceful. Labor has taken up the committee’s recommendations andof parental and other forms of paid leave will be vital in securing both economic outcomes for the nation and the well-being of Australian women. I have said on other occasions in the House just how inadequate the government’s actions have been in promoting welfare to work amongst sole parents. The government has reduced sole parents’ benefits by moving them onto an allowance that is lower than the one they had before. Worse still, the enhanced Newstart Allowance actually has a more punitive taper rate than the parenting payment, with a taper rate for low-income earners of 60 per cent instead of the 40 per cent taper rate that applies under the parenting allowance. Just as we saw with the disability pension, we see with the parenting allowance the government increasing the effective marginal tax rates for people trying to do the right thing-trying to move from welfare to work. Instead of the government encouraging them, as its rhetoric says it does, it punishes them. The government takes an ideological stake and drives it through as it punishes people trying to move from welfare to work. If you believed the government’s rhetoric you would believe that it was trying to help people moving from welfare to work, but what it is doing is punishing people who are trying to move from welfare to work. The government has also clearly failed to create anywhere near enough out of school hours care places to cater for sole parents returning to work. I note that even the Treasury, in its submission to this inquiry, says that women might find it easier to return to the work force with adequate and affordable child care. I would put it a little bit more strongly than the Treasury. The Treasury says child care might help; I think it is pretty obvious that it would help. But even the Treasury recognises the importance of child care. The government has not followed this up with adequate action. There will be 80,000 places created, but there is a shortfall already of 30,000 places. Before anybody moves from welfare to work, we have a shortfall in this country of 30,000 out of school hours places. I make a prediction that the 80,000 places now being created will be woefully inadequate and that the government, perhaps in the budget next year or the year after that, will create more places. It will be forced into action, it will claim credit and say, ‘Look how wonderful we are’, but really it should be creating all those places right now, as people move from welfare to work. Half of the funding for these places does not come online until 2008-09, while these reforms apply from 2006. Even when the extra positions do come online, they will be inadequate. The government will then create more positions, and will claim all the credit, but really it should be doing that right now. The UK government has taken a very different approach to the Australian government. Despite all the measures of support and assistance that the Blair government has provided, it still does not require sole parents to work until the child in question is 16. In contrast, this government has provided hardly any support for sole parents to return to work, yet it requires them to seek work when the youngest child turns six. There is also a contrast when it comes to assisting disabled people to return to the work force. Recipients of a disability pension in Great Britain are also able to access a personal adviser, who helps them develop an individually tailored plan to return to the work force. Government members should take note that, in addition, the Blair government has introduced a disabled person’s tax credit, at a cost of £120 million. Again, this reduces effective marginal tax rates for people moving from welfare to work. MAIN COMMITTEE So this government, in its wisdom, increases effective marginal tax rates, reduces support and pushes people back into the work force. The Blair government reduces effective marginal tax rates and puts £120 million into a personal work force access plan so that each person seeking to move from the disability pension into the work force has a personal adviser to help them work out their travel plans, how to get around on public transport in their wheelchairs et cetera. They get very personal and individually catered support from the Blair government, which still does not require sole parents to return to work until their youngest child is 16. This punishing government, by contrast, requires people to return to work when their youngest child is six. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.50 am to 11.04 am Blair government’s approach and the Howard government’s approach is stark. To continue that theme, in the area of child care the government of the United Kingdom has taken action to extend child care and out of school hours care. It has spent £330 million to provide out of school hours care for up to half a million people. It has also provided £100 million to improve training for child-care providers, taking all the steps necessary to encourage and support people as they do the right thing and try to move from welfare to work. The early figures in Britain on the number of people returning from welfare to work are encouraging and heartening. It is too early to say just how successful the British government’s scheme has been, but, as I say, the early figures are encouraging. I am not saying that the Blair government’s approach is perfect or that it should or could be adopted lock, stock and barrel in this country. However, one thing is clear: the Blair government has taken the approach that people on welfare often face great challenges in making the transition to work. The government of the United Kingdom has adopted the approach that these people should be helped and supported as they face the challenges involved in moving from welfare to work. The Howard government has taken the approach that the best way to encourage people to move from welfare into the work force is to reduce their benefits and to increase their effective marginal tax rates. Given a choice, I know which model I prefer-and it is not the Australian model, I am sorry to say. This is one of the most important economic issues facing our country. This report does a good job of outlining why it is so important. However, the Howard government’s reforms do not maximise the chances of moving people from welfare into work and they are based on bad economics. I hope the government listens to the alternative approaches, embraces them for the sake of our economy and listens to the unanimous views of this committee, both government and opposition, on the sorts of things that the government should be embracing to encourage people to move from welfare to work. I do not expect the government to embrace the minority report, although I hope it might, but I do expect it to embrace the unanimous report, which it has so far ignored. I encourage the government to do that. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.07 am)-As a person who served on the Standing Committee on Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation for the entire period of the inquiry this report is about-from June 2003, when the terms of reference were given to the committee by Tony Abbott, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at the time, right up until the report was tabled in parliament in March this year-I want to put on the record my thanks MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Committees
306,Mr Bowen,"As I was saying before the calling of a division, the contrast between theto all those people who gave evidence to the committee and to the staff attached to the committee. It was very much appreciated by all of us. We learnt a lot from those people and from hearing about their experiences-the experiences of people within the work force, the experiences of people who tried to obtain work and the experiences of people who were involved in various industries, training organisations and unions. The committee received evidence from a wide range of people. During my contribution today I would like to go through some of the issues that were raised during the inquiry. I have to say that I strongly support the recommendations of the report that were unanimous and those which were contained in the dissenting report. I will spend some time going through the dissenting report later, but I would like to start with the issue of skills shortages. The committee received overwhelming evidence from a variety of people about the fact that there are significant skills shortages within the Australian economy and community. That evidence came not just from one group but from a wide variety of people. Manpower Australia believes that Australia risks economic irrelevance unless its skills shortages are addressed. The shortages occur in a number of key areas. We need to address the shortages in those key areas if we are going to be competitive in the global market, but I really feel that the government has failed to address this issue of skills shortages and failed to address the fact that we are facing chronic shortages in the area of trades. We need to put significant investment into the area of developing and skilling up our work force. We do not need rhetoric. We need action. We need to listen to the messages that we are getting from organisations such as Manpower, Employment Services Australia and the Australian Industry Group. The message has come from a wide range of people that we have a chronic skills shortage in Australia. If we do not address that, we are going to become irrelevant. We need to put significant investment into the area of developing and skilling up our work force. We do not need rhetoric. We need action. We need to listen to the messages that we are getting from organisations such as Manpower, Employment Services Australia and the Australian Industry Group. The message has come from a wide range of people that we have a chronic skills shortage in Australia. If we do not address that, we are going to become irrelevant. I would like to spend some time discussing issues surrounding mature age employees. One of the most disappointing submissions that the committee received, from my perspective, was from Professor Saunders. Professor Saunders tended to write off mature age workers. He was of the opinion that it is a waste of money to try to retrain a blue-collar worker and get that person back into the work force. I find that highly offensive. At a time when we have an ageing population and when we need to encourage mature age workers to re-enter the work force, somebody who puts himself up as an expert says that these men-he highlighted men-are irrelevant. These negative stereotypes that exist in the community affect Australia’s ability to utilise a vital part of our work force. I agree with the Treasurer when he says that we need to get more mature age workers back into the work force. We should value these people. They are a valuable asset to Australia. With ideas like those expressed by Professor Saunders, we will go backwards, rather than forwards. I believe it is possible to retrain mature age workers and that, if we make the proper investment, as a nation we will be rewarded. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the organisations from which the committee received evidence was Westpac. Their evidence was in stark contrast to the evidence that we received from Professor Saunders. Westpac have adopted a policy of employing mature age workers. They can see that this is of great benefit to them. It puts them in a very strong competitive position in relation to other banks. Westpac believe that mature age people relate better to older people when they come into the bank. Westpac are employing mature age people within the client service area. People feel a certain confidence when a mature age person serves them at the counter. Westpac have employed somebody who is in excess of 70 years of age. That is highly commendable. That is the type of approach we would like to see taken by businesses in Australia-not the negative approach of Professor Saunders, but rather the positive approach of Westpac. The level of unemployment amongst Indigenous Australians is a condemnation of what is happening in Australia. All the strategies that have been introduced have failed this group in our community. They are over-represented in our jails and they are well and truly overrepresented in the unemployment figures. For too long the approach to addressing Indigenous unemployment has been to start another CDEP program. It is time we were serious about addressing this issue. Until we do, we cannot hold our head up high as a nation. This brings me to people with disabilities. We received a large body of evidence relating to people with disabilities. The recommendation of this committee with regard to this issue is one that I dissented from. I have a long history of working with people with disabilities, helping them access employment. I spent 13 years working as a rehabilitation counsellor, helping people with disabilities enter the work force. The current proposal and the recommendation put forward in this report will undermine the ability of people with disabilities to enter the work force. The first thing that a person with a disability needs to have before they are prepared to enter the work force or are able to even think about entering the work force is confidence that they will not be worse off. You must appreciate that there is a big risk associated with it. A person with a disability could obtain a job and only be able to maintain that employment for a very short period of time. Once you go over the magic 15 hours a week that is being proposed by the government, it will cause all sorts of difficulties for these people. To be able to assist a person with a disability successfully move from being on a disability support pension or Newstart, you need to have in place a proper program with a proper case manager. You need to have in place all the support that that person will need to successfully make that transition. If you have somebody who is moving from working in a manual occupation and is looking at entering something like a clerical position, you need to make sure that they have the proper ergonomic furniture, you need to have the workplace looked at and you need to make sure that you are not setting that person up for failure. One of the easiest things to do is get the job; it is maintaining the employment that is the difficulty. When I was very new in the position of finding jobs for people with disabilities, I developed a relationship with a number of people who were going through a program. These people were alcoholics. When they were sober, it was very easy to find a job for them. I managed to find employment for five or six of them. Unfortunately, it was only for a very short time that they maintained their employment. One of those people ended up being murdered. Once they found employment they felt secure, they felt that they had money, they felt that they were okay and they were tempted to have a drink, and they did so. The reason they failed was that there was no proper support in place for them after they found that job-at that time. I was MAIN COMMITTEE working as a disability officer with an organisation that only had placement procedures. Subsequently I worked with an organisation that provided ongoing support, and the outcomes were much better. SoI say to the government: be very cautious about where you go with these disability support changes, because there can be very negative outcomes if the proper supports are not in place. It is long-term support that is needed. Unless that happens, we are going to be setting a whole lot of people up for failure. I am sure members on the other side of this House do not wish to do that. I am sure they want to see people with disabilities succeed when they re-enter the work force. The Treasurer said in his budget speech that he would particularly target people with back injuries. Once again, that group needs to have the proper support in place, including the proper ergonomic furniture that I detailed earlier. In the last couple of minutes remaining to me, I will turn to the dissenting report. Recommendation 1 of the committee states: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue strategies for further award simplification by reducing the number of allowable matters and encouraging greater workplace customisation to suit industry and regional conditions. I cannot think of one occasion on which that proposal was presented to the committee. That was not the tone of the evidence we received. The government members took this up and ran with it. We do not feel that casualisation and part-time employment is benefiting the Australian work force. Increased casualisation means less security in the future, which does not in any way benefit workers. If this government is truly about building a strong economy, workers need security so they can plan for the future, obtain housing loans, buy houses and care for their families. This increasing casualisation is not the choice of workers. Some people have been employed for seven years as casuals. (Time expired) Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (11.22 am)-I am very pleased to speak to the report on workplace participation. I was Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Work Force Participation during the 40th Parliament but, unfortunately, the federal election was called while the draft report was being considered. As I did not rejoin the committee in the 41st Parliament I was unable to participate in the final presentation of this report, so I am particularly pleased to be given the opportunity to speak to the report today and to thank the member for Shortland, other members of the committee and the staff of the committee for their contributions and their assistance. The inquiry into the long-term unemployed was a valuable experience. The evidence submitted by so many individuals, organisations and stakeholders was challenging, and the inquiry was very much an eye-opening experience for me and my colleagues. This inquiry took place at a time when all the critical issues surrounding employment in this country were being discussed and debated, so clearly the report is current and very relevant. As a result, its recommendations will be helpful to government, to the opposition and to policy-makers alike. I agree with the comments made by the committee chair, the member for Deakin, that the report tackles some of the critical issues that relate to building both the size and the capability of Australia’s work force. Like all other members of the committee, I was concerned to hear evidence that, by the year 2030, Australia would have over 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill MAIN COMMITTEE them. This is indeed an alarming prognosis and, if true, it means we must act immediately to address the looming work force shortage. At a time when alarm bells are being sounded about the skills shortage we are currently experiencing, it is imperative that we address these issues immediately or we will have no hope of averting a potential crisis 10 or 15 years down the track. This report is pertinent, and its importance is also highlighted by the fact that the committee was almost unanimous in its recommendations. Of the 23 recommendations, there was unanimous support for 20, including the recommendations on apprenticeships uptake, on addressing long-term unemployment, on expanding and improving child-care assistance and services and on all but one of the recommendations relating to the disabled. These recommendations are of particular interest to me because they are of great relevance to the people I represent in the electorate of Calwell. I have mentioned many times in this place that my electorate has a large number of residents on disability pension support. We also have a large number of young people who take up apprenticeships because we are fortunate enough to have the Kangan Batman TAFE in Broadmeadows. It should also be noted that this inquiry was undertaken in the context of an ageing population and recommendations 8 and 10 go some way to addressing the increasing issue of mature aged unemployment, which is another significant issue in my electorate. During the hearings, what struck me most was that the evidence being given indicated a strong trend towards ageism in the work force. I remember then remarking that what the submissions were stating was consistent with what many of my mature aged constituents were telling me: there is a real sense of discrimination against you if you are seeking employment and are 40 years of age. If you are 40 and over, you have a problem getting a job if you are unfortunate enough to become unemployed. Many people reported that they were simply overlooked on the basis of their age, with their experience and skills not seeming to carry as much weight as they deserved. These reports have been backed up by figures from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which show that the majority of complaints before them, in respect of age discrimination laws, claimed discrimination in employment, with 65 per cent of those claims being lodged by men. Equally, many mature aged workers who lost their jobs were low skilled and had virtually no chance of re-employment despite being keen and often desperate to be employed. Given that most of these mature unemployed are simply too young to be out of the work force, it is clear that we need to re-skill this work force and provide incentives to stimulate employment recruitment. Similar problems are faced by the disabled, by Indigenous Australians, sole parents, migrants and the long-term unemployed with a lack of employer interest in giving them a go. If this year’s budget is about increasing work force participation then addressing all areas of disadvantage and hurdles becomes imperative. It is vital that, if the Welfare to Work reform is to be successful, it must tackle and look at employer attitudes and practices and see what can be done to alleviate impediments on that level. Twenty of the recommendations in this report have received unanimous agreement and should be acted upon immediately by the government. The remaining three recommendations, however, have not received unanimous support with opposition members producing a dissenting report covering recommendations 1, 9 and 14 because these committee members have MAIN COMMITTEE substantial concerns about these recommendations. As my colleague, the member for Gorton, has already stated: Our concerns about these three recommendations go to the negative effect we believe they will have on industrial relations in this country. As a former member of the committee, I also cannot support these three recommendations. I stand with the dissenting report of the opposition members for the following reasons. I would like to address recommendation 1 at this point. It concerns award simplification by reducing the amount of allowable matters and encouraging greater workplace customisation to suit industry and regional conditions. Along with opposition members of the committee, I do not support this recommendation because it does not reflect the evidence received by the committee, nor is there any evidence to support the assertion that reducing allowable matters in federal awards would improve work force participation. The evidence received by the committee did, however, suggest that improving award provisions by including provisions such as paid parental leave or job sharing would, in fact, increase work force participation. In accordance with that evidence, I support the proposed recommendation 1 in the dissenting report which recommends that the government pursue strategies to improve participation in the work force by encouraging employment conditions that are mutually beneficial, such as job sharing, permanent part-time and paid parental leave. Recommendation 9 concerns part-time and casual employment and recommends that the government examine mechanisms to remove barriers to the employment of part-time and casual employees in industrial awards and other industrial arrangements. I agree with the dissenting report in not supporting this recommendation as the evidence received by the committee highlighted that whilst there will always be a place for part-time and casual employment there are problems associated with such employment including a lack of training, an inability to save or secure a home loan as a result of being a casual employee, and difficulties balancing home and work responsibilities. I have to agree with the member for Gorton, who makes the very valid point that Australia already has one of the most casualised work forces in the world and a large number of workers in part-time employment. Both groups are heavily represented in my electorate, and I know-because I speak with many of them-that a great number would prefer to have permanent, full-time employment. AlthoughI agree that there is benefit in having flexibility in the workplace that allows for increased workplace participation, this is true only to a certain extent. A great number of Australians, far from feeling that the existing flexibilities provide greater opportunities for participation, are in fact feeling a greater sense of insecurity and underemployment. As such, I do not support this recommendation. Rather, I support proposed recommendation 9 in the dissenting report, which calls upon the government to undertake a comprehensive study on the growth of casual and part-time employment and the social and economic effects of such growth, so as to identify the impact upon industry, occupations, gender and age groups and to identify the adverse social impact on employees and their families. Recommendation 14 concerns disability support pension recipients and recommends that the government introduce increased work capacity provisions in determining eligibility for those in receipt of the disability support pension. We have seen this recommendation incorporated in this year’s federal budget. However, opposition members did not support the recomMAIN COMMITTEE mendation when included in the report, and we do not support the budget provisions which implement the recommendation. Much of the evidence presented to the committee indicated how difficult it was for people with disabilities to gain employment, largely due to the perceived attitude of employers that people with disabilities were not preferred. They were often seen as a burden, with employers often not prepared to pay for the adjustments required in the workplace. Generally, there seemed to be an attitude that people with disabilities were not worthy of long-term investment. Within my electorate are many examples of companies giving disabled employees a fair go, and these organisations include Brite Industries and a local employer, Mr Gary Marshall, whom I have spoken about in this place. He virtually makes it his business to employ people who are most at risk, and most of his work force is made up of people with some form of disability, people with long-term unemployment or mature age workers, who, as the member for Shortland said, when given an opportunity are able to perform tasks efficiently and successfully. It is being given the opportunity that is the problem. There is ample evidence to suggest that there is discrimination in the workplace against people with disabilities and the mature unemployed, in particular. I talk to Job Network providers, such as Distinctive Options, that specialise in finding placements for people with disabilities, and they have an incredible number of problems convincing employers that their clients are worthy of being given a go. So there is plenty of empirical evidence to suggest that it is very difficult for these cohort groups to find employment or to be given an opportunity. I talk to many of these people in my electorate, and they always raise the difficulties of perception and discrimination that they have. It is a real shame, given that in particular the mature aged unemployed have a wealth of experience and potential which, at this stage, remains untapped and needs to be harnessed if we are to avert a skills shortage-the 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them-by the year 2030. I raise my concerns about the prospects of a large number of people in the Australian work force who are out there ready, willing and able to work should they be given an opportunity, and I reiterate that we need to concentrate very much on employer attitudes. There are recommendations in the report that go some way towards providing encouragement for employers to take on what are, I guess, perceived to be the less desirable unemployed, but I think we are going to require more than just incentives; we are going to require a stick as well as a carrot. If we are going to be successful in the Welfare to Work policy that the Treasurer trumpeted loudly in this year’s budget, and if we are going to arrest the skills shortage and give Australians an opportunity to participate in the work force, we need to be mindful of the fact that employers have a great responsibility to do their part and not to pick and choose as they see fit. After having gone through that inquiry, it is very obvious to me that that was one of the greatest problems, one of the greatest obstacles, in the way of a lot of people getting meaningful and long-term employment. In conclusion, I do agree with the dissenting report that was put forward by my colleagues. I support proposed recommendations 14 and 14A in the dissenting report, which recommend that a broader and more comprehensive study be undertaken and that the 30-hour per week work test for disability support pensioners be retained, given the difficulties I have outlined MAIN COMMITTEE that people with disabilities have in gaining employment and then, as the member for Shortland said, in being able to maintain it. I would like to finish by saying that throughout this inquiry all committee members agreed that paid employment is important in reducing social disadvantage and improving Australian living standards and all members agreed on 20 of the 23 recommendations. What is now needed is for the government to take up the initiatives put forward in this report and to implement the recommendations which were agreed upon unanimously. I thoroughly recommend that the government also adopt the additional recommendations from within the dissenting report. As I said earlier, I think that the report comes at a critical time in the history of employment and the work force in this country. It makes some very sound and sensible recommendations-recommendations that I believe will go a long way to assisting with improving work force participation. In particular, the report goes a long way to assisting those people who happen to be in groups that at present are disadvantaged in the work force to be given a fair go and an opportunity to improve their livelihoods and build upon their aspirations for themselves and their families. Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation entitled Working for Australia’s future: increasing participation in the workforce. I take this opportunity to comment on the recommendations which prompted a dissenting report by Labor members of the committee-a dissenting report that it would seem from the Prime Minister’s recent statement on industrial relations he clearly chose to ignore. Before turning in particular to the three recommendations of the dissenting members, I would like to record my support for the report’s 20 unanimous recommendations. I believe that it is very important that the recommendations that were made by the committeeincluding reviewing the tax-free threshold; reviewing effective marginal tax rates; improving transition to work programs; expanding child care and after-school and holiday care; and improving access to employment programs-should be closely examined by the government if it is truly intent on assisting an increase in work force participation. I also support the recommendations of the dissenting report. It seems to me that the Labor members of the committee have considered the evidence more closely and clearly have a better understanding of the concerns of the average Australian. It seems that the dissenting members of the committee are more aware of the concerns that Australians have in relation to casualisation of the work force. It is true that more employees are facing longer periods of part-time and casual employment. Gone are the days when getting a job meant simply accepting regular, full-time working hours. Some have dismissed this as a change in the composition and structure of work in Australia. Nevertheless, it is occurring, and that fact is certainly supported by statistical evidence. In particular, it is interesting that in the statistics presented in the report the proportion of males employed on a casual basis has doubled since 1988. Additionally, over that same period, from 1988, the statistics show that total employment involving casual employment has increased by 50 per cent. The labour force statistics for April, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, record that more than 2.8 million people were employed on a part-time basis. Granted, a number of them will be happy to be employed on a part-time basis, as it will enable them to pursue other MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Committees
307,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.37 Am),"I rise today to comment on the report of the Standingactivities while earning an income, such as raising a family, caring for aged parents or, indeed, studying. However, many people do want to work more. In 2004, the ABS released a report on the underemployed workers of Australia, which was particularly revealing of the views of part-time employees about their employment status. The ABS conducted a survey throughout September 2003 to provide empirical evidence for that report. At that time the survey showed that 2.7 million people were employed on a part-time basis. Of this 2.7 million people, 23 per cent wanted to work more hours; that is, more than 600,000 people employed on a part-time basis wanted to work more. Examining the data further showed that, of those 600,000 workers, 58 per cent wanted full-time employment and 77 per cent, during the four-week period of the survey, had actively looked for work that would provide more hours. It is pretty clear from the results of that survey that the majority of these part-time workers wanted to work more and they were ready to start working more. The ABS report goes on to indicate that 90 per cent of those who wanted full-time employment were available to start immediately. This situation has not changed. In the lead-up to my own by-election campaign, a constituent in Werriwa approached me and described his experience of entering the work force. The fellow was on a Job Network program and had found some part-time work. As he said, it was great; this was what he wanted to do. This work was probably not the best in the world, but he wanted to participate in the work force. He was very pleased to have gained the job. He sought to inquire of his conditions from his employer. He turned up there and was told that, from the next day on, he would be required to bring his own vehicle because he would be required to travel for work purposes. So he was required to drive his own vehicle not only to and from work but also in the course of his employment. After his first week at work, he had only worked for three days. He said that he was pretty shocked when he got his first weekly pay. After taking into account that he was using his own vehicle not only to travel to and from work but also to run errands during the day for his employer’s business, he found that he was worse off than he was on his former program. So being keen to continue working, he went in the next week-granted, one day was wet-to be told that he would be required only one day that week. The company that he was working for and that he named for me would be well known to everybody; it would certainly be found on the ASX. That is the way in which employment practices are starting to perpetuate-and I am sure that Werriwa is no exception with circumstances like these-and this is one example that was brought to my attention. This bloke is just an average fellow who is happy to pay his taxes. He wanted to participate in the full-time labour market and do his bit in looking after his family. He certainly saw the way in which the system is stacked against many individuals. Given the fact that at the time of the last census one in four workers in Werriwa was employed on a part-time basis, this gentleman’s case that he related to me could hardly be considered as isolated. But it gets worse than that. Not only do part-time and casual workers face greater uncertainty of income; because of their own financial instability they also find it difficult to access a number of other services that many of us would take for granted. Part-time and casual employees have greater difficultly accessing financial services. Due to the uncertainty surrounding their future incomes, part-time and casual employees often report that financial institutions are more reluctant to give them access to loans and lines of credit than they would be had they been in full-time employment. Most of us would know that to be a MAIN COMMITTEE fact. The evidence presented to the committee suggested that casual and part-time employees may also face reduced access to training and skills development opportunities, which are obviously so crucial for people making that transition into full-time permanent employment or trying to pursue a career. I am also quite sure that, if we had a closer look at those who have Centrelink debts, we would probably find that a significant number of those debtors are either part-time or casual employees, as they would find it even more difficult than the rest of us to accurately estimate their annual income. Hence, at the end of the year part-time and casual employees receive yet another setback when they are notified that they have managed to accumulate a Centrelink debt. I guess these are the rewards for being employed under the so-called flexible working arrangements. I would also like to take the opportunity to support the recommendations in the dissenting report concerning employment conditions. Once again, when making recommendations pursuing further award simplification and encouraging greater workplace customisation and flexibility, government members of the committee seemed to substitute ideology for evidence. As someone with a reasonably extensive involvement in the Australian industrial relations system, having worked in it from all perspectives, I find it difficult to believe that further simplifying awards will result in greater participation in the work force. I think such an argument does not hold much weight, particularly when one considers the claim that 77,000 more jobs will be created if small businesses are exempted from unfair dismissal laws-a claim that, when placed under some scrutiny before the Senate committee, was found to be seriously lacking. My views are reinforced by the findings of the dissenting report. The dissenting committee members found that the committee’s recommendations for reductions in allowable matters and greater workplace customisation were contrary to the evidence received. The dissenting members reported: On no occasion had evidence supported the assertion that reducing allowable matters in federal awards would have any bearing upon improving participation in the paid workforce. Work force participation will not be improved through award changes or even the erosion of hard won conditions in awards. It will not be improved by exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws or reducing the right of entry into workplaces. And it will not be improved by effectively sidelining the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which, after all, has acted as the independent umpire looking to protect the interests of both employers and employees engaged under the system. Increasing participation rates requires increasing opportunities for unemployed people to enter the work force. These opportunities will only emerge when the hurdles that people face when they are seeking a job are effectively addressed. To address those issues really does require us to focus on matters such as the effective high marginal tax rates; child-care places, so that they are more abundant to facilitate people being able to translate into the workplace; and more affordable training places, when the opportunities are there, for people to become job ready to re-enter the work force. I have spent many years working closely with both employers and employees in business improvement programs and also representing workers as a union official. Bearing in mind this experience, I cannot recall one occasion when I thought that the employment prospects of MAIN COMMITTEE Australians would be enhanced by reducing award conditions or by reducing the number of allowable matters. I am yet to be convinced that Australians who for whatever reason are not participating in the labour market at the moment believe this will encourage them to re-enter the labour market. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee recently explored the stunning statistic this government used to justify excluding small business from unfair dismissal laws-that is, that small business will create 77,000 new jobs if exempted from unfair dismissal laws. The assertion was found to be unreliable and based on opinion and perception rather than on any accurate data. In much the same way, once the claim that reducing the number of allowable matters and increasing the flexibility in workplace arrangements is subject to some harsher scrutiny, I suspect that it will be found to be lacking as well. With regard to the recommendations on disability support pensions, I support the expansion and modification of the Job Network disability support pension pilot. (Time expired) Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.52 am)-This report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation titled Working for Australia’s future: increasing participation in the workforce was tabled in the House of Representatives on 14 March 2005. AlthoughI was not a member of this committee, I understand the importance of its findings and its recommendations to future work force participation in this country, particularly the participation of older workers and other disadvantaged groups. We are all aware that no longer do any of us have a career for life. Many Australians will have two, three or more careers over their working lives. I note that the committee was told that by 2030 Australia will have over half a million jobs with no-one to fill them. I note also the committee’s determination, in the face of low unemployment levels, to assist the work force participation of those groups who have traditionally been called disadvantaged. These groups include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the long-term unemployed, young people, migrants, mature age workers and people with disabilities. This report recommends that these people should be assisted by government and that this assistance must be targeted and delivered in an appropriate way. Some members in this place may know that in my previous career I was a manager with the old Commonwealth Employment Service. I came into the CES at the time when Paul Keating’s Working Nation programs were being implemented. This was exactly the range of programs which case managed so-called disadvantaged job seekers to increase their work force participation. Under these case management programs, there was a range of programs to assist the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and sole parents. There was a whole spectrum of programs. Whatever level a job seeker was at, there was a program that they could fit into and that would take them right through to the reality of getting a job. These programs included, at one end of the spectrum, training programs to assist people with literacy and numeracy skills and programs to increase self-esteem and to address personal issues that related to working. Along the spectrum were skills training and eventually to what were known then as job clubs, where people were assessed as being work ready and MAIN COMMITTEE were assisted in applying for jobs-in getting their CVs together and in the actual physical activity of getting out there, knocking on doors looking for work. Other programs included the Jobs, Education and Training program, which assisted sole parents. That program was delivered between the CES and the then department of social security. It provided a lot of assistance for sole parents to assist themselves into the work force, including subsidies for child-care arrangements. I believe that program still exists, but it has been decimated under the Howard government. There was training for Aboriginal people, which was the specific area that I was working in. There were a whole range of programs to assist particularly young Aboriginal people into work. I had the satisfaction of seeing many young Aboriginal people commence and complete traineeships and apprenticeships and get themselves into work. There were also programs called disability support panels. These panels case managed each individual with a disability personally to assist that person into a job. The panels consisted of somebody from the CES, somebody from the department of social security and somebody from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. Those people would then also go out and assist people to sell their skills to employers and actively encourage employers to take these people on. I want to make a point in relation to work force participation of Indigenous Australians. There are seven pages in the report, from page 151 through to page 157, which deal with participation in the work force by Indigenous Australians. However, there does not seem to have been a recommendation from the findings of the committee relating to Indigenous employment. The committee did note on page 154: While significant numbers of Indigenous youth are being helped to gain employment through Job Network and the Indigenous Employment Programme ... more needs to be done to ensure they have the skills, job search techniques, confidence and motivation to benefit from strong economic growth. The report went on to say at 5.101: The Committee is encouraged by the broad range of these initiatives and the improvements in employment outcomes. However ... significant focus is required to support and foster further increase in participation in paid work. I find it a bit disturbing that, although there had been some focus on Indigenous employment participation, there were no recommendations coming out of this report. As I said, the programs that had been in place in the old CES under Paul Keating’s Working Nation were either abolished or decimated on the election of the Howard government in 1996. I want to move now to changes proposed in this year’s budget to the disability support pension. I note the recommendations relating to these changes were dissented from by the Labor members of this committee. The dissenting committee members noted: ... that while the Job Network Disability Support Pension pilot has shown some promise in assisting people on the DSP to gain employment, there are areas which require greater investigation before any long term conclusions can be made. The dissenting members also said: Less than half of the pilot participants and less than a quarter of DSP recipients who initially met the providers were successfully placed in employment or education. If this sample is representative then MAIN COMMITTEE more than half of the DSP population could be penalised by the proposed changes to the DSP eligibility requirements despite their desire to look for work. The concerns that we have in the Labor Party in relation to the changes to the disability support pension have been expressed in this place. They include concerns about the changes in the eligibility criteria-that is, eligibility for a person who has a disability will be changed so that the number of hours a person is deemed as able to work without losing eligibility will be reduced from 30 hours a week to 15 hours a week. From1 July next year we are going to see two classes of disability support pensioner. We are going to see those people who are on the disability support pension who cannot work more than 30 hours a week but may be able to work between 15 and 30 hours a week and those people with a disability who will be forced onto Newstart allowance because they have been assessed as being able to work more than 15 hours a week. These people are also going to see a drop in their incomes. Once we have a person with a disability who is deemed to be able to work more than 15 hours a week, rather than being supported by a disability support pension where all the support mechanisms are in place for that person-as well as assistance in concessions and a little bit more income-they are now going to be forced onto Newstart allowance. They are going to have lower incomes than disability support pensioners, but they are going to have the same health concerns and they are going to need the same assistance in trying to look for work as they would if they were on the disability support pension. Those people with disabilities who can work more than 15 hours a week are being told, ‘Yes, you must look for work,’ but they are also being told ‘You are not going to get the same support as a disability support pensioner to look for work and you must do it on less money.’ We must remember that people with disabilities or chronic illnesses have variances in their day-to-day lives. They can have good weeks and bad weeks and good months and bad months. This particularly applies to people with mental illnesses. If a person with a mental illness who is assessed as being able to work more than 15 hours a week, subject to the work activity test, goes off and gets themselves a job that they can do, the next week or the next month they might have a bad week and not turn up for work. That person is then going to be penalised when they go back to the Centrelink office to resume their unemployment benefits. They will be penalised for leaving a job. But they have left a job through no fault of their own; they have done that because they have a particular illness which has not been catered for under these arrangements. A lot of these people would be working if they could be working. If there were jobs out there that were for 15 or 20 hours a week, with flexibility and arrangements to adapt to their health circumstances, it would be great. But the unfortunate reality for a lot of the people with disabilities who want to work is that the jobs which should be flexible to their needs just do not exist out there. I want to move on now to the long-term unemployed and particularly the mature long-term unemployed. We saw in April the release of the Productivity Commission’s report on the economics of ageing. Following the release of that report, Sid Marris, in the initial paragraph of an article he wrote in the Australian, said: The first priority for tackling the mounting taxpayer costs of ageing should be getting unemployed mature workers into a job rather than simply raising the pension age. MAIN COMMITTEE The Productivity Commission’s report was titled Economic implications of an ageing Australia. The summary released with that report stated: People aged over 55 years have significantly lower labour force participation rates than younger people. As more people move into older age groups, overall participation rates are projected to drop from around 63.5 per cent in 2003 04 to 56.3 per cent by 2044-45. Following the release of that report, a couple of statements were made. An article headed ‘Work for over-55 jobless the key’ in the Australian of Wednesday, 13 April 2005 states: Council on the Ageing-National Seniors chief executive David Deans said that with work force participation for men aged over 55 below 50 per cent in Australia, a low figure by international standards, mature-age workers and employers had to think differently about work and training. That is also reflected in this report. The article later states: Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association NSW president Morrie Mufsud said ... increasing the pension age to 70 or 75 was inhumane and would put greater stress on the health of older people. Over the years that I have been representing my constituents of Charlton here, I have received much correspondence regarding the barriers facing long-term unemployed, mature age workers when trying to get back into the work force. I have one such letter here, written by Graeme Winter and signed by nearly 40 constituents, parts of which I would like to read into the Hansard. These quotes touch on just some of the barriers and challenges that face mature age workers. Graeme writes: Dear Madam, As a person over 45 years and looking for work, I am writing to make you aware of the challenges faced in my area. Canberra and Little Johnny and his team have got to think of the age group who left school before 1980 and did not do well at school, and in a lot of cases, as far as computers go, we did not have any. … … … These days, with our age group all you have are the newspapers and going to Centrelink and playing with the touch screens ... they don’t seem to want you. You are hard pressed to find jobs for people from thirty to forty-five, then after that it just gets even harder. That is also for all the jobs in the paper and with all of them you need certificates and other tickets and ... it can cost you one hundred to a thousand dollars. … … … Transport in this area is and always has been a problem. … … … I know a lot of people like me who have only had 1 to 5 months work at a time ... and have a very hard time because of our work history but it is because a lot of the places go broke or just get rid of us for someone younger. If something is not done soon by Little Johnny and his party about us 45 years and older age bracket there are going to be more and more of us out there in nowhere land just getting older and more depressed and not having much of a future and again that affects our health and costs more money on health benefits. Graeme’s letter concludes by saying: SoI just think we need a fair go and work that is 30 hours a week and more otherwise we will never get off the unemployment benefits. MAIN COMMITTEE (Time expired) ramatta, I would just remind honourable members that, when quoting from documents, they need to be careful that the quotes do not make unparliamentary comments, because they are unparliamentary whether they are quoted or stated individually. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12.07 pm)-This report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation is indeed a very welcome report. I would like to start by congratulating the members of the committee on both sides for what is an extremely substantial and much needed report. I particularly congratulate the members of the government, who have contributed to an analysis of the current situation in Australia which is quite often critical of their own government. There are two issues in my electorate which are regularly raised with me. The first concerns unemployment. In spite of the rhetoric about low unemployment, one of the most common issues raised with me concerns people unable to find a job. Whether it is single mothers, mothers returning to the work force, people with disabilities, older Australians, skilled migrants or members of the Indigenous community, the difficulty in finding work is still very much alive in my electorate in spite of the rhetoric about low unemployment. The second issue which is regularly raised is raised by the small business community in particular, and in my electorate that is a vibrant community indeed. The issue for them concerns future growth. It concerns the ability to find skilled people to work for them. It involves the need for greater investment in research and development and for the building of export markets. This report contributes greatly on both of those issues. I have learned a great deal from reading it, and I know I will find it extremely useful in working with people in my electorate. It is a comprehensive and serious report involving over nearly 100 submissions and over 20 days of public hearings, and again I thank the committee, particularly on the government side, for the courage to be constructively critical of the government. Many of the recommendations imply a failure by the current government to seriously tackle issues of workplace participation, particularly in the areas of skill shortages and marginal tax rates. But it is interesting to note that when committee members from both sides of the House get together and have a proper look at what is happening there is general agreement on what needs to be done. Of the 21 recommendations, the vast majority were passed unanimously. That is a very good sign of the health of our democracy when people get together and work collaboratively. We have a comprehensive report making largely unanimous recommendations which was tabled at the beginning of this year and yet, in spite of its quality, those recommendations were not incorporated in the budget. On occasion the Treasurer referred to some of the issues, but it is fair to say that he did not pick up the main recommendations of that report. This is indeed a lost opportunity. The members of the committee, and the members of the public who contributed to this inquiry, made an extraordinary effort in putting this report together and their work deserves much more consideration than it received. It is interesting to speak on this report now, after the budget, when it was actually written before the budget because it throws the budget into an interesting light. The main issues raised, particularly that of skill shortages, MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Committees
308,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Wilkie),"BeforeI call the honourable member for Parwere not addressed adequately in the budget-and nor, for that matter, was the whole issue of how we get Australians back into the work force. Instead of taking the positive approach recommended in this report in the main the government took a punitive approach-a stick approach-to forcing people back into the work force. It is clear from the recommendations in this report and the substance of the report that there are far greater barriers to people returning to the work force than a willingness to do so. There is a recognition in this report that employment is patchy, a recognition that I really appreciate having spoken to so many people in my electorate who are having difficulty getting back into the work force. It clearly recognises that, while we can talk about the overall low unemployment rate, that rate is not enjoyed by some sections of our community, particularly the Indigenous community, women, older Australians, younger Australians and skilled migrants. I would like to raise a couple of examples that have come up in my electorate recently of people who are facing extraordinary barriers to their re-entry into the work force-barriers which this report addresses but which the government has failed to address in the budget. My first example is of a 29-year-old woman who emailed me a couple of days ago. She is married and has three children between eight months and six years old. She is a stay-at-home mum. Before she decided to stay home with her children she was quite a senior person in the public sector. She resigned from her full-time job in July 2004 to be a full-time stay-at-home mum. Since then, she and her husband have reviewed their financial situation and decided that she needs to return to full-time work. They have a mortgage and a car to pay off and their wage is barely making ends meet so they feel that she needs to return to work. She does not have anybody to help with looking after her children-she does not live close to her parents, for example-so she needs to send one of the children to beforeand after-school care and two of the children to full-time long day care while she returns to work. She went to Centrelink with an estimated income of $95,000 to calculate the family’s childcare benefit and family tax benefit. After she considered those and took into account childcare costs, which would be $95 a week for one child and $185 a week for each of the otherstotalling $515 per week-she realised that child care would cost $27,000 per year. That would be more than 70 per cent of her pay and larger than their mortgage payment. She then went on to calculate their net weekly income less their expenses and realised that if she returned to work she would be $50 a week better off than if she did not. After taking into consideration the effect that returning to work would ultimately have on her relationship with her children and the pressures it would have on her marriage, she just cannot justify returning to work for $50 a week. The budget announced that there would be 80,000 extra child-care places but, as she says, that is no use if the price is not regulated. In her area long day care is charged at $57 a day for under twos and $47 a day for children aged two to six. With three children, that is not something she can afford. This woman asks in her email what incentive she has to go back to work, even though she wants to. She has discussed this issue with other mothers in her area and has found it to be a common story, as have I in visiting child-care centres around my area. The single biggest topic of conversation among mothers, both those working part time and those staying at home, is the difficulty they have in finding a way back into the work force. The second example I have is of a young woman I know who has a mental illness. She is bipolar. She is an extraordinary young woman and was highly skilled before the onset of her MAIN COMMITTEE illness. She has been on the disability support pension for quite some time. Through the intervention of a small group of people, she has managed over the last four or five years to find her way back into the work force on a part-time basis, and she is now managing to control her illness. She has not had a serious bout of depression and has not needed shock therapy for nearly 2½ years. She is now looking at a situation where she is able to work more hours and can get the work. But, of course, if she does that she will have to go off the disability support pension. This should be a time of great rejoicing for this woman. She has been on that pension for many years now and, through considerable work by her and a surrounding group of supporters, she has found a way back into the work force and has taken back control of her life. She should be celebrating. Quite to the contrary, she has a recommendation from her psychiatrist that she not take up this option at this time, for the simple reason that if she does go back to work and then lapses back into her illness-which undoubtedly she will; this is a lifelong illness that she has-and has to return to the disability support pension at some point, she will go onto the new pension, not the old one. She also may not be able to get back onto it because of her capacity at this stage, when her illness is essentially under control, to work considerably more than 15 hours a week. Because fear of the future is one of the triggers for this woman’s illness, her psychiatrist’s advice is that she will be better off in the long term working only a few hours a week, rather than doing the considerable hours that she can. When you understand that this woman is one of the leaders in the field-that when she does work she is an unbelievably productive person who makes a great contribution to those around her-it is really quite a tragedy. This is a case of a person who is ready to return to work and really should be returning to work, but the very measures which the government introduced to try to force her to do so are those which will prevent her from returning to the work force. The third example is mothers returning to the work force. I have just given part-time work to two mothers who are returning to the work force after a long time, and I would encourage every employer out there to consider finding a way to get some of these fabulous mothers back into the work force. For a start, they are quite often more mature women who have had experience in the work force at a very high level and who are looking for secure, ongoing work at a level which allows them to go home at the end of the day and concentrate on their family. They are those rare workers who bring skills to a job they can quite often handle easily. They do that job with their full attention and go home at the end of the day to concentrate on something else. They are incredibly valuable people. WhatI have found in talking with these people and the many who come to my office looking for a solution to their dilemma is that they have difficulty in finding work which allows them to balance their responsibilities to their families. There is difficulty in finding work, for example, which while secure and ongoing provides time off during school holidays. It is difficult to find work close enough to their own home to be able to get to and from work, and to include travel time, between the hours of nine and three. This report makes quite a few recommendations concerning child care. Child care is absolutely essential to these women. It also covers in some depth the area of family balance, which is one of the biggest barriers for women returning to the work force. Again, the budget which was recently delivered does not address this issue in any real way at all. We still have in our MAIN COMMITTEE community thousands of women with great skill and great willingness to return to work who simply cannot find appropriate working conditions in which to do so. The casualisation of the work force is an increasing barrier to these women. I met two parents recently when I was doorknocking in the south of my electorate. The first time. I went to their house I did not actually meet them; I encountered their six-year-old child at home on her own. She-and this is quite scary to me-opened the door to me, and I suspect she would have opened the door to anyone who knocked. There was a six-year-old child at home on her own. SoI phoned these parents after hours, just to see how they were and if they needed some help, and I found two people who got up every morning not knowing whether they were going to work that day-two parents on casual work in a low-skilled area who phoned the office each morning to find out whether they were going to work. They were on extremely low pay and under very poor conditions with three children, actually, under the age of 10, all three of whom were at various times at home on their own. These parents did not have a support network that could help them. These parents did not have the opportunity to find regular child care; in fact, child care does not work on that kind of basis. They really were doing the best they could. They were doing their best to pay their rent; they were doing their best for their children. Unfortunately, the best is still an appalling situation for these parents. Not only could they not guarantee that their children could be picked up at school; as a married couple, they could not even commit to each other that they would be there on Saturday to pick up the kids from soccer or that they would take care of the kids tomorrow. These were two people who were completely unable to make the commitments to each other that parents need to make in order to stay together, let alone raise three children. The recommendation in this report that even suggests increasing the casualisation of the work force is an appalling recommendation for people who live this kind of lifestyle now. Anybody, any parent-any person, really-seeking to save for their retirement, to educate their children or seeking to build a life needs some form of planning in their life. You simply cannot commit to a family and children and a future if you cannot look ahead and know that you can earn this amount of money, that your pay will come in on a regular basis, that your job is reasonably secure-even if irregular-and that you can commit to the people around you to do the things you need to do to hold your relationships together. The casualisation of the work force is not just about work force and it is not just about business. It is actually about family. It is an extremely negative trend that has made it incredibly difficult for people who are already struggling with low wages and poor conditions and, in many cases, a low education level, to build lives for themselves and their families. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. His Holiness Pope John Paul II Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document. the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II. I had only just started the speech when this deMAIN COMMITTEE",205,Committees
309,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (12.23 Pm),"I rise to continue my comments of condolence onbate was adjourned. I had been talking about the Pope’s life during World War II, which was extraordinarily hard in his native Poland. During that time he had become a priest and he had earned his first doctorate. He continued his studies and in 1953 he defended his thesis and was appointed a professor of philosophy at the University of Cracow. The following year he joined the faculty of the Catholic University in Lublin. He moved through the ranks of the Catholic Church swiftly. In 1958 he was named the Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow and in 1964, when the communist government lifted a ban on such appointments, he was promoted to archbishop. He was promoted to cardinal in 1967 by Pope Paul VI. As a cardinal, he was required to attend in Rome at the untimely death of Pope John PaulI who, as we all know, died after just 34 brief days in office. On 16 October, after three days of deliberations in the Vatican Sistine Chapel and after eight ballots, Wojtyla was elected to the throne of St Peter. At 58 he was the youngest pope in 132 years. ‘It is God’s will,’ he declared when the vote was announced, ‘I accept.’ With those simple words, he began one of the most extraordinary reigns of any pope, creating a legacy that touches all parts of the globe. Pope John Paul II led the world’s Catholics for 26 years, which is the third longest reign of any pope. His capacity to travel was one of the hallmarks of his period in office. He transformed what was traditionally a Eurocentric church into one with a global outlook. His destinations included the United Nations, remote islands in the farthest reaches of the Pacific, the plains of Africa, the slums of Latin America and the Mall in Washington. His visits included non-Catholic areas such as India and South-East Asia. His extensive travels made him one of the most recognised figures in the world. I well remember going to the local racetrack in Perth when the Pope visited and I can remember him walking by and greeting the assembled children, to our great excitement at the time. He drew enormous crowds on his two Australian visits, and these crowds were repeated wherever he went in the world. No corner of the world escaped the Pope’s attention, and his popemobile was a very familiar sight on the evening news. On his travels he reached out to men and women of other faiths. Indeed, he did more than any other pope to open dialogues with other religions. He was the first pope to enter a mosque and the first pope to visit a synagogue. He championed relations with the Jewish community, and one of his first official acts was to send a message to the Jewish community in Rome. Under his guidance, the Vatican opened full diplomatic relations with Israel. The process of reconciliation reached a dramatic climax during the Pope’s visit to the Holy Land in March 2000. At Yad Vashem, Israel’s monument to the Holocaust victims, he declared: ... I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church, motivated by the Gospel law of truth, and love, and by no political considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place. In Jerusalem, Pope John Paul II prayed at the Western Wall, the most sacred site in Judaism, and he also visited the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. I note that the Chief Rabbi of Rome, who once prayed with the Pope, has said that he believes that Pope John Paul II ushered in a new era of Jewish-Christian relations. I also note that following the Pope’s death he was eulogised by both the Israelis and the Palestinians and that the President of Israel and the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority both attended MAIN COMMITTEE his funeral. I know that sadness over the death of Pope John Paul II was shared by both Jewish and Islamic communities in my electorate of Stirling. Perhaps the real defining moment of his reign as Pope was in the role that he played in liberating the people of Eastern Europe from the forces of totalitarianism. He worked tirelessly with the people in his native Poland, in Hungary, in what was then Czechoslovakia and in other nations that were locked into the rigid sphere of Soviet domination. He visited Poland not long after he was elected Pope, in June 1979, and that was his second overseas visit. He received a rapturous welcome from Poles across the whole country. He used his visit to highlight the plight of the Poles, and he developed close ties with the Solidarity movement and a man who would be Poland’s first post-communist president, Lech Walesa. He is reported to have told a Polish cardinal after his election as Bishop of Rome, ‘I have become the Bishop of Rome but I have not ceased being a Polish bishop.’ The Pope visited his homeland eight times during his reign. These visits increased the confidence of the Polish people and ultimately contributed to their throwing off the yoke of communism. This in turn contributed to the extraordinary demise of this evil doctrine in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union. With hindsight, I often fear that we forget how souldestroying communism was to the people who were literally trapped behind the Iron Curtain. Pope John Paul II, by his presence and quiet dignity, challenged those regimes to respect the dignity of the people that they ruled over. By visiting these nations he was able to highlight the deficiencies within the governance of these countries and to shine a bit of light into corners of the world where information and hope were not readily available. I am reminded of the quote attributed to Stalin, ‘How many divisions does the Pope have?’ Of course, the Pope had no armies but he did have the power of his own ideas and I think that history has proven him to be the victor in that particular conflict. Pope John Paul II was a man of very firm beliefs. He did not gauge the prevailing view before making up his mind but decided what was right and then stuck to it. This is in marked contrast to some of the more fashionable clerics who seem to be more malleable in their views. In fact, I am often struck by how some members of the clergy now seem prepared to jump on whatever politically correct bandwagon happens to be passing. Even in death, many have criticised Pope John Paul II for the rigidity of his views-and I had better add that I do not share them all-but I respect the fact that he remained true to what he believed was right. I heard a person who was randomly interviewed at the time of the Pope’s death make a comment that went something like this: ‘I’m not what you would call a true believer, but I believed in him.’ This person, in one simple statement, was able to express exactly what it was that made Pope John Paul II so special. He was a man who was able to gain the love and respect of not only people of Catholic faith but people of all religions across all nations. His presence and counsel will be missed by many. His recent funeral will be recorded as one of the most memorable events of this century for two reasons: firstly, the unprecedented outpouring of public grief and, secondly, the sheer number of world leaders that attended. I cannot think of any other event that would have brought such a diverse group together. It will be recorded as one of the defining moments of its time. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to conclude my remarks by congratulating Pope John Paul II’s successor, Pope Benedict XVI. I am sure that the whole parliament will join me in wishing him well in carrying out his extensive duties on behalf of Catholics the world over. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.32 pm)-Born on 18 May 1920 and dying on 2 April 2005, Pope John Paul II was Pope of the Catholic Church for almost 27 years, the third longest reign in the history of the church. He oversaw a momentous period in world history, providing a moral force for his followers in the latter half of the 20th century as he travelled the globe, determined to reach as many people as possible, in the process becoming known as the ‘pilgrim Pope’. Pope John Paul II lent a spiritual force to his fellow Poles in the rise of the Solidarity movement, which went on to destroy a regime in the thrall of the communist ideology he so vehemently opposed. He also rallied against what he saw as the dangerously secular hedonism of the West, a spiritual malaise he saw as caused by an excessive adherence to materialism and consumerism. Unwavering in extolling his belief in the sanctity of human life-for example, in his vocal opposition to abortion, war and capital punishment-he nevertheless expressed traditional Catholic values in his attitudes towards marriage, sexuality and the role of women in the church. Pope John Paul II was unstinting in his advocacy of social justice and in the rights of the individual. Yet some of his views could be seen as challenging-some even divisive. As a student in southern Poland, Karol Wojtyla intended to become a professional actor. With the occupying Nazi regime closing the university he attended, and under threat of deportation, he was forced to support himself by working as a stonecutter. In 1942 he entered the underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Cracow and was ordained a priest in November 1946. In 1958 the future Pope was named Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow and four years later he assumed leadership of the diocese, all the while publicly rallying against communism and oppressive state officials and also secretly providing support-financial and otherwise-for opposition groups and, it is reported, often clandestinely meeting their leaders, who were on the run from the government. He was at the time the youngest bishop in Poland. In 1962 he contributed to the Second Vatican Council and within five years was elevated to cardinal. He refused to attend the First General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops due to a fellow Polish cardinal being denied a passport by the communist government. He participated in the papal conclave that elected Pope Paul VI and then, after the sudden death of Pope Paul VI’s successor, John Paul I, he found himself, a compromise candidate, at only 58 years of age, the 264th Pope of the Catholic Church. The new pope proved in the eyes of many, including the leader of the Solidarity movement, Lech Walesa, to be instrumental in the fall of communism in eastern Europe. His visits to Poland in 1979 and later in 1983 provided inspiration to the Catholic Church and to the growing non-violent Solidarity labour movement. In the words of future Polish communist leader Jaruzelski, his first visit was the ‘detonator’ for a train of events that eventually resulted in the collapse of the communist states in the East and the fall of the Iron Curtain. No less a person than Mikhail Gorbachev asserted that the disintegration of the Eastern bloc would have been impossible without Pope John Paul II. During his reign, Pope John Paul II became the most travelled pope in history, making more visits to foreign lands than all the previous popes combined. Many of these trips were to MAIN COMMITTEE the developing world and to countries never visited by a pope before, drawing some of the largest crowds in history. For instance, his visit to his Polish homeland in 1979 drew over two million people, while his mass in Dublin’s Phoenix Park in the same year drew one million people, a staggering one-quarter of the population of Ireland. He oversaw the global expansion of Catholicism, especially in Africa. His second visit to Nigeria saw the Pope canonize a Nigerian monk, greatly enhancing the Pope’s popularity in the region. Pope John Paul II was committed to spreading the influence of the church across the globe to Catholics and nonCatholics alike. I vividly remember his visit to Perth and our great family outing. We sat on a rug at the show grounds for many hours to attend mass there. Pope John Paul II, speaker of six languages, was determined to overcome religious divides, stressing the peace inherent in all religions. During his ceaseless travels he made several historical overtures to divergent faiths. He met with the Dalai Lama no fewer than eight times, finding common ground with a spiritual leader who had also suffered under communism. He was the first Catholic Pope to visit and pray in an Islamic mosque, and he subsequently visited the mosque where John the Baptist is understood to be buried. He was also the first pope to visit the United Kingdom, meeting the head of the Church of England, Queen Elizabeth II. In a powerful gesture at the time of the Falklands War, a battle he strongly spoke out against, he knelt to pray with the then Archbishop of Canterbury. However, despite significant stumbling blocks, it could be said that his greatest success was in bridging the divide between the Catholic and Jewish faiths, with a Jewish-American organisation declaring: ... more change for the better took place in his 27 year Papacy than in the nearly 2000 years before. Such approval stemmed from several actions undertaken by Pope John Paul II. He made a formal apology for the missteps committed by the Catholic Church over the last 2,000 years, expressly apologising for the acts of anti-Semitism committed by the church. He visited the Auschwitz concentration camp in his Polish homeland-the first pope to do so-and, in his historic visit to Israel in 2000, he left a written apology to the Jewish people in the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Furthermore, he issued an apology for the conspicuous silence that fell over the Catholic Church during the time of the Holocaust, and he became the first pope in modern times to visit a synagogue. Pope John Paul’s ecumenical efforts were instrumental in the emergence of a new, outward-looking Catholic Church. The Pope’s belief in the sanctity of human life expressed itself in his stance against contraception, euthanasia and abortion. Yet his belief in the rights and inherent dignity of the individual also manifested itself in his fervent opposition to war. To the Pope, all war was unjust and, in his words, a defeat for humanity. He asserted that all avenues must be exhausted before contemplating aggressive means, a position that logically led to his opposition to the war in Iraq. The Pope sent a cardinal from the Vatican to meet with the President of the United States to relay his opposition to the actions of the coalition of the willing, seeing any unilateral aggression as a breach of international law and seeing diplomacy through the United Nations as paramount. By speaking out almost daily on the injustice of the war, the Pope provided moral support to the millions of antiwar protesters throughout the world. This search for a political solution was emblematic of the Pope’s reign, with the Vatican sending diplomats to the Middle East, East Timor, the Balkans, Africa and Asia in the search for peace during intense periods of conflict. MAIN COMMITTEE The Pope’s influence was strongly felt in his shaping of the Catholic Church as a defender of human rights and of the poor and disenfranchised. He was a vocal supporter of Jubilee 2000, the campaign to provide debt relief to the beleaguered nations of Africa. He issued apologies for the suppression of ethnic and indigenous groups by past Catholic missionaries and was a strong supporter of the rights and aspirations of indigenous peoples, creating in 1992 a foundation for the indigenous peoples of Latin America to promote the development of rural communities among the campesinos of Latin America and the Caribbean and the African-American peoples. In a speech given here in Australia in Alice Springs in 1986, the Pope spoke compassionately and eloquently in support of the stolen generation and Aboriginal land rights. He said: Let it not be said that the fair and equitable recognition of Aboriginal rights to land is discrimination. To call for the acknowledgment of the land rights of people who have never surrendered those rights is not discrimination ... Christian people of good will are saddened to realise-many of them only recentlyfor how long a time Aboriginal people were transported from their homelands into small areas or reserves where families were broken up, tribes split apart, children orphaned and people forced to live like exiles in a foreign country. The establishment of a new society for Aboriginal people cannot go forward without just and mutually recognised agreements with regard to these human problems even though their causes lie in the past. If only such emphatic words were more prevalent today. The Pope decried the structural excesses of neo-liberalism and economic rationalisation, highlighting the devastating effect such policies have upon the poor and marginalised. As he stated, the wealth produced often remains in the hands of only a few. The Pope was a champion of workers’ rights. I have already touched upon his unwavering support of the Solidarity trade union in his homeland. In his encyclia the Pope affirmed the right of workers to join trade unions. In his 1981 statement, ‘On Human Work’, the Pope called for: ... ever new movements of solidarity of the workers and with the workers. This solidarity must be present whenever it is called for by the social degrading of the subject of work, by exploitation of the workers and by the growing areas of poverty and even hunger. The Pope continued by asserting the right of trade unions to exist and the right of workers: ... to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions. These associations are called labor or trade unions... The experience of history teaches that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social life. In another encyclical, Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the need for trade unions to: ... defend workers’ rights and protect their interests as persons while fulfilling a vital cultural role so as to enable workers to participate more fully and honorably in the life of their nation and to assist them along the path of development. Elsewhere he stressed the importance of a just wage, health care and workers compensation and the right to a retirement pension-all mainstays of the labour movement. The Pope’s compassion and sense of justice meant he instinctively sided with the workers. As progressives rightly point out, Pope John Paul II’s reign was not without fault. His views on contraception and the role of women in the church have been highly controversial, and he has rightly been admonished for his slow response to sexual abuse scandals within the church. Yet Pope John Paul II has had an extraordinary impact upon the Catholic Church and MAIN COMMITTEE hence upon the world, transforming the church under his charismatic leadership into an activist church based upon social justice, human rights and dignity and respect for the individual. A man of great integrity, compassion and conviction, his success was due to his ability as a world statesman to reach across to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. His words and actions during his 27-year reign will continue to reverberate. I wish to congratulate his successor, Benedict XVI, who, as confidante and right-hand man to the previous Pope, is no doubt aware of the great demands and requirements of the pontificate. I wish him well as he guides the Catholic Church into a new era. of other members of this parliament, to members of the Catholic Church, particularly the Catholic constituents of my electorate of Hinkler and the Catholics of the diocese of Rockhampton-notwithstanding the fact that I am a Catholic myself. I think John Paul II’s passing will be one of the seminal events of this new century that we live in because of the profound effect he had on so many lives. I wish to express my thanks for the life and work of John Paul II, Karol Wojtyla, who passed away on 2 April this year. He was truly a remarkable man. His 26-year papacy was marked by his drive to create a more inclusive church-one that extended the hand of friendship to all faiths-and by his truly global appeal as a man of the masses. He made his first communion at the age of nine and was confirmed at 18. When the Nazi occupation of his native Poland occurred, he had to work in a quarry from 1940 to 1944. No doubt it was in this environment that he developed his love for the workers of the world and for the unionists whom he served so well. He then worked in the Solvay chemical factory, to earn a living and to avoid deportation to Germany. In 1942 he became aware of his calling to the priesthood and started courses in a clandestine seminary in Cracow. After the Second World War he continued his studies at the major seminary in Cracow, being ordained there on 1 November 1946. His work took him to Rome and during his vacations he exercised his pastoral ministry amongst young Polish immigrants in France, Belgium and Holland. In 1948 he returned to Poland and until 1951 he was vicar of various parishes in Cracow and chaplain for the university students. Then he again took up studies in philosophy and theology. This led, 10 years later, to his being appointed the auxiliary bishop of Cracow by Pope Pius XII. He was consecrated on 28 September 1958. On 13 January 1964 he was nominated Archbishop of Cracow by Pope Paul VI, who made him a cardinal on 26 June 1967. His was a truly remarkable rise. In 1978 he became the 263rd successor to St Peter and the first non-Italian pope since Hadrian VI in 1522. John Paul II has a special place in history. He made the world’s business his business, especially in regard to human rights. Perhaps he will be best remembered for helping to deliver 400 million people from communist slavery. His profound effect on Eastern Europe was summarised by graffiti scrawled on one of the banners of the Polish communist state. The banner read, ‘The party is for the people.’ A courageous Pole had added to this banner, ‘But the people are for the pope.’ With his support of the free union movement Solidarity he not only created a new way of life for the working people of Poland and eventually all the people of Poland but also, through his influence-probably more than that of any other person in the 20th century-contributed to the breaking down of communism in other countries. It was not long after communism fell in Poland that other communist states fell like dominoes across MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Condolences
310,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.43 Pm),"I rise to express my condolences, along with thoseEastern Europe, with East Germany and eventually Russia itself abandoning communism as a way of life. As a young Pole, John Paul II saw the Holocaust up close, and he grasped its radical significance for the church. He went on to make it his goal to heal the rift with Judaism, and this became a key element of his 26-year papacy. He apologised, as one of the previous speakers said, for the sins the church had committed against the Jewish people. His outreach involved ridding Christian education material of any anti-Semitic themes, visiting synagogues, pointing to the Holocaust as a permanent point of moral reckoning and reaffirming the rights of Jews to be at home in Israel-which the Vatican formally recognised as a state in 1994. No other pope travelled so widely and encountered so many individuals as John Paul II. He was estimated to have effectively circled the globe 27 times to deliver his message during his pontificate, including two visits to Australia. I can remember being in the grandstands of the QEII stadium in Brisbane, not long after the Olympic Games, and the tremendous atmosphere there. There was an Anglican or Lutheran pastor in front of me-I could not quite tell. I could see that he and his wife were tremendously moved by the fact that the Pope had come to Brisbane. During his 1986 visit, the Pope visited every state and territory and attended 38 functions in just 6½ days. One of the major events during that visit was a mass at Flemington Racecourse. John Paul II spoke directly to the young people of Australia, saying: Young people of Australia, I ask you: does your God have a part in your hopes and ambitions for the Australia of tomorrow? Do you dream of an Australia in which the poor and the downtrodden, the disadvantaged and the lonely, the spiritually blind and those struggling to make sense of their lives, will be sustained by the hands of a loving God? Do you realise that God has no other hands but yours to stretch out to those in need? What strong and lovely words to a young nation and to the young people of a young nation. I remember his second visit to Australia, in 1995, when he came here to beatify Mother Mary MacKillop. I remember a parliamentary debate not unlike this one. One of the members opposite would probably remember it, as would you, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan. I think it was the longest debate on a private member’s business motion that we had ever had. Just about everyone in the parliament wanted to speak on it. It was about the beatification of Mary MacKillop. That was largely inspired and brought to its climax by the Pope’s visit to Australia. While most of his predecessors rarely ventured beyond the walls of the Holy See, John Paul II took the Catholic Church on the road, ministering to millions of the faithful, who were quite ecstatic in his presence. Interestingly, I met him quite by chance at the Vatican. I was there at the end of a parliamentary delegation trip and was on a private visit on the way home. Australia’s Deputy Ambassador to the Holy See was going to the Vatican that day and invited me to join him. The visit was very fulsome. The deputy ambassador took me through various parts of the Vatican. He showed me where the next consistory was going to be held-that new motel type facility-and took me up to meet some of the staff of the secretariat of state. There were no official tickets. I just happened to be behind the official enclosure. When the Pope had finished blessing the sick and saying the prayers he delivered that day, he went along the steps of St Peter and was photographed with the various official groups that were there. I think there was a band from Austria, and the University of Rome were there. MAIN COMMITTEE When he had finished, he was right at the edge of the steps of St Peter and he walked back down to a group of seminarians and across the enclosure where I was standing. I saw him look at his watch when I was about as far away as I am now from the opposition members. I said to my wife, ‘I think we’ve missed out.’ All of a sudden, he seemed to get another spurt of life and came down along the next row. That is how I met him. He certainly had an ecstatic presence; there is no doubt about that. In his travels around the world, he went to the church in Africa, Latin America and Asia, where the church was struggling in a different way from the West, where the church was struggling to maintain its flock and to maintain its focus on Christian values. He seemed to be able to stimulate each group in a different way. Around 18 million pilgrims participated in his general audiences, and this figure does not take into account the other, special audiences and religious ceremonies which he held. John Paul II met numerous government personalities during his 38 official visits, 738 audiences and meetings with heads of state, and 246 audiences and meetings with prime ministers-an extraordinary record. His desire for closeness with people almost led to his death, as is well recorded. In 1981 he was shot and seriously wounded by a Turkish fanatic in St Peter’s Square, but, more to the point, he forgave this man and frequently visited him in prison. The longevity of the Pope allowed him to appoint all but three of the 117 cardinals who were to choose his successor. The clarity that he left the church was, I think, an important feature in the quick decision of the cardinals to appoint Joseph Ratzinger as Benedict XVI. I, along with other members, extend my congratulations to Pope Benedict XVI. Probably the greatest legacy of Pope John Paul II-from my perspective, not from an international perspective-was the fact that he was a champion for the light, for decency and for high moral values, particularly in the great moral dilemmas of our time. He certainly copped a lot of criticism for his view on contraception, yet it was not based so much on an ideological, Catholic Church position as a consistency of view regarding the preservation of life. It did not extend just to contraception; it was equally forceful in the case of abortion, euthanasia and, more recently, stem cell research. The Pope spoke with a clarity that sometimes not all Catholics liked to agree with, but I think that, grudgingly, they knew he was right. I think that is one of the reasons why he had such a profound effect: he never varied from the truth. The religions of the world get into trouble when they start to play with the truth, when they alter things at the margins. We have seen that happen with a number of Christian churches in recent times. Pope John Paul II was the greatest pontiff of modern times. He was a warrior for freedom and human dignity and was a contemporary Catholic philosopher without peer. He was a pilgrim, a thinker and a man of peace. We were all diminished by his passing on 2 April but are the richer for his spirituality and his vision. Debate (on motion by Mr Quick) adjourned.
