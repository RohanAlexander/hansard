64,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime Ministeras that part involves expenditure it is conditioned by the amount of money governments can provide for such a purpose. This question is closely bound up with the state of budgets in view of the fact that deficits are being financed by short-dated loans. obvious limitations to the short-term finance that can beneficially be provided, and the general financial situation gives littl e prospect of the raising of long-term loans. It is recognized that reliable budget forecasts for the financial year 1932-33 cannot be made until June at the earliest. A t the same time, m3' Government feels that action towards the alleviation of employment is too urgent for so long a delay. It , therefore, suggests that a conference of Premiers and Treasurers be held in Melbourne on Tuesday, 12th A p r i l , to consider steps which may be taken to assist in the solution of the unemployment problem. Asi t is imperative that some information should be available to such a conference with regard to the budgetary position for 1932-33, my Government further suggests that tentative estimates should be prepared upon the basis of the expenditure for the present year, and the existing sources of revenue and the incidence of taxation. I would point out that such estimates are only for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the trend of public finance and arc not contemplated as a basis for the consideration of the requirements of governments for the year 1932-33. My Government has in contemplation that a further meeting of Premiers should be held at the beginning of June, when in the light of the more authoritative information that w ill then be available the budget estimates for the year 1932-33 could be considered. In preparing the tentative estimates it is not proposed, owing to the shortness of the time available, and the expense involved, to call a meeting of Under Treasurers. It w ill , however, of course be imCentral Wool Committee, the final report perative that such a .meeting should take place before the holding of the June conference. In order to assist the Premiers Conference in A p r i l , my Government suggests that a special committee be appointed immediately to make a preliminary survey of the economic problem as a basis ""for discussion at the conference. This committee, in addition to making suggestions and recommendations in relation to the ultimate objective of the complete reabsorption into employment of our people, would also deal with the question of how best governments can assist immediately in alleviating tbe present situation. W it h regard to the latter point they should be asked to advise generally whether a useful initia l impetus towards a general revival would be given by any form of government action, either directly or in co-operation with private enterprise. In this connection they would consider such questionsas what are the latent financial resources, which might be utilized for the immediate provision of avenues of employment; whether it is preferable to use them by the means of short or long term borrowing; in what proportion such borrowing should be allocated to the meeting' of budgetary deficits and to the creation of avenues of employment. It is thought tliat the most effective work would be done by a small committee; that the most suitable personnel would be two business men and the four economists who were signatories to the report which was presented to There are the Premiers Conference last year. In view of the limited time available, it is not practicable to delay the appointment of the committee pending consultation with a l l governments as to its personnel. My Government, therefore, proposes that the committee be immediately constituted, and that the personnel be Messrs. C. H . Reading, of Sydney; G. S. Coleman, of Melbourne, and Professors Copland, Giblin, Melville, and Shann. Owing to Professor Copland's absence from Australia at the moment, he w ill be unable to act immediately, but it is hoped that his assistance w ill be available in the later stages of the committee's deliberations. I trust that you wil l be prepared to concur in these proposals, and I should greatly appreciate a reply by telegram at your earliest convenience. I shall also be glad if you w ill be good enough to arrange for information to be supplied to the committee relevant to the subjects that are to be considered. The headings under whicli information is required will be sent immediately and it is hoped that as much of this as is possible will be supplied at the earliest practicable date. and Treasurer) [3.42] -by leaveA few days ago, I received' from Sir John Higgins and the other memhers of the of that body, and I think it appropriate that I , as Prime Minister, should publicly acknowledge on behalf of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth, the debt of gratitude that we owe to the chairman and members of the Central Wool Committee, the chairman and members of each of the State Wool Committees, and to all of those technical advisers, honorary insurance advisers, and officials who have contributed, each in his respective sphere, towards the successful completion of what can only be described as a gigantic task.

It must not be forgotten that the whole of the work of the Central Wool Committee, as well as that of the State Wool Committees, from the time of their initiation in November, 1916, has been performed by the members in an honorary capacity. while our gratitude to Sir John Higgins is great indeed, we should acknowledge also our obligation to those patriotic Australians who, without financial recomTotal amount distributed by pense, devoted so much time and energy to the important work assigned to them.

I am confident that the committee, as a result of its inquiries, will submit a useful and valuable report which, when presented to this House, will give honourable members au opportunity to review all matters affecting the administration of Avar service homes. I am particularly pleased that the Government is not going outside the Commonwealth Public Service in appointing the personnel of this committee. We are extremely fortunate indeed that Major Treloar, who at present is direc-' tor of the Australian War Memorial, has been appointed. servant who has had a distinguished career.

I welcome this innovation, because the appointment of the committee within the Public Service obviates the necessity for setting up some outside body at unnecessary expense. war service homes are, in respect of fallturned men who are in a position which ing land values, in a predicament similar to that of purchasers of homes under various State housing schemes, and they are, therefore, looking to the Government for sympathetic treatment when the report of the sub-committee is made available. Mr Riley. The purchasers of war economic conditions have forced many of the occupants of war service homes to vacate them. The Commonwealth has provided out of its funds approximately 37,000 homes. That undoubtedly is a fine achievement. It shows that the Commonwealth has assisted returned Recently, however, the soldiers to secure their own homes. Unfortunately, of that 37,000 homes, some 600 have been vacated, and have reverted to the commission. The statement of the 884. later than that contained in the last report of the commission. It shows the vital necessity for reviewing at the earliest opportunity the administration of war service homes. Of these 600 houses that had reverted to the commission about 300 were occupied by other tenants. That, of course, had minimized to some extent the loss incurred by the vacation of war Service homes. The bill contains a number of amendments to the act. One amendment is designed to allow the commissioner to let unoccupied houses. That practice has been carried on in the past although there has been some doubt as to He is a young public its legality. The measure enables the commissioner to serve notices where the purchaser or borrower is deceased. In addition, it gives definitely to the commissioner certain other powers about which some doubt has previously existed. Since July, 1930, the Commonwealth Government has. not, so far as I can gather, made available any loans under the War submit to the GoService Homes Act. Although there is justification for that action, it is regrettable that the Commonwealth has seen fit to discontinue such a laudable scheme, and is thus contributing to the depression in the building trade. I understand that the Scullin Government, in coming to its decision, was influenced by the increasing number of vacant homes, but despite that, I submit that for war service The purchasers of homes loans should he available to re-, would justify the commissioner in making an advance. The building operations of the war service homes branch should be resumed at the earliest moment. Generally speaking, the returned men and war widows who have purchased homes under The existing unfortunate the act have played the game by meeting",24,Francis

To-day three per cent, of the instalments are in arrears. The manner in which the purchasers of war service homes have in the past met their obligations is satisfactory an' commendable, 1 and that fact should I an incentive to this House, and to the Government particularly, to give them sympathetic consideration in this time of stress. ordinate. the percentage will increase. I am anxious that every consideration should be given to the occupants of war service homes, and I am sure that this bill will not operate to make their condition more irksome. While we all desire that sympathetic treatment should be accorded war service homes occupants, it is also necessary that the interests of the Commonwealth should be protected. It is for that purpose that this amending bill has been brought down. I am sure that the committee which has been set up will do what is fair both to the occupants of the homes and to the Commonwealth. I suggest that the Government, as a means of relieving unemployment, might consider extending the building operations of the War Service Homes Department. Unemployment is perhaps more serious in the building trade than in any other at the present time, and if tbe activities of the War Service Homes Department could be renewed, it would provide employment for many bricklayers, carpenters, ancl other tradesmen. In 192S-29, £1,606,469 was voted for war service homes construction and purchase. In the following year the amount was reduced by nearly £500,000, and stood at £1,154!,161, while for the year 1930 31 the : sum expended was only £157,613. I know of many ex-service men who wish to acquire homes, but owing to the policy embarked upon eighteen months ago. their claims are not receiving consideration. I hope that the Government, when considering the Estimates for next year, will recommend for war service homes construction an amount at least equal to that expended in 1929-30. I am sure that the independent committee which has been appointed to inquire into war service homes will furnish the Government with a valuable report. This bill is not intended to be comprehensive, and the matter will no doubt be brought before the House again when the committee's report is presented. Speaking as a returned soldier, I should like to express my appreciation of the speech of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. He described the bill as being sympathetic as far as possible to the occupants of war service homes; I hope it will be. The Minister, when introducing the bill, described it a3 largely a machinery measure. The present is no time to do anything which will bear at all harshly on the occupants of war service homes. This bill deals with, among other matters, the taking possession of homes, and the effecting of repairs. I happen to know something of the construction of many war service homes, and while the commission should be given credit for exercising close supervision, there is no doubt that, during the early stages of war service homes construction, many homes were badly built. One series of homes of which I know were found, a few days after completion, to have been so badly built that it was necessary to ask for an inquiry. tract? some of the houses, and found that the bricks were of such poor quality that they could be rubbed away with the finger. I ascertained that for myself. In some cases, the window sashe3 were as much as 1£ inches out of plumb. It must be evident that the cost of maintenance and repairs for houses built in such a fashion must be unreasonably high. In another instance which came under my observation, the verandah was constructed by the contractor in such a way that rain water instead of running off it, ran hack towards the door. This piece of work had been visited by the inspector, and had, apparently, been passed by him. The honourable member for Cook( Mr Riley) said that payments on war service homes were only 3 per cent, in arrears.",25,Francis

It is possible that the percentage will increase, because returned soldiers, like every one else, are under great disabilities it did. If these homes are to be protected, at the present time. Many of these men, when they entered into obligations regarda reasonable price, it is bad policy on the ing homes, were earning four or five pounds a week. They are now earning, perhaps, two pounds a week, or are out of employment altogether. Many expected that when their families grew up they would be able to contribute something towards the cost of the home, whereas they now find that the members of their families are unable to get employment, an'd have to be maintained. Clause 36 of the bill gives the commissioner power to take possession of homes, cancel contracts, and sue for money if 1 payments are three months overdue. This is not the time to pass a measure of that kind. Last week, I asked a question in the service home has been ejected since this House regarding sewerage for war serGovernment took office. vice homes. If the War Service Homes Commissioner has constructed houses in communication in which the following areas which are sewered, it is not right paragraph appears:to leave them -unconnected with the sewerage system. In one instance, the Dryden, of Cochrane-road, Thirroul, who was municipal council has agreed to do the removed from his home in August last. This work of sewering the houses, and allow man the occupants to pay the cost over an was earning £4 10s. per week; now his extended period. The council merely asks average earnings are £2 5s. a week, aud he has that the War Service Homes Department four grown-up children, none of whom are shall guarantee the cost. The Minister, working. in reply to my question, said that no whole of the time, and, in addition, it has money was available to make such a depreciated in value through wanton damage grant. I remind him that no grant is at necessary. From its experience, the department need not expect a greater percentage of default than two or three per cent, at the most. Not only would the that he was removed from his home in occupants of war service homes obtain August last. the benefit of sewerage if this plan were followed, but the work provided would pay any rent? go some way towards relieving unemployment.

If this is merely a machinery bill, it would appear that some of its provisions are hardly necessary at the present juncture. We are told that this measure is merely to facilitate the working of the act and the regulations framed under it ; but I contend that it will make the conditions of occupants a little more difficult than they have been in the past. What is proposed should, I contend, have been deferred until conditions generally are a little more prosperous. Without giving the measure very close attention, it would appear that some of its provisions are innocuous. When I .first heard that it was the intention of the Government to introduce an amending war service homes bill I assumed, without perhaps any ground for the assumption, that it would afford relief to those occupying war service homes. An examination of the measure shows that it is a bill framed by a departmental official to validate regulation 17, which the Full Court of Victoria declared ultra vires. This measure is now submitted to validate that regulation, and to make it retrospective. for eleven or twelve years. been in force for that period does not prove its justice or validity. departments are administered under regulations. For instance, under one clause in the Navigation Act, pages and pages of regulations have been framed by departmental officers, and concerning them Parliament knows very little. On the first occasion on which the regulation in question was tested it was found to be ultra vires, and the Government now introduces this bill to close up a loophole in the State Savings Bank of Victoria2 the act. I join with the honourable memwhat he has said in support of those occupying war service homes, and congratulate him upon the fact that his maiden speech in this chamber should have been upon so worthy a subject.

If such occupants were ejected, the Government's instructions were disobeyed. honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the subject of war service homes, and his remarks on that occasion were supported by honourable members on both sides of the chamber including myself.

It has been argued that it is impossible to reduce the interest rate because some of the money loaned to the soldiers to buy war service homes was borrowed overseas, but that is small satisfaction to the man who is in distress. What does he care whether the interest payable by the the money was borrowed at home or abroad? for 224 per cent, reduction of interest. say that the interest cannot be reduced overseas. We ought to face the facts. I cannot understand why the Government should want us to pass this bill with such indecent haste, and before the investigation committee has met. In my opinion, consideration of the measure should be deferred until the report of that committee has been obtained. We are labouring under a grave disability in considering the bill at present, for our information is restricted to that obtainable from the Minister, the department, or our own personal contact with returned soldiers. If we could wait until the report of the committee is available, we should be much better equipped to deal with the bill. quire into the high price paid for land for war service homes purposes? certainly think it should do so.

Unduly high prices were also paid for land bought for war service homes purposes. Honourable members should contrast what this Government is proposing to do for the occupants of war service homes with what the Victorian Government has done for soldier settlers. £24,140,000 in placing 11,400 settlers on the land. The concessions granted to these men have amounted to £4,203,000, the land values have been reduced by £250,000, and an amount of £1,370,124 has been written off in respect of excess cost of buildings. But very little has been done to help the occupants of war service homes. There was a slight reduction in charges in 1923. The Auditor-General has pointed out that the spending of money on war service homes by the Commonwealth Government has been an excellent investment. He has shown clearly that the men have acquitted themselves as might be expected of them, yet the Government has brought down a bill designed to make things still harder for them. In his annual report for the year ended the 30th June, 1931, the Auditor-General says, in connection with war service homesIt is of interest to note that this is .the first year in which a reduction in tlie liability is designed to permit the commission to to the Treasury has been effected. Such reduction indicating that repayments of principle and interests are in excess of expenditure plus interest on capital. In fact, capital expenditure has been reduced to a minimum,.and is now practically confined to repairs and maintenance of homes abandoned by purchasers. He also pointed out thatThe percentage of arrears to instalments due has increased from 2.19, compared with 1.12 in 1929-30. The greatest increase occurred in New South Wales, where unemployment is most acute. No doubt, the percentage of arrears has increased since that time; but it is quite evident that the men have done their best to meet their obligations in spite of scandals associated with the building of war service homes such as those to which the honourable referred. Land scandals and timber scandals were occurring about the time some of us returned from active service. Many jerry-built houses came into the hands of the returned men who had been thrifty enough to invest their gratuity and savings in a home of their own. In spite of all this, the occupants of these homes have not unduly protested. It is, therefore, regrettable that a hill of this description should have heen introduced before the investiVictoria spent gation committee has had an opportunity to present a report to the Government on the subject. The most important amendment to the principal Act, the Minister informed us, was designed to validate regulation 17, and so make it legal for the commission to sue for arrears. We were told that about £10,000 had been collected under regulation 17, but that £28,000 was still outstanding, and that the Government was afraid that application might be made for the refund of money already paid. But surely it cannot be argued that there is any urgency in the matter. Only one case has succeeded, and every individual occupant will have to take his case to the court for determination. The .next amendment, in point of importance, has relation to repairs. According to the Minister, the commission should be empowered to maintain houses, and the amendment will give it legal authority to do so. Another amendment let houses that become empty. At present, if a house becomes empty, it may be sold to anybody, whether he is a returned man or hot. his house if he desires to do so ? with the consent of the commission: Some of the men who put their money into war service homes on their returu from the war, are in a most unhappy position. A man may have bought a house in 1920 for £800, and its value today may he only £500. Many war service homes are in distant suburbs. I have very few of them in my constituency, but I know that there are many in the division of Henty. The men bought homes in distant suburbs, because of the favorable terms that were available at -that time; but to-day they are feeling the detrimental effects of living at a distance",29,Francis

The result has been that many men have abandoned their war service homes, and have rented houses nearer the city at a considerably cheaper rate than they were paying previously. A perpetuation of the present state of affairs will mean the penalizing of our best returned men. The man who squandered his substance has now no binding property obligations. We know very well that many of the men who bought war service homes are government employees, who have had their salaries or wages reduced to such a point that they are now finding it very difficult to make ends meet. I shall be told that men who are in difficulties are not being forced to pay for Cook( Mr Riley) should have their rent ; but the amount they are in arrears is being placed to their debit, and affording relief to returned soldiers it they will be required to continue their payments for a greater number of years than was stipulated in their contract in order that they may repay their full indebtedness. Of the 2,000 men who were retrenched in the Postmaster-General's Department last year, 1,500 were returned soldiers, who have very little chance of getting back to their old standard of home comfort. In these circumstances, we should not hastily pass this hill, even soldiers. though it would validate something that is allegedly wrong. If a man is forced to vacate his home, he gets no credit whatever for the improvements that he may have made during his occupancy. If the original cost of a house was £800, and if the amount owing on it was £500, because of the depreciation of values, the occupant would be lucky if he got £400 or £500 for the property, so that the whole of his and at such times as are prescribed, or the equity in it would be lost. If through Unemployment a returned soldier is forced to vacate a home, the commission may decide that certain repairs are necessary, and debit him wifh the cost.

It would be better if the Government got on with the business of providing means to relieve unemployment. returned soldiers are unemployed, and if further charges are levied upon them in respect of repairs to homes which, through force of circumstances, they have been compelled to vacate, the Government, which, I know, sincerely desires to improve their lot, will at all events be misunderstood by them. entirely opposed to the bill, and I cannot understand why the honourable member given it his blessing.

It did very little good, but what little it did do I am not anxious to overlook. When Mr Parker Moloney was administering war service homes, he extended every sympathy to the occupiers of these homes, and even reinstated many who had been evicted by the Bruce-Page Government. This bill is unnecessary. The act under which the homes have been administered for years past is harsh enough. Do not let us make it harsher. Let us even extend to the occupiers the consideration that many owners extend to their tenants. A home in Mayfield was resumed by the commission because the instalments had not been met, and the occupant, who happened to be the tenant of the purchaser, was evicted. The property was first purchased when the employment of the purchaser necessitated his living at "" Mayfield. He was subsequently transferred to Newcastle, and it was more convenient for him to live at Carrington. He therefore let his home at Mayfield, but the tenant subsequently became unemployed and accumulated arrears of rent. The owner would not evict the tenant. He preferred not to follow the inhuman policy of the commission as applied to occupiers who fail to pay their instalments, and, as a result, lost his house. can furnish the particulars to the Minister at the conclusion of the debate. Hardship has been inflicted in cases where the department has come to the decision that homes must be renovated, although the occupiers may not think that repairs are necessary. The Mayor of Cessnock has written to me saying that he has paid approximately £300 towards the purchase of his home, and still owes the original amount he contracted to pay. If the improvements for which these amendments make provision are to be effected, men may be thrown further into debt. a man is paying his These are fixed on an in due course a man cipal and interest.

They are not covered by this bill. confers no benefit on the soldier occupant. Many requests have been made for a reduction in the purchase price of property in accordance with, the Premiers plan, but there has not yet been a re-valuation of war service homes. The Valuer-General of New South Wales has reported that the value of property has fallen in New South Wales, and I dare say it has fallen in the other States too, yet there has been no reduction in the price of war service homes, nor is any such reduction proposed by this bill. The Government does not even propose to reduce rents in accordance with the Premiers plan. tion by the Workers Homes Board iu New South Wales. rents have been reduced by 22^ per cent. Some.war service homes were built without proper outlets for waste water, and the purchasers are now being compelled by the local governing bodies to effect the necessary connexions with the sewerage system. I submitted to the commissioner one such case from Edward-street, KurriK u r r i ; the shire council said that it could not be held responsible for an omission on the part of the commission when the home was built.

The Eeturned Soldiers Congress resolvedThis congress requests that no evictions be far in arrears through no fault of their made from war service homes where the arrears are caused by unemployment or other circumstances over whicli the occupant has no control. That is a reasonable request, but I am afraid that the humane policy of the Scullin Ministry will be discontinued, and the commission will revert to the harsher treatment that characterized the administration of war service homes during the Bruce-Page regime. At that time many unfortunate men whose payments fell into arrears through unemployment were evicted from their homes. When an occupier through unemployment is forced to suspend his payments for a period the commission could be adequately protected by extending the period of purchase accordingly. amendment to that effect in committee. The bill generally does not commend itself to the occupants of war service homes, particularly that provision which seeks to validate an invalid law and thus deprive the soldiers of their legal rights. Although one successful litigant named Davies successfully appealed to the FullCourt in Melbourne, and is not to be robbed of the fruits of his victory, this amendment is being made retrospective in order to prevent other occupants from getting the benefit of the defect in the law. a technical point. In the lower court, and the Supreme Court judgment was given for the Crown, but on final appeal to the Full Court judgment was given in favour of the occupant. dealt with by that judgment, this bill does propose to' impose on the occupants of war service homes a retrospective liability. These men have made greater sacrifices than any other section of the community, and are entitled to special consideration; for that reason the interest rate should be further reduced from 4£ per cent, to 2\ per cent. Owing to the general trade depression which has robbed men of their employment, a house for £500 may ultimately cost him £1,100, through the accumulation of interest and penalties. Some of the purchasers are so own that they have no prospect of ever becoming the owners of their homes. Another objectionable provision in the bill is that which enables the commission to sue the estate of a deceased soldier for the recovery of arrears. In committee I shall move several amendments, which I trust will be sympathetically considered by the Minister in charge of tbe bill. futile to talk of the soldiers as having been harassed or being likely to receive anything but considerate treatment. The Scullin Government laid down and honestly administered the principle that where default was due to unemployment or any other cause over which the soldier had no control, the contract of purchase would not be enforced by ejectment or other drastic measures. The present Government is following that policy to the satisfaction of representative soldier organizations. The bill has two main objects. The first is to give to the Commissioner the right to recover amounts in respect of which the soldier purchaser has defaulted. An ordinary contract of sale contains a clause setting out the remedies available to the vendor if the purchaser should default. The War Service Homes Act purported to provide similar remedies, but the enumeration of them was defective. The act provides for the annulment of the contract, aud for the commission to repossess itself of the house; but it fails to provide the ordinary right to recover arrears from the purchaser. If the act had not attempted to enumerate the remedies available to the vendor, the right of' recovery would have existed as a matter of ordinary law. An attempt was made to cure the omission by regulation, and for many years both rhe commission and the soldier occupants were of opinion that the ordinary conditions of a contract of sale applied to war",33,Francis

Recently, however, one Davies took advantage of the defect in the act, and although there was no merit in his claim, the superior court gave judgment in his favour on a technical flaw. It is not desirable that the departequity in a house it is fair to debit the ment should be required to refund many thousands of pounds that it has collected in accordance with what was believed by both vendor and purchaser to be the law. I doubt whether many soldiers would care to take advantage of the defect on which Davies succeeded; and it is questionable whether the administration of the act strictly in accordance with its language rather than its spirit would be in the interests of the soldiers. The act has been administered in a spirit of sympathy with, and consideration for the soldiers, and if an attempt were made to have their agreements carried out strictly in accordance with the law, it would be much to the disadvantage of the soldiers. Such legislation as this should be administered in a spirit of fairness, equity and good conscience; it is hot desirable to take retrospective operation of this measure is advantage of technical defects which may have been discovered in the operation of the law. A similar comment is applicable to the new cases. second defect which the bill seeks to remedy. In nearly all cases, the clause enabling the Commissioner to recover the interest rate should be reduced to 2£ per sum expended on repairs is quite unnecescent., but that is quite impracticable.

In those measures that would result in real imcase , the commission should have the provement. 1 right to effect repairs.

Repairs mean renovations, and can be distinguished from improvements, which involve the addition of something that is new. The only risk is that a departmental officer might think it clever to include in the cost of repairs a work which amounted to an improvement, and that would operate unfairly against the ex-soldier. But the department can be trusted, I think, to act fairly towards the occupants in the future, as it has in the past. The only other complaint made is that this legislation is to be retrospective. Ordinarily that is a sound objection; but, as I have pointed out, it is not desirable that the department should be obliged to refund moneys which have been paid to it. I do not consider that the likely to prove unfair, because for years the department has believed that it had the power now sought, and giving it this power is not likely to make it search for The suggestion has been made that the day it may be desirable to consider the but this is not a suitable time to raise returned soldiers' committee has made a",34,Francis

[5.13] -There are seven or eight hundred returned soldiers in my electorate who are much disappointed to find that this bill makes no provision for relieving them of their difficulties, and they are anxious to have their whole position reviewed. They are glad that the Minister has agreed to have an inquiry made, and H report presented regarding their efforts to complete the payments due with respectto their homes; but are disappointed that # purchaser of a war service home is 3iot to he included on the committee. It seems to me that in the discussion this afternoon we have been dealing only with a position that should obtain in normal times. There seems to ;be good ground for the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr grievances. They do not blame the GoWhite) that the consideration of this bill jnight well be postponed until the Government is furnished with the report of ihe special committee appointed to investigate the position of the occupants of war service homes. past acts of administration, whereas the special committee is inquiring into a problem of the future. -that; but I can show, I think, that the present and future positions of the occupants should be considered conjointly. I do not suggest that any government has failed to show every possible sympathy for the returned soldiers who are struggling to purchase their homes. I believe that the Minister has in mind a method of preventing the ejection of those who cannot meet their payments; but we should consider this measure in the light of the present circumstances of the purchasers. They committee is bought their homes when values were high. On several occasions I have sat in conference with returned soldiers, and I find that the average purchaser entered into his commitments years ago, when he had every reason to believe that he could keep up his payments. He set out with the ambition to buy his home as quickly as-possible; but every reasonable person must admit that it is impossible under present conditions for a large percentage of the occupants to carry out their original contracts. This bill strengthens the position of the commission in dealing with homes that have been deserted by the purchasers. those men. Power is sought to obtain the maximum profit for the ex-soldier on the sale of his house. that these homes should be kept in proper repair, and nobody suggests that a returned soldier would desire to live in unhealthy premises. Naturally, from time to time these homes require renovation ; but the occupants have got into arrears because their incomes have been reduced by at least one-third. A large percentage of the men have been forced to join an organization for tbe purpose of obtaining redress of their ' vernment for the commitments which they have to meet; they are merely endeavouring to show how difficult is their position on account of those commitments. Since they guaranteed to make regular weekly payments by way of interest and principal, in order to pay off the sums owing on their homes, their incomes have been reduced, on the average, by at least one-third. Yet it cannot be suggested that a similar reduction has been made in the amounts due by them. More than 50 per cent, of them are either totally or partially unemployed. The Government is quite justified in expecting these homes to be kept in proper order; but whenever the department authorizes the renovation of a home, it adds to the already high arrears that are piling up against the occupant. The ex-soldiers are inclined to think that if they lived to the age of a thousand years they could never become the owners of their homes. They have now concluded that it would be better for",35,Francis

They do not take up this position because they are anxious to desert their homes. On the other hand the great majority of them would prefer to discharge their liability; they have, in fact, done much to add to the attractiveness of their dwellings. The War Service Homes Purchasers Association, which represents a large body of these men, is asking the department to consider wiping off a portion of the arrears that have accrued. In doing so they are merely asking to be treated as others are treated. thing for a government tp declarea moratorium under which the tenants of houses belonging to private landlords are not required to pay rent, in certain circumstances. They do not, however, always free the tenants of government properties from the necessity of paying their rent. municipalities agreed not to demand rates and taxes from property owners who had freed their tenants from the necessity of paying rent. This bill does not do anything like that. ment would view this matter purely as a business proposition, it would realize that it would obtain more revenue from the purchasers of war service homes by relieving them of some of their arrears than if it insisted on full payment. If the arrears are allowed to accumulate, the purchasers will find their position hopeless, and will relinquish their homes. I agree with the honourable member for Balacl ava ( Mr White) that war service homes should, be maintained in good condition. advantage to do so, since, in the event of the house being sold, any balance over and above his liability to the Government would go into his own pocket. However, in view of the depreciated value of house property, that is a remote possibility at this juncture. the honourable member for Balaclava has said, for the Government to be tightening up the regulations against the returned soldiers at the very time that they were looking for relief from some of their obligations. The Minister would do well to hold the bill in abeyance until the Mr Holloway. report of the committee has been received. I am disappointed that the bill, instead of relieving the purchasers of war service homes, merely provides that they shall pay the last penny that they owe. suggestion. that is what the bill provides. The Minister ought to defer its consideration until the committee's report has been received. I am disappointed also that the Government has not seen fit to provide that the purchasers of war service homes shall have direct representation on the comIt is not an uncommon mittee of inquiry. Surely they are in a better position to provide the committee with information than is any other person !

I urge the Minister not to proceed with this measure iu committee until the report of the committee of inquiry has been received. I also stress the importance of giving the purchasers direct representation on the comIndeed, it is to the purchaser's mittee of inquiry. I wish to refer to some points mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) which originated with the United War Service Home It is indeed strange, as Purchasers Association. First, I mention the alleged necessity for an alteration of the bill to overcome the difficulty which has arisen because of the Full Court of Victoria having found a regulation to be ultra vires. The Minister said that the bill would not in any way affect that decision-that V. S. Davies, who brought the case before the court.",36,Francis

164,Mr Holloway,The Minister,37,Francis
165,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) ['5.25].,"would not be affected by the decision. Apparently, Davies is the only man who will obtain any redress because of the action taken in the court, notwithstanding that behind him stood an organization whose members were as much concerned with the Court's decision as he was. If each member of the association had approached the court, as Davies did, then I take it that all of them would have received the benefit of the decision secured by Davies. It would appear that the object of the Government is to get behind the decision of the court by making it apply only to Davies, not to those other members of the association who stood behind him. It is a common practice, when a number of men are similarly affected by some action, or decision, for only one case to be cited before the court. For the convenience of the court itself that is often done. But it is expected that any decision arrived at will apply to the whole of the members of the organization concerned. If , for instance, the members of a trade union feel that it is desirable that the court should be approached in relation to their wages, or conditions of employment, they submit a test case for the court's decision, and they expect that any benefit which results fromtheir action will apply to all the members of the trade union concerned. the Government by introducing this measure is attempting to cheat the other members of the association who did not individually approach the court. rushed in with legislation the object of which is to deprive the other members of the association of benefits which the court held they should enjoy. ber state the details of the case 1 cannot; but probably the Minister can do so. I suggest that he place this case in all its aspects before the House, so that we may be in a position to judge the measure impartially. It is probable that there are other matters in connection with which the association desires relief. Purchasers of war service homes, realizing that, as individuals, they were as a voice crying in the wilderness, formed an association with the object of obtaining some relief from the conditions imposed on them. The association, with whose object the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is probably more acquainted than I am, submits that this amending bill should not be finalized until every aspect of the case, as affecting its members, has been considered and dealt with. The Minister will probably say that the terms of reference to the committee of inquiry do not touch the alterations in this bill. If that is so the committee of inquiry is restricted in regard to matters which the association regards as vital. that. Minister's case. dates what has been done in the past. The inquiry is designed to keep the soldiers in their homes. the Minister had been candid and had informed us that the Government had hurriedly introduced this amending bill in order to meet the position which has arisen because of the decision of the court. I maintain that, if Davies is entitled, to redress, every member of the association to which he belongs is entitled to similar treatment. The association maintains that the inquiry should be of an all-embracing nature. The views of the rank and file of the association have been placed before the House clearly by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). From those who are vitally concerned in this measure, we are most likely to obtain the truth. It may be that the officers of the association 1 are in a more fortunate position than are many of its members, and that, therefore, they are not best equipped to put the case as affecting war service homes purchasers generally. Were the Government really desirous of helping the unfortunate purchasers of war service homes, it would defer further action until the report of the committee has been received. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the purchasers of war service homes should be directly represented on the committee of inquiry. I cannot understand why the Government has not acceded to their request for representation. I hope that even now it will do so; such -action would meet with",37,Francis

173,Mr Beasley,"I would be glad i fgeneral approval. Honourable members who have been in this chamber for some years, particularly those who have been Cabinet Ministers, know that it is only now and then that an opportunity presents itself to introduce an amending bill. A government may admit that amendments are necessary to a measure, and promise that they will be introduced at an opportune time, but that is too indefinite and unsatisfactory to those concerned. I , therefore, feel that when an amending bill is before the House, we should consider every aspect of the matter it concerns. war service homes are passing through difficult times, particularly in the northern districts of New South Wales which are represented by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr were abnormally high, and land values James), who put their case so well. I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to accede to the request for a postponement of the bill. also urge the Government not to proceed with this legislation hastily, particularly as it is expected that the act will again have to be amended after the investigating committee has lodged its report. have to visit all the States, and the exhaustive nature of its inquiry will necessitate at least four months being occupied in the investigation. such a long period must elapse before existing anomalies can be rectified. The disabilities of the occupants of war service homes are patent to all, and surely with the assistance of returned soldier organizations, the Government could obviate much of the travelling and questioning that it intends shall be done by the proposed committee. There are certain features of the bill to which exception cannot be taken. I recognize that the responsibility of ownership must be acknowledged, also that it would be wrong to allow these homes to fall into serious disrepair through neglect on the part of the occupants. At the same time, we should not allow legislation of this description to be hurried through in nn ill-digested state, as that could only result in hardship being inflicted on the occupants of war service homes. Government would be well-advised to delay action until it is better informed on the subject. From time to time. I have been asked to place before the Government the case of occupants of war service homes in my electorate, and I must admit that on every occasion the most sympathetic consideration and assistance has been extended to me. For that I express my appreciation. I realize that the War Service Homes Department is confronted with one of the most difficult tasks associated with the affairs of returned soldiers. The haste The occupants of with which the war service homes scheme was originated has resulted in many anomalies, which cause the department much concern. These houses were ""constructed at a time when building costs were excessive, and so it is essential to do something to reduce valuations. The committee should deal specifically with that problem. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) that every encouragement should be given to the occupants of war service homes to remain in possession of them. Because of unemployment and other adverse circumtances, these unfortunate people have incurred arrears of rents which amount, in the aggregate, to an alarming figure. The Government would be well-advised to disregard those arrears for the time being, It is unfortunate that and allow the purchasers of war service homes to deal only with current commitments, leaving the arrears to be dealt with as part of the capital cost and extend the period of repayment. That would be preferable to forcing the tenants out of their houses, which would merely result in additional loss in expenditure to the Government. A similar idea was propounded by the originator of the "" thousand homes scheme "" in South Australia, but, unfortunately, the Government of that State was unable to appreciate its wisdom. I also think that this Government should reduce interest rates on war service homes by another half per cent., which would be in conformity with the action of the Stare Governments in its treatment of returned men. I ask the Minister to recognize the claims of honourable members on this side, The as well as those of honourable members",38,Francis

If that and certain other anomalies were adjusted, the measure would be more to my liking. trust that the Minister will not agree to either adjourn the debate or withdraw the bill. This measure does not represent an attempt to deal with any of the wrongs from which the occupants of war service homes are suffering. The present Government has been in office only about ten weeks, and has not had time to investigate the position, which admittedly is serious. To accede to the requests of all honourable members would place a terrific strain on the finances of the Commonwealth. The Minister has done all that is possible in. the circumstances, by introducing a bill that will not cause injury to one occupier of a war service home. tion as it was thought to exist. undertaking to purchase war service have produced at least this fruit.

The bill is designed to deal only with the urgent question of validating certain powers and actions taken under those powers that were thought to exist from the commencement of the war service homes administration. of this department, all my endeavours have been directed towards ensuring that the purchasers of war service homes remained in their homes. The policy definitely adopted by this Government-the policy that was in operation when this legislation was originally introduced-is that every endeavour is to be made to provide returned men with their own homes. The act was designed for that purpose. our power, taking into consideration the difficult times through which we are passing, to ensure that the returned man shall remain in his home. We are accepting, as instalments, small payments in accordance with the wages, salary, or income of the individual occupant. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said a moment ago, a portion of that policy was introduced during the regime of the late Government. A man with a wife and three children, on an income of £3 18s. a week, pays only £1 a week. The payment diminishes pro rata, until the income reaches £2 3s. a week, in which case the returned soldier pays 2s. a week. On an income of £2 2s. a week and under the payment is only Is. a week. That policy has been adopted by this Government to ensure that, so far as possible, the ex-soldier will remain in his home. The bill is in the light of the circumstances, with all designed only to rectify an anomaly under a judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria, but opportunity has been taken by the Government to deal with one or two minor matters. harshness, cruel administration, and lack of consideration has no application to this bill, and no act of administration on the part of this Government since it took office could justify any of those charges. The returned soldier occupant himself has made no complaint about this proposal. the complaints of the returned soldiers in my electorate. was designed to amend only three sections of the act. When it became known that it was to be introduced, the president of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia asked me to make copies of the bill available to him. That was done on the 26th February, at SinceI took charge the time the bill was introduced. Copies have been distributed among the States, and there has been no objection taken to this amending legislation except from Victoria in respect of one matter. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) quoted one protest against the bill, but he referred to a letter which was written to him two days before E made my second-reading speech in this House. was agreed to I obtained a copy of the bill and circulated it. By return post I received a protest against the bill. member's interpretation of the bill is similar to the interpretation placed upon it by the writer of that unfortunate letter, I am not surprised that the resolution referred to was carried. The official representative of the Opposition in this House referred sympathetically to the administration of the department, which, he said, had always endeavoured to carry out the intention of the act. I also, from my personal experience of the department prior to and since I have been in charge of it, express my appreciation of the work of the officials. They have endeavoured to carry out the spirit of the act, at the same time dealing as leniently as possible, cases that have come under their notice. They have always had a difficult and delicate task, and have carried out their duties with sympathy and tact.

The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr named Davies. He was £38 4s. 5d. in McNicoll) brought under my notice certain conditions in respect of homes in !New South Wales, particularly at GoulIburn, and raised several objections to this measure. The group of homes at Goulburn was built in 1919, not by the War Service Homes Commission, but by the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of the commission. The architect who supervised the building of those homes was sued by -the War Service Homes Commission in respect of faulty construction and the offer of £10,000 to indemnify the commission for damages was accepted. On receipt of that sum the commission offered to build .for every soldier who had one of those faulty homes, a new home to his own .design. That offer was accepted by all -except two returned soldier occupants who desired to remain in their old homes, and in those instances the original price of the house was reduced to £600. Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial Xeague of Australia at Goulburn has been ainstinted in its appreciation of the action of the commission in this connection. The difficulty in respect to the question of sewerage raised by the honourable member for Werriwa is finance; we cannot afford the expenditure of large sums of money at this time. Since the honourable member brought this matter under my -ecord. The. Government notice, I have been in communication with the Goulburn City Council. I have informed that body that we shall be pleased to do all within our power to assist it. The commission is having considerable trouble, mainly in New South Wales, from vandalism in unoccupied houses. For this additional reason we are anxious to carry out our policy of keeping returned soldiers in their homes. If there is any equity in a property, we hope to preserve it for the returned soldier occupant. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. vernment has been taking since the War Service Homes Act was first put into operation. It is not proposed to increase in any way the obligations of the soldiers, and no additional powers are to be given to the Commissioner. The whole matter arises out of a case heard before the courts dealing with a returned soldier arrears in his payments. He had occupied a house since October, 1923, to the 26th February, 1931. He was in perma-nent employment as a shunter in the Victorian railways. He resides at Newporu His wage was in excess of the basic wage, and he made arrangements to pay the usual instalments, and a small sum in addition every month to overtake the arrears. That arrangement was riot carried out, and the commission instituted proceedings after the issue of a final notice. The contract was cancelled, and the Commissioner took action to recover the amount in arrears, and was successfu l in the County Court. The matter then went to the Full Court, and, on a technical point, the decision went in favour of the occupant. It is in order to put beyond any doubt the legality of the regulation under which action was taken The by the Commissioner that this amendment is being brought forward at the present time.

When the decision of the F u l l Court was made known, several applications were received by the Government for re:funds of sums of money previously paid ""by occupants of war service homes under xegulation 17. which was published in all the leading .newspapers of Australia, urging returned soldiers not to incur costs in making application through solicitors for refunds of payments they had made. I told them that the Government proposed to amend the act in order to carry out its original intention, so that they would only be wasting their money by taking legal action. This legislation has been brought down as early as possible, so as to protect the soldiers themselves, and to safeguard the revenue. To-day several honourable members paid tribute to the occupants of war service homes for the exemplary way in ""which they had met their obligations under the terms of the contracts into -which fhey had entered. I j o in with them in that tribute, and point out that, prior to the present depression, payments hy occupants of war service homes were in arrears only to the extent of 1 per cent. Of the 37,000 occupants of war service homes only 32 had been ejected, and this excellent result had been achieved under the act as it stood before the judgment of the court was given. see no reason why honourable members should raise any objection to the proposed amendment.

Recently, as the result of the conversion loan, the late Treasurer reduced the rate of interest to returned soldiers from 5 per cent, to per cent. Several organizations have since requested that the rate of interest should be reduced by another \ per cent. The request has been carefully examined by the Government, and a statement has been drawn up, copies of which w ill be sent to the various organizations which have preferred requests. The statement is as follows:Your representations that the rate of interest on war service homes should be reduced to 4 per cent, from tlie rate at present charged, viz., 4J per cent., to which rate interest charges were reduced as from the 1st August, 1931, in accordance with the undertaking given by the late Government in Mr Theodore's speech in Parliament on the 9tb July, 1931 (see Hansard, volume 130, page 3741) have had tbe most careful consideration of the Government.

Recognizing the manner in which the administration had become confused, the Government of the day decided that it would not charge soldiers a penny more than they had believed they would have to pay. It was arranged that the soldiers should be charged a maximum of £800 for homes, although many of the houses had cost £900, £1,000, and £1,100, and as much as £800, at a cost to the Commonwealth of £230,000. These points have, of course, been dealt with before. They are ancient history, as is the matter referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr. The architect in charge was proceeded I regard that statement against, and agreed to pay £10,000 as Every soldier concerned a hew home built to his own design.

This clause is designed the ex-mortgagor when the commission has merely to deal with a technical situation. occurs It is necessary that the department shall serve notice on somebody in order legally security is a contract of sale and purchase, to take possession of the house. There is where the home is re-sold and a surplus occurs, no intention to claim any payment the and none has been claimed. Every State housing act contains powers similar to those included in this bill, directly or indirectly bearing on repairs to properties, particulars of which I have before me, but which I do not think it necessary to quote. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) objected to what he termed the retrospective nature of this legislation. There is nothing retrospective in the bill.' It provides the commission with those powers which the original act was intended to confer upon it. power to let a property? stated that, apart from the right to let a house, and to serve a notice under section 42, for which provision had not previously been made, no additional powers are granted. Under this measure no additional burdens are placed upon returned soldiers; the sole object of the bill is to assist the occupants of war service homes. Provision has been made for effecting repairs in order to ensure a better sale. If , when the property market is glutted, the Commissioner endeavoured to sell a home in a state of disrepear or semi-disrepair, a prospective buyer, who has so many properties from which to make a selection, would probably decline the offer. By placing a cottage in a good tenant-able condition, a better price should last. be obtainable. The better the price obtained, the greater is the probability of the original borrower securing more than his equity in the property. This legislation has been submitted in the interest of returned soldier occupants. It is not the policy of the Government to harass a returned soldier who is in arrears in his payments. The commission gives the following 1. In mortgage cases, when the home is rea sufficient margin of security. If a loss this is borne by the commission. 2. In rent purchase cases, i.e., where the ex-purchaser is accorded the following concessions:(a) If he had a 10 per cent, equity made up of deposits and principal repayments, arrears of instalments to the extent of the surplus are written off and the balance claimed from the ex-purchaser. (6) If he lodged a deposit but did not have a 10 per cent, equity, arrears to the extent of the deposit, but not exceeding the difference between the loan granted to him and the new sale price are written off and any balance claimed from the ex-purchaser. In every instance the utmost consideration has been shown to the purchasers of war service homes. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) complained because the United War Service Homes Purchasers Association is not to be represented on the committee. organization operating? is impossible for all such organizations to be represented on a committee which is to consist of three members; but I hope that that organization will avail itself of the opportunity to submit points for consideration by the committee, which I feel sure will give them the fullest consideration.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN My ruling was that the consideration of the clause had been completed before the honourable member rose. Clause 3(1.) Section thirty-six of the Principal Act is amended by inserting, after sub-section (1.), the following sub-sections:"" ( IA . ) Notwithstanding the cancellation of any contract of sale, the Commissioner may sue for and recover from the purchaser any money which became due under the contract at any time prior to the date of cancellation of the contract."" Section proposed to be amended1. If at any time any instalment or money payable in respect of any contract of sale or advance under this act, or any part of such instalment or money, is unpaid for three calendar months next after the time appointed for the payment thereof, then, although no legal demand has been made for payment, the commissioner possession of the land or land and dwellinghouse vyith< respect to which the contract of sale was entered into or the advance was made, and maymoveThat the words "" cancellation of tbe con tract,"" proposed new sub-section IA , be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereol the words ""the mutual vacation of the property."" In cases of this kind there should be some mutual understanding between the Commissioner and the purchaser or the borrower prior to a property being vacated. In the absence of a provision such as I propose, there will be friction and possibly legal proceedings. Minister) [8.29] -The amendment is not in conformity with the spirit of the act and cannot therefore be accepted. If a property could be vacated only by mutual consent the Commissioner would be placed in an impossible position and there would be no necessity for thit provision. This measure has been framed to meet all cases that may arise. When occupants wish to vacate war service homes the commission advises them to endeavour to meet their obligations, and points out the advantages of remaining in occupation. "" ( l c ) Where the Commissioner has entered upon and taken possession of an}' land and dwelling-house(a) he may effect all repairs which he deems necessary, and the expenses thereby incurred, together with interest at the same annual rate as that which is payable on the purchase money or advance, as the case may be, shall be paid to the Commissioner by the purchaser or borrower on demand or by such instalments and at such times as are prescribed or the Commissioner determines, and until repayment shall be a charge under the contract of sale or mortgage or other security upon the property, notwithstanding that the cost to the Commissioner is thereby increased to more thaD nine hundred and f if t y pounds: and (6) if the Commissioner is satisfied that it is not possible to effect an immediate sale of the property at a reasonable price, he may let the property, upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit , until such time as, in his opinion, it is possible may enter upon and take to effect a sale at a reasonable price, and the rent received shall be applied in the same manner as the proceeds of any sale made in pursuance of this Part."".",46,Francis

As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the value of war service homes has fallen considerably. A house bought for £800 a few years ago is probably worth no more than £500 to-day. In these circumstances it would be unwise to permit any authority to make extensive repairs to a property or to spend a large sum in renovating it in the expectation of receiving a very much higher price at a sale. We do not know what agents the War Service Homes Commission appoints to do its work, but it would be distinctly unfair to a person who has had to vacate a home if he had to pay, or was debited with, a large sum for repairs and renovations. Minister) [8.36] -The Government cannot accept this amendment, but will accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr amendment. McNicoll), and temporarily withdrawn. Consideration has been given to the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), and I wish to assure him and other honourable members that the commission will not incur any expense for repairs and renovations beyond the minimum amount necessary to effect a satisfactory sale of any property. As an evidence of the bona fides of the Government iu this connection, I am willing to stipulate that not more than £40 shall be spent in this way in any one case. I do not desire honourable members to imagine, however, that £40 will be spent in every instance. Only so much money will be spent as will put the property into a saleable condition. Such expenditure will be in the best interests of the soldier who may have an equity in the house, the comI have a prior amendmission, and the Government. the Government is not prepared to withdraw the bill, I am glad that it is at least willing to make some concession to the persons who are in difficulties with their war service homes.

It is not fair that the War Service Homes Commission should be the sole judge of the extent of the repairs and renovations necessary to any particular property. Many occupants of war service homes are, to-day, in a desperate plight, and severe hardship would be inflicted upon them if they were obliged to submit to the extensive renovation of their homes. Eveni f they were not called upon to pay for the work immediately, the liability in respect of it would be added to their total indebtedness and so their accumulated arrears would be increased. The officers of the commission should not be allowed to enter anybody's home for the purpose of effecting repairs or renovations unless the occupant or the purchaser is willing.

The honourable member's remarks, therefore, have no application to section 36 of the principal act which is now being amended. They would have been appropriate perhaps if applied to section 31, hut we have concluded our consideration of the amendments to that section. In any case, the officers of the War Service Homes Commission would not be likely to take action with regard to the renovation of a house which is still in occupation of the original purchaser, unless it was in a state of very serious disrepair. But with houses which have been abandoned the position is different. effect renovations and repairs to such a house in order to get a tenant or make a sale. cases it is in the interests of the former soldiers. owner of the house that it should be put into a condition to make the sale of it possible.

This means that the commission may recover the cost of repairs or renovations as far back as that year. I wish to safeguard returned soldiers from further indebtedness which may be dueto circumstances over which they have no control. Owing, to unemployment they may have fallen into arrears with their payments and been forced to vacate their homes. In a later provision, the commission is eveu given authority to serve notices on executors or administrators of estates of deceased -Apparentl y there is one aspect of the amendment foreshadowed by the honorthat is not understood by the honourable while £40 may be the maximum to be expended on repairs by the commissioner, the soldier who has vacated his home may be sued for only the amount of his equity. Commissioner will not be able to sue for anything spent on repairs. The returned soldier does not stand to lose anything by the amendment; in certain circumstances, he may gain something. Obviously, if a home were not repaired, it is practically certain that no sale would be effected, consequently there would be no equity for the soldier. On the other hand, if a certain amount were expended to make a property more saleable, the soldier could not be debited with more than the amount of his equity in it. Actually there there might be a balance over and above the amount owing to the commission, and this would be paid to him.

I would, however, point out that the amendment should have been moved at an earlier stage. These proposed new subsections deal with the situation that has arisen after the Commissioner has entered upon and taken possession of any land or dwelling house, so no good purpose can be effected by persisting with the amendment. The soldier, having vacated his home, the Commissioner has determined to effect certain repairs with the object of finding a buyer for it. If there is any equity belonging to the soldier after all expenses have been met, he will be entitled to receive it. I am not satisfied that the soldier, at this stage, is entirely freed of all liability. I incline still to the view that he has not rid himself of obligations which he entered into when he made the contract for the purchase of a home. I gather from the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) that even if a returned soldier is forced, through unemployment, to vacate his home, he will still be liable for the cost of repairs carried out by the Commissioner. It is true that such, repairs may be necessary to ensure a sale at a better price, but under present conditions, the disposal of a war service home might not be an easy matter. The desire of the honourable member for Hunter is to safeguard the interests of a returned soldier who, after vacating a war service home, is in occupation of another property. ber's view, I take it, is that if a returned dealt with sympathetically. If , however, soldier's income is merely sufficient to pay the rent and provide the bare necessaries of life, it should not be in the power of the Commissioner to harass him. purpose of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr with him until justice is done, and I feel James) is to protect a returned soldier from being sued for the cost of repairs up to £40 in the event of his not being in reasonable employment and having no equity in the property. four or five returned soldiers are being for payment. sued for arrears of payments although they have been ejected from their homes. in the act to sue a returned soldier for the arrears of his instalments. But in this case, so far as I can gather-the Minister, I hope, will either affirm or contradict me-the Government is not seeking power to sue a returned soldier for the cost of any repairs effected to a home unless the soldier has an equity in the property and a sale is effected. Thus, if a property were repaired at the cost of £40, and were sold at such a price as to show a loss, there would be no claim against the returned soldier for the cost of repairs. The Commissioner would be obliged to shoulder the whole of it. I can see no hope of being able to pass a law to define what is meant by ""reasonable employment."" A man may have no employment at all, and yet be in enjoyment of a fairly good income. Again, what may be regarded by one person as reasonable employment might not be so regarded by another. We must not forget that this clause relates to repairs made to properties which have reverted to the Commissioner. Any provision to define the term ""reasonable employment"" should have been inserted in an earlier section of the act. In any case, I think we must depend upon the administration to do the fair thing hy returned soldiers, and in this respect we can only judge by experience, and by the policy of governments. Usually, instructions have been given to the Commissioner to take the lenient view. We must rely upon the administration's sense of justice, and, I think, all will admit that The honourable memhitherto every case of hardship has been any honourable member can cite cases of hardship due to unemployment of returned soldiers, which have not received sympathetic consideration, either during the administration of my government, or any other administration, we shall fight sure that we shall command the unanimous support of all honourable members. at the cost of £40, and is not sold for twelve months, the Commissioner may",49,Francis

At no think that the Minister has confused the time in the history of the commission clause by his explanation. It seems to has it sued separately for the cost of me that the contract between the War repairs. Where a mortgage has been Service Homes Commission and the home executed, and the purchaser is in arrears and leaves his home, either voluntarily or by ejectment, the property is repaired and sold. If it should be sold at a profit the borrower has an equity which goes to him. If , however, a loss is sustained the commission foots the bill. The position is different when there is a contract for sale. The power to call upon the soldier for the cost of the repairs exists, but in no instance will the commission pursue any soldier whose circumstances prevent him from meeting his obligations. In no instance is it done. This provision exists in all the housing legislation of the States. definitely that if the soldier has no equity meeting the cost of these repairs? as a mortgage is concerned. I appreciate the motive that has actuated the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) in moving his amendment, but it would be impracticable to administer it. The principle upon which the amendment is based is observed by the department wherever practicable; but it is impossible to embody it in any statute. It would be impossible to give a correct interpretation of any provision covering it.

When he made application to the migration authorities he was earning £4 a week. Evil times overtook him, and his average net weekly wage for fourteen weeks has been £1 7s. lOd. On that he has to maintain .himself, his wife, and two children. When he applied to the commission for relief he was told that because he was in regular employment he is expected to live up to his obligations as far as he can; the commission is not prepared to cancel his contract. The dangerous nature of this clause is indicated by the proposal of the honourable memthe expenditure on repairs to £40. The Minister stated that the department will charge repairs only against the soldier's equity in the house, but the bill does not purchaser. I approve of the clause. The soldier has a liability in respect of his home, and if he were vacating it he would probably prefer to have his equity protected by the expenditure of £40 on repairs rather than risk the sale of the property in a state of disrepair. A mistake will be made if any limit is specified because the department will probably spend up to that amount. I suggest to the committee that the interest of the soldier is protected when his house is put in a state of repair so that it will be more likely to be sold at a price which will enable him to get a return of his equity. not l i ft the soldier's liability, for if he is unable to pay his instalments he certainly will not be able to pay the cost of repairs. well. repairs will be a charge against hi3 equity.

I am pleased that the Government has decided to call a conference, and I hope that the committee to be appointed will go into the several matters which have been mentioned to-day as well as the rate of interest. Minister said that the interest rate had been definitely fixed because the money had been borrowed abroad. It is little satisfaction to the occupant of a war service home to know that his interest cannot be reduced because the money was borrowed overseas. I do not suppose that one occupant of these homes inquired where the money came from.

I admit that the amendment needs to be re-drafted before it could be embodied in the measure. A request is being made by those concerned that there should be a general writing down of these properties. 1 said, when Prime Minister, and 1 repeat it now, that this is not a time for a general re-valuation or writing down of war service homes. We should wait until values regain stability before taking that action. In the meantime the best that can be done is to administer this department in a humane and lenient way. One particular type of case needs special consideration. Assume that a returned soldier purchases u war service home, say, for £900, and that he improves the proper:y by adding rooms at a cost of £300. He finds later that he cannot continue his payments, ancl abandons the home. The commission re-possesses itself of the home, and because of a drop in values sells it for £900, that figure being obtained only because of the improvements effected by the late occupant. obtains the amount that it originally put into the property, while the late occupant loses, in addition to other moneys, the £300 expended in improvements. Tbe purpose of tbe amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter was to give such a purchaser at least some return for the improvements effected by him. I suggest that the matter should receive consideration before the bill is submitted to another place. It was in order to focus attention upon the desirability of action along those lines that I and members of my party voted for the amendment.

I think an explanation is also due by me. As a rule, I do not find myself in accord with honourable members who belong, as they themselves assert, to the real Labour party. I stated a case to the committee, which was almost identical with that cited by the Leader of the Opposition, and asked the Minister in charge of the bill to give a ruling about an amendment that I contemplated. My amendment was ruled out of order, but, having spoken in favour of the principle, I voted for the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Lfunter( Mr James), as I do not believe in walking out of tbe House to avoid registering my opinion, even when I am the only honourable member on this side of the House who holds such a view.

Between now and the time when the bill reaches another place, I will give my attention to the matter nnd see what can be done about it. I raised the objection that the amendment con Id not be added to a clause which dealt with granting power to let a. war service home. On that issue I was ruled out of order by the Chairman. I also contend that the procedure adopted with regard to the amendment was an unsatisfactory one, as if similar methods wore generally adopted, a bill entirely different from, that intended by the Government would be evolved in committee. I do not think that any general rule could be adopted to compensate the occupants of war service homes for any improvements that they have effected. In one case the addition might be of value, in another it might detract from the worth of the home. I am quite certain that if a good case was made out, very favorable consideration would be given to it. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) also suggested that tbe present was not an opportune time to undertake a general revaluation of war service homes or a writing down of values. The intention of the Government is that the committee of inquiry which has been appointed shall submit recommendations that will enable the Government to formulate a plan covering a period not exceeding five years, so that the opportunity may be afforded to span over the difficult conditions through which we are passing. If the committee can lay down the outline of such a plan, I am confident that many of tbe anxieties of honourable members will be brushed aside, and that an excellent scheme will be evolved in the interest of the occupants of war service homes.
