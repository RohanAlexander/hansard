There are many thousands who are keenly interested in this matter.

I am not wedded to the system of the 'past. Indeed, I think that it needs alteration in many ways.

They will give further consideration to it . The interval between this and the next sitting day 'will afford them another opportunity of so doing. I was glad to hear the honourable member admit that the system, as it has been administered in Victoria in relation to vignerons' licences, requires alteration, and is altogether too lax.' I consider that it will be very difficult to justify the extension of such a system to all the States. However, the Government are desirous of doing whateveris fair to the vignerons and just to the revenue. But the unnecessary multiplication of opportunities for defrauding the revenue cannot be justified. However, the best attention will be given to the interests both of the revenue and of the producer, and I hope to be able to arrange something which will be satisfactory to both. Progress reported. Debate resumed (from 1st August, vide That the Bill be now read a second time. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I moved the adjournment of tlie .debate on the second reading of this Bill some time ago, not with a view of originating on the present occasion any prolonged discussion, because it appears to me that most of the details and principles of the measure are pretty well accepted, and that it is chiefly a matter for consideration in committee. I welcome this B ill as likely to give tlie people of the Commonwealth, one of the first practical fruits of AusThis is a Federal tralian federation, inasmuch as it will largely assist in giving us a unified judicial systema unified system for the purpose of service of civil and criminal processes throughout the States, and for the execution of judgments as well as the execution of other various processes known to the law. Hitherto a great enforcement, *of judgments and of legal proceedings Inter-State. Great technical difficulties have been experienced, and, to a large extent, we have had to rely upon I m perial legislation, especially in regard to the execution of criminal processes. Under this Bill, however, facilities will be given, not only for the recognition of, but for the enforcementof, judgmentsInter-State. ThisBill might have been drawn upon different lines,, and it might have provided that judgments should be executed Inter-State without the intervention of what is known as registration or the backing of warrants. It mighthaveprovided that a warrant issued, say, in Victoria, for the apprehension of a criminal should be enforceable in any part of the Commonwealth, without the intervention of or backing by a magistrate in the State where it is proposed that the warrant shall be executed. However, the backing process has been engrafted upon this Bill. Probablyi t was derived from the Fugitive Offenders Act, but certainly the process could have been made much simpler. There was no absolute necessity for retaining the backing process. A warrant might have been executed without the intervention of any local fiat. I do not say .that the intervention of the backing process is objectionable, but the . Bill would have been much sirnjder without that",15,Officers Op Permanen T Defence Forces

16,Page 3441) On Motion By Mr Barton,"process. I do not see what danger is to be apprehended from such a simplification. There is no danger of spurious warrants being issued by a magistrate. It could be provided that a warrant issued under the seal of one court should be enforceable throughout the Commonwealth without the necessity of its being sanctioned or authorized by the signature of a justice or Judgei n the State where it is to be enforced. I am merely pointing out a method of procedure which might be adopted in time to come in the direction of simplification. In the same way under this Bill, before a judgment of tlie court which gives such judgment can be enforced in an adjoining State, ib must be registered in that adjoining State on the same principle as the backing. But the process could have been much simpler by providing for its direct enforcement instead of for securing the intervention of local registration. There is no necessity for retaining the old process of registration. Under the old system, when there was reciprocity between the courts to secure tlie execution of judgments, it was necessary that there should be registration, and that there should be secured the intervention and sanction of the local court in which the judgment of a court in another State was to be enforced. Under the provisions of our Constitution, there is no necessity for the backing of warrants before execution, or for the registration of judgments before execution. I am simply directing attention to the powers which might have been exercised in this Billi n the direction of simplification and uniformity. W it h reference to the powers taken for the execution of warrants under clause 16, it has occurred to me that there is a rather serious deficiency. In other words, ib does not meet a very important class of cases which it is desirable should be met, which it is intended should be met, and which the draftsman no doubt thought was met. Sub-clause (a) of clause 16 provides for the apprehension of any personWho is charged with any offence alleged to have been committed within such State or part, whether such offence is indictable or punishable upon summary conviction. Provision is made for two cases-for the issue of a warrant in the one case, and for its execution in another. It has occurred to me that sub-clauses («) and (b) do not make provision for the arrest of absconding fathers and husbands. That is a very 13 F 2 important class of case. In Victoria, one of the grievances under which we have been labouring for many years is that a man may desert his wife and family, fly to Western Australia, Queensland, or some other part of Australia, and there is no provision for his apprehension under the Fugitive Offenders Act. A great deal of difficulty has been occasioned in dealing with that class of offender. railway fares. Sir JOHN QUICK In New South Wales and other StatesI believe provision is made to bring wife and child deserters within reach of the criminal law by making the offence a misdemeanour. A warrant may be issued for the arrest of a deserting father or husband, but the offence is not punishable by summary jurisdiction as a misdemeanour. Sub-clause (ft) deals with the case of a person who is charged wibh an offence alleged to have been committed. There may be a wrong for which a warrant may be issued in Victoria, but it is not an offence punishable by summary jurisdiction, nor is it a misdemeanour under which a warrant may be issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act. I propose an addition to the sub-clause which will provide for the. apprehension of any person charged with deserting, or leaving without means of support, his wife or children. The Bill as it stands will, of course, apply to a State like New South Wales, where this is an offence punishable by imprisonment as a misdemeanour, but it will not be applicable in Victoria. effect before the Victorian Legislature ? Sir JOHN QUICK I am not sure, but, at any rate, I think it is desirable to have the amendment I suggesb. There is anobher matter which I am not sure is prbvided for by the Bill, namely, the service of civil writs and civil processes on corporations in a State outside the jurisdiction of the court which issues bhe process. I am aware that it is believed that the Acts Inberprebation Act provides for the extension of the principles of this Bill to corporations, but I am not sure that this is suflicient. By clause 10 ib will be noticed that in order bo make service effective it must appear to the court or Judge that the writ was j>ersonally served on the defendant, or it must also appear thab reasonable efforts were made to effect",16,Servi Ce Andexecution Of Process Bill

On the whole, the B ill is a very important and useful one, and, subject to certain improvements and alterations, some of which have been suggested by the Minister himself, and some to which I intend to direct attention, I think it will be found a very practical measure. know that I should have spoken on the second reading had it not been for the points raised by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo as to Inter-State backing of warrants and registration of judgments. He has suggested that the formality proposed by the Bill is undesirable or unnecessary. I would like to submit that although there may be objections capable of being urged to the provision, and that it may add to a certain extent to the elaborateness of the process, the formality is nevertheless desirable. We must recollect that under the Bill a process of any kind, whether it be the initial or final process, may be issued in Victoria and executed in the remotest parts of the Commonwealth. It is quite conceivable that injustice can be done even under the provisions of the B ill as it stands, but that is a risk that has to be taken in view of the great and undoubted advantages which are to be gained. It is desirable, as far as we can do so, without overnot be an absence of any reasonable preloading the Bill with precautions, to minimize any risks; and the backing of a warrant and the registration of a judgment in the Statei n which it is proposed to enforce the judgment or execute the warrant, does to a certain extent-to my mind, to a considerable extent-preven t the possible abuse of the relief afforded by .the Bill. I have no doubt that such were the considerations present to the mind of the framers of the Acts on which this Bill is largely founded, and were the considerations present to the minds of those who framed and determined the policy of this particular Bill. Without provision for Inter-State backing and registration I see risks', difficulties, and In Victoriai t has dangers, which to a large extent are obviated by the proposals of the Bill. ' I am aware that the honourable and learned member merely draws attention to this matter ; but I would suggest to him that it would not be desirable to lessen the protection afforded by these precautions to those who might otherwise be wrongfully harassed by improper processes. The only other matter to which I wish to call attention is one which has already been referred to by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. It seems to me that cases in which warrants are issued, not because of the alleged commission of criminal offences, but are, or may be, issued, so to speak, as security for tlie appearance of the defendant i i i quasi-criminal matters, such as wife desertion, are not covered by clause 10. These are the cases in which men skip over the border, and in which most frequently the existing state of affairs has been noticed. These are not purely civil matters, nor are they purely criminal matters, but offences for which men can be arrested and held to bail because they are called upon to answer quasi-criminal charges. Most honourable members know perfectly well the difficulty which has been experienced in the past with regard to wife and children deserters, and it would be very undesirable if, after passing the B i ll into law, we were to find any reasonable doubt cast on the efficacy of the measure. I join in urging on the Attorney General the desirability of making sure that this Bill will cover tlie very cases which it is desired shall be covered. It would be of great advantage to the States to have some such measure as this, but, on the other hand, it is desirable that there should cautions to prevent tlie abuse of what otherwise will be a very useful measure.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I should like to have the meaning of the word ""suit"" made clear beyond all doubt. Is the word intended to cover proceedings in all courts, such as courts of petty sessions, county courts, courts of mines, wardens' courts, and so on ? A doubt has been suggested to me whether ""suit"" is sufficiently wide to cover the proceedings in all the courts I have mentioned. ral) -The words are intended to embrace all possible proceedings in all the courts the honourable and learned member has mentioned. The word ""action"" covers all proceedings at common law, and "" suit"" those in the equitable jurisdiction; and the words "" original proceeding "" will relate to all other matters. proceedings in a court of petty sessions 1 those are original proceedings. object of definition (d) is to provide that legal proceedings in a court of a State shall include proceedings in the Vice-Admiralty courts, processes in regard to which may be served in tlie manner directed by this Bill. The question is whether we have jurisdiction to deal with the practice and procedure of Vice-Admiralty courts. These are Imperial courts founded on Imperial law, and according to Webb, in his Imperial Law, page 68, it is not competent for the local Legislature to deal either with the practice or procedure of the Vice-Admiralty courts. If it is not competent for us to deal with the practice and procedure in such courts, it may be worth considering whether this definition' ought not to be struck out. My impression, as a result not only of my own consideration, bub of Vice-Admiralty courts are not within the jurisdiction of this Parliament. thab Vice-Admiralty courts are within our jurisdiction, but it . is anobher question whether those courts having exercised their jurisdiction, we cannot provide as to the service and execution of their processes. But the matter may be open to some doubt, and since atbention has been called to it , I will reconsider the point before finally disposing of the Bill. While fully recognising that we cannot control the jurisdiction of Vice-Admiralty courts, the honourable and learned member might consider the question from this aspect. We are not altering its jurisdiction; we are giving effect to ib, enabling it to operate over a larger area. Albhough, no doubt, on ' the border line, it may be fairly contended that it can be included within "" court of a State."" to ask the Attorney-General why the interpretation of "" court of a State"" is limited to the Vice-Admiralty courts of only two States? two Statesi n which the court exists; at least, I think so.

I wish to ask the Attorney-General, however, whether the represenbations made by the legal committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce in regard to this B ill have been considered. They object to a stipendiary magistrate or justice of the peace having the power to issue a summons which requires a defendant to proceed from one Sbabe to another. They prefer that bhat power should be limited to the Supreme Court and disbricb courts of each State.",18,Servi Ce Andexecution Of Process Bill

If the honourable member had been present some little time ago he would have heard the measure challenged from exactly the opposite stand-point by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. In view of the representations that have been made in this regard, it is proposed in this B ill that the service of process shall not be, as it might have been made, absolutely unified throughout the whole of Australia, so that the action of a single justice of the peace in Victoria could affect a man in a most remote portion of the continent. We here require as a safeguard, to meet cases which the honourable member and the Sydney Chamber of Commerce have in mind, that the process shall be backed in the Statei n which it is sought to be exercised. We have provided that additional check so as to give a feeling of security to those who have apprehen, sions that this power placed in the control of the unpaid justices of the peace might possibly be abused. We have retained that guarantee which has already existed and has been found to afford sufficient protection. The matter was considered, and it was believed that it would curtail the operation of this Bil l and limit its advantages to an indefensible degree if we were to confine its operation only to the higher courts referred to. great deal is to be said for the B ill in regard to opportunities which it gives for the prosecution of legitimate suits. But there are also some dangers of misuse of the extended powers in the facilities which these give for bogus suits, the object of which is to black-mail the defendant. The Attorney-General has provided a partial remedy in his proposed new clause to follow clause 9, by giving the defendant liberty to apply for security for costs. It is very desirable that such a provision should be made, because cases may occur in which a man living in a remote part of tlie country would rather pay, although he had a good defence, than travel a long distance, and run the risk of losing both the suit and expenses. I know such cases have occurred in the States. The sum involved in travelling to a court may be about equal to the amount claimed, and rather than run the risk of losing the suit as well as having to pay his travelling expenses, a defendant The representations submits to an injustice. I do not know whether the Attorney-General's amendment giving the defendant liberty to apply for security for costs would apply to the smaller courts; if not, it should, be extended to them. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -As to the terms ""plaintiff"" and "" defendant,""no doubt it is intended, under the Interpretation Act, that they should cover "" corporations,"" but when we come to clause 10 I shall ask the Attorney-General to make a verbal alteration there in order to make the matter clear.

It seems to me to be an unusual expression to apply to a police court summons.

A j i y lawyer or layman who first reads the interpretation clause, and then clause 4, will at once have his attention directed rather to higher courts than lower courts. The prima facie impression most certainly is that the clause refers only to higher courts. The whole scheme of the B ill turns our attention to higher courts, and not to those of petty jurisdiction, and even a closer perusal of it does not shake tbe first impression. However, the Attorney-General has promised to look into the matter, and I do think that more apt language could be secured to express what is desired. power to give to courts of summary jurisdiction, and in. a case before the Supreme Court there might be an unconscious inclination to see the clangers rather than the benefits of applying these provisions to the inferior courts. Consequently the Act might be interpreted by the Supreme Court in a way in which this committee would not desire. Clause agreed to. Clause5 (Indorsement on writ for service outside State). service of a writ summons may be made under clause 4Iu the same manner as if the writ were served on the defendant in the State or part of the Commonwealth in which the writ was issued. I would point out that in Tasmania summonses for some of the smaller petty courts may be served merely by leaving them at the residence of the An ""original prodefendant. Personal service is not required. The provision I have quoted from clause 4 seems to govern what we are coming to in clause 5; that is to say, that in regard to the rule as to service, we must A "" writ of sumlook to the practice of the State. Therefore, if in the case of a small local court, service of a proceeding may be effected by leaving the writ at the residence of the defendant, as in Tasmania, personal service in some cases will not be necessary.

I know that tliere are provisions in clause 10 as to non-appearance. Mi-. DEAKIN If the defendant appears he is not h u r t ; but if he does not appear he is protected. * MrM c C AY (Corinella) I should like to ask whether under clause 5, when' a summons is issued out of a court of petty sessions, the defendant is to be compelled to enter an appearance, although he is not required to do so in an ordinary case coming before courts of petty sessions. Supposing he does not enter an appearance and give an address, will he be injured, It is an immense extension of even if he actually does appear on the hearing of the summons ? It appears to me that this clause contemplates the necessity for an appearance. Of course it is another phase of the question as to what sort of courts the BUI applies to. Clause5 provides that the endorsement on the writ for service must contain a statement to the effect, that "" your appearance to this summons must give an address."" It does not distinctly say that a person must enter an appearance, but it is to be strongly inferred that it must be done. We do not want persons to be compelled to enter an appearance in courts in respect of which that requirement does not now exist.

43,Mr Piesse,"I only want the Attorneyclause requiring an appearance to be entered, supports the view that this procedure applies to superior courts only. It would be absurd to talk of an appearance being entered in a court of petty sessions. appearance is required, except in a special class of action. I should be very glad if the Attorney-General would consider and clear up this matter. It would be very unfortunate, if, after attention had been called to this matter here, the Bill should be limited to only half the courts to which we desire it to apply. raised by the honourable and learned member for Corinella will need some consideration, although I doubt if this is the place to deal with it . As I understand, the honourable and learned member's point is that in all cases in which an appearance is not now necessary within the State, it should not be necessaiy beyond tlie State-that is to say, the formal appearance. As long as the defendant is therd when the case is called on, that should be sufficient to meet the ends of justice. I think tliere is something in that, and that perhaps clause 10 will be tlie proper place in which to make the provision. I have made a note of the suggestion because, as this is a technical measure, I prefer to consider the matter quietly, rather than to attempt amendments off-hand. Clause agreed to. Clause 6If a writ of summons or copy thereof does not bear all the indorsements hereby required, it shall be void. That the word ""void"" at the end of the clause be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""ineffective for service under this Act."" This expression is more precise, and may possibly obviate disputes. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I think the proposed amendment is a very proper one, but I should like to suggest the addition of the words ""unless the court or Judge otherwise orders."" There may be special cases in which the requirements of Clause5 have been inadvertently omitted, and it may not be desirable that the service should be absolutely ineffective. Therefore I propose that the court or Judgei n special cases should have the power to dispense with this formal requirement. believe these words were originally in the Bill, but were struck out in another place. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I feel that the powers given under this B i ll are so large that we should consider the very real Eveni n the county court no dangers that would arise from their unrestricted use and not do away with any precautions that are not absolute clogs. the theoretical completeness at which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo aims, but in view of all the circumstances I have been led to adopt the clause in its present form. The endorsement upon a writ I think the point of summons may be necessary to a man who is in a remote place, who may have forgotten the circumstances, or who may be without legal advice. If the appearance is left entirely optional and under the thumbof a court of petty sessions, that court might strike out what in tlie minds of better-informed men might be considered a very essential condition. I do not think we ought to take such a step as that suggested by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo until we have had some experience of the working of this measure. As the country becomes more settled, and legal processes become easy of administration, no doubt advances will be made. I would hesitate to take such a step as that now indicated, at the present time. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause7 (Concurrent writs may be issued). MrM c C AY (Corinella) I would like to suggest what may possibly happen under I m o v e this clause. A is suing B in a court of petty sessions. A knows tliat B is out of a State, and he issues a summons for foreign service and a concurrent summons for local service, the latter being served at the last known place of abode of the defendant. A also endeavours to serve the foreign summons. If the defendant does not turn up, A says nothing about the foreign summons, but proceeds on the domestic summons, keeping to himself what he may regard as the unnecessary information that B is out of the jurisdiction of the Court. If a plaintiff is to have the right to issue a summons for foreign service or domestic service, he should have his choice only.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -Every one must feel obliged to the honourable and learned member for having brought this matter forward. Buti f the parties to a contract are in Sydney, and the breach takes place in ""Western Australia, they are more likely to bring their action in Sydney than in Western Australia. If a man ships goods from Sydney to Perth, the consignee being in Perth, he will naturally desire to bring his action in the place where he resides, and it would' be unfair to compel him to journey to the place where the goods were shipped. It is only just that he shall have the option of bringing his action in the State where he may he resident. I think that the advantage to the consignee would .be greater than it would be to the shipowner under tlie circumstances. that the Attorney-General will not make any alteration in the clause. From my experience as a magistrate I know that many cases have been dealt with in Western Australia which it would have been impossible to deal with in a fair spirit if it had been necessary for them to be determined at the port of shipment. Of course, the case mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is an isolated one. It is very seldom that a case will arise in the northern territory or in the north-west part of Western Australia. The principal cases will arise at Fremantle, which is the shipping port. I hope that the Attorney General will not make any alteration in the clause. that paragraph ( / ) should be omitted. I am aware that the Federal Parliament have power to legislate upon matrimonial matters, and I think that this subject would be more properly dealt with under another Bill. The contract would be jurisdictions. We only give them a wider sphere of operation. „We do not wish to alter their jurisdiction in any way. I would not propose any legislation which would affect the divorce laws of any State. In this case, liowever, we are simply giving a wider area. A doubt suggests itself to me as to whether by the ""principal officer"" the honourable and learned member for Bendigo means the principal officer in the State or the Commonwealth, as the case may be. is in another State in which the service is to be effected, the service would be on him in that State. the same question arises. As I think the honourable and learned member has pointed to an obscurity which it is desirable to clear .up, the best way is to accept the words proposed by him and then to alter them afterwards. if paragraph (e) will not, in many cases, have a retrospective effect.

As this is a service and execution of process Bill, if the liability arose prior to its passing and the writ was not issued until after it had been passed, serious difficulties might arise through the parties being in different States. and make sure of the clause before I allow it to go through. direct attention to paragraph ( f ) .

How can a judgment obtained in one State have the same force as if the writ had been served on the defendant in the State or part of the Commonwealth in which the writ was issued ? Yet the plaint if f is to be compelled to register his judgment in the Statei n which the defendant was served. we are dealing here with two distinct matters. The first relates to the service and execution of the civil process. It simply provides that when one has taken advantage of the liberties conferred by this Bill, and has obtained a judgment, that judgment shall be as good as if it had been got within a State. When we come to clause 18, we shall be dealing with a new par,t of the B ill altogether, and with a new set of difficulties. The honourable and learned member must see that the clauses relate to two different sets of cases. Clause agreed to. Clause 13and place mentioned in such summons, all such proceedings may be taken as if the summons had been served in the State or part of the Commonwealth in which it was issued. tainly like the committee to understand the meaning of this clause. It really means that a justice of the peace can issue a process for any part of Australia, and that the defendant will have to appear before the court. Seeing that we are now giving powers to justices of the peace to order imprisonment up to a term of two years, and to fine up to .£100, it means that a man who does not appear before a justice can be forced to appear under the ordinary warrant which a justice can enforce. Upon the non-appearance of a defendant, a justice can now issue his warrant to any part of Australia to compel him to attend. That may be right ; but I would point out that the defendant may I will take that pointinto have a very good defence, and not possess the necessary means to enable him to attend. There is no provision here by which tlie defendant is provided with the means to attend. A Victorian justice of the peace can force a defendant to appear here, and in the event of his nonappearance can either issue a warrant, or go on with the case in his absence. If an innocent man is alleged to have committed an offence in Victoria, for which he has not been prosecuted, and he is in the Northern Territory, another man, possibly actuated by spite, may, by paying half-acrown, force the alleged offender to come back, or, if the justices choose, have him -tried in his absence and possibly sent to gaol for two years, or fined £100.

If a albhough the first part of bhe clause gives i party is prepared to pay for a witness' the power to serve a subpcena or summons, I attendance, it proves, especially if that it is only when we come to the power of compulsion that there can be any dispube. That provision . is contained in subclause (2), and there we require proof that a reasonable sum was tendered to the witness for expenses. Of course, in a sense ib is a hardship for any man bo be called upon to leave his business to attend and give evidence at a court even if it is in his own town, but in the inberests of justice it is absolubely necessary thab we should all be liable bo that service, and it is a generally admitted principle that provided our expenses are paid we have to make the necessary sacrifice. tices this power in a matter punishable by summary jurisdiction? to be brought from another State his expenses will be heavy. The only practical proof, I think, which we can ever obtain as ness of the parby calling him to pay for his attendance. The greater the distance the greater the penalty. If honourable members, as they have a right to do, put the most extreme cases, and speak of residents of Perbh or Porb Darwin being brought over here as witnesses, then they have to realize that those who call those witnesses have to be prepared to pay their expenses. That would be a very serious matter indeed in -. such cases. Consequently, witnesses are -never likely to be brought such long distances in small or trifling cases, unless their attendance is absolutely indispensable. the court in the second stage, might it not be well to make the same provision in the evidence.

That is the extent of the fine for which a man may be made liable under the Victorian JusticesA ct for non-attendance as a witness. not think that such grave responsibilities as those proposed under the clause should be placed in the hands of a layman such as a justice of the peace. We know that very often mistakes in the issue of an ordinary warrant involve great expense, and a justice of the peace should not be empowered to summon a witness from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. balance of opinion is against the clause as it tion of justice by restricting these powers stands, although I look forward with apprehension to the task of expressing in so many words any limitation upon this power that could be defended. I believe that in China, when a street accident or disturbance takes place, the rapidity with which every one in the locality disappears is most remarkable. back upon the scene of the fray and departs as quickly as he can so that he may not be called as a witness. In China no consideration is shown to witnesses, who are brought up and detained as long as may be thought necessary in the interests of justice, State to another part of the same State, the and are tortured if they do not give the evidence that is expected of them. I could understand resistance being offered to these powers under the Chinese law, but under our own law the interests of the citizen in the proper administration of justice are supposed to be so great that all men are called upon to make sacrifices if necessary in order to give testimony in the courts. We all know, for instance, thab if the honourable and learned member for Indi were the witness of an accident, he would be liable to be called upon to appear, and would have to sacrifice all his briefs for the day in order that he might give his evidence; and any expenses that might be tendered to him would not be more than a fraction of the loss he had incurred. No attempt has ever been made in connection with our judicial procedure to remunerate persons for the losses they have incurred in the discharge of such a public duty as that of giving evidence. While a case may not involve a veiy large sum of money, the issue may be a vital tion, and the circumstances may be such as to render it absolubeiy indispensable that he should obtain all the evidence possible in order to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the community. If it is to be required that a Judge in a distant part of the continent shall say whether a certain man's evidence is necessary or not, it seems to me that we shall be rendering .the ordinary practical processes for securing evidence unnecessarily difficult and complex. However, as tlie feeling of the committee seems to be in favour of a reconsideration of the clause, with a view to having some restrictions placed upon tlie power to call witnesses, I will endeavour to see how far their wishes can be met. A t the same time, I think that It is evident tliat the we shall lend ourselves less to the administrain the way suggested than if we rely upon the practical safeguard of the cost attending the summoning of witnesses from distant parts. is another aspect of this clause which I ' think it would be well for the AttorneyEvery one turns his General to consider. There is no doubt that lying at the root of all these clauses tliere is a difficulty that we are apt to lose sight of. We are inclined to suppose that because the law hitherto has provided that a man may be called from one part of a same argument* can be extended to tlie whole of the Commonwealth; but we have to remember that to call a man from one extreme of the Commonwealth to the other, for perhaps a most trivial purpose, is a very serious matter. A man resident in Adelaide might for business purposes visit the Gulf of Carpentaria, and he might be called upon by summons to travel back the the length the continent and give evidence in connection with some trivial matter. It might be in connection with .police court proceedings or a civil matter. The arguments that might apply very well in the case of an individual State do not extend with equal force to the whole continent, as the whole circumstances are altered.

I would suggest that the Bil l be postponed until we have a larger number of those honourable members present who take an interest in it .

We should like to have a f u l l committee to vote on many of the contentious clauses, and the Government might proceed with the Postal Bill, which is of a more peaceful character, and take this measure next week. If my memory serves me correctly, we were led to believe last night that only the Distillation BiU, and the Service and Execution of Process Bill would be taken to-day. Those measures have been allowed to pass through quietly, and I think the Defence Bill ought not to be brought on this afternoon. to emphasize that which the honourable member for Dalley has said, and to point out that quite early in the Bill an important question will come up for consideration in an amendment which I have circulated, and which if carried would have tlie effect of rendering necessary a substantial alteration of the Bill.

We were told that the Postal Bill would be proceeded with until completed, and I think this Bill can be very well dealt with, if there be time, either after we have disposed of the Postal Bill and sent the Tariff on to another place, or on some other equally convenient occasion.

I hope that a Bill of this importance will not be dealt with in a thin House. There is no doubt that there will be a very great amount of discussion upon several of the clauses of this measure-discussio n which will operate at the very root of the Bill itself, and tend to change the whole of its character. the Bill introduced will not be by any means tlie Bill that will pass the committee. For economy of time and labour, I would suggest that we should take some other measure for the two hours or so that we now have at our disposal this afternoon. As the honourable member for West Sydney has suggested, after we have got through the Tariff, or at any time when opportunity offers, we may deal with this Bill. slightest idea of helping my honourable friend from Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, to bring on any of his motions, the only effect of which would be to shorten our labours this afternoon, and cause many of us to leave at an early hour. the Government can at least expect from the committee a readiness to proceed with work this afternoon. Last night, however, we were told that the Postal Bill, the Distillation Bill, and the Service and Execution of Process Bill would be taken to-day. It seems that the Government are not ready to go on with the Postal Bill, but it is hardly fair to those honourable members who for some weeks past have been circulating amendments on the Defence Bill, and who are not here to-day, because they were not aware that the Bill was coming on, that we should proceed with its consideration now. Special reference might be made to the amendment which has been circulated by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and which lies at the root of the whole Bill. Without the presence of the honourable and learned member, it could not receive that attention which it would otherwise gain. In the circumstances we might very well allow this measure to stand over. might well call on the Minister for Defence to pospone this Bill. The very first clause provides that this Act shall be constituted as the Defence Act. Many of us hold that this is an. aggressive measure, aud there is bound to be a very large amount of discussion on that point: Mi-. PAGE ""(Maranoa) -This is a most peculiar proceeding.

The Distillation Bill was dealt with, and so was the Service and Execution of Process Bill.

We intimabed lasb night that if by any chance the Service and Execubion of Process Bill did not occupy the whole of the time, we would proceed with the Immigration Restriction Bil l if honourable members were ready. That was the next order of the day. We found, however, that honourable members were not prepared to go on with that measure, and it was for tlieir sake that we postponed its consideration. Honourable members will thus see that we have taken the next Bill on the notice paper, and cannot complain that they had no warning as bo what was to be done. Then when the House requested the Minisber for Defence to s&t aside the Defence Bill, and abruptly required him to discontinue his remarks, we find ourselves reproached for once more conveniencing them. shown that we have strictly adhered to the business paper, I propose thab we shall now occupy bhe time remaining to us and occupy it profitably. On two occasions we have had to ask the honourable member for Grampians to sacrifice his right to speak upon the motion relating to the establishment of a national department of agriculture. W it h the permission of the House, and the kind concurrence of the members who have prior business on the paper, I propose to posbpone the intervening business, and to allow that motion to be brought forward thisafbernoon.

188,Mr T. Skene (Grampians),"I willhave taken to-day, because next week is our great agricultural week in Melbourne, when all the agricultural societies in this State will probably be represented at our annual show, and I wished to have my remarks upon this subject in print before that gathering took place. 1 am specially indebted to the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, for giving. me # precedence oh this occasion, and to other honourable members who followed his example. Indeed, I am indebted to the whole House for the opportunity which has been afforded me of speaking upon this question. 1 think it will be conceded on all sides that any movement having for its object the advancement of agriculture within the Commonwealth is entitled to earnest consideration. Our unkindest critic, I am sure, cannot say that. All my life T have been identified with rural pursuits, and representing, as I do, large agricultural and viticultural interests, I am naturally in deep sympathy with this motion, in so far as it can be given practical effect to. But I confess that I do not think all that is implied in it is practicable at the present time. To establish such a department of agriculture as fcbey have in the United; States of America is impossible in this small community. It would be very much like the man with a few hundred pounds a year attemptingtt>live up to one with as many thousands. on the threshold of the consideration of this subject with two facts. The first is, that the States already have departments of their own. The second is, that they have need of them apart from any common.interests they may have in any legislation which the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to enact in regard to agriculture. The last two Governments of Victoria have endeavoured to facilitate the system of closer settlement on the lands of the State by the purchase and subdivision of large estates. Now, if there is any vital interest which can be served by technical education it is that of enabling people to live on a small area of land. I am referring, of course, to those people who cultivate the earth for a livelihood, and not merely for an investment. That is one of the matters which will have to come within the purview of the State Parliaments. This matter of closer settlement touches upon one of the most vital questions with which we shall have to deal in the futurenamely, the tendency of the people to leavethe country and cling to tlie towns. If has been said that the United States of America did without a department for 75years. But there is no analogy between the two cases. A.n unwholesome distribution of the population was not one of thetroubles of the United States at the time of the inauguration of their Constitution.. When President Washington was installed in the President's chair in 1790, of the whole population of America-the n some4,000,0003 per cent, only lived in the towns. The remaining 97 per cent, resided in the rural districts. As late as 1840 theproportion had not very much increased,, and in 1880, some eighteen years after the* first Act was passed relating to the departThis is no debating-club subject. ment of Agriculture, only about 23 per cent.. of the population were living in the towns. not come in then. not come into vogue so much then, of course, lam just leading up to the position asifcisnow.. This urban population lived in 242 towns and cities. A t the present time only some 37 per cent, of the population of the United States-notwithstandin g all that has been done in the way of creating manufactures, and inducements for the people to livein the cities-resid e in the towns. There are 580 towns, each containWe are met ing some 4,000 or more inhabitants. I believe that at the last census it was found that some 35 per cent, of the population of New South Wales was living in Sydney, and in Victoria the proportion is possibly even greater. I am not going to refer to the fiscal issue, but the figures appear toshow that under the protective policy of Victoria, or the free-trade policy of New South Wales, the tendency of population is to cling to the large towns. I suppose that at least 50 per cent, of population is to be found in the large towns of Victoria and New South Wales, and that is a reason why we should in the future try as far as possible to encourage the settlement of the people on the land. We can only encourage that settlement, I presume, by what I shall refer to later on, namely, by bounties on production and export; but the States can encourage agricultural settlement as is beingdone now in Victoria and New South Wales,, by providing for closer settlement, and in this connection the States cannot part with their own departments of agriculture. We-",38,Nationaldepartment Of Agricultur E
189,Mr Higgins,Steam and machinery had,39,Nationaldepartment Of Agricultur E
190,Mr Skene,"Steam and machinery hadare told that in the United States tlie political centre of gravity lies in the valley of the Mississippi, people having gravitated westward ; no eastern man having been, or is likely to be, returned as President for a long time. Mr Frederick Harrison, in a recent article i u the Nineteenth Centwy, sets <>ut that fact, and states that Chicago or St. Louis is destined to be the metropolis of the United States. I was pleased to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca with regard to the possible advancement of irrigation, although I would be one to proceed very cautiously in this respect. Notice of motion has. been given by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, for the locking of the larger rivers of Australia, which run into the Murray and thence into the sea. hardly recognise what are the possibilities in connection with these rivers, when they Are taken in hand and thoroughly locked; but I do not think that very much can be done by tlie mere locking of the rivers. We know that those 'rivers are simply large ditches, whereas there are places on the mountains where huge reservoirs could be made, and a great deal of water conserved. There is another matter in connection with that part of the country which perha.ps honourable members do not know. Some few years ago an Attempt was made to strike artesian water at Hay. The bore went through one layer of drift, and the water rose a certain distance. Then tlie bore went through A layer of clay, and through successive layers of d r if t and clay for some 600 feet, when the water always rose to the same level within 70 feet of the surface. There are millions of acres of niagnificient land there, which eventually, when we have sufficient population, will be under intense culture. AlthoughI am not prepared to go quite so far as the motion of the honourable and learned member for Beudigo indicates, I can go with him in his proposal that there should be an Intelligence Bureau, because such an institution, with the -obtain, _good in focussing the best work of the State departments. On the imposition of uniform -duties, the question of the bounties on production and export will be cast on us, and we must have some means of deriving the most accurate and up-to-date information on the subject. We cannot deal with a matter of this kind simply on the knowledge which comes to us haphazard in the House, and we must have reports to enable us to adopt the most accurate methods. I heartily congratulate the honourable and learned members for Bendigo and In d i on the way in which they dealt with the literary and technological view of the question, showing that they had given the subject very great research. But tlieir inspirations appear to be drawn from what is to be seen and heard inside the circle of educational establishments. As a practical man I am not quite so taken with that particular view, and my object to-day is to t r y and impress on the House the view that we want some action taken .which will embrace not only the technological part of education, but, at the People same time, will introduce into the scheme the practical man. Mr Frederick Harrison, to whose recent article in the Nineteenth CentwyI have referred, and who was invited to Chicago to give the annual address in commemoration of George Washington, spoke very largely of the 'magnificent system of general education throughout the United States, and after remarking that libraries are not learning and museums and laboratpries not knowledge, he said this :The passing visitor to the United States forms his own impression as to the bulk of the diffusion of the instrumeifts of education ; but he is in no better position than any one else to measure the product. I feel very much in that way. Having lived most of my life in the country, and having been brought into contact with men following agricultural pursuits, I must say I have not found outside of our educational establishments the f r u it f u l results I should have expected, and I think the reason is not far to seek. We have, I believe, most capable men connected with our agricultural and educational establishments in the various States, and I am quite sure that the agricultural population of Australia is as intelligent a population as is to be found in any part of the world. These educational most capable head we can establishments do not do as much as they would do a great deal of ought to do, because the practical man and the teacher do not sufficiently play into each other's hands. There is a mistaken notion as to their proper relations. The practical man is not regarded as being of much value in educational schemes, but I contend that he is the first and last factor. Agriculture is not an exact science, and -outside the exact sciences, I take it that the province of the teacher is not to lead but to follow-to follow, as I once heard it expressed, as the coachman follows his horses, guiding ' them. The province of .science is to take hold of rough facts, -sift them, them, and make them current coin. The .scientist does not evolve methods out of his inner consciousness, but obtains his lead possibly from some accidentally hit on .physical circumstances. That, according to my reading, is the teaching of the history of science. The primary postulate of John Stuart Mill, in his Principle!) of Political Education, is that in every department of human affairsPractice long precedes science. Systematic inquiry into the modes of action of the powers of extracts, just to show as nearly as possible nature is the tardy product of a long course of my ideas on the subject. Mr Dow, who -efforts to use these powers for practical ends. AVe find that in everything which crops up in connection with not only agriculture, suggested to him by Dr. Plummer, as the but with other matters. I remember a result of a conversation upon the federal system thorough scientific farmer in the south of adopted .Scotland telling me a story of a stupid boy diuary agricultural societiesthronghout the States, who was sent to fetch home a set of harnext the federation of these societies into central rows. That boy dragged the harrows boards, which boards in their turn were knit tothrough a field, where the crop was already gether five oi six inches above the ground, with the 1 result that at harvest time that part of the He goes on to explain the state system of -crop was six or eight inches higher than the California. He says :rest. That was an accidental discovery which, no doubt, scientists took hold of, and men, working according to a plan by which they .afterwards explained. In our dry districts combine tbe offices held in Victoria by the Goin Australia, there is summer fallow, baud, and the National Agricultural Society of surface tilth, deep seeding, and other Victoria on the other. conditions that have been discovered by farmers for themselves. discoveries can no doubt be improved on by those who invested with the State authority by an Act have studied the matter with scientific passed specially to that end. The Act may be knowledge, and who can state the result thus summarized :-Tb e association is declared better than can men who accidentally hit a State institution. Twelve resident citizens, on the rough fact. I now come to what I representing regard as the kernel of my subject. We ments are b}' the votes of the agricultural have, I believe, in our practical agriculturists societi es. The board classifies itself, by lot or othera splendid industrial army of research, wise, into four divisions of three members each, and those agriculturists have already been three, unofficially organized to some extent through bers are charged with full control of all the prothe agricultural societies of the States. perty of the institution and with the direction of I believe thfcy are only waiting for official all its proceedings, together with the appointrecognition, such as is given in the United ment States, to render them of infinite use. AVe They meet once a quarter, or of toner if required. have many points in common, and I have The board uses all suitable means to collect and myself been trying for a long time to bring disseminate all kinds of information calculated to about an organisation similar to that in the the United States. I have here the reports of of tlie State, and make such suggestions and' the Royal Society of Victoria, with which I have been for a good many years connected, and it will be seen that several attempts have been made to organize some system of the kind. A lecture was delivered before the Victorian Royal Agricultural Society by Mr explain the rationale of J. L . Dow-the n a member of the local Legislature-afte r his return from America, showing how similar societies there were organized, and liow they fitted in with the Agricultural department of Washington. The late Dr. Plummer, who was for seven or eight years president of the Royal Agricultural Society, made one or two attempts to federate the agricultural bodies of Victoria, and it was at his request that Mr Dow delivered the lecture. I shall not trouble honourable members with more than a few delivered his lecture in 18S4, saidThe idea of reading this paper had been by the agricultural societies of the United States. In that country there was, first the orwith tbe great central board, the Agricultural department at Washington. . fc Here we have an association of representative vernment departments of' agriculture ou the one What is called the State Agricultural Society After such of California, may be described as a board of have been made, they twelve members elected from, and representative of, all parts of California, whose proceedings are different portions of the State, are appointed as a board of agriculture.

The Act has further provided for the division of the whole of California into twelve districts, each district including such a number oE counties as lie most conveniently into each other, and whose interests are most in common. The presidents of the district boards form a central board and thus the whole system becomes complete. Mr Dow also saysThe establishment of at least one agricultural college iu each State of America is provided for by au Act of Congress, and in connection with these valuable educational institutions the central or State boards are found of great value. The central board receives suggestions through the district representative, calculated to be of benefit to the general agricultural interest, and combined with the influence brought to bear through the central boards, the legislature' is enabled to have necessary action taken ; and, on the other hand, after certain steps have been taken, such as for example, the establishment of an agricultural college, then it also comes in as a valuable auxiliary in the way of supervision. I think [ have read enough to show that the federation of agricultural societies is part of the American system, and a part which I think might very well be introduced here. If we could only have our agricultural societies federated in that way we should be able to do away with a number of public experi mental plots. The experimental plots which have been carried on in ""various parts of the world. have not been quite as successful as some honourable members imagine. on as they are conducted in Victoria there is no cause for surprise at their failure. member for Indi laid great stress upon the work which has been carried out on the Rothamsted experimental farms in the old country. I find in tlie Nineteenth Century for November, 1899, a reference to that work in an article entitled, ""Manuring with Brains,"" which deals with the experiments conducted at Dalnieny-Lord Rosebery's Scottish cottage estate. The article sets forth tliatI t may be admitted, that as these continuous white crop-growing experiments are being carried out upon the same lines year after yew, and each year's results only confirm those of previous years, while at the same time these crops are grown under conditions which never obtain in ordinary farm practice, the Rothamsted experiments have now lost much of the interest which they formerly had for the agricultural public. The writer goes on to say that in spired by the example of the Rothamsted experiments, the national agricultural societies and several other public bodies, proceeded to establish similar experimental stations. These farms, however, have been abandoned to some extent. Then the article goes on to show thatThe Scottish National Agricultural Society abandoned their stations as a failure, and it is a. very open secret that in recent j'ears tlie boaitl of agricultural inspectors have urged the conductors of the grant-receiving experimental stations to try and bit upon some other form of research rather than go on testing the same-, manures year after year with ever-varying results. If we could secure the affiliation of our various agricultural bodies under some Act of Parliament-and I do not see why it should not be an Act of the Commonwealth I am sure that a great many men would take such interest in these matters that they would lay out experimental plots, themselves. The great success which has been gained in the breeding of stock has been due to the fact that various, formers and pastoralists keep their little stud flocks and herds. T see no reason why a fanner, once he can be induced to experiment in a propei way by means of 1 technical education, should not have his own experimental plots on his own farm, and take as much interest in them as graziers do in their stud flocks and herds, which are to be seen throughout the country. The great advantage of this would he thab we should have a large industrial army of If they have been carried research We should have a large number of men throughout bhe country looking for inberestihg facbs connected with agriculture, facts which perhapsthey could not explain themselves, but which might bring about important resulbs, and could be explained by those who had a scientific education.

I think the motion, if amended as I propose, would have the effect of establishing at once that which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo desires. We should obtain periodical reports from tlie State departments on all matters of interest for an intelligence bureau. would be a very good beginning, and afterwards these institutions might be taken over by the Commonwealth. Having thought the matter out, I feel that it would be advisable to amend the motion in the form that I have suggested, and I hope that honourable members will give full consideration to the proposal. ber of honourable members have delivered very long, able, and eloquent addresses in support of this motion. They all seem to be very enthusiastic about the immediate establishment of an agricultural department to be controlled by tlie Commonwealth. I do not, however, feel at all enthusiastic about adding to the responsibilities and increasing the labours of tlie federal authorities at this early stage in our existence. It w ill be time enough for us totalk about extending our powers and responsibilities when we have proved by the= exercise of the undoubted powers that we< have under the Constitution that we can properly administer the departments at. present under our control, and that we a,re worthy of the public confidence.

In connexforget that they were federated for somefifty years before they formed an agricultural department. The honourable member for Grampians said that this was no debating-club question, but I think there is no question that is more worthy of beingcalled a debating-club question, or one which could be more easily or more advantageously It would greatly compostponed, than that of establishing a federal agricultural department. I do not feel that I MrA .

The motion itself seems very vague, and the That amendment which has been proposed by the. honourable member for Grampians certainly very much improves it . The motion in its original form refers to the establishment of a "" National Department of Agricultureand Productive Industries."" I would like the mover to tell us what is meant by productive industry. I take it that a productive industry means an industry which produces something, and if an industry does not produce anything it is a misnomer tocall it an industry at all. If it is intended that tlie motion shall refer only to agriculture and kindred industries it will ignore other industries which are just as much entitled to consideration as is the agricultural industry.

204,Mr Kirwan,"That may be, but itclone as much for the Commonwealth as has the agricultural industry. It is those who are engaged in mining who largely supply a market for the produce of those engaged in agriculture. MrA . McLEAN -Mining is a productive industry. lution does not embrace ib ifc ought to. Why agriculture should be specially mentioned, and not mining, is one of those things which it is so difficult to understand. The mining industry is just as much, if not more, in need of the help to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo referred. In connection with the mining industry we need money for prospecting votes, for schools of mines, for the treatment of our refractory ores, and for many other these directions would prove just as beneficial as if it were devoted to the interests of agriculture. I am not going to say that we should establish a department of mining in connection with the Commonwealth, because I consider that a department of mining, as well as a department of agriculture, can wait for many years ; but if the one is established the other ought to be, because they are equally essential and d.eserving. Then there is the constitutional aspect of the question. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo devoted himself to provingfchatitwas within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to establish a department of this kind. I have here a book which I presume honourable members of this House-and perhaps none more than the honourable and learned member for Bendigo-wil l regard as an authority on this particular subject. I refer to the Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth. A t page 935 the author's note saysThe residuary authority left to the Parliament of each State, after the exclusive and concurrent grants to the Federal Parliament, embraces a large mass of constitutional, territorial, municipal and social powers, including control over Then follows a list of something like 30 different subjects, and the very first one mentioned is "" agriculture and the cultivation of the soil."" Then, amongst the other matters that are left under tbe authority of the States is "" inspection of goods imported or proposed to be exported in order to detect fraud or prevent the spread of disease."" I would like to know whether honourable members are prepared to take this book as an. authority, or whether they will rely upon the opinion of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. There is still another aspect of this matter which we have to consider. When the Federal Constitution was being discussed throughout Australia, we' were told, rightly or wrongly, that the Agricul. tural department, and all that affected the agricultural industry, would be left solely in the hands of the State Governments, and until the honourable member proposed thismotion, I am sure that the majority of honourable members, and I believe most of the public, were firm in the idea that agriculture was one of those subjects over which the State Governments had exclusive control. It was certainly a matter of very considerable surprise to find the honourable and things; and money spent in learned member for Bendigo proposing at this early stage to extend the powers of the Commonwealth in this direction. has omitted to consider section 90 of the Constitution. the authors of the book have done in connection with that. I am only falling into the same mistake that they have made. dently too deep for the honourable member. a very great respect for this book, and I ant sure that that feeling is shared by honourable members generally, to whom the publication has been of considerable assistance. orable members to consider whether it would! not be unadvisable at this stage, in the in terests of the agriculturists themselves, to pass this motion. A t present the agricultural industry is looked after by the various. State Departments of Agriculture; but what would happen if the Commonwealth undertook the controlof the agricultural industry ?: There would be a kind of dual control. The Commonwealth has its hands pretty f u l l at the present time, and could not pay the. necessary attention to this department; and as the States would make the responsibility of the Commonwealth an excuse for neglecting their own duty, the agriculturists would, between the two authorities, find themselves very much neglected indeed.

We have already -a sufficient number of heavy duties to discharge, and we should show our competence to administer the affairs nowunder our control before undertaking fresh responsibilities. I think that the consideration of this matter might very well be postponed. After the set-back that our enthusiasm has received from the other side, I think it is time to say something as to the real intention of this proposal. I have as much fear -of what is known as centralization in these matters as has any honourable member, and I realize that a centralized control might, under some circumstances, prove disastrous to the agriculturist. Nevertheless, there is a great -on the -certainly ought to be undertaken. We have reserved to ourselves the right to grant bonuses for the encouragement of ""various industries, and it would be well for us to have some central authority to decide how these bonuses should be applied, There is no doubt that this Parliament can do a .great deal to encourage the agricultural and -other productive industries. We know that the resources of this Cdmmonwealth are infinite, and that there is abundance of work to be done in developing them. There are many admirable institutions already in existence in the various States, and I know that we have recently been making great -progress in Victoria in tlie matter of entomogreat idea which might be worked out to logical developments, in cross fertilization, And in endeavouring to produce a rustresisting wheat. But all these researches should be systematized so that those who are working for the common end may -derive the best fruits from their labours. We also require to give every encouragement to students of agriculture, and this is only to be done by giving them scholarships -and other inducements of a similar kind. method of the gymnasium. We keep our young lads at the State schools nowadays studying the three R's when they would probably be better employed if they were studying agricultural chemistry and the other sciences kindred to the calling of agriculturists. We can, by a system of scholarships, enable youths to attend evening classes and University extension lectures The which might be established throughout the length and breadth of the country. This can be anything more than it can done only by united and uniform action throughout Australia, guarding against centralization, but at the same time having a central college and a teaching staff which would go forth to do the pioneering work. Of course we are all aware that the Scylla and Charybdis of our politics is to guard against centralization on the one hand and decentralization on the othei*. Decentralization in effort of this kind means dissipation of energy and jirogress, without anything like aim or object; whereas if a national department of agriculture were recognised by Parliament, and came under the purview of a Minister of the Federal Parliament, it would certainly do much to unify and encourage scientific agriculture. Tlie previous speaker has taken exception to the words "" producdeal to be done tive industry,"" and pointed out that mining lines of this motion that is a productive industry. That is true, and I hope that when we create a national department of agriculture we shall also notice that the rudiments of geology are as much needed by the practical miner as are the rudiments of chemistry by the practical agriculturist I should like to see some great national university or teaching staff, such as would embrace all these practical subjects. Then we should be able to call tlie institution a university in the proper sense, because I am certain that the word "" university,"" which in the mediaeval sense included all professions, willj soon become similarly employed in the industrial world. This is the genesis of a great purpose and utility. We need not be afraid of taking too much upon our shoulders. It is certainly good policy not to bite off more than we.can chew, but. I think we are able to undertake this work without any fear of encroaching on tlie rights and privileges of the various States. As to the question of whether we have any right to do this, I would point out that we are only seeking to work in co-operation We should adopt the German with the States, so as to give point and purpose and national aim to their efforts. We are by no means trying to override the States, or to take over from them that which they are not willing to grant.

I find that it is a generally accepted maxim that the more attention a man has given to a particular avocation in life, bhe more it seems to be assumed by those outside of thab avocation tliat he knows little about it . I purpose to briefly express my views on the subject which has. come before us somewhat unexpectedly. I cannot understand the menbal attitude of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who took exception to a declaratory resolution of this sorb because it did not lay down bhe dicbuni that the Federal Government-assumin g thab this motion is assented to-nius b immediately incur an extraordinary expenditure to create a department of agriculture, to the complebe. exclusion of mining and obher productive industries. Ib is not even questioned by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that mining is a productive industry. On reflection, I think that the honorahle member for Kalgoorlie will admit thab ib would be to the best interests of those engaged in all industries relating to all our staple producbs if some efficient means could be devised whereby those in any particular State could have the best information, scientific and otherwise, thab is available in any of tlie obher States. Ib is nob to be assumed for a moment that it was in the mind of the mover of this resolution bhat the Federal Government should -immediately atbempt to establish a national department; of Agriculture. What was in the mind of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was what has since been given expression to, namely, that when the Federal Government have time to deal with the matter which we hope will be, if not in the first recess, in the second-the y will formulate some scheme by which they can disseminate information obtained from the different State departments, and work on from thab. It is nob necessary to rush into rash expenditure; indeed, we have splendid landmarks in the different States to protect us against any of the extravagant expenditure of the past. In Victoria, of which I have some knowledge, we have an Agricultural College endowed by tlie Government. The council of that college have done a good deal of useful work, but, 13 H considering the endowment which they have received, and the opportunities at their disposal, I am free to admit that their efforts, howsoever well directed, have not been as successful as one could have hoped. In some of their colleges they have the best men available in Australia. Bub through some misfortune the resulbs of the experiments carried oub in these institutions, which should have been available to the agriculturisbs of Vicboria, have never reached them. This may be due to parsimony on the part of the council in neglecting bo have their reports printed and distributed. I remember visiting one particular agricultural college when it was under tlie control of a parental government, just prior to bhe holding of one of their annual, stud stock sales. Looking through the sbock I found an animal which' appeared in the catalogue as a shorthorn bull. I attempted to dissuade a friend from buying this animal, which was represenbed to be a shorthorn yearling. He disregarded my advice, however, and twelve monbhs laber the shorthorn bull had developed into a Jersey. It is matters of this sort that frequently discredit our colleges. It is an extraordinary facb bhat up to the present time in Vicboriaand I have been informed that a, similar condition of things prevails in the other States -few , if any, of the farmers' sons have taken advantage of the opportunities offered for education by these institutions. I do not know what are the reasons for this, but I do know of the results of the education imparted to some who have gone through the full course. In one case a student had gone through the f u ll course, and was enabled through his credentials to obtain employment upon an agricultural and pastoral holding. Almosb one of the first duties which he was asked to perform was that of killing a sheep for household purposes. It is scarcely to be credited that although he had been three years in one of the besb colleges of Australia he did not even know how to k i ll a sheep. This fact serves to show that too much atbention is paid in these institutions to the technical side of the education imparted, and too little to the practical side. If one considers what the respective Sbates expend upon agricultural education, and comes to realize what little benefit tlie agriculturists derive from that expenditure, one can quibe",46,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I could quote many other illustrations of a like character. It is not alone with respect to the education of our agriculturists that a department of tlie character proposed could be of immense advantage in our productive industries.

All the information we have at present * goes to show what benefits may be derived from an interchange of ideas, and from experiments carried on in the different States. We, in the State of Victoria, went to New South Wales many years ago to learn something about butter factories, the latter State being the first in Australia to establish the manufacture of butter-on that system. I am not going to contrast the butter industry as it exists in the two States to-day, but it must be admitted that, owing to the application of the system, and more particularly to the If there be a direction given by the authorities, there have been in the State of Victoria splendid results for the expenditure.

For insbance, there are people who are ready bo pay the necessary fees for new telephones, but the Posbal department has not the aubhority to spend money on new works. I believe this and the obher Chamber would be willing to pass a short Bill authorizing the Government to raise money for such purposes, apart from any question of general policy. holiday occurs next week in connection with the Royal Agricultural Society's show, and I should like to ask the AbtorneyGeneral what are the intentions of the Government in regard to sibbing on thab day. General) in reply -S o far as I know the Government have not considered the question of a holiday on Thursday next. I am the morning, as far as honourable members are concerned, and that work must be proceeded with in the afternoon. In reply bo the honourable member for Bland, let me say bhat I hope that the progress made will be sufficient to enable us to go right through with the Immigration Restriction Bill, but of course, there is a kindred Bill relating to Kanakas which may come on for consideration. It will depend on the progress made, and while we hope to go righb through with the Immigration Restriction Bill, it may be necessary to bring on the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill as well as the three measures which I have referred to. be taken next week.",49,Honourable Members Hear Hear

230,Mr Sawers,"The Defence Bill will not have to be prepared to meet emergencies as they arise. As to the matter of interest to which the honorahle member for Bland has alluded, and which applies not only to the works of the Post-office, but to other public works which are suspended for the same reason, the Treasurer has the question undor his consideration. I expect that in the course of a comparatively few sitting days, when he lays his Budget before the House, it will be found to contain proposals to meet the case. the House giving statistics of the manufacturing industries of the States, was presented to the House on the 2-2hd instant, and ordered to be printed. On inquiry, however, I have ascertained that the cost of printing the whole of the information would amount to £ 2 4 5 . As the return consists largely of printed schedules taken from statistical papers of the various Statesi t was 'suggested that, in order to save expense, only the new matter should be printed, and that the printed schedules should he bound together and laid oil the table, where they could be referred to at any time. This suggestion I have ventured to adopt, being sure that I was giving effect to the wish of this House to save unnecessary expense. I may soy that this proposal is made at the desire of the honourable member who moved for the return, and with the consent of the Minister who furnished it . Question resolved in the affirmative House adjourned at 4.5 p.m.",50,Industries
