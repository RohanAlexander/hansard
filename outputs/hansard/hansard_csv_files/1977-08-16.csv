The budgeted increase implies, for the second year running, a reduction in total outlays expressed in real terms. Expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product, outlays reached a peak of 30.9 per cent in 1975-76, compared with 29.7 per cent in 1974-75 and around 24-25 per cent in earlier years. In 1976-77, reflecting the substantial deceleration in the rate of growth of""outlays, this proportion declined to 29.6 per cent; the present estimates imply a further reduction in 1977-78. Outlays for 1976-77 and the estimates for 1977-78 are classified by broad economic type in the following table: 1976-77 1977-78 Actual Change Estimate Change$ million per cent 8 million per cent Net expenditure on goods and services1998 19.0 2151 7.6 Other current expenditure . . . . 2 648 11.4 3 054 15.3 Capital expenditure S16 7.8 476 7.6 5162 11.8 5 681 10.1 Transfer payments and net advancesTo or for the States and local government authorities 8 941 5.6 9 981 11.6 Cash benefits to persons(a) . . . . 7 494 21.0 8 239 9.9 Interest paid 1412 45.9 1 727 22.4 Transfers overseas 388 4.7 414 6.9 Net advances (other than to States)(6) . 386 -50.9 221 -42.8 341 -25.4 393 15.0 Total 18 962 10.0 20 975 10.6 (a) Includes unfunded employee retirement benefits.

Receipts Total Budget receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 per cent in 1977-78 to S24 439 million. This is after allowance for the net loss to revenue of taxation measures. Reflecting the substantial cost to revenue of taxation measures introduced in 1976 and 1977, the estimated increase in revenues in 1977-78 is considerably less than the 17.0 per cent recorded in 1976-77 and the 19.7 per cent in 1975-76. Details of the estimates for 1977-78, including the effects of measures on receipts, are in Statement No. 4. The Deficit The estimated total deficit in 1977-78 of $2217 million is $523 million less than the 1976-77 deficit of $2740 million. After allowance for the deficit incurred on overseas transactions-mainl y in respect of defence and foreign aid expenditure-the estimated domestic deficit is $1347 million. This is $648 million less than the domestic deficit of $1995 million recorded in. 1976-77. Historical Data Historical data on Budget transactions are presented in Statements Nos5 and 6. Statement No. 5 provides a detailed account of the Budget outcome for 1976-77 while Statement No. 6 presents Budget data for the period 1967-68 to 1977-78 in both functional and national accounts form. Table2 of Statement No. 6 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by functional and major sub-functional categories in each year since 1967-68. An Appendix describes the basis of the functional classification of Budget outlays used throughout the Budget Statements. An account of the economic context of the 1977-78 Budget and of the post-Budget outlook for the economy is presented in Statement No. 2.

Continued restraint on government expenditures, control of the growth of the monetary aggregates and advocacy of moderation in wage determination all contributed to the anti-inflationary thrust of policy during the year. The necessity to devalue the Australian dollar in November 1976 implied, at the time, a* marked change in the overall settings of macro-economic policy and the need to effect compensating adjustments to domestic policies. Activity and Employment Although the growth in economic activity in aggregate was greater in 1976-77 as a whole than in either of the two previous financial years, unevenness between sectors and over time continued to be a feature of economic performance. A sizeable increase in expenditure and product was recorded in calendar 1976, but the tempo of activity slowed again in the first half of 1977. The key question posed by this continued variation in performance concerns the strength and durability of the economic recovery that has been under way. Later sections of this Statement examine movements in major economic aggregates from that point of view. The following paragraphs describe major developments in the economy over the last year or so. This commentary, including the accompanying charts, refers to semi-annual movements. AU figures mentioned are seasonally adjusted and in constant price terms unless otherwise noted. Since the economy is an interrelated whole, using developments in real expenditures as the starting-point for discussion is, though conventional, to some extent arbitrary. It can be seen from Chart1 that total final expenditure (panel g) rose in both halves of 1976-strongl y so in the second half-befor e declining in the first half of 1977. Private final consumption expenditure (panel a) increased in both halves of 1976 although, because of the decline in the March quarter, only slightly so in the first half of the year. The pace of consumer spending quickened in the second half of the year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more than 6 per cent. The bunching of expenditures in anticipation of and immediately subsequent to the devaluation of late November' appears to have been an important contributing factor; in effect, this resulted in the movement of some consumption out of the first half of 1977 into the second half of 1976. A further small part of the increase in recorded consumption was due to the reclassification of expenditures resulting from the changes to health insurance arrangements that took effect on 1 October; these have had the effect of raising the level of recorded private consumption expenditure since the December quarter. Following very rapid growth through 1975-76, private dwelling investment (panel b) levelled off from mid-1976 resulting in a lesser, though still sizeable, increase in the second half of the calendar year. The rapid expansion in new dwelling construction was not fully matched by growth in sales of dwellings; excess stocks of dwellings began accumulating towards the end of 1976 and, largely as a result, construction activity declined in the first half of 1977. Private gross business fixed capital expenditure (panels c and d), which fell through 1975, has increased, albeit marginally, in each of the three half-years since then. Investment in other building and construction (panel c) continued to fall throughout 1976 and, although recovering slightly in the March quarter, fell again in the June quarter and was little changed on a half-yearly basis. Investment in plant and equipment (panel d) has fluctuated between quarters but in half-yearly terms has consistently recorded increases since the end of 1975.

The shaded bar is the published (income-based) estimate: the unshaded bar is an expenditure-based estimate (equal to (j) in the above identity which excludes the change in the statistical discrepancy). The gross non-farm product estimate is income based (includes discrepancy). All half-yearly figures are consistent with the most recent annua/ national accounts estimates published concurrently with this statement. On average the public sector has accounted directly for only a small part of the growth in total final expenditures since 1975. A small decline in the first half of calendar 1976 was approximately matched by an increase in the second half; there was a further, slightly larger, increase in the first half of 1977. In 1976-77 as a whole, government expenditure at all levels (panel e) was 1.8 per cent higher than in the previous year; current expenditures were 5.1 per cent higher while capital expenditures were 2.6 per cent lower. Exports (panel f) provided a strong supplement to domestic final expenditure through most of 1976. Growth in the December half-year was over 16 per cent at an annual rate. However, the volume of exports declined in the December quarter and continuation of that decline into thefirstquarter of 1977 saw the volume of exports fall at an annual rate of 10 per cent in the six months to June 1977, in the process making the largest absolute contribution to the decline in total final expenditure in that half year (see Chart 1). As panel h shows, between 1975 and 1976 the cyclical turnaround of stocks from decumulation to accumulation was substantial. But at the time this turnaround was contributing most heavily to the growth in gross national expenditure, import volumes (panel i) were also rising strongly, substantially offsetting the contribution of stock changes to product growth. Both stock accumulation and importing continued to increase in the second half of 1976, though less markedly. With the increases in imports and stock-building broadly commensurate in 1976, movements in the expenditure-based estimate of gross domestic product (panel j) (excluding the statistical discrepancy) and total final expenditure in each half-year were similar, with both showing stronger growth in the second half of 1976 than in the first.As panel j shows, movements in the income-based estimate of GDP (including the statistical discrepancy) were almost even between the two halves. In 1976 as a whole gross domestic product (income-based) increased by 4.2 per cent, farm product by 4.1 per cent, and non-farm product (panel k) by 4.2 per cent. In the most recent half-year the fall in exports translated a broadly flat domestic final demand picture into a decline in total final expenditure. This was accompanied by a larger increase in imports than in the preceding half-year, and with markedly lesser non-farm stock accumulation non-farm product declined overall. (Further information on stock changes in the most recent half-year is contained in Table 4.) On present estimates for 1976-77 as a whole, domestic product (income-based) increased by 3.4 per cent, farm product by 2.4 per cent and non-farm product by 3.5 per cent. (Non-farm product growth for 1975-76 has been revised upwards from 0.8 per cent to 2.0 per cent.) The 3.5 per cent estimate for non-farm product growth for 1976-77 which, of course, remains subject to revision, compares with the forecast of about 4 per cent given in Statement No. 2 at this time last year; the pattern of developments within the year was rather more different from that foreseen, for reasons which are mentioned later. Within the farm sector, the gross value of production of wheat is estimated to have declined sharply in 1976-77 reflecting a marginal fall in volume and a larger price fall. The value of sugar cane cut for crushing increased after the decline in 1975-76. The value of livestock slaughtered rose sharply again, but was still a little below its high 1973-74 level. The value of wool production also increased solidly for the second successive year. Industrial production grew moderately, though erratically, over the course of 1976 before falling back slightly in the first half of 1977. The tracking of labour market conditions has been complicated in recent times by problems in interpretation of the available data. These difficulties were discussed in some detail in the October 1976 and February 1977 issues of the Treasury Round-up of Economic Statistics. On the employment side one difficulty has arisen because of divergent trends shown by the quarterly population survey and by the estimates of employed wage and salary earners. As Table1 indicates, the former has recorded a sizeable increase over the last eighteen months while the latter has shown little change (a slight rise in government employment offsetting a fall in private employment). The survey-based concept of employment is broader, including as it does employers, self-employed persons, unpaid helpers and agricultural employment in addition to wage and salary earners. The sampling variability inherent in the survey estimates and differences in the timing and methods of collection require that comparison of the two series, particularly over short periods, be made with due caution. Nonetheless, the increase in this estimate of employment over longer periods suggests that the former labour force categories have been expanding elements of the total employed population. It should be noted also that growth in the survey estimate has been stronger in part-time than in full-time employment and, more recently, also for females than males.

Observations about the level of and changes in unemployment over short periods are complicated by difficulties with the seasonal adjustment process (as a consequence, seasonal adjustment of persons registered with the CES was discontinued from September 1976) and other special influences acting on the CES statistics. Indicators in Table1 point to underlying labour market conditions stabilising in 1976 before easing further in the first half of 1977 when labour force participation rates rose above earlier low levels and labour force growth outstripped the increase in employment. Unemployment rates among females and juniors have been above the average, even relatively more than usual in the latter case; relative wage movements have been a contributing factor. Despite the high overall incidence of unemployment, labour is reported in short supply in a number of skilled categories. Prices and Incomes Increases in earnings and prices are shown, by half-yearly periods, in Chart 2.

As with activity, price and income developments in the review period fall into two phases: 1976, when the trend of price innation was distinctly downwards and factor income shares moved in favour of profits, and the first half of 1977 when the downward trend in inflation was interrupted and income shares remained at about their levels of the preceding half-year. With wage indexation continuing to link award wage movements fairly closely to the inherited rate of price inflation (extra-indexation increases have remained small throughout), increases in award wage rates (Chart 2, panel a) and ordinary time earnings (panel b) remained large in 1976-77. The increase in award wages and earnings for 1976 as a whole owed much to the February National Wage Case rise of 6.4 per cent; later in the year two partial indexation decisions and the slowing of price inflation contributed to lesser increases. More recently, the large award wage increase granted on the basis of the December quarter increase in the consumer price index boosted the rise in award wages and earnings in the June quarter (although the increases in the half-year were still slightly lower). As panels a, b and c of Chart2 show, there has been only a very gradual deceleration in award wages and earnings over the past two years. Although the pattern has been uneven between quarters average award wages and weekly earnings in the recent June quarter, when deflated by the private consumption and non-farm product deflators, were as high as or higher than in the same quarter of the two previous years. The consumer price index (excluding hospital and medical services) decelerated in both halves of 1976; the implicit deflator for major GNE components and aggregate non-farm prices moderated even more markedly in the second half. Table2 details movements .in these and other price indicators. With productivity growing strongly through the year (Chart 5), unit wage costs rose much less rapidly than wage rates and earnings in both halves of 1976. Unit gross surplus rose in both half-years; with product also expanding this meant that the level of gross operating surplus of companies increased by 23.5 per cent in the year as a whole. There was a sizeable rise in the profit share over the year from its previous very low level (Chart 4). In the first half of 1977, by contrast, measured productivity declined marginally and unit wage costs rose more sharply than earnings. Unit gross surplus increased but with product lower, the gross operating surplus of companies rose only slightly on the previous half-year. The profit share declined fairly sharply in the June quarter and for the half-year was little changed from the second half of 1976. The impact of the devaluation of the Australian dollar in November 1976 on the price indexes most sensitive to changes in prices of internationally traded goods was immediate and substantial (see Foreign Trade and Manufacturing Industry price movements in Table 2). Effects on the broader indexes measuring final prices have been much less noticeable; this reflects both the more muted impact to be expected at later stages of production in a subdued domestic market, and also lags in transmission to final prices. Further, the prices 'pause' discouraged some price increases during the period of its application from mid-April until .late May. This latter influence was also undoubtedly a factor in the weaker profit share in the June quarter, already noted.

(b) Six months to May 1977 compared with six months to November 1976. The rate of increase in the CPI (excluding hospital and medical services) levelled out in the first half of 1977, while aggregate non-farm prices and the deflator for major components of GNE rose more than in the preceding half-year (in part reflecting the innuence of changes in composition). In 1976-77 as a whole the increase in the broadly-based price indexes was four to six percentage points less than in 1975-76. Although the slowdown in the rate of increase of wage rates and earnings was much less marked, there were increases in both the profit share and, more markedly, the level of profits. In contrast to 1975-76, an increase in average farm sector prices (9 per cent, as measured by the implicit deflator for farm product) was sufficient, with volume growth, to produce an increase, of 18 per cent, in farm income following declines of 10 per cent in 1975-76 and 39 per cent in 1974-75. With the rate and extent of unwinding of the 1974 distortion of real wages and the wage share being a key element in the process of recovery in activity and employment, wages growth and the factors underlying it warrant close examination. The system of wage indexation introduced by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in April 1975 remained the dominant innuence in the process of wage determination over the past year, and its effect on the speed of real wage adjustment is of great importance. In analysing these issues it is essential to distinguish between the effect on total earnings growth of increases in awards granted in National Wage Cases and othei elements in earnings, including other award increases and hours worked, whioh are more directly responsive to the influence of the market place. Table3 provides estimates of the contribution of the various influences to wages and earnings growth over recent years.

There was a slight delay (into 1977) of the full effect on awards of the last adjustment in 1976; similarly, earnings in 1976 did not reflect the bulk of the November 1976 decision. This means that the contribution from other unit wage factors in 1976 should be slightly larger than shown in the table and the contribution from total awards slightly smaller. (6) Reflects differences in coverage and over-awards. (c) Seasonally adjusted. (d) Reflects differences in coverage as well as overtime. On the basis of past experience in this country and elsewhere, the sharp downturn in economic activity in 1974 could have been expected to produce an early slowing in earnings and some decline in the real wage. In fact, although overtime payments began to decline early in the downturn in response to the easing demand for labour, large increases in award wages granted outside the National Wage Case arena persisted past the downturn. In 1975 as a whole, there was a sharp slow-down in other award increases, in the face of a more prolonged easing in the labour market and (not unrelated to that) a high degree of compliance with the principles of indexation. This contributed, with a fall in overtime, to the equally sharp decline in earnings growth in the first half of 1975 (see Chart 2). As in 1975, a substantial degree of indexation applied on average in 1976 but award wages increased by much more than in the preceding year on account of National Wage Cases (Table 3, first column). A further slight deceleration in earnings occurred despite this because the market continued to bear down on the more flexible elements in earnings formation-othe r awards, overawards and overtime working (see Table 3). The institutional element of wage fixation under the present system is not, of course, determined in a vacuum; by its very nature it is, however, several steps removed from the direct operation of market forces. As indicated above, in the adjustment necessitated by the massive wage increases of 1974, National Wage Case determined increases have moved in the opposite direction to other elements. There is, of course, a strong_possibility that this greater institutional contribution to awards and earnings has facilitated in some measure the lesser contribution from those other elements. The key question, however, is whether, in the prevailing circumstances, smaller national wage decisions would have been compensated fully by more rapid increases from other sources. On the evidence of Table 3, it appears likely that smaller National Wage Case increases in 1976 would have resulted in smaller earnings increases. The Recovery Process in 1976-77 Sources of Growth in 1976 In this document a year ago it was noted that: The second half of 1975-76 saw the beginnings of what, assuming continued progress in dealing with inflation, should on this occasion be a sustainable upturn.' The upturn did, in fact, continue into 1976-77 and was the strongest and most sustained lift in demand and activity since the onset of recession in 1974. Its characteristics differed significantly from the ephemeral upturn in demand and activity in the first half of 1975. On that occasion, as Chart1 and Table4 show, a large part of the increase in final demand emanated from the public sector, having its origins in the very large increase in Commonwealth outlays in 1974-75. The exceptional increases in real household incomes in 1974 produced some growth in private consumption expenditure in 1975, but this weakened again later in the year as innation continued at high levels. There was little support from any of the other elements of private domestic final demand. In contrast, the upturn in 1976 was concentrated in the private sector and fairly widely based. Table4 shows percentage point contributions of major demand components to movements in gross domestic product, including the separate contributions of private and government domestic final demand.

(6) The positive contribution to growth from stocks in the first half of 1977 was entirely due to a large recorded increase (in seasonally adjusted terms) in farm and miscellaneous stocks (principally wool and wheat) in the June quarter. The rate of accumulation of non-farm stocks slowed in the half-year, contributing negatively to product growth. In both 1974 and 1975, to a lesser extent, the contribution of private domestic final demand to GDP growth was weak and during fiscal 1974-75 much less than that of the government sector (this being the more remarkable since the latter is about one-third the size of the former). As long as that situation continued there could have been no prospect of a durable economic recovery. Recovery could not be sustained by burgeoning public expenditures because the associated intensification of inflation and inflationary expectations was generating offsetting depressive effects on private expenditures and eroding the international competitiveness of domestic producers. (The elements of this nexus were discussed in this document last year under the heading Factors in Continued Recession.) Policy, in recognition of this, has been aimed at controlling innation and fostering private sector revival. The rate of increase in Budget outlays decelerated sharply during 1975-76 before levelling out in 1976-77. The domestic deficit showed a broadly similar pattern, though it turned down a little later; approximate seasonally adjusted half-yearly figures are shown in Table 5.

(b) The usual seasonal pattern of receipts has been much affected by the introduction of the indexation adjustments to PAYE instalment deductions on 1 July 1976. Special allowance has been made for this in arriving at the seasonally adjusted figures for receipts and the domestic deficit in 1976-77. Similar allowance has been made throughout for changing patterns of company tax and personal income tax refunds. The strengthening of private expenditure in 1976 was thus of considerable significance for the durability of the upturn. As Table4 shows, private final demand was a major element in the strengthening of GDP in both halves of 1976. Just as higher, and for a time accelerating, inflation and inflationary expectations exacerbated the weakening in private sector expenditures in 1974 and continued to contribute to subdued overall performance in 1975, the easing of inflationary pressures-bot h actual and expectedfacilitated expansion of private spending in 1976. One important element in this, which parallels the experience of overseas countries as inflation rates were brought under an increasing measure of control, has been the continued unwinding of the household saving ratio which began tentatively in 1975. Table6 shows the patterns of change in income, consumption and the saving ratio ovsr the past three years.

(b) Deflated by implicit price deflator for private consumption. (c) Ratio of household saving to household disposable income. Real household disposable income was rising through 1976 but tbe saving ratio was declining and consumption advanced more quickly than incomes. In 1976 as a whole consumption was 2.6 per cent higher than in 1975; household disposable income was 0.7 per cent higher, while the saving ratio declined by 1.5 percentage points. Declining innation and expanding business profitability during 1976 also shifted business confidence, actual and prospective rates of return on capital outlays, and flows of internal funds in the direction required for greater investment activity. As a result, a prospect began to emerge for the most sustained revival in business fixed investment for some years. As noted earlier, plant and equipment investment increased in 1976, and although expenditure on non-residential building and construction fell further in 1976, the value of approvals and commencements began to rise from early in the year. Other factors were working to bolster plant and equipment investment in 1976. The investment allowance has been in force since 1 January 1976 and for the first half of that year double depreciation provisions also applied to a wide range of plant and equipment expenditures. Continued high unit labour costs were also encouraging investment of the labour-saving variety. (Seasonally adjusted) Average 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1968-69 to Sept. Dec. March June Sept. Dec.

Improvements in the investment climate to date fall well short of what is required to permit a full investment recovery. For instance, as Table7 shows, the company profit share remains significantly below its longer term norm. A feature of the economic recovery in other countries, even in the United States, has been the persistent relative sluggishness of business fixed investment despite a return to normal levels of profitability. This has raised questions about the prospective rate of return which businessmen now regard as adequate to justify the perceived risks associated with long-term capital projects in an environment of uncertainty and continued high inflation. Such questions are no less relevant in the Australian context. Stock accumulation contributed significantly to GDP growth in 1976-particularl y so in the turnaround from decumulation to accumulation in the first half of the year (Table 4). The stocks/sales ratio (Table 7) had fallen in 1975 to an uncharacteristically low level for the recession phase of the cycle; severe stock shedding took place in the face of shrunken corporate cash flows and high costs of holding stocks. An easing of some of those factors and the improved outlook for sales allowed normal cyclical accumulation in 1976. The stocks/sales ratio declined a little further in early 1976 as a result of expanding sales, but this was reversed in the second half of the year. Although higher importing fairly fully matched stock building throughout 1976, there was sustained growth in export volumes until the final quarter of the year. In summary, 1976 saw the beginnings of what promised to be a sustainable recovery in economic activity, based on growth in private sector expenditures occurring in an environment of declining innation and restorative changes to the basic economic distortions that have been dampening consumer and business spending in recent years. However, the rates of increase in most of the expenditure and product aggregates in 1976 were not as strong as in previous recoveries and the 1976 expansion was more uneven, both across sectors and over time. Opinions differed, therefore, about the durability of recovery. A lift in activity of this magnitude would usually have been enough to raise employment sufficiently to reduce unemployment notwithstanding a continuing growth in the workforce. In fact, as noted earlier in this Statement under Activity and Employment, and illustrated in Chart 5, total non-farm employment grew only slightly over 1976;' wage and salary earner employment in the private sector actually declined and no impression was made on unemployment. Even after allowance for the usual productivity growth in the early recovery stage of the business cycle (Chart 5) the employment response, particularly for wage and salary earners (Table 8), was weak. Analysis of this topic is clearly of great importance. Table4 (and Chart 1) showed the significant contribution of exports to domestic product growth in 1976. The relatively low labour intensiveness of many exporting industries would, of course, have enabled expansion of output to occur in those areas with relatively little employment growth. Discussion of the employment response to recovery in 1976 would be totally inadequate, however, if it failed to take up the implications of the persistence of the imbalance between real wage levels and productivity. Table8 brings together some key aspects of the problem. Columns1 and 2 of the table compare the product real wage with productivity, both measured on a per manhour basis. The product real wage, which was out of line with productivity at the beginning of 1976, remained so through the year, despite the sizeable increase in productivity that served to slow the increase in unit labour costs and prices. The associated trend in wage and salary earner employment is shown clearly in the table.

While cyclical productivity growth during 1976 ameliorated the real wage/ productivity imbalance for a time, the implications of the remaining imbalance for future employment growth should also be viewed in the context of the relationship between the product real wage and trend productivity. Moreover, the measure of the product real wage shown in Table8 can be further refined to render its comparison with productivity more accurately illustrative of the remaining wage cost drag on improvements in labour market conditions. The national accounts concept of average earnings, while it does take in more than purely wage costs and, in contrast to the male-units earnings series, does reflect the effect of the transition to equal pay for females, does not encompass payroll taxa significant non-wage labour cost. Chart 6, which again uses March quarter 1973 as the base period, compares average real male and female awards, and average wages, salaries and supplements (national accounts basis) augmented by payroll tax per man-hour, with actual productivity per man-hour and trend productivity (calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the basis of estimated movements in productivity and employment from 1964-65 to 1975-76). The remaining real wage/productivity distortion, relative to both aclual and trend productivity, is clearly large. As discussed in the Report of the Working Party on the Measurement of Labour Productivity, market sector productivity is the appropriate basis to consider in wage determination processes. Data on that basis, available only annually to 1975-76, were presented in the Commonwealth Submission to the August 1977 National Wage Case. In this document movements in the real product wage and other unit wage series are compared with productivity movements for the non-farm sector up to the June quarter 1977. The general picture of relativities between real labour costs and productivity for the non-farm sector has been broadly similar to that for the market sector. 1977-The First Half In the most recent half-year a number of factors temporarily interrupted the moderate expansion in total final demand; the non-domestic production sources of supply (non-farm stocks and imports) contributed negatively and non-farm product declined slightly. With farm product (and stocks) recording increases the decline in total domestic product was less. Unemployment drifted upwards. Private domestic final demand was a little lower in the second half of 1976-77 than in thefirsthalf (Chart1 and Table 4). One contributing factor was the slackening in thefirsthalf of 1977 in the previously very strong growth of private investment in dwellings discussed above (Chart 1, panel b). More generally, significant re-scheduling of expenditures from the second to the first half of the financial year accompanied devaluation: the December quarter of 1976 saw some consumption expenditure and investment in plant and equipment brought forward because of expectations of import price increases prior to and immediately after devaluation. Thus some of 1977's (first half) weakness in expenditure was 1976's (second half) strength; taking 1976-77 as a whole, private domestic final demand increased by 3.0 per cent. Table4 displays the substantial negative contribution to product growth stemming from net foreign trade in the most recent half-year, with both a decline in exports and a strong increase in imports contributing to this result. The weakness in the balance of trade in the half-year reflected a number of factors (see the Balance of Payments section of this Statement). In particular, the increase in the volume of imports was stronger than the general level of domestic expenditure would have indicated. Some of that strength appears to reflect the lagged effect of forward ordering of imports in anticipation of devaluation. The varying prominence of non-farm inventories in the cyclical process has also contributed to the unevenness of total non-farm output. Following a strong positive contribution to product growth at the turnaround, non-farm stock accumulation abated and was contributing negatively to product growth in the first half of 1977. Moreover, in contrast to 1976, when non-farm stock movements and imports were offsetting, they were working in tandem to depress domestic production in the first half of 1977. Other economies have experienced a similar pattern of strong contribution to product growth from stock movements in the early part of recovery, giving way to a dampening influence later as the rate of accumulation eased, off. This varying cyclical behaviour of stocks was, for example, one of the main elements in the so-called 'pause' in the US. recovery late in 1976. The foregoing discussion embraces the readily identifiable reasons for the easing in economic activity between the first and second halves of 1976-77. Signs that they were largely transitory, rather than indicative of a petering out of recovery, began to emerge late in 1976-77. Although occurring too late to have much effect on the halfyearly movements in the relevant national accounts aggregates, retail sales and motor vehicle registrations strengthened over the course of the June quarter. Likewise, some renewed growth in export volumes and the beginnings of a more pronounced decline in import volumes presaged a more substantial turnaround on trade account. After falling in the March quarter, non-farm product increased by i per cent in the June quarter. Balance of Payments In 1976-77 there was an overall balance of paymentr deficit of $481 million, following a deficit of SI020 million in 1975-76. An increased current account deficit, attributable to both a reduced trade surplus and increased net invisible payments, was more than offset by a much larger net apparent capital inflow than in 1975-76. At the end of 1976-77, international reserves stood at $3.3 billion, slightly higher than the level a year earlier. For analytical purposes, external account developments during 1976-77 should be divided into two periods-the five months prior to devaluation of the Australian dollar at the end of November 1976, and the period thereafter. Table9 below presents balance of payments aggregates for 1975-76 and 1976-77 (on a seasonally unadjusted basis). The Pre-devaluation Period At the beginning of 1976-77 there was apprehension about the eventual impact on the balance of payments of the high, though moderating, domestic innation rate. However, notwithstanding the continued growth in costs and prices in Australia at a faster rate than overseas, the average monthly trade surplus in the first five months of 1976-77 was larger than in either of the two preceding half-years. Towards the end of the period there were some signs of a weakening in the trade account. After showing (unsustainably) strong growth in the September quarter, exports fell in subsequent months; at the same time growth in imports quickened and, in retrospect, there appears to have been some advance ordering of (and paying, or covering forward against paying, for) imports in expectation of a change in the exchange rate. Notwithstanding continuing growth in net invisible payments abroad, the deficit on current account remained relatively moderate in the pre-devaluation period. The immediate external problem, therefore, was in the capital account. Despite significant overseas borrowing on official account, including a S309 million drawing under the IMF's Compensatory Financing Facility, reserves fell by almost S500 million in the period between end-June and 26 November 1976. There was a net apparent private capital outflow in the first five months of 1976-77 of over $600 million, powerfully influenced by exchange rate expectations; a substantial part of this outflow was attributable to speculative leading of import payments and lagging of export receipts. As a result, by 26 November official reserve assets were about one-third lower than a year earlier.

(6) Constitutes external account element in formulation of private sector primary liquidity, (c) Estimate only. Against the background of this continuing loss of reserves, and the continued deterioration in Australia's underlying external competitive position, it was decided, with effect from 29 November 1976, to devalue the Australian dollar by 17.5 per cent and to institute a more flexibly administered exchange rate system. The immediate objective was to reverse the earlier speculative outflow of capital and to ease the sectional burden being shouldered by certain areas of the mining, rural and manufacturing industries in the effort to overcome inflation. At the same time, in recognition of the effect of devaluation on the overall setting of macro-economic policy, fiscal and monetary policies were tightened and the Government argued consistently that direct price effects of devaluation should not flow through into wages via indexation. Capital flows were being monitored closely and, as discussed below, inflow controls were soon extended. The objective was to preserve the gains from devaluation by minimising its potential second-round flow-on into the domestic cost and price structure. The Post-devaluation Period Devaluation had an immediate effect on capital transactions: the private capital outflows of the preceding months were quickly replaced by a very high rate of capital inflow. In December/January net apparent private capital inflow totalled about $900 million, reflecting a resurgence of new overseas borrowing and the start of the process of unwinding of pre-devaluation leads and lags in trade payments. Although the rate of private capital inflow diminished after the initial devaluation was reduced to 12.45 per cent in a series of eight steps, for the two-month period as a whole there was a balance of payments surplus of over $650 million. In view of these developments, and the large inflows in prospect, as evidenced by applications for exchange control approval to borrow overseas, early action was taken, with effect from 17 January, to strengthen controls on overseas borrowing. The embargo on short-term overseas borrowings was extended to all borrowings repayable in less than two years, and a variable deposit requirement of 25 per cent was imposed on borrowings for two years or more for specific non-exempt purposes. This latter measure brought the effective interest cost of such funds more into line with that of domestic borrowing. These extended controls, and dissipation of the unwinding of pre-devaluation leads and lags, resulted in a moderation in the rate of private capital inflow. In the last five months of the year, private capital inflow was much the same in total as in the two preceding months. However, after allowance for small net capital payments overseas on official account and a small net inflow as a result of marketing authorities' capital transactions, total net apparent capital inflow was a little over $1650 million in the post-devaluation period. The impact of devaluation-in particular its time profile-o n the current account was more complex. As expected, the initial effects of the exchange rate change on export and import prices in Australian dollar terms showed up quite rapidly. Most export prices (in Australian dollars) responded quickly to devaluation (see Table 2); most of our exporters are price takers in world markets or sell under contracts denominated in foreign currencies. These initial gains appear largely to have been held. Similarly, import prices (in Australian dollars) rose substantially in the period immediately following devaluation (see Table 2). The response of export and import volumes to such price changes is lagged. The lags involved are variable according to the particular circumstances of the time, and can be masked in actual figures by the operation of other factors. The postdevaluation period provides an interesting example. On the exports side, the immediate effect of devaluation on Australian dollar prices was partially offset by a period of subdued overseas demand for some main export commodities (e.g. wool, sugar and a number of minerals and metals) and by the effect of industrial disputes. The volume of exports in the second half of 1976-77 was therefore lower than in the first half. Even in the context of devaluation that is not surprising; while in some cases demand increases can be met by reducing existing stocks at near post-devaluation prices, in general the effect of devaluation on export volumes is very slow .to emerge-especiall y for rural commodities with annual production cycles. The continued subdued overseas demand for some major Australian exports also served to delay the volume response. The total value of imports increased sharply following devaluation. Apart from the price increases noted above, there was a strong rise in the volume of imports in the March quarter. In the closing months of 1976-77 the volume of imports began to decline; in the June quarter imports of goods and services (seasonally adjusted at constant prices) fell by 5 per cent but remained above pre-devaluation levels. There appear to have been two main explanations for the delay in the emergence of the volume effects of devaluation (i.e. a shift away from imports to cheaper domestic substitutes). First, because of relatively slack domestic demand conditions, which led to some unintended stock accumulation, the price effects of devaluation, as reflected in import prices, were slow to be passed on to final buyers; that would be consistent witb the sharp drop in the profit share in the June quarter (Table 7). The six-week price 'pause' in the June quarter of 1977 may also have been relevant. Secondly, it appears that substantial orders for imports may have been placed late in 1976 in anticipation of devaluation, with the arrival being concentrated in the first half of 1977. The net outcome of these developments was a substantial reduction in the trade surplus in the post-devaluation period. With the net deficit on invisible transactions also adversely affected by devaluation in the short term, and with adverse seasonal factors operating in the period involved, the current account deficit increased appreciably. However, the resumption of private capital inflow more than offset the increase in the current account deficit. As a result there was an overall balance of payments surplus of $199 million in the last seven months of 1976-77. Monetary Conditions Table 10 and Chart7 set out the main factors producing changes in private sector liquidity and the volume of money over 1976-77 and the preceding two financial years. Table 11 provides quarterly data on the asset composition of movements in the portfolios of government securities of major financial sectors over 1976-77 and the preceding twofinancialyears. Strong injections from domestic budgetary transactions continued to be the dominant influence on private sector liquidity, with the domestic Budget deficit estimated to have run at seasonally adjusted annual rates of around $2100 million in the first half of 1976-77 and $1900 million in the second half. Despite the drop between the two half-years, these seasonally adjusted figures mask an even stronger than usual within-year swing in domestic budgetary transactions, stemming largely from the concentration of company tax collections in the last four months of the financial year (see Chart 8). With the known prospect of an unusually large end-year seasonal liquidity contraction, adequate preparation within the private sector by way of stocking portfolios with short-term Government securities during the liquidity upswing was an important aim of monetary management early in the year. To facilitate that process, Treasury Note yields were raised. Following the seasonally tight June quarter of 1976, private sector liquidity increased markedly in the September quarter, with the effects of the domestic Budget deficit of $2106 million only partly countered by unwinding of the Reserve Bank's commercial bill portfolio and a drain from private sector foreign exchange transactions. Substantial subscriptions to the July 1976 Commonwealth loan by the non-bank private sector were largely offset by sales of already issued securities to the authorities so that net nonbank take-up of Government debt amounted to only a moderate $156 million in the quarter. 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 Sept.

See footnote (g) to Table 10 Ease in nnanciai conditions at this time was evidenced by strong growth in the monetary aggregates and in the balance sheets of major financial institutions. Subsequent financing of speculation against the exchange rate was facilitated and adverse expectations about the rate were reinforced by perception of the inflationary implications of domestic monetary ease. This meant that measures of domestic credit showed more rapid expansion than did the usual monetary indicators. Notwithstanding the end of the seasonal run-down in the preceding June quarter, private short-term interest rates declined only a little in the early months of 1976-77. Expectations of early official interest rate reductions, which had been gathering some strength earlier in the year, were not maintained and sales of Government paper continued sluggish in October. Against this background, and in pursuance of the Government's monetary objectives -that monetary growth should provide sufficient funds to foster sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while exerting some downward pressure on inflation-monetar y policy instruments were tightened in early November. With primary liquidity growing strongly, restraint in secondary credit creation was required for financial conditions to be less than fully accommodating to inflation. These measures included further increases in yields on very short-term Government securities leading through to higher yields on short and medium Government paper, a percentage point rise in the SRD ratio and guidance to restrain lending by financial intermediaries. Nonetheless, speculation against the currency-strongl y in evidence in September and October-continued , leading to the devaluation in late November. To offset the expansionary monetary impact of the expected post-devaluation unwinding of leads and lags in trade payments and the turnaround in other private capital flows, further increases in official yields at the time of the devaluation were followed by increased restrictions on overseas borrowings in January and the series of small revaluations over the December-February period. The SRD ratio was increased from 6 per cent to 10 per cent in steps of one percentage point, the last increase being in February. Added emphasis was given to slowing the pace of lending by various intermediaries. The rapid strengthening of demand for Treasury Notes in the December quarter-particularl y in the latter part-is reflected in Table 11. In the March quarter, primary liquidity rose by SI 031 million; an aggregate Budget deficit of SI 171 million in January and February more than offset a surplus of S518 million in March. Private sector foreign exchange transactions, having turned to surplus, added strongly to liquidity. Non-bank accumulation of Government paper early in the quarter was largely unwound in March as the seasonal tax harvest got under way; over the quarter as a whole, Treasury Notes in, the hands of non-bank holders fell by $366 million while their stocks of other securities (which include Treasury Bonds and Australian Savings Bonds) increased by S468 million. A substantial run-off in banks' commercial bill holdings and diminished demand for other accommodation following devaluation meant that trading bank advances outstanding declined by $373 million in seasonally adjusted terms in January and February but resumed their growth in March. At the time of the seasonal liquidity peak at around end-February, private sector holdings of very short-dated assets seemed adequate, in aggregate, to negotiate the prospective large liquidity contraction associated with the very substantial tax harvest. The capacity of the banking system to finance this seasonal funds transfer was augmented by reversion of the LGS ratio from 23 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 April. In early April, major trading banks' margins of free liquidity averaged a little over 10 percentage points but with considerable dispersion between banks.

Aggregate funds flows to the Government on Budget account during the period turned' out to be fairly well in line with expectations; none the less, some tight periods in markets were occasioned by difficulties in matching the maturity structure of assets with an imperfectly known pattern of fundsflows.Sensitive private short-term interest rates increased seasonally. Reflecting some revision to interest rate expectations and a level of rates more in accord with the market's more optimistic perception of current and future rates of inflation following the publication of the consumer price index for the March quarter, the non-bank private sector subscribed heavily to the Commonwealth May loan and subsequently made substantial net purchases of Government paper through the market (see Table 11). This, together with some reversion to deficit in private sector foreign exchange transactions in May-June, sharply reduced the liquidity of major trading banks at the tail-end of the drain. To maintain the banks' liquidity positions, the SRD ratio was reduced by two percentage points around year-end. In last year's Budget Speech the Treasurer foreshadowed that growth in the broadly denned volume of money, M3, in the 10-12 per cent range during 1976-77 would be consistent with the aims of Government policy. The 10.6 per cent increase recorded in M3 for the year, compared with 13.8 per cent in 1975-76, signifies considerable success in the operation of monetary policy during a year which was not without its difficulties and in which circumstances changed markedly as it unfolded. A substantial within-year firming of monetary conditions is indicated in the reduction in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of M3 from IS per cent in the half-year to December 1976 to 6 per cent in the half-year to June 1977-thoug h problems of seasonal adjustment exaggerate the apparent turnaround. This pattern partly reflects the fact that, following devaluation, demands were made on the monetary instruments additional to those already required by fiscal settings in order to maintain the overall anti-inflationary stance of policy. In early July the controls on overseas borrowings reverted to their settings prior to mid-January. An important element of the monetary outcome was the contribution that $1089 million in sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank private sector, made towards financing the large domestic Budget deficit. Australian Savings Bonds continued to prove a useful addition to the set of monetary instruments, netting (after allowance for redemptions of Special Bonds and Savings Bonds) $366 million in subscriptions, almost all by the non-bank sector. Although holdings rose substantially over the liquidity upswing, aggregate Treasury Note portfolios of non-bank groups declined marginally over the year as a whole. The bulk of the growth in holdings of other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds) was concentrated in the seasonally tight half year. (Table 11 contains details of Government financing transactions.) As in 1975-76, when a net $1122 million (or 77 per cent of total non-bank take-up) was received from Australian Savings Bonds, non-bank take-up of Government paper accounted for over 50 per cent of the domestic Budget deficit. Reflecting a complex of factors, some data pertaining to which appear in Table 10, banking sector (excluding Reserve Bank) holdings of government debt fell by $252 million in 1976-77 compared with a rise of $71 million in 1975-76. This, together with portfolio adjustments of other sectors, meant that 56 per cent of total Budget financing was accounted for by borrowings from the Reserve Bank in 1976-77. Further details of Budget financing are set out in Statement No. 5. While sale of Government securities to the non-bank sector is generally the least inflationary method of financing a given deficit, that policy mix does not have the same advantages for anti-inflationary policy as a smaller Budget deficit. The securities acquired may be highly liquid assets readily convertible into cash-indee d even longer term bonds can be monetised without significant capital loss if official interest rates are notflexibleupwards. Furthermore, the size of the public sector borrowing requirement has direct implications for the cost and availability of funds for private borrowers in nnanciai markets. These points have added force when, against the background of a succession of large Budget deficits, the stock of outstanding Government debt has been greatly swollen. The deficit financing task during 1976-77 was not, then, just to place new paper in the hands of firm holders but to ensure also that as far as possible the outstanding stock in the hands of non-bank holders remained in such hands. The public sector's borrowing requirement seems to have been a little larger in 1976-77 than in 1975-76, after allowance for prepayment by the Commonwealth late in 1975-76 of some funds required by the States in 1976-77, which implied an artificial switch of State budget deficits from the earlier year to 1976-77. The reduction in the Commonwealth's Budget deficit was more than offset by growth in the borrowing programs of public authorities outside the Budget sector. Although corporate pronts continued to record firm growth and demand for investment funds remained subdued in 1976-77, substantial stock accumulation may have meant (the data are extremely limited) that the corporate sector's borrowing requirement was larger than in 1975-76. New fixed interest raisings grew strongly in 1976 while equity financing by listed companies was 2 i times the level of the year before. Trie fall in share prices over the early part of 1976-77 was reversed at the time of devaluation. The Sydney Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index was 3 per cent lower at 30 June 1977 than a year earlier. The household sector's demand for funds remained firm, particularly for personal loans and housing finance. These financing requirements were met without a sharp rise in the general level of private sector interest rates; administered rates were unchanged. First mortgage rates for housing finance held steady. With the strong inflow of funds to banks and building societies during the liquidity upswing, lending for housing returned to a high level in the second half of 1976. In the March quarter 1977, when deposit growth was slower than expected, lending fell more than seasonally. However, the effects were short-lived, and a renewed pick-up began in the June quarter. Background The preceding analysis has portrayed an economy that, for a variety of reasons, experienced a temporary pause in domestic activity around the end of calendar 1976 and into the early months of 1977. In discussing the various elements of the total picture, attention has been drawn to factors which could be expected to continue to depress and to others whioh can be expected to prove transitory. Most important in the latter category is that the balance of payments on current account has begun to show signs of improvement and can be expected to improve further over the months ahead. The expected gains from devaluation are taking time to emerge for import-competing industries, but should gather further momentum over the course of 1977-78. On the other hand, there are continuing forces, associated with still high inflation and the level of real wages, which will serve to hold back the pace of private sector recovery, and, more especially, of employment growth. Government policy for some time now has 'been based on the premise that control of inflation is fundamental to the achievement of other economic policy objectives. Some success has been achieved but the reduction of inflation necessarily remains the primary economic policy objective. It has also been increasingly recognised that long term sustainable recovery in the economy will be possible only if the profitability of investment is restored to an adequate level. The Government has consistently pressed the case for continued moderation in wage increases as a means both of reducing inflation and restoring corporate profitability and employment. There have been encouraging improvements in profitability, but even after allowance for the innuence of underutilised capacity, the rate of return on invested funds would not appear to be sufficient to ensure an adequate level of investment in the medium term. The prospects for significant growth in employment depend very much on the trend in real wages. So long as the price of labour, and particularly certain categories of labour, remains excessive relative to its product, there will continue to be both a tendency for contraction in the overall scale of production and, for any particular level of activity, a heightened tendency to substitute capital for labour. The latter process is now seemingly occurring at an advanced rate. Clearly, if the wage settlement processes do not serve to further reduce the share of labour in the national income, market forces will operate to reduce employment or at least the rate of growth of employment, and the same end will be attained-bu t more slowly and much more painfully. Changes in wage relativities and compression of margins have led to a change in the composition of unemployment at the cost of the female labour force, the young and the unskilled. Those changes cannot easily be reversed. In January this year, the Government announced in broad terms its intentions for this year's Budget; namely, constraining government outlays to within zero real growth and further reducing the deficit. These intentions were seen as consistent with the overall requirements of policy, and they remain so. In the months since then, the Government has reaffirmed in its decision-making the weight it places on the desirability of continuing fiscal restraint. As elaborated in the Treasurer's Budget Speech, not only is this expected to contribute directly to the primary objective of policy but also to permit, at an appropriate stage of the developing situation, some easing of the overall settings of monetary policy. Expenditure growth has, accordingly, been held back to 10.S per cent in nominal terms and the deficit is estimated to be $2217 million (the corresponding domestic deficit is $1347 million). This compares with recorded deficits of $2740 million in 1976-77 and $3585 million in 1975-76 (and domestic deficits in the two years of $1995 million and $2905 million respectively). What then is the economic outlook for 1977-78 and the period ahead given the Government's Budget decisions and' the background of other relevant developments? Forecasting is an uncertain undertaking at any time but is the more difficult in a period in which -the economy is operating outside its normal range of functioning. A table of key economic ratios introduced in this Statement last year served to illustrate this observation. Its updated counterpart, Table 7, indicates that although considerable progress has been made in the return to stable conditions there is still some way to go. As already noted, the continuing high rate of inflation, together with the continuing high cost of labour relative to capital, have their implications for the recovery path. They also have their implications for uncertainty surrounding private sector expectations and decision-making. These heightened uncertainties naturally translate into uncertainties attaching to the macro-economic outlook. Expectations are obviously crucial, but the ways in which, and the extent to which, policy influences them cannot be predicted with precision. The following description necessarily makes judgments about how expectations are and will be developing and, on that basis, details the most likely path that the economy will take. By the nature of the exercise, the description cannot hope to be correct in all its specific elements although, hopefully, greater certainty should attach to the broad picture. Assumptions The following assumptions underlie the overall forecast. The improved budgetary situation will permit some gradual easing in monetary instruments over the course of 1977-78; the broad aim will remain to administer monetary policy so as to continue to provide adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down on inflation and inflationary expectations. o Apart from the Budget proposals themselves, there will be no new fiscal measures during 1977-78. o The recovery in overseas economies will continue at a steady, albeit moderate, rate and Australia's balance of payments will strengthen over the course of 1977-78. o Seasonal conditions will be broadly consistent with a level of real farm product similar to that in 1976-77. o Partial indexation of award wages will continue, as will restraint in increases outside the indexation guidelines. It should be explicitly acknowledged that, so far as the last of these assumptions is concerned, the factors governing it are only indirectly within Commonwealth policy innuence. Yet there oan be no question that full indexation of wages would have most serious repercussions. Equally, exclusion from award wage adjustments of changes in the consumer price index attributable to devaluation and oil price increases is essential if the desired effects of these changes are to be fully garnered. To the extent that devaluation serves simply to raise the general domestic cost and price structure, its intended effect of increasing relative prices (and profitability) in the import-competing and export industries will not be achieved; similarly, if oil price increases flow significantly into prices generally via wage indexation adjustments, then the intended relative price effects of the policy will be to that extent eroded. Expenditures Private consumption expenditure is expected to grow at a moderate rate over the course of 1977-78, this being accompanied, as in 1976-77, by some decline in the saving ratio. Real household disposable income was boosted in the September quarter by the introduction of personal tax indexation and the new system of family allowances. It then fell slowly in the remaining quarters but for the year as a whole was 1.6 per cent higher than in 1975-76. Consumption increased by 2.8 per cent. In early 1977-78 there was again a significant increase in real disposable income because of the annual indexation adjustment of tax scales. The changes to the tax scales taking effect in February 1978 will lead to a further significant increase in the second half of the year. Further easing in the labour market could tend to dampen consumer confidence; so too would any acceleration in the rate of inflation. On the other hand a lift in private expenditures is now Occurring as the timing and other effects of the devaluation on spending recede. In summary, moderate growth in consumption is expected, accompanied by a lower average saving ratio than in 1976-77, but remaining well above its average level over the 1960s. Investment in dwellings weakened in the first half of 1977, as the industry cleared its excess stocks and the rate of loan approvals by major lenders slackened temporarily. Loan approvals quickened over the past quarter and the government has acted to remove any official restraints on lending for private home building. After allowance for some lag for these developments to show up in work done, the prospect is for activity in this area to return during 1977-78 to the high levels achieved in mid-1976. The timing of investment in plant and equipment over the course of 1976-77 has been influenced by taxation concessions and by the forward shift of investment in anticipation of devaluation-induced price rises. The marked improvement in corporate profitability and in actual and expected inflation, together with the incentive to substitute capital for over-costly labour, have all contributed to lifting the underlying growth in investment. Continued improvement in inflationary expectations and profitability, the expected modest uplift in domestic spending and product, and a quickening in the pace of mining activity should see the flatness in investment in plant and equipment of early 1977 give way to significant expansion over the course of 1977-78. Year-on-year growth may, however, be quite moderate as a result of the pattern of investment over the course of 1976-77. The outlook for investment in other building and construction is also encouraging. The steep decline in expenditure of the past two years appears to have been arrested in the first half of 1977. Private other (non-residential) building approvals and commencements, though erratic, were substantially higher in the second half of 1976 and into 1977 than a year or so earlier; and while the precise timing of the resultant investment is uncertain the outlook is for growth in this area through 1977-78. Private expenditure in the heavy construction area seems likely to benefit progressively from important new mineral developments expected to get under way in the period ahead. Continued growth in government current expenditures over the course of 1976-77primarily at the level of State and local governments-ha s been partly offset by declines in government capital expenditures. 1977-78 could well see more moderate growth in current expenditures together with some growth in capital expenditures. Again, however, growth is likely to be stronger at the State and local government levels; growth in the Commonwealth sector will be largely confined to semi-government authorities. The evidence of the past two quarters is that non-farm stock accumulation has slowed a little from the rates recorded in the second half of 1976. The ratio of stocks to sales now lies somewhat above the level of recent experience and, with a more moderate rate of growth in consumption than in 1976, there could be modest stock decumulation over 1977-78. Balance of Payments External transactions in 1977'-78 will continue to respond to the net depreciation of the exchange rate in late 1976-early 1977 and the further depreciation in early August, as well as to overseas and domestic economic conditions. Overall, there is likely to be a deficit in the early part of the year, largely reflecting normal seasonal influences. However, with our international reserves now realistically valued and with a renewed program of moderate but steady borrowing abroad on government account, Australia's reserves are such that no difficulty is expected in financing such a deficit. During the latter part of the year, the balance of payments is expected to strengthen, with a resumption of additions to reserves. The present outlook is for continuing real growth, at a moderate pace, in Australia's major export markets. Subdued overseas demand in the early part of the year for certain Australian products may be followed by a strengthening as the year progresses. Export receipts should benefit from higher average prices, partly as a result of the full-year effect of devaluation. Higher Australian dollar import prices resulting from devaluation should lead to increasing substitution of domestic production for imports, which may also be affected by clearing of what may well have become some excess stocks. The trade balance is thus expected to strengthen further as the year progresses and the current account deficit should follow a similar pattern. On capital account, with the resumption of long-term official borrowing overseas already noted, a moderate net inflow is expected on government capital account. Transactions of primary produce marketing authorities are however expected to result in a net capital outflow in 1977-78, mainly in the first half of the year. Net apparent private capital inflow should increase in 1977-78. In particular, the prospects for increased domestic investment, and continued progress in reducing the underlying rate of inflation, should lead to higher long-term investment from overseas. Monetary Conditions The foregoing would imply moderate net monetary inflow on private sector account during 1977-78. The other major primary formation factor-domesti c budgetary transactions-is estimated to contribute substantially less to private sector holdings of LGS assets than in 1976-77. Borrowings under approved programs for semi-government (Commonwealth and State) and local authorities are expected to increase by S24S million (see Budget Paper No. 7). The aggregate public sector demand for borrowed funds is thus likely to be no greater than in 1976-77. Security sales to the non-bank sector have been very strong in the past several months primarily reflecting, it would seem, expectations of lower interest rates associated with a more favourable inflation prospect. Given the favourable outlook for gross corporate profits, the present expectations for increased business fixed capital expenditure, the relatively small increase in company tax collections (see Statement 4) and the possible stock decumulation, the corporate sector seems likely to require, in aggregate, considerably less in borrowed funds from other sectors in 1977-78 than in 1976-77. The overall policy context of this Budget should serve to sustain the strength of official bond sales. This, when coupled with likely business demand for funds, holds open the prospect of lower growth in the monetary aggregates than in 1976-77 in conjunction with reduced pressure on interest rates and some gradual easing in the settings of other monetary policy instruments. In this connection, it will be noted from the Budget Speech that official restraints on lending for housing have been removed. Putting a little more precision on the outlook, expected growth in the volume of money (broadly denned) over the course of 1977-78 is in the range of 8-10 per cent given the assumptions and general environment discussed above. If the associated expectations about product and price outcomes are realised, this would continue to represent, as in 1976-77, monetary growth consistent with the objectives of policy; namely, to provide sufficient funds to underwrite sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while maintaining downward pressure on innation and inflationary expectations. Some increase in the velocity of circulation is expected. Product The outlook for domestic demand and the balance of trade is consistent with year-on-year growth in gross non-farm product in real terms of about 2 per cent between 1976-77 and 1977-78. Because of the pattern of change within 1976-77a strong early period followed by a flat close2 per cent growth for 1977-78 as a whole would represent an increase of more than 4 per cent over the course of the year; that is, from June quarter 1977 to June quarter 1978 non-farm product is expected to grow by over 4 per cent, compared with 1 per cent from June quarter 1976 to June quarter 1977. It is of course the rate of growth over the course of the year which influences the prospective trend from now on in such other elements in the outlook as employment and unemployment. Real farm product in 1977-78 will, as always, be greatly influenced by seasonal conditions; at present it is expected to be at much the same level as in 1976-77; on that basis, real aggregate farm income would be likely to fall from the previous year's level. Labour Market Given an expectation that real wage levels will continue to hamper demand for labour, the projected product growth of over 4 per cent over the course of 1977-78 would probably be accompanied by growth in productivity of more than half that amount. Employment growth from June 1977 to June 1978 is therefore likely to be something approaching 2 per cent. For the prospective development of unemployment the relevant comparison is between this anticipated employment increase from June 1977 to June 1978 and the likely change in the labour force over that period. Given expected job opportunities, the participation rate is likely to be litt'e changed at end 1977-78 from end 1976-77. On this basis, the labour force increment from June 1977 to June 1978 would be almost the same as the employment increase. Therefore, although there is some prospect for a reduction in unemployment, on balance the likelihood is for little or no change over this period. Given the pattern of product and employment changes, this through-the-year result would probably be accompanied by further easing (in an implicit seasonally adjusted sense) to around the end of 1977, followed by a moderate down-trend over the course of 1978 as product and employment growth gather momentum. Growth in employment in year-on-year terms in 1977-78 corresponding to growth from June 1977 to June 1978 approaching 2 per cent would be around 1 per cent; labour force growth on this basis would be about the same. The public sector is expected to generate some of this growth in employment, although less than in 1976-77; most of it is expected to occur in the private sector. Prices and Incomes This year's May decision of the Arbitration Commission recognised the serious consequences that would flow from compensating wage earners for devaluation-induced price increases. As noted above, similar consequences would flow from full compensation for the results of oil price increases. On the assumption that there will be some further discounting on both these accounts in the following decisions, with a degree of partial indexation for the balance of the increase in the consumer price index, the outlook for (male) award wages growth in 1977-78 is of the order of lOi per cent following a 12.9 per cent increase in 1976-77. As noted in the discussion of the revenue estimates in Statement No. 4, the assumption that has been adopted for average weekly earnings is that they will also increase by 10! per cent in 1977-78. Because of the effects of the prices and wages 'pause' from mid-April of this year, the increase in the consumer price index in the June quarter was perhaps a little lower than it might otherwise have been. In addition, final prices have not yet fully reflected the increases in import and other prices that occurred in response to devaluation. The unwinding of both these factors may increase somewhat the September quarter outcome for the CPI. Similarly, the decisions relating to the prices of petroleum products will have a direct impact on the CPI in the December quarter and an indirect impact in that and later quarters depending on the speed and extent to which increased costs of transportation and production are passed through into final prices. On the other hand, a number of influences will be acting to reduce the underlying rate of price increase in 1977-78. This Budget continues the overall thrust of policy of the past couple of years-particularl y reductions in the growth in government outlays and in the deficit and a slowing in the rates of increase in the monetary aggregates. Inflationary expectations are undoubtedly being wound down. Judgments about the innation prospect depend on a range of interrelated factors including the rate of profit recovery. A slower rise in unit pronts and or more favourable wage determination developments would mean a lower anticipated innation rate. Whatever the outcome for the year as a whole there should be a first-half increase somewhat higher and a second-half increase somewhat lower than the increase for the year as a whole. That is to say, the expected pattern of change is for a slowing in the rate of innation as 1977-78 progresses; the rate of change of consumer prices in the June quarter 1978 seems likely to be 2-2i per cent. Movements in broadly-based deflators would be of a similar order to that in consumer prices, with the downward trend in rates of change possibly emerging a little earlier. The movement towards import parity for domestic crude oil and other related decisions is expected to add something less than 1 per cent to aggregate price indexes during 1977-78. To the extent that wages are compensated for these policy-induced price rises, the general inflationary effect will, of course, be greater. In terms of the overall inflationary outlook, however, the major contributor will continue to be the wage indexation treadmill; if the Commission were to award increases at a lower degree of indexation than has prevailed, then the increase in prices in 1977-78 could be markedly less than in 1976-77. Projected growth in average weekly earnings and prices would lead to some decline in real average earnings per employed person over the course of 1977-78. Employment growth of the anticipated magnitude would, however, be sufficient to mean no decline in real aggregate earnings over the period. Given the actual and projected changes in personal taxes-the indexation reduction of 1 July 1977 and the new scales of 1 February 1978-cas h benefits and other income components, aggregate real household disposable income would in these circumstances show a noticeable rise over the course of the year, although not much change in year-on-year terms. Together with the expected increase in measured productivity, this outcome for wages and prices would be, as noted above, consistent with a further recovery in the profit share in national income. By mid-1978, factor shares are likely to be closer to the levels of historical experience than for any time since mid-1973. The foregoing picture would represent a further significant step along a path of sustainable growth although not, clearly, one of rapid recovery. As has been the case for several years, recovery will be consolidated and strengthened the more rapidly inflation is wound down. This, in turn, remains heavily dependent on the extent to which money wage increases are held to less than inherited price increases. Arbitral decisions apart, success in that objective will continue to depend on the overall economic environment created by fiscal and monetary policy. PAGE Summary 97 1. Defence 99 2.

The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effects of awards and determinations made in 1976-77 and an increase in service strengths largely associated with the manning of new equipment coming into service and the activation of HMAS Stirling, Cockburn Sound, WA. An increase in the number of pensioners and the effect of pension increases brought about by indexation, offset in part by one less pension payday in 1977-78, are the main factors accounting for the net increase of $14.9 million in the defence forces retirement and death benefits provision. Manpower costs are estimated to account for 52.6 per cent of total defence outlays in 1977-78 compared with 53.1 per cent of actual defence outlays in 1976-77. Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, armour, artillery, etc.) are adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on 'capital' type equipment in 1977-78 are estimated at $318.7 million, or $41.5 million more than in 1976-77. Substantial provision is made for many on-going acquisitions of new equipment including patrol frigates, an oceanographic ship, Oberon submarines, patrol boats and electronic counter measure equipment for the Navy, Leopard medium tanks, Rapier surface to air guided missile systems and Nomad aircraft for the Army and Hercules C130 and Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft for the RAAF. Provision also has been made for a start on some new major equipment projects and on other equipment, details of which will be announced by the Minister for Defence in due course. Expenditure on supporting equipment and stores is estimated at $222.9 million in 1977-78, compared with $196.6 million in 1976-77. Outlays on repair and maintenance of equipment and stores already in service-includin g periodic refit of naval vessels and overhaul of service aircraft, vehicles, etc -is estimated to increase by $5.3 million. Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain facilities, including adequate living and working accommodation for defence personnel. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen and their families are estimated at $26.1 million, $9.0 million less than the amount spent in 1976-77. In addition to this housing, which is being built by State Housing Authorities, the Commonwealth intends to acquire land and construct houses at Rockineham (WA.) for personnel of the Cockburn Sound Naval Support Facilitv and of the ships to be based tbere. Other significant new projects include the acquisition of a large tract of land at Yamni (WA.) for use as a training area, the construction of Staee2 nf the development of Williamstown Naval Dockyard (Vic.) and Point Cook RAAF Base (Vic), and additional fuel storage facilities at military bases. Exoenditure on these and other projects is expected to total $172.2 million in 1977-78 compared with $168.8 million in 1976-77. Tn the main, expenditure under this heading is directed towards the maintenance in Government factories and in industry of reserve production canacity con«iri<T<»d essential for defence purposes. Expenditure is estimated at $53.6 million in 1977-78, compared with $51.3 million in 1976-77. Other exoenditures covered under this item are the costs of production/ development of special defence projects in Government factories, such as Ikara and Turana, and in industry; production assistance for the construction of Nomad aircraft; and the acquisition and maintenance of reserve stocks of essential war material. The Government has also recently announced its approval to the production of a further 25 Nomad aircraft bringing the total approved for production to 120. Expenditure on defence science and technology is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in defence technology and at developing weapons and weapon systems suited to Australia's defence needs. The estimated expenditure of $91.6 million in 1977-78 covers the salaries, other administrative and operating expenses, machinery, plant and works services of defence science establishments and laboratories and the Woomera range. Some reduction in overall manpower levels is planned, but provision has been made for continuation of a modest level of trials activity at Woomera, in conjunction particularly with the United Kingdom. Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region to strengthen their own and the region's defence capacity. Estimated expenditure of $25.9 million in 1977-78 ($25.4 million in 1976-77) includes $7.2 million to Indonesia as part of Australia's current three year commitment program of $25 million which terminates 30 June 1978, and $4.8 million for continuing assistance to Malaysia and Singapore. An amount of $13.2 million is also included for defence co-operation activities with Papua New Guinea in 1977-78, compared with $14.0 million last year. The small decrease reflects the progressive reduction in numbers and support costs of Australian servicemen in Papua New Guinea in line with the continuing localisation of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. The allocation of $0.7 million for 'other countries' reflects the provision of military training and advisory assistance to such countries as the Philippines and Thailand and the development of closer defence relations with Fiji and other countries in the South West Pacific region. This item comprises removal costs of servicemen and their families on re-posting, transfer of defence civil staff and their families, and storage costs associated with those activities. This broad category of expenditure covers a range of items including travel, office requisites, postage and telephone services, fuel, light, power and water supply, freight and cartage, compensation payments and medical and dental services. The budgeted increase of $11.0 million largely reflects increases in the costs of these services and some increased levels of activity. Included under this heading are outlavs on the upkeep of the Natural Disasters Organisation, Commonwealth assistance to State/Territorial Emergency Services through purchases of equipment and stores for those Services, and reimbursement of some salaries paid by the States to their civil defence personnel. Other outlavs for civil defence, maintenance of war graves and various miscellaneous items are also included. The principal elements here are payments made by servicemen under the Defence Force Group Rental Scheme for rent of houses provided for their use, charges made for meals and accommodation provided at Defence establishments, contributions by other countries towards the cost of joint defence activities, revenue from disposal of surplus defence equipment and stores, and miscellaneous receipts. LOAN ACT In 1976-77 it was necessary to transfer an amount of $1504 million of defence expenditure from Consolidated Revenue Fund to Loan Fund to meet a prospective deficit in the former Fund. Expenditures transferred were financed from borrowings. The Budget estimates for 1977-78 show a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $901 million in the absence of further action to meet that deficit. The intention is that this potential deficiency should again be met by transferring sufficient defence expenditures from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund where they will be financed from borrowings for defence purposes. A Loan BiU to authorize these transactions will be introduced into Parliament during the Budget session. 2. EDUCATION Total outlays on education are estimated to increase by $210.9 million-o r 9.8 per cent-in 1977-78 to $2371 million; this total is equivalent to 8.9 per cent of estimated total outlays. The 1977-78 estimates for the programs of the education Commissions relate to the second half of the previously determined 1977 programs and the first half of the recently determined 1978 programs. For 1978 the base programs for universities, colleges of advanced education and schools are to be maintained at the same levels in real terms as in 1977; the base program for technical and further education is to be increased by 10 per cent in real terms. From 1978 these base programs will be supplemented for wage and salary increases in respect of recurrent grants only; up to, and including 1977, supplementation has been provided for all cost increases. For planning purposes only the Government has announced guidelines for 1979 and 1980 which provide for increases of 2 per cent each year in real terms in the base programs for the tertiary area as a whole, and 1 per cent for schools. The Commissions are due to report by 31 August on the detailed allocation of funds for the 1978-80 rolling triennium within the guidelines announced by the Minister for Education on 3 June. +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million $ million $ million $ million UniversitiesGrants to Universities 539.4 640.1 675.6 + 35.5 Student Assistance 61.7 75.9 92.0 + 16.1 Other University Education 2.0 2.2 2.5 + 0.3 Total. . . . 603.1 718.2 770.1 + 51.9 Colleges of Advanced Education and Teachers CollegesGrants to Colleges. . . . 386 8 461.9 469.3 + 7.5 Student Assistance . . . . 43.8 54.2 61.5 + 7.3 Other Advanced Education 3.6 3.7 6.9 + 3.2 Total 434.1 519.8 537.7 + 18.0 +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million $ million $ million Technical and Further EducationGrants to Technical Colleges 81.1 100.1 113.0 + 13.0 Student Assistance . . . . 20.2 23.8 29.1 + 5.4 Total 101.3 123.8 142.2 + 18.4 Tertiary Education Commission 2.0 1.9 2.0 -SchoolsNon-Government Schools in the Terri10.1 11.2 13.1 + 1.8 Non-Government Schools in the States. 152.4 191.6 210.8 + 19.2 Government Schools and Pre-Schools in the Territories . . . . 108.5 116.0 118.5 + 2.5 Government Schools in the States 300.4 353.0 360.4 + 7.5 School Transport . . . . 2.4 3.0 3.0 0.1 Student Assistance . . . . 10.1 11.6 14.9 + 3.3 Joint Projects for Schools. 22.7 24.9 28.9 + 3.9 Commonwealth Teaching Service 0.4 0.5 0.5 + 0.1 Schools Commission . . . . 2.6 2.7 3.0 + 0.3 Other Assistance . . . . 0.4 -Total 610.0 714.6 753.1 + 38.5 Cost Supplementation of Grants made under the Education Commissions 75.0 + 75.0 Special GroupsAboriginals 41.4 36.4 43.0 + 6.5 Migrants 21.4 10.3 10.4 Soldiers' Children Isolated Children. . . . . . . . 3.6 10.4 3.5 11.7 3.6 13.8 + o!i + 2.1 Other 0.2 0.1 -Total 77.0 62.0 70.8 + 8.8 General Administrative and Other ExpenditureAdministration . . . . 17.5 17.9 18.5 + 0.7 Other 3.0 3.6 3.5 0.1 Total 20.5 21.4 22.0 + 0.6 Less Recoveries 1.6 1.6 1.8 + 0.2 Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education As mentioned above, base expenditure programs for universities and colleges of advanced education in 1978 have been set at the same real levels as for 1977. Student intakes for both sectors are expected to be maintained at the present level. Some additional funds are to be provided in 1978 'for non-government teachers colleges. At estimated June 1977 price levels, grants to universities are estimated to total $675.6 million in 1977-78, an increase of $35.5 million over 1976-77. The bulk of these funds will be expended on academic and administrative salaries within the universities, and on equipment, research and other operating costs. The proportion allocated for capital purposes is expected to decline further this year compared with earlier years when new universities were being established. Grants to colleges of advanced education (including teachers colleges) are estimated to increase by $7.5 million to $469.3 million in 1977-78 (at estimated June 1977 prices). As with universities, the proportion of these funds allocated for capital purposes is expected to decline relative to recent years. The Government is proceeding with the development of the Australian Maritime College at Launceston, which is expected to begin courses in 1979. Amounts of $1.6 million for capital purposes and $0.3 million for recurrent expenditures are to be provided for the College in 1977-78 from within the allocations for the advanced education sector. The Government has sought an assessment by the new Tertiary Education Commission of an imbalance that appears to be developing between the supply and demand for teachers. The Commission is to provide advice on possible options that the Government might consider and to explore with State and other authorities the scope for reduction in trainee teacher intakes. The Government also has reviewed its program of recurrent assistance to nongovernment teachers colleges. In recognition of the contribution whiph these colleges make towards the preparation of teachers for non-government schools an amount of $1.4 million (at estimated June 1977 prices) is to be provided for these purposes in 1977-78 within the total funds available for the advanced education sector for 1978. Student Assistance The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme provides living and other allowances for undergraduate students. Subject to a means test all full-time non-bonded Australian undergraduate students admitted to approved courses at approved universities, colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges are eligible to receive these benefits. Following a review of all student assistance schemes in late 1976 benefits were increased substantially, and means tests relaxed, with effect from the beginning of 1977. It has been decided to further relax means tests and to increase allowances from the beginning of the 1978 academic year. The maximum (independent student) living allowance payable under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), which was increased from $32 per week in 1976 to $43 per week in 1977 is to be further increased to $45.15 per week from the beginning of 1978. The means test to determine the level of allowance payable, which was relaxed from the beginning of 1977, is also to be relaxed further from the beginning of 1978. Taking into account these proposed changes, the cost of TEAS for students attending universities and colleges of advanced education is estimated to increase from $112.0 million in 1976-77 to $137.4 million in 1977-78. About 85 000 students are expected to qualify for this assistance in 1978, an increase of 5000 on 1977 numbers. Living allowances under the Post-graduate Awards Scheme, which provides assistance for post-graduate students on a competitive non-means-tested basis, were increased from $3250 per annum to $4000 per annum at the beginning of 1977. From the beginning of 1978 they will be further increased to $4200 per annum. This scheme is estimated to cost $9.7 million in 1977-78 compared with $8.6 million in 1976-77. About 2130 students are expected to benefit from the scheme in 1978, about 100 less than in 1977. Technical and Further Education The Commonwealth meets the full cost of technical and further education in the Territories, and provides financial assistance to the States for these purposes. This assistance to the States is directed towards enhancing the quality and extending the availability of technical and further education, and is provided on the understanding that the States do not reduce the level of their own activities in this area. A base amount of $94.4 million (at estimated June 1977 prices) has been determined for the Commonwealth's program of assistance to the States in 1978. This represents a 10 per cent increase in real terms compared with 1977. Total Commonwealth expenditure on grants for technical and further education in 1977-78 is estimated at $113.0 million (at estimated June 1977 prices), compared with actual expenditure of $100.1 million in 1976-77. Total enrolments in these institutions (full-time, part-time and correspondence students) are expected to increase by about 7.6 per cent in 1978, to approximately 828 000 students. The new Tertiary Education Commission has been asked to pay special attention to the requirements of the TAFE sector and to develop co-operative arrangements with the States for the allocation of resources on the understanding that the States will continue to discharge in full their own financial responsibilities in this area. Student Assistance TEAS assistance is available to students attending approved technical colleges at the same levels and on the same terms as for students attending universities and colleges of advanced education. The cost of providing assistance to technical college students in 1977-78 is estimated at $29.1 million, compared with $23.8 million in 1976-77. About 22 000 students are expected to qualify for this assistance in 1978, an increase of 2000 on the 1977 numbers. Tertiary Education Administration The Tertiary Education Commission was established on 22 June 1977 to replace the three separate education Commissions relating to Universities, Advanced Education and Technical and Further Education which formerly operated in the tertiary education field. The Tertiary Education Commission is responsible for advising the Government on levels of financial assistance for universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions. It is required to perform its functions with the objective of promoting the balanced and co-ordinated development of tertiary education in Australia. The Commission is to consult with appropriate State authorities in the performance of its functions and in formulating its recommendations is to have regard to greater rationalisation of the use of resources and more extensive use of facilities throughout the year. It is also to examine proposals for establishing new courses and for lengthening or upgrading of established courses. Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training In recognition of the need to achieve a more efficient use of the resources allocated to education and to relate the educational system more closely to workforce requirements, the Government has set up a Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training under the chairmanship of Professor B. R. Williams. This Committee will be focusing particularly on post-secondary education but will also examine aspects of secondary education and the problems of transition of school leavers directly into the labour force. Expenditure by the Commonwealth Government on schools in 1977-78 is estimated at $753.1 million, an increase of $38.5 million or 5.4 per cent over 1976-77. This total excludes assistance provided for pre-school and child care projects in the States which is included in the Social Security and Welfare block. (A detailed account of financial assistance for schools in the States is included in Chapter IV of Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1977-78). Available enrolment projections for primary and secondary schools in Australia point to a levelling out of total enrolments in 1978 and to a declining trend thereafter. Schools in the States The Commonwealth makes grants to the States to assist both government and nongovernment schools under programs administered by the Schools Commission. Grants are estimated to total $600.1 million in 1977-78 (at estimated June 1977 prices), an increase of $30.6 million or 5.4 per cent over 1976-77. Assistance is provided for general recurrent purposes at government and non-government schools, for the construction of new, and upgrading of existing, buildings, for libraries, disadvantaged schools, innovatory projects and teacher development, and for migrant and handicapped children. Government Schools and Pre-schools in the Territories Outlays for government schools and pre-schools in the Territories are estimated at $118.5 million in 1977-78, an increase of $2.5 million compared with actual outlays in 1976-77. The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority was established on 1 January 1977 to administer and develop the Government's pre-school, primary and secondary education systems in the Capital Territory. Expenditure on government schools and pre-schools in the Capital Territory is estimated to increase by $2.1 million in 1977-78 to $74.1 million. Provision is made in the estimates for the staffing and equipping of one new secondary college, one new high school and two new primary schools. The wage and salary costs of the Authority are estimated to increase by $6.0 million and school servicing costs by a further $2.5 million. These increases have been partially offset by a reduction of $6.4 million in capital outlays on schools, reflecting a slowing down in the rate of growth of Canberra's population and, consequently, a reduced demand for new student places. Expenditure on government community schools in the Northern Territory is estimated to increase from $44.0 million in 1976-77 to $44.4 million in 1977-78. (See also references to the education of Aboriginals in Northern Territory under 'Special Groups'). Provision has been made in 1977-78 for an estimated increase in salaries of $4.5 million. This increase is partially offset by an estimated decrease of $4.2 million in expenditure on school construction in the Northern Territory. Non-government Schools in the Territories From 1965 to 1974 the Commonwealth Government provided assistance under the Capital Aid Scheme to non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory for school building projects. The Scheme was terminated from 30 June 1974 although projects approved under the Scheme before that date have continued to be supported. The Government has decided that future non-government school building projects in the Territories should attract assistance on similar principles to those operating in respect of the Schools Commission's program of capital assistance for non-government schools in the States. An amount of $1 million is provided in 1977-78 for the support of new projects on this basis. The Government has also decided to establish an interest subsidy scheme to enable non-government schools in the Territories to borrow from approved lending authorities to finance building projects approved by the Minister for Education. The Commonwealth will reimburse interest charges, up to 10 per cent, on the borrowing, over a period of up to 20 years; an amount of $40 000 is included in the 1977-78 estimates for interest subsidies under this scheme. In total, assistance for non-government schools in the Territories is estimated to increase from $11.2 million in 1976-77 to $13.1 million in 1977-78. Student Assistance Expenditure on assistance for school students in 1977-78 is estimated at $14.9 million, compared with $11.6 million in 1976-77. Included in these amounts is $6.3 million in 1977-78 (S4.6 million in 1976-77) for the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme, under which means-tested allowances are made available to adults undertaking tull-time studies in the final year ot secondary scnooiing. Benefits and the means test are the same as apply under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. Approximately 3000 students are expected to quality tor assistance under the scheme in 1978, an increase of some 300 on the 1977 numbers. Also included in the estimate for 1977-78 is $8.4 million (compared with $6.9 million in 1976-77) for the Secondary Allowances Scheme, under which means-tested allowances are provided to assist low income families to maintain their children at school for the final two years of secondary education. The maximum rate of living allowance payable under the Scheme was increased from $450 per year to $550 per year to take effect from the beginning of 1977. In 1978 almost 17 000 students are expected to qualify for this assistance, an increase of about 500 on the number receiving the benefit in 1977. COST SUPPLEMENTATION The programs of the education Commissions are supplemented, with lags, for cost increases. The 1977 programs are to be supplemented fully for cost increases subject to offset to the extent possible by savings; but from 1978, supplementation is to be limited to wage and salary increases in respect of recurrent grants only including the fees reimbursement component in the technical and further education program. The bulk allowance of $75 million for cost supplementation included for 1977-78 relates mainly to estimated requirements in respect of the 1977 programs. The comparable figure included in the estimates last year was $60 million. Assistance by the Commonwealth for the education of special groups is estimated to total $70.8 million in 1977-78, compared with $62.0 million in 1976-77. Aboriginal Education Two student assistance schemes provide special benefits to Aboriginal students. Benefits under these schemes were increased substantially at the beginning of 1977 and some allowances will be increased further from the beginning of 1978. The Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme provides assistance to all full-time students of Aboriginal descent attending approved secondary schools or classes. Expenditure on this Scheme is estimated at $12.1 million in 1977-78, compared with $10.0 million in 1976-77. Approximately 14 000 students will be assisted in 1978, an increase of about 700 on the number in 1977. The Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme provides, in the main, assistance to Aboriginal students undertaking courses at universities, teachers colleges and technical, business and agricultural colleges. It also provides for overseas study, observation and short-term courses. Total expenditure is estimated at $3.3 million in 1977-78, compared with $2.3 million in 1976-77. Almost 2800 students are expected to receive assistance in 1978, about 600 more than in 1977. The Commonwealth Government has direct responsibility for the education of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory and has provided for estimated expenditure of $18.2 million in 1977-78, compared with $15.6 million in 1976-77. The main components of the increase of $2.7 million are salaries f$0.6 million), school running costs ($0.7 million), recurrent assistance to Missions for education of Aboriginals ($0.4 million) and school construction ($0.8 million). In addition, the Government has included a provision of $0.25 million for new and expanded activities ih Aboriginal Education in the Territory, including a new program of canital assistance for school building projects on Missions to be administered by the Department of Education, equipment for Aboriginal education in Northern Territory 'outstation' communities and for the development of an education complex at Ti Tree. A provision of $9.2 million is made in the Budget for grants to the States and to non-government organisations tor Aboriginal education purposes in 1977-78. These grants will finance the construction and equipping of pre-schools and primary and secondary schools. Additional expenditure will be incurred on several programs of special assistance for schools with high Aboriginal enrolments, and on special courses in Aboriginal studies at tertiary institutions. Comparable expenditure in 1976-77 was $8.5 million. The Budget also provides $85 000 in 1977-78 for the continued operation of the new National Committee on Aboriginal Education. The Committee, which consists entirely of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, provides advice and information on the educational needs of Aboriginals. Total assistance for Aboriginal education under these programs is estimated at $43.0 million in 1977-78 compared with $36.4 million in 1976-77. Migrant Education The Commonwealth provides funds for special instruction for migrant children with English language difficulties to facilitate their participation in normal classes. Funds are provided to government and non-government school authorities for special language teaching equipment, for salaries of special teachers and for the initial special instruction of refugee children. An amount of $0.6 million will be provided in 197778 to enable the program to be maintained at the same real level of activity as in 1976-77 when $0.5 million was spent. Adult migrant education in the English language is conducted in special courses. Expenditure, including salary and administrative costs and living allowances for some students, is estimated at $9.5 million in 1977-78 compared with $8.8 million in 197677. Again this will enable the present level of activity to be maintained in 197778. Living allowances payable to migrants undertaking full-time English courses are to be increased by about 25 per cent from 1 November 1977 to bring them up to a level equal to that of TEAS. For single students the allowance will be $45.15 per week; married students with a dependent spouse will receive $76.55 per week. An amount of $0,162 million is included in the 1977-78 estimates for the final year of a program of providing demountable classroom accommodation for child migrant classes in government and non-government schools. Soldiers' Children Education Scheme This Scheme provides for payment of fees, fares and allowances, and for provision of books and equipment for the tertiary education and training of children of ex-servicemen who died as a result of war service or who are either totally and permanently incapacitated or blind. Allowances are also paid in respect of children attending secondary schools. The cost of this scheme is estimated at $3.6 million in 1977-78, compared with $3.5 million in 1976-77: a slight decrease in the number of beneficiaries has been more than offset by the full year effect of the increased allowances effective from January 1977. Isolated Children The Commonwealth provides assistance through the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme to children who, because of their geographical isolation, do not have reasonable daily access to a government school providing courses at the appropriate level. A basic boarding allowance which was increased from $350 per annum to $500 per annum from the beginning of 1977 and an additional means tested allowance (which was increased from $350 per annum to $450 per annum and will be increased further to $500 per annum from the beginning of 1978), are payable in respect of such children living away from home to attend school. Additional assistance is available in cases of particular hardship. For isolated children who study at home by correspondence there is an allowance free of means test which was increased from a maximum of $350 per annum to $500 per annum at the beginning of 1977. The estimated cost of the scheme in 1977-78 is $13.8 million, compared with actual expenditure of $11.7 million in 1976-77. Almost 20000 children are assisted each year under the scheme. General administrative and other expenditure of the Department of Education is estimated at $22.0 million in 1977-78, compared with $21.4 million in 1976-77. The estimate for 1977-78 includes $15.3 million for salaries. Also included under this heading is $1.93 million for the Curriculum Development Centre, which has been established as an independent statutory authority to develop school curriculum projects, and $0.9 million for the Education Research and Development Committee, which provides support for research in education. 3. HEALTH Total outlays on health are estimated at $2813.8 million in 1977-78, an increase of 10.7 per cent on 1976-77. If the 1976-77 figures are adjusted for the prepayment of $216 million made to the States in June 1976 for hospital operating costs, the increase is 2.0 per cent. Outlays on Health in 1977-78 represents 10.6 per cent of total Budget outlays.

Entitlement to health insurance benefits is universal for all Australian residents. Since1 October 1976, when revised arrangements came into operation, coverage is achieved in one of two ways: (i) Medibank Standard. For medical and optometrical consultations, Medibank Standard provides benefits of 85 per cent of schedule fees (with a maximum patient contribution of $5 for any one service where the doctor charges the schedule fee) to those persons who elect to pay the health insurance levy and to those persons who are exempted from the levy (other than those fully covered by private insurance) such as low income earners, most pensioners, certain Defence Force personnel and Repatriation beneficiaries. Persons covered by Medibank Standard are also entitled to free standard ward accommodation in public hospitals, with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital. They may, however, purchase basic 'hospital only' cover from a registered health insurance organisation to provide for treatment by a doctor of their own choice in shared-room or private room accommodation in public hospitals. The hospital fund benefits may also be applied towards meeting charges for treatment in private hospitals. (ii) Full Private Medical and Hospital Cover. This provides both hospital and medical benefits through private insurance. Persons opting to be exempted from the levy can do so by insuring privately with a registered health insurance organisation. Coverage is provided for the same medical benefits as for levy payers, and for shared and private rooms in public hospitals and for private hospital care. After allowances for cost increases, expenditure on medical services and optometrical consultations to be met in respect of Medibank Standard patients is estimated to amount to S4S0 million in 1977-78. This is S90.2 million less than expenditure for 1976-77, but it should be noted here that the revised health insurance arrangements under which persons may opt for private medical and hospital cover in lieu of Medibank Standard applied only from 1 October 1976. Other Medical Benefits Included here are residual expenditures on medical benefits for services that were rendered under the National Health Act prior to the commencement of Medibank on 1 July 1975. It is estimated that expenditure on these benefits will amount to only $0.2 million in 1977-78. Diagnostic Services This item covers the running costs of the Commonwealth Pathology Laboratories which provide services to hospitals and medical practitioners, and the cost of supplying radio-active isotopes toy the Australian Radiation Laboratory to hospitals and medical practitioners. Charges are to be introduced on 1 October 1977 for services undertaken by the Commonwealth Pathology Laboratories for privately insured patients. From1 January 1978 responsibility for the supply of radio-active isotopes is to be transferred to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The impact of these measures on expenditure under this item will more than offset the full year effect of cost increases that occurred in 1976-77, resulting in a net decrease in outlays in 1977-78 of $2.9 million to $16.6 million. Treatment and Allowances for Ex-Servicemen and Women The Commonwealth meets the costs for eligible persons of specialist, local medical officer, paramedical and dental services, of providing and maintaining surgical aids (including spectacles) and of travelling expenses incurred in obtaining medical treatment. Expenditure on these activities in 1977-78 is estimated to increase by $5.2 million to $45.9 million, reflecting increased fees for professional services together with rising demand for treatment. Medibank Hospital Payments This item shows Commonwealth expenditure for hospitals under the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973. It covers daily bed payments to private hospitals of $16 a day and 50 per cent of the approved net operating costs of public hospitals in the States and Territories. In public hospitals, treatment in standard wards is provided free to those persons covered by Medibank Standard who have no additional hospital insurance coverage. With the revised health insurance arrangements applying from 1 October 1976, the charges in public hospitals for privately insured patients have been $60 a day for a bed in a single room and $40 a day for any other bed. The figure for expenditure in 1976-77 on hospital benefits excludes an advance of $215.6 million which was paid in June 1976 under the States Grants (Hospital Operating Costs) Act for the period 1 July to 30 September 1976. There were subsequent adjustments resulting in net repayment to the Commonwealth in 1976-77 of $6.1 million of the amount previously advanced. Allowing for the prepayment in 1975-76 and subsequent adjustment in 1976-77, the 1977-78 estimate of Medibank hospital payments of $1044 million represents an increase of about $103 million. Hospital Insurance Subsidy This item provides for the subsidy payable to registered health insurance organisations in respect of the contribution rates for basic 'hospital only' insurance offered to persons who are covered by Medibank Standard. The estimated cost of the Commonwealth subsidy in 1977-78 is $15 million. Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund As provided by the National Health Act, the Commonwealth subsidises the private health funds by sharing deficits that may arise in reinsurance accounts required to be maintained by registered hospital insurance organisations. The deficits occur from paying benefits to high risk and chronically-ill members. The estimated expenditure from the Trust Fund by the Commonwealth in 1977-78 is $50 million, an increase of $34.5 million. Other Hospital Benefits This item reflects mainly expenditure authorised by the National Health Act on special account subsidies that ceased on 30 September 1976 with the establishment of the Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund. Carry-over expenditure in 1977-78 is estimated at $5.1 million. Repatriation Hospitals Hospitals and clinics are maintained in each State for the treatment of eligible veterans and dependants but to a limited extent non-repatriation patients are also treated in Repatriation hospitals. Use is also made of private and State public hospitals where this is appropriate. Expenditure in 1977-78 is expected to increase by $13.6 million. Of this, $3.7 million represents the increased cost, arising mainly from the full-year effect of higher charges, of maintaining patients in metropolitan and country hospitals. The balance of $9.9 million reflects higher wages and salaries and operational costs associated with the running of Departmental institutions, as well as additional expenditure on buildings and works. Mental Health Facilities Expenditure on mental health facilities is estimated at $8.0 million in 1977-78. This expenditure includes annual payments to the New South Wales and South Australian Governments for the cost of maintaining residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory receiving psychiatric treatment in those States, and the cost of medical care and treatment for eligible ex-servicemen and women at State mental hospitals. Assistance for non-residential mental health facilities is provided under the Community Health Program, while funds for residential mental health facilities are provided under the Hospitals Development Program. Hospitals Development Program Grants are extended under this Program to the States to assist in the provision and modernisation of approved public hospitals and other residential health facilities such as mental institutions, hostels for the mentally ill and nursing homes and hostels for the physically infirm. These funds are conditional on the States maintaining certain baseline levels of expenditure. As announced previously, the Commonwealth will provide S50 million for the Program in 1977-78, compared with S108 million in 1976-77. Health Program Grants, authorised under the Health Insurance Act 1973, are payable to eligible organisations to meet the cost, or such proportion of the cost as the Minister may determine, of approved health services, including contract medical services, provided outside of hospitals, by medical practitioners employed on a salaried or sessional basis. With the restructuring of Medibank from 1 October 1976, eligible organisations have introduced charges, where appropriate, for services involving privately insured patients. The Government has decided also to expand the application of Health Program Grants to include the development and testing of new forms of health care delivery, the promotion of accreditation utilisation review and quality assurance processes across the whole range of health activities, and the examination of new methods of meeting service operating costs to introduce greater incentive towards efficiency. Expenditure on Health Program Grants in 1977-78 is estimated to amount to S8.7 million compared with S6.0 million in 1976-77. Pharmaceutical Benefits-General and Pensioners Except for a flat charge of $2 per prescription payable by most patients, the Commonwealth meets the cost of a range of drugs and medicinal preparations supplied on a doctor's prescription to any person in the community. PHB (Pensioner Health Benefits) card holders and their dependants are eligible for benefits without charge. Estimated expenditure on general pharmaceutical benefits in 1977-78 is SI36.5 million, an increase of $16.8 million compared with 1976-77. This reflects mainly the prescribing of higher cost drugs and an increase in utilisation of benefits. For the same reasons, expenditure on pharmaceutical 'benefits for eligible pensioners is estimated to increase by $11.5 million in 1977-78 to $126.7 million. Pharmaceutical Benefits-Ex-Servicemen and Women The Commonwealth meets the full cost of drug and medicinal prescriptions supplied on a doctor's prescription for eligible ex-servicemen and women and their dependants. Expenditure for this purpose is estimated to increase by S2.3 million in 1977-78 to $33.5 million and is attributable mainly to payments for retrospective increases in chemists' dispensing fees. Nursing Home Benefits and Payments As previously announced, legislation will be introduced to provide new arrangements for the payment of nursing home benefits as from 1 October 1977. These arrangements will provide a much higher level of protection for patients in private nursing homes than in the past. From1 October 1977 the following benefits will be payable by the Commonwealth for levy-payers and those exempt from the levy who are not insured with a private hospital benefits fund, and by private health funds for all members insured in the standard hospital benefits table (or above): Ordinary Intensive care care patients patients $ a day $ a day New South Wales 13.65 19.65 Victoria 19.65 25.65 Queensland 11.80 17.80 South Australia 17.40 23.40 Western Australia 11.75 17.75 Tasmania 14.85 20.85 Private hospital benefit funds will also pay benefits for members who are patients in those nursing homes whose operating deficits are met by the Commonwealth. The benefits, when combined with the statutory patient contribution, will fully cover fees charged in each State to 70 per cent of patients in non-government nursing homes approved under the National Health Act, as compared with about 30 per cent at present. The levels of benefit will be automatically reviewed each year after a survey of nursing home fees and will be adjusted as necessary. Mainly because of the higher levels of Commonwealth benefit that will apply from 1 October 1977, expenditure on nursing home benefits is estimated to increase by $16.9 million to $181.2 million in 1977-78. After allowance for cost increases, financing the deficits of eligible nursing homes is estimated to cost $69.3 million in 1977-78, a decrease of $0.8 million. Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit The Commonwealth pays a benefit of $2 a day to persons who arrange for the provision of adequate nursing care for elderly relatives at home as an alternative to institutional care. The elderly relative must have attained the age of sixty-five years and require professional nursing care to an extent that would otherwise justify admission to an approved nursing home. Expenditure on the benefit is estimated to increase by $0.2 million in 1977-78 to $8.3 million. Nursing Home and Domiciliary Nursing Care for Ex-Servicemen and Women The Commonwealth meets the full cost of nursing home accommodation required by ex-servicemen and women because of service-related disabilities. It also meets the cost of nursing home care for disabilities not related to service for certain categories of veterans and war widows, subject to payment by the patient of the patient contribution prescribed for other nursing home patients in the community. Free domiciliary care services are provided to these groups as required. Expenditure on nursing home and domiciliary care for eligible persons is expected to increase by $1.1 million in 1977-78 to $28.4 million. The increase is attributable to higher nursing home charges and increased usage. Other The item provides for subsidies, estimated to cost $10.5 million in 1977-78, to approved non-profit organisations that provide home nursing services. The rate of subsidy was increased with effect from 1 July 1977. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual Commonwealth payment for each nurse who attracts a subsidy was increased from $8600 to $9600. For organisations established after that date, the annual subsidy for each nurse employed was increased from $4300 to $4800. The Commonwealth subsidy to any organisation may not exceed that paid to the organisation by a State. The increase in the subsidy is expected to cost $1.06 million in 1977-78. The Commonwealth is providing assistance to the States, local government authorities and other eligible organisations for the provision of community-based health services. Some 700 projects have been approved; they include community health centres, day hospitals, community mental health teams and alcoholism and drug dependence centres. Commonwealth assistance for the Program in the States is provided in the form of an annual block grant to each State which allocates the grant to individual projects. Except for projects having an Australia-wide application, the Commonwealth will meet, from' 1 July 1977, 50 per cent of capital and 75 per cent of operating costs. The previous capital subsidy of 75 per cent will apply to projects not completed by 30 June 1977. 'National' projects-suc h as the Family Medicine Program-whic h operate in all or most States are funded direct by the Commonwealth. An amount of $79.1 million has been allocated to the Program for 1977-78; this is $9.3 million more than expenditure on the Program in 1976-77. In addition, grants to the States and institutions for health care planning and research are estimated at $0.8 million in 1977-78, compared with $1 million in 1976-77. Reimbursement by the Commonwealth of capital and maintenance expenditures by the States on the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis ceased from 31 December 1976. The Government decided that because tuberculosis had been brought under control in Australia there was no longer a need for Commonwealth assistance. Costs incurred toy public hospitals in treating tuberculosis patients have been subsumed within the Medibank hospital arrangements. Provision is made to reimburse States' expenditure incurred up to 31 December 1976 and for continuation of allowances to persons suffering from tuberculosis and their dependants. Expenditure under this item is expected to decline by $4.0 million 5 in 1977-78 to $3.9 million. It is expected that all final claims from the States will be processed by the end of 1977-78. The Commonwealth is establishing, in co-operation with the States, an Australia-wide school dental scheme to provide a free dental service to all primary school children. The children receive comprehensive dental care at local clinics at regular intervals by either a dentist or dental therapist, with an emphasis on prevention and dental health education. As previously announced, the Commonwealth will meet, from 1 July 1977, 75 per cent of the capital cost of new training facilities and clinics (previously 90 per cent). The previous capital subsidy of 90 per cent will apply to projects not completed by 30 June 1977. Also from 1 July 1977 the Commonwealth will meet 75 per cent of the operating costs of training facilities (previously 90 per cent) and 50 per cent of operating costs of clinics (previously 65 per cent). Expenditure on the scheme under the revised funding arrangements is estimated to increase by $1.9 million,in 1977-78, to $24.6 million. In the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the Commonwealth provides health services of the type provided elsewhere by State and local government authorities. These services include hospitals, public health activities, ambulance services and community health centres. The Capital Territory Health Commission operates two hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory and the Department of Health operates five hospitals and a leprosarium in the Northern Territory. Charges were levied on patients in A.C.T. mental health hostels from 5 July 1977 (estimated receipts in 1977-78 are $81 200). Construction and equipping of Calvary Hospital, a central hospital services complex and a central administration building, account for the major part of capital outlays in the Capital Territory. The major projects in the Northern Territory in 1977-78 are the construction of a hospital and central pathology laboratory in Darwin, a health centre at Howard Springs and the equipping of hospitals at Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and Darwin. Reflecting the completion of some major works and allowing for 50 per cent of net operating costs of the recognised hospitals being met by Medibank, net expenditure on health services in the Territories is estimated to increase by $0.3 million in 1977-78 to $107.1 million. Expenditure under this heading includes direct expenditure by the Commonwealth ($9.1 million in 1977-78) and grants to the States ($12.6 million). The expenditures provide hospital facilities, clinics, health centres and doctors and nurses in areas of high Aboriginal population. Provision is also made for health education and preventive medicine projects. Medical Research Grants Through the Medical Research Endowment Fund and on the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Commonwealth Government assists the medical research activities of Commonwealth and State Government departments, universities and other institutions and individual research workers, and with the training of medical research workers. An amount of $10.2 million was provided for this purpose in 1976-77. $11.7 million is being provided in support of medical 'research programs in 1977-78, including $0.37 million for the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine and $0.5 million for the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission produces and sells biological products, undertakes research into the production of therapeutic biological products, and maintains stocks of biological products. The provision of $9.3 million for 1977-78 is $3.5 million more than expenditure in 1976-77. Aids and Appliances The Commonwealth meets the cost of supplying hearing aids (and batteries) to children, eligible pensioners and their dependants; artificial limbs to civilians; stoma appliances and, up to 30 September 1976, home dialysis equipment (and supplies) to members of the community who need them. From1 October 1976 costs incurred in relation to home dialysis have been shared by the States and the Commonwealth under Medibank hospital arrangements. Reflecting 'this change, expenditure is expected to decline from $5.3 million in 1976-77 to $4.4 million in 1977-78. Educational Campaigns Funds have been provided to support State and national projects of education directed against the abuse of narcotics and other drugs of addiction since 1970-71. $0,825 million has been allocated to the National Drug Education Program in 1977-78; this allocation is subject to an assessment of the effectiveness of programs currently in operation. Blood Transfusion Service and Products The annual operating costs of the Red Cross Society's Blood Transfusion Service in the States are shared by the States (60 per cent), the Society (the lower of 5 per cent of operating costs or 10 per cent of its previous year's income from donations) and the Commonwealth (the balance) and in the Territories by the Society and the Commonwealth in accordance with a similar principle. Blood collected by the Society's Transfusion Service is processed into blood fractions, plasma and serum by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission. The blood products are supplied, free of charge, to hospitals and approved pathologists for use in medical diagnosis and treatment. The Commonwealth reimburses the Commission for the cost of processing the blood. The Commonwealth's contributions are estimated to increase by $2.0 million in 1977-78 to $9.4 million. Quarantine Services Human, animal and plant quarantine measures are enforced to prevent the introduction of exotic diseases into Australia. By arrangement, the States administer animal and plant quarantine and have their costs reimbursed by the Commonwealth. Human quarantine is administered by the Commonwealth. As part of a proposal for upgraded facilities for the isolation and treatment of new types of human quarantineable diseases, the Commonwealth proposes to meet the costs in 1977-78, estimated totoe$0.91 million, of constructing a national high security quarantine unit at the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital in Victoria. The Government has also decided to re-introduce vaccination fees from 1 September 1977; this is expected to result in revenue of $2.5 million in 1977-78. Net outlays for quarantine services are estimated to increase from $8.3 million in 1976-77 to $8.7 million in 1977-78. Included in this amount is a provision of $0.8 mUUon for the incineration of quarantineable wastes at international airports, for which financial and operational responsibility was transferred from the Department of Transport to the Department of Health from 1 July 1977. Other Included here are the Commonwealth subsidy of $2.4 million to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, grants to the States for the Australian Encephalitis Eradication Campaign, reimbursement to the Australian Medical Association of expenses incurred in examining a system of peer review of medical professional standards, and expenditure related to the administration of public health and the Therapeutic Goods Act. This item comprises the general administrative and capital expenses of the Health Insurance Commission (other than its Medibank Private function) ($54.8 million), the Hospitals and Health Services Commission ($0.2 million) and the bulk of the Department of Health. Expenditure is estimated to increase from $87.0 million in 1976-77 to $92.1 million in 1977-78, reflecting the full-year effect of salary and other cost increases in 1976-77 and an increase in expenditure of a capital nature. Recoveries are accounted for mainly by charges met by certain countries for treatment given to their ex-servicemen through Repatriation facilities. 4. SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE The Australian social security system is intended to protect people from economic hardship caused by events such as loss of earnings through age, invalidity, sickness, unemployment or the loss or absence of a supporting spouse as a result of death, desertion or long-term separation. It is designed also to compensate ex-servicemen for war-caused disabilities and the dependants of those whose deaths are war-related and to assist parents with the expenses associated with bearing and raising children. Much of this assistance is provided by way of cash benefits. There are selective, or means-tested, benefits such as invalid and widows' pensions and unemployment benefits, as well as universal benefits such as maternity allowances and family allowances. Additionally, assistance is provided, either directly or through State and local government authorities and voluntary agencies, for a wide range of welfare services for people with special needs. The aged, for example, are assisted with their accommodation needs and invalids may be trained so that they can re-enter paid employment. Assistance is provided in a variety of forms for the advancement of Aboriginals. Total direct outlays on social security and welfare are estimated to increase from $6430.7 million in 1976-77 to $7247.9 million in 1977-78, an increase of 12.7 per cent. Direct outlays on social security and welfare in 1977-78 are equivalent to 27.2 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays. The Government is continuing to review the income security system in Australia. This review will include consideration of the final reports from the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry and the Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. As announced by the Minister for Social Security an overall review of the Department of Social Security is being carried out with a view to implementing improvements in the Department's present systems and procedures, including those for reviewing entitlements and processing claims. Although expected savings from the review are only fractional in relation to total outlays under the Social Security and Welfare heading, they are significant in absolute terms-saving s of the order of $50 million are estimated in 1977-78. Figures for actual outlays on social security and welfare in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and estimated outlays in 1977-78 are shown in the following table: +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million $ million $ million S million Assistance to the AgedPensions and Allowances 2129.4 2 483.6 2912.0 +428.4 Aged Persons Accommodation 94.2 64.3 73.4 + 9.1 Home Care Services. . . . 12.1 14.0 17.0 + 3.0 0.2 0.2 0.2 Total2 235.8 2 562.0 3 002.5 440.5 Assistance to Ex-Servicemen and their DependantsWar Pensions and Allowances 344.9 375.2 418.8 + 43.6 Service Pensions 218.9 283.3 347.9 + 64.6 Other 1.0 0.9 0.9 Total 564.9 659.4 767.5 + 108.1 Assistance to the HandicappedInvalid Pensions and Allowances 407.1 511.0 568.0 + 57.0 Sheltered Employment Allowances and Facilities 9.8 13.8 15.5 + 1.7 Handicapped Children's Benefits and AUowances 9.7 12.5 20.3 + 7.8 Handicapped Persons Facilities . 30.0 30.0 39.0 + 9.0 Rehabilitation Services 12.0 13.5 18.1 + 4.6 Other 0.4 0.2 0.2 Total 468.9 581.0 661.1 + 80.1 +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million $ million $ million Assistance to Widows and Supporting MothersWidows Pensions and Allowances 325.3 370.2 422.5 + 52.3 Supporting Mothers' Benefits and Allowances 127.2 158.5 185.0 + 26.5 Other 9.7 13.3 15.5 + 2.2 Total 462.2 542.0 623.0 + 81.0 Assistance to FamiliesFamily Allowances . . . . 265.5 1 027.2 1 0^9.0 + 21.8 Maternity All o w a n c e s . . . . 7.2 6.9 6.9 Children's Services. . . . 64.0 67.1 73.3 + 6i2 Other 4.3 4.4 5.6 + 1.1 Total 341.0 1 105.7 1 134.8 + 29.1 Assistance to the Unemployed and SickUnemployment and Sickness Benefits. 614.1 745.4 787.0 + 41.6 Unemployment Relief Grants 30.0 1.6 7.0 + 5.4 Relocation Assistance 0.3 1.3 + 1.0 Structural Adjustment Assistance 8.5 0.1 0.1 Regional Employment Development Scheme 123.4 0.3 0.3 Total 776.0 747.7 795.3 + 47.6 Other Welfare ProgramsFuneral Benefits 1.5 1.5 1.7 + 0.1 Telephone Rental Concessions 12.3 14.2 14.8 + 0.7 Australian Assistance Plan. 6.8 5.4 5.4 Assistance to Homeless Men and Women 1.6 2.2 6.4 + 4.1 Assistance for Migrants 1.9 2.2 2.6 + 0.4 Welfare Programs in the Territories nec 3.8 6.0 8.0 + 2.0 Other 1.8 1.3 1.4 Total 29.8 32.8 34.8 + 2.0 Aboriginal Advancement Programs nec . 43.5 35.7 43.5 + 7.9 General Administrative and Other Expenditure 161.1 171.5 189.8 + 18.3 Less Recoveries and Repayments 5.9 7.1 4.4 2.7 AND WELFARE 5 077.4 6 430.7 7 247.9 +817.2 Pensions and Allowances Age pensions are payable, free of income test, to residentiaUy qualified men and women aged 70 years or more or to persons of age pension age who are permanently blind. Age pensions are payable, subject to an income test, to residentiaUy qualified women aged 60 lo 69 years and to residentiaUy qualified men aged 65 to 69 years. To be residentiaUy qualified for age pension, a period of ten years continuous residence in Australia is usually necessary. Wife's pension is payable to an age pensioner's wife who does not qualify for an age, invalid or repatriation service pension in her own right. The pension is subject to an income test. Additional payments of S7.50 a week for each child are available to pensioners with dependent children. These payments are subject to an income test. Supplementary assistance of up to $5 a week is payable, subject to a special income test, to pensioners who pay rent or lodging charges. Generally the amount of supplementary assistance payable is not to exceed the actual amount paid for rent or lodgings. Upon the death of one of a married pensioner couple, the surviving member becomes entitled to receive, for up to six fortnightly instalments, the equivalent of the two pensions that would have been paid had the spouse not died. The levels of the relevant pensions and benefits are adjusted automatically for movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Levels will be adjusted in November 1977 and May 1978 by the percentage increase in the CPI between the December quarter 1976 and the June quarter 1977 and between the June and December quarters 1977 respectively. The existing maximum rates of pensions and additional payments and the rates to come into force as from November 1977 are set out below. From November Pension or additional pa ment Existing 1977 S a week S a week Standard (or single) rate of pension 47.10 49.30 Married rate of pension (including wife's pension) 78.50 82.20 Eaci dependent child (including a student child) . ! 7.50 7.50 Guardian's allowanceWhere there is a child under 6 years or an invalid child requiring full-time care 6.00 6.00 Other cases 4.00 4.00 Supplementary assistance-for eligi ble pensioners wh> pay rent or for lodgings . 5.03 5.00 The estimated cost of the two proposed increases in the rates of age pensions is $114.1 million in 1977-78 and $307.0 million in a full year. At 30 June 1977 there were 1,231,000 age pensioners (including wives of age pensioners in receipt of a wife's pension) and during 1977-78 the number is estimated to increase by 32 000 to 1 263 000. In addition, approximately 19 000 invalid pensioners of age pension age will be transferred to age pension during the year. The average amount of age pension (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from $39.50 a week in 1976-77 to $44.80 a week in 1977-78, an increase of 13.4 per cent. The main reasons for this are the increases in pension rates in line with the CPI and the full-year effects of increased rates of pension introduced during 1976-77. Aged Persons Accommodation The Government has approved a three-year program to subsidise the provision of aged persons' accommodation under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act-$42. 4 million was spent under the two Acts ia 1976-77. An amount of SSO million is included in the Budget for expenditure on aged persons homes and hostels in 1977-78; S7.6 million more than in 1976-77. An announcement concerning this program will be made by the Minister for Social Security. Under the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 organisations are assisted to provide suitable homes in which aged people may live in conditions approaching ordinary domestic life. Grants on a $2 for $1 basis may be made to religious and charitable organisations and local government bodies to meet the cost of erection, extension or purchase of homes for the aged. The maximum subsidy limits under the Act are SI 1 130 for a single unit and S12 910 for a double unit, plus a maximum of $1920 a unit for land. Handicapped adults may also be accommodated in subsidised homes. Expenditure on the provision of homes is estimated at S21.S million in 1977-78. The Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972 is designed to encourage the provision of hostel accommodation for the aged. Subject to certain conditions, the Commonwealth meets the cost of providing additional hostel accommodation by eligible organisations up to a maximum of $16 700 a person. The Commonwealth also pays an additional grant of up to $2400 a person for the purchase of land; a further $250 a-person is-available for furnishings. Accommodation provided under the Act must be allocated strictly on the basis of need and without any contribution from the prospective resident. Expenditure under the Act is estimated at $28.5 million in 1977-78. Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 the Commonwealth also pays a personal care subsidy of $15 a week to eligible organisations for persons aged 80 years or over and other residents who require, and are receiving, approved personal care while living in hostel-type accommodation provided by those organisations. Expenditure on the personal care subsidy is estimated to rise from $11.1 million in 1976-77 to $13.4 million in 1977-78 as a result of an expected increase in the number of persons who will qualify for the subsidy. The States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974 is designed to assist the States with the provision of self-contained dwelling units at reasonable rentals for single age, invalid, ClassB widow and certain single repatriation pensioners, who have little or no means apart from their pension. The Act was amended in 1977 to provide an additional $10 million in grants and to extend its operation for one year to 30 June 1978 pending completion of the review of the Government's policy towards care of the aged. The grants are allocated among the States in proportion to the total number of age, invalid and ClassB widow pensioners in receipt of supplementary assistance in each State. Rents of units provided under the scheme are not less than the maximum rate of supplementary assistance paid to pensioners. Of the $40 million provided for under the Act, $30 million had been spent to 30 June 1977 including $10.8 million in 1976-77; the States are to receive the remaining $10 million in 1977-78. Home Care Services Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969, and the States Grants (Paramedical Services) Act 1969, the Commonwealth provides funds, in association with the States, for the provision of a range of home care services, mainly for aged persons and for the provision of senior citizens centres. Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969, the Commonwealth shares on a $2 for $1 basis with the States the cost of approved housekeeping or other domestic assistance provided wholly or mainly for aged persons in their homes. Grants are estimated to rise to $9.3 million in 1977-78, $2.4 million more than in 1976-77, because of the expansion of existing services. The Commonwealth also shares, on a $2 for $1 basis with the States, up to a maximum of two-thirds of the capital cost of approved senior citizens centres and the cost of the salary of a welfare officer employed in conjunction with such a centre The Government has agreed to a three-year funding program for senior citizens centres with $4 million being provided in each of the three years. 1977-78 will be the second year of the program. Grants towards the cost of the salary of a welfare officer employed in conjunction with a senior citizens centre are estimated to amount to $0.9 million in 1977-78, $0.2 million more than in 1976-77. Under the States Grants (Paramedical Services) Act 1969, the Commonwealth shares, on a $1 for $1 basis with the States, the cost of approved paramedical services provided wholly or mainly for aged persons in their homes. Grants in 1977-78 are estimated at almost $0.5 million. The Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970 is designed to assist the establishment, expansion, improvement or maintenance of approved meals-on-wheels services. The basic rate of subsidy is 25 cents a meal. An additional subsidy of 5 cents a meal is payable if the organisation undertakes to include with each meal approved kinds and quantities of fresh fruit or fruit juices. Expenditure under the Act in 1977-78 is estimated at $2.2 million, compared with $1.9 million in 1976-77, as a result of an expected rise in the number of meals supplied by existing services. Disability Pensions and Allowances Disability pensions and allowances (and certain other benefits including medical treatment) are available to certain veterans and their dependants. The term 'veteran' includes any man or woman eligible for consideration under the Repatriation Act 1920 or associated Acts by virtue of service in the Australian armed forces. The term 'service' includes service in the 1914-18 War, the 1939-45 War, the Korea-Malaya Operations, the Far East Strategic Reserve, special service in South-East Asia (including Vietnam), and service with the Defence Force on or after 7 December 1972. Basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with 'active service' incapacity or death resulting from 'any occurrence' during service may be accepted. For those with 'home service', however, the criterion is narrower, in that incapacity or death must have arisen out of, or be attributable to, that service; incapacity or death arising from a condition existing prior to enlistment may be accepted if aggravated or contributed to by the conditions of service. Classes of Disability Pensions Pensions are paid to eligible veterans in three main categories: o The Special Rate (known as the T & PI) Pension, payable to a veteran who, as a result of service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a living wage; o The Intermediate Rate, payable to a veteran who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to service, can work only part-time or intermittently, and in consequence is unable to earn a living wage; and e The General Rate, payable to a veteran who has an incapacity accepted as related to service, but who is still able to work full-time although under difficulty. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum General Rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. Pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated veterans and to their children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran's incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow's rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at 'orphan' rates and other benefits. If a veteran's death has not been accepted as related to service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the Special Rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service. Other dependants of deceased veterans may qualify for pensions in certain cases. Allowances Various allowances are provided to supplement disability pensions. These allowances vary according to the type or severity of disablement and the special needs of the pensioners. Rates of Pensions and Allowances The Special, Intermediate and General Rate disability pensions and the war and defence widow pensions are automatically adjusted each Spring and Autumn in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. The existing and proposed rates of the main disability pensions and allowances are set out below. * Proposed from November Benefit Existing 1977 $ a week $ a week Disability PensionsMemberSpecial rate 90.15 94.40 Intermediate rate 62.10 65.00 General rate (100 per cent) 34.05 35.65 War and Defence Widow 47.10 49.30 Wife 4.05"" Each child 1.38 War Orphans-No change Father dead-eac h child 10.45 Both parents dead-eac h child 20.90.

The Sustenance Allowance is to be replaced by a Loss of Earnings Allowance which will be available on a similar basis to that presently payable to veterans in respect of their attendance before Appeal Tribunals. The Government has also decided to remove from the Repatriation legislation the provision for the automatic acceptance of pulmonary tuberculosis as a basis for disability pension and the guaranteed minimum pension rate of 100 per cent payable in respect of it. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be announcing details of these two changes. The proposed increases in the rates of disability pensions in November 1977 and May 1978 are estimated to cost $9.2 million in 1977-78 and $22.3 million in a full year. During 1976-77 the average number of veterans and their dependants in receipt of disability pensions was 489 000; in 1977-78 the number is estimated to be 471 000. The effect on expenditure of this estimated decline in numbers is more than offset by the full year effects of increased rates of benefits introduced in 1976-77 and the increases in benefit rates in line with movements in the CPI during 1977-78. Service Pensions Service pensions may be payable to: o a male veteran who served in a theatre of war and who has attained the age of 60 years or is permanently unemployable; o a female veteran who served in a theatre of war or embarked for service abroad and has attained the age of 55 years or is permanently unemployable; o ex-members of the Defence Forces of British Commonwealth countries who served in a theatre of war and have had at least ten yean residence in Australia; and o a veteran suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis irrespective of age or the area of service. As with disability pensions, legislation will also be introduced to remove pulmonary tuberculosis as a basis for the grant of service pension. Those veterans currently receiving Service Pension for this reason will, however, continue to do so. Service in a 'theatre of war' means, in respect of the 1914-18 War or 1939-45 War, service 'at sea, in the field or in the air in naval, military or aerial operations against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war . . . ' In respect of certain later service, 'service in an operational area', and 'special service' as defined are the qualifications equivalent to service in a 'theatre of war'. A service pension is the broad equivalent of an age or invalid pension. The advantages to the veteran are availability of the service pension five years earlier and, in certain circumstances, eligibility for a wide range of repatriation medical treatment services. Service pensioners are eligible for the same range of pensions and allowances as age pensioners and the rates of benefits are the same. Like age pensions, service pensions will be increased in November 1977 and May 1978 in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Service pensions are paid, free of income test, to eligible veterans aged 70 years and over. For eligible veterans under 70 years of age, 50 per cent of any disability pension received is disregarded as income for service pension income test purposes. With this exception service pensions are subject to the same income test arrangements as social security pensions. During 1976-77 the average number of service pensioners (including wives) was 151 200; this number is estimated to rise to 171 100 in 1977-78. Increased expenditure in 1977-78 reflects this increase in numbers, the full-year effect of pension increases granted in 1976-77, and the increased rates to apply in 1977-78. The proposed two increases in the rates of service pensions are estimated to cost SI6.1 million in 197778 and $39.2 million in a full year. Invalid Pensions and Allowances Invalid pensions are payable to persons not less than 16 years of age who are permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of at least 85 per cent, or permanently blind. Pensions are subject to an income test except in the case of people who are permanently blind. If the incapacity or blindness occurred outside Australia, the residence qualification is the same as for an age pension. Invalid pensioners are eligible for the same additional payments as age pensioners and the rates of payment are the same. Similarly, wife's pension is payable, subject to income test, to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is not eligible for an age, invalid or service pension in her own right. At 30 June 1977 there were 246 000 invalid pensioners (including wives of invalid pensioners in receipt of wife's pension) and during 1977-78 the number is estimated to increase by 13 000 to 259 000. However, this number includes approximately 19 000 pensioners of age pension age who will be transferred to age pensions during the year. The average amount of invalid pension (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from $41.00 a week in 1976-77 to $46.30 a week in 1977-78, an increase of 12.9 per cent. The main reasons for this are the proposed increases in pension rates in line with the Consumer Price Index and the full-year effects of increased rates of pension introduced during 1976-77. The estimated cost of the increases in rates of invalid pension in November 1977 and May 1978 is $20.9 million in 1977-78 and $56.1 million in a full year. Sheltered Employment Allowances Sheltered employment allowances are payable to disabled people engaged in approved sheltered employment who are qualified to receive an invalid pension or who would become so qualified if they ceased to be provided with sheltered employment. The allowance is subject to the same income test as applies to the invalid pension and the rates of payment are generally the same. An incentive allowance of $5 a week is paid (free of income test) to the recipients of sheltered employment allowance. Recipients of the sheltered employment allowance are not eligible for supplementary assistance. Handicapped Child's Allowance A handicapped child's allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a child under the age of 16 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. The Government has decided to amend the Social Services Act to give the Director General a discretion to approve the grant of a handicapped child's allowance, wholly or in part, where a person has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped child and, as a consequence of continuing substantive expenditure associated with the child's disability, the person suffers financial hardship. The number of recipients at 30 June 1977 was 22 000 and this number is expected to increase to 24 000 by 30 June 1978. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $10.9 million in 1976-77 to $18 million in 1977-78 as a result of the increased numbers expected to qualify for the allowance and the full-year effect of the increased rate of allowance announced in the 1976-77 Budget. Handicapped Persons Facilities Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 the Commonwealth provides subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis to non-profit organisations and local governing bodies for the purchase, construction, extension, alteration, rental and maintenance of premises that cater for physically and mentally handicapped people. Buildings qualifying for subsidy comprise day training centres for handicapped children, activity therapy centres and sheltered workshops for handicapped adults and residential projects for people who attend these establishments. Residential projects for people who, because of a disability, need special accommodation to allow them to engage in normal outside employment also qualify for subsidy. Subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis are available also for the cost of furnishing and equipping the various types of centres, while assistance with operating costs may be provided by means of staff salary subsidies. The latter are usually on a $1 for $1 basis although a higher proportion, up to 100 per cent, may be paid for the first two years of operation of some new projects. A training fee of $500 is paid to eligible sheltered workshops for each former employee who, after completing more than six months sheltered employment, graduates to and retains employment for 12 months or more. The Commonwealth has introduced a three-year program of assistance under the Act. $30 million was spent in 1976-77 and $39 million will be provided in 1977-78, rising to $52 million in 1978-79. The Commonwealth pays a handicapped children's benefit of $5.00 a day, for each child under 16 years of age, to charitable and religious organisations conducting approved homes providing accommodation and care for mentally and physically handicapped children. The benefit continues to be paid to an eligible organisation when a child is absent from the institution for a short period only such as a week-end home visit. Expenditure is estimated to increase from $1.6 million in 1976-77 to $2.3 million in 1977-78 due to an expected increase in the number of organisations becoming eligible for subsidy and the full year effect of increased rates introduced in the 1976-77 Budget. Rehabilitation Services The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service attempts to restore disabled people to fheir fullest physical, mental, social and vocational usefulness. Treatment and training are provided free to persons in the following categories if there is a reasonable prospect of their engaging in gainful employment: e invalid pensioners; o widow pensioners and supporting mother beneficiaries (other than those eligible under the National Employment and Training System); e recipients of unemployment, sickness or special benefits; former national and regular servicemen who are disabled at time of discharge but are ineligible for rehabilitation assistance from the Department of Veterans' Affairs; o persons receiving a tuberculosis allowance; o persons who become disabled while working for the Commonwealth Government and who are covered by the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act; and o boys and girls of 14 and 15 years who would otherwise be likely to qualify for an invalid pension at 16. The Commonwealth has decided to make the service available, free of charge, to certain mentally and physically handicapped persons within the broad working age group who are not presently eligible without charge under the existing legislation because there is little prospect of their engaging in gainful employment. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $13.1 million in 1976-77 to $16.9 million in 1977-78 as a result of an expected increase in the numbers to be accepted for treatment and training and the full year effect of price and salary increases during 1976-77. The Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments have agreed to share the costs of establishing and operating a joint rehabilitation centre for handicapped persons in Hobart. The Commonwealth meets up to half the capital cost of the Centre. Its contribution is estimated at $1.2 million in 1977-78 as compared to $0.4 million in 1976-77. Widows'Pensions and Allowances Pensions are payable to widows subject to an income test. No period of residence is necessary if a woman .and her husband were residing permanently in Australia when she became a widow. In other cases, there is a residence qualification of either 5 years immediately prior to claiming a pension or 10 years continuous residence in Australia at any time. There are three classes of widow's pension: Class AA widow with one or more qualifying children in her care. Class BA widow without qualifying children who is at least 50 years of age or at least 45 years of age if her ClassA pension ceased after she reached that age because she no longer had a qualifying child in her care. Class CA widow without qualifying children who is in necessitous circumstances within 26 weeks of her husband's death. For all classes, the term 'widow' includes a woman who was the common-law wife of a man for at least three years immediately before his death. For ClassA and B, it includes a wife who has been deserted for six months, a divorcee, a woman whose husband has been imprisoned for six months and a woman whose husband is in a mental hospital. Widow pensioners may be eligible for supplementary assistance, additional pension for dependent children and mother's allowance (in lieu of guardian's allowance) at the same rates as age and invalid pensioners. These payments are subject to an income test. At 30 June 1977 there were 139 000 widow pensioners and during 1977-78 the number is estimated to increase by 8000 to 147 000. The average rate of pension (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from S51.90 a week in 1976-77 to $57.70 a week in 1977-78, an increase of 11.2 per cent. The estimated cost of the increases in the rates of widows' pensions in November 1977 and May 1978 is $13.8 million in 1976-77 and S37.0 million in a full year. Supporting Mothers' Benefits and Allowances A supporting mother's benefit is paid to unmarried mothers and mothers who are deserted de facto wives, de facto wives of prisoners and separated wives. The benefit becomes payable six months after the date of the event which gives rise to eligibility (e.g., the birth of a child or separation), and it is payable at the same rate and subject to similar conditions as the ClassA widow's pension. Supporting mothers may also be eligible for supplementary assistance, additional benefit for dependent children and mother's allowance. At 30 June 1977, there were 51 000 supporting mother beneficiaries and during 1977-78 the number is estimated to increase by 6000 to 57 000. The average rate of benefit (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from $61.30 a week in 1976-77 to $67.10 a week in 1977-78, an increase of 9.5 per cent. The estimated cost of the increases in the rates of supporting mother's benefit in November 1977 and May 1978 is $5.2 million in 1977-78 and S14.1 million in a full year. Other Under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act 1968 the Commonwealth shares, within limits, on a $1 for $1 basis with the States the cost of helping certain mothers of families without a breadwinner where the mothers are ineligible for a ClassA widow's pension or a supporting mother's benefit. Assistance is provided during the first six months after the date of the event which gives rise to eligibility (e.g., the birth of a child or separation). The main groups of mothers assisted are deserted wives, deserting wives, wives of prisoners and unmarried mothers. After the first six months, these groups of mothers may qualify for either a ClassA widow's pension or a supporting mother's benefit. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $13.3 million in 1976-77 to $15.5 million in 1977-78 due to a small expected increase in numbers and the full year effect of rate increases during 1976-77. Family Allowances Family allowances are payable to people with children under 16 years of age or 16 years but under 25 years of age and receiving full-time education at a school, college or university and not in employment. There is no income test. Allowances are usually paid to the mother. Special conditions apply if the person does not intend to reside permanently in Australia. The rates of family allowances are: $ a week First child 3.50 Second child . . . . 5.00 Third child . . . . 6.00 Fourth child . . . . 6.00 Fifth and later children 7.00 Child in an institution 5.00 At 30 June 1977, there were 4 302 000 children (including student children and children in institutions) covered by the allowances and the number is estimated to increase to 4 310 000 by 30 June 1978. Outlays are estimated to increase from S1027.2 million in 1976-77 to $1049 million in 1977-78 due to an expected increase in the numbers becoming eligible and altered payment procedures. Maternity Allowance Maternity allowance is payable, as a lump sum, to mothers on the birth of children. There is no income test. A woman is entitled to the allowance if she resides, or intends to reside, in Australia permanently and gives birth to a child here or on board a ship travelling to Australia. The rates of allowance are as follows: S No other children under 16 30.0 1 or 2 other children under 16 32.0 3 or more other children under 16 35.0 Multiple births-additiona l payment for each additional child 10.0 During 1977-78 the number of grants is estimated at 219 000 compared to 220 000 in 1976-77. Expenditure is estimated to remain steady at S6.9 million. Children'sServices The Commonwealth provides capital and recurrent assistance for pre-school and child care projects including home care, vacation and after-school care projects. Assistance is provided through the State Governments and directly to organisations concerned with pre-school and child care activities. Since1 January 1977, assistance to the States for the recurrent costs of pre-school services has been provided in the form of a block grant, subject to certain broad requirements concerning priority of access. An amount of S39 million will be provided to the States by way of block grants in 1977-78. Total expenditure on children's services is estimated to be $73.3 million in 1977-78 compared to expenditure of $67.1 million in 1976-77. The figure for 1977-78 includes a small amount for new projects. Other Grants are made to eligible marriage guidance organisations (estimated at $2.1 million in 1977-78) and for the provision of family planning facilities and the training of medical personnel (estimated at $0.8 million in 1977-78). An orphan's pension of $11 a week is payable free of income test to the guardian of a child under 16 years of age or a full-time student over 16 but under 25 years of age. It is paid in respect of a child both of whose parents are dead or one of whose parents is dead and the whereabouts of the other is unknown, or in respect of a child whose sole surviving parent or adoptive parent is in prison or in a mental hospital. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $1.6 million in 1976-77 to $2.6 million in 1977-78 partly due to an expected increase in the number of claims and a change in method of reoording payments of these pensions. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Unemployment and sickness benefits are respectively available, subject to an income test, to people who are unemployed or to people who are temporarily incapacitated for work and have thereby lost income. A special benefit may be paid to a person ineligible for a pension or for an unemployment or sickness benefit if he is unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for himself and his dependants. To be eligible for unemployment or sickness benefit, a person must be at least 16 years of age and under 60 (females) or under 65 years (males). The person must also have lived in Australia for at least a year immediately prior to claiming benefit or intend to remain here permanently. The basic rates of benefit are generally the same as for age and invalid pensions except for single people under 18 years of age. This group is eligible for a maximum payment of $36 a week and the benefit is not subject to the automatic indexation provisions for increases in the Consumer Price Index. Beneficiaries are also eligible for additional benefit for each dependent child. After receiving benefits for six consecutive weeks sickness beneficiaries become eligible, subject to a special income test, to receive supplementary allowance of up to $5.00 a week if they pay rent. This allowance is not payable to beneficiaries in hospital who have no dependants. The cost of the increases in rates of unemployment, sickness and special benefits in November 1977 and May 1978 is estimated to be $27.7 million in 1977-78. The Government has decided to change the present system of paying unemployment benefits two weekly in advance to paying benefits two weekly in arrears. Savings from the move are expected to total about S60 million in 1977-78. Special provision will be made for those who would suffer hardship as a result of the change. Unemployment Relief Community Youth Support Scheme The Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) was introduced on 1 November 1976 to assist young unemployed persons who have registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The aim of CYSS is to improve the employability of unemployed youth and to maintain an orientation towards work. Under the Scheme nnanciai assistance is provided to community groups, including recognised youth organisations and local government authorities, to meet thc administrative and operating costs of the projects conducted by those bodies to assist the young unemployed. An allowance of up to $6 a week may be paid to participants to meet fares and incidental expenses. Expenditure under CYSS in 1976-77 amounted to $0.6 million; $4.0 million has been provided for 1977-78. Fraser Island Following its decision to cease granting export licences for minerals from sand mining on Fraser Island, the Commonwealth agreed to provide $10 million to Queensland for allocation by that State to create employment opportunities in the Maryborough region. $1.0 million was provided in 1976-77 and $3.0 million will be provided in each of the next three years. Relocation Assistance Scheme On1 October 1976 the Government introduced the Relocation Assistance Scheme to help overcome the employment difficulties of unemployed persons who are unable to secure continuing employment in their present locality and are without prospects of doing so, even with re-training. Assistance is made available to enable eligible persons to move to another locality to take up either employment or training under NEAT leading to employment. Financial assistance is provided in relation to fares, removal expenses, re-establishment allowance in a new location, and certain other costs incurred by unemployed workers and their families changing their place of permanent residence. The Scheme is estimated to cost $1.3 million in 1977-78, an increase of $1.0 million on 1976-77. Regional Employment Development Scheme (REDS) This scheme was introduced in September 1974 but no new projects have been approved since September 1975. Funeral BenefitsA funeral benefit of up to $20 is payable to any person liable for the funeral costs of an age or invalid pensioner. A higher benefit of up ""to $40 is payable to an age, invalid or widow pensioner (including a woman in receipt of supporting mother's benefit) liable for the funeral costs of a spouse, a child or another such pensioner. For these benefits 'pensioner' means a person who satisfies, or had satisfied, the Commonwealth Government pensioner 'fringe' benefits income test. Expenditure is expected to rise from $1.5 million in 1976-77 to SI.7 million in 1977-78 as a result of an expected increase in numbers becoming eligible. Telephone Rental Concessions A reduction of one-third in the basic annual rental for a telephone is available to pensioners and recipients of some other benefits who meet certain requirements including, in most cases, a special income test. Expenditure on concessions to social security and repatriation pensioners is expected to rise from S14.2 million in 1976-77 to $14.8 million in 1977-78 as a result of an expected increase in the number of persons applying for the concession. Australian Assistance Plan The Government decided last year that the Australian Assistance Plan would more appropriately be administered and funded at the State or local Government level. An amount of $5.4 million was provided in 1976-77 to phase out the Commonwealth's involvement. Assistance to Homeless Men and Women The Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1974 provides, over a three-year period, for the payment of capital grants to voluntary agencies and to local authorities for approved projects (such as night shelters, reception centres and hostels) in order to upgrade and replace inadequate existing accommodation and to build new facilities for homeless persons. It also provides payment of a salary subsidy of 50 per cent of the salary of approved staff, an accommodation subsidy of 75 cents a person a day and a meal subsidy of 25 cents a meal in respect of non-resident homeless persons. The program is to be reviewed this financial year. Expenditure in 1977-78 is estimated to be $6.4 million compared to $2.2 million in 1976-77. The increase in the 1977-78 allocation represents the amount required to meet progress payments on capital projects underway in 1976-77. Assistance for Migrants The Commonwealth makes grants to the Good Neighbour Council (estimated at $1.4 million in 1977-78) and to community agencies involved in migrant integration activities (estimated at $0.7 million in 1977-78). Expenditure on the Community Interpreter Service is estimated to rise from $0,393 million in 1976-77 to $0,465 million in 1977-78 as a result of increased use of the service and the Government's decision to expand the service to Wollongong in 1977-78. Provision has also been made for the operation, on an experimental basis, of migrant information and resource centres in Sydney and Melbourne. Under arrangements introduced in 1976-77 the Commonwealth, in co-operation with the States, local government bodies and ethnic groups, provides information services and assistance to migrant communities. Expenditure under this heading is estimated at $43.5 million in 1977-78, an increase of $7.9 million over expenditure in 1976-77. This increase mainly reflects larger grants-in-aid for employment ($1.5 million) and for town management and public utilities ($4.2 million). Also provision has been made for costs associated with the establishment of the National Aboriginal Conference. This expenditure comprises the general running and capital expenses of the Departments of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs (except those relating to repatriation institutions) and Aboriginal Affairs. 5. HOUSING The Commonwealth nnances a range of programs to provide housing and to assist persons to attain the goal of home ownership. Some of these programs take the form of interest subsidies and tax concessions which are not reflected in Budget outlays. Identifiable housing outlays are estimated to total $495.8 million in 1977-78 and include funds for Aboriginal housing, migrant accommodation, housing in the Territories, Defence Service Homes expenditure and assistance to the States for welfare housing. The total is $53 million less than expenditure last year but this is more than fully accounted for by an estimated $65.2 million reduction in estimated outlays classified to Housing in the Territories, which in turn largely reflects the run-down in expenditure on housing by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and the reclassification of other expenditure on housing in the Northern Territory to General Public Services as part of the $50 million allocation to be made to the N.T. Legislative Assembly in 1977-78. +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million $ million $ million $ million Advances to States for Housing364.6 375.0 390.0 + 15.0 Less Repayments 21.9 24.7 27.7 + 3.0 Net Advances 342.7 350.3 362.3 + 12.0 Grants to States for Housing 6.8 5.5 5.5 Home Savings Grants. . . . 6.6 8.3 20.8 + 12.4 Housing Loans to Banks. 30.1 Less Repayments 53.1 10.7 10.7 Net Loans 23.0G10.7G10.70Defence Service HomesNet Payments 47.9 31.0 21.9 9.0 Interest Subsidy 24.5 23.1 24.9 + 1.8 72.4 54.1 46.8 7.2 Other General Housing ExpenditureCommonwealth H o s t e l s . . . . 1.6 0.9 1.1 + 0.2 2.7 3.2 7.3 + 4.1 4.3 4.1 8.4 + 4.3 Housing in the TerritoriesDwellings Built for Sale or Rental. 86.4 85.9 36.6 -49.3 Other Gross Advances for Housing^ 53.2 52.9 34.8 -18.0 Less Repayment of Principal . 19.4 19.4 17.2 2.2 Net Outlays 120.2 119.4 54.2 (W-65.2 Housing for Migrants 1.2 0.5 0.3 0.2 Housing for Aboriginals . . . . 43.4 40.9 35.3 5.6 General Administrative Expenditure(c) 1.5 Less Other Recoveries and Repayments 13.6 23.5 27.1 + 3.6 (a) The responsibility for this item in the N.T. has been transferred to the N.T. Legislative Assembly. Expenditure is included in the SSO million allocation made to the Assembly and is recorded in the function General Public Services. (fc) See paragraph proceeding Table. (c) Administrative expenses for the Defence Service Homes Scheme are included under that heading in the table. Other Administrative expenditures for Housing are not separable from the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and are recorded in the function Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment. An amount of $390 million, an increase of $15 million on 1976-77, is to be advanced to the States in 1977-78 for welfare housing purposes under the terms of the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement. These advances, which are repayable at low rates of interest over a 53-year period, are mainly to assist the State housing authorities to provide dwellings for rental or sale on a concessional basis to low income families. Part of the advances is allocated to Home Builders' Accounts to provide low-interest housing loans to prospective home owners who meet specified eligibility conditions. Eligibility for allocation of a State housing authority dwelling, or for a loan from the Home Builders' Account, is determined on the basis of means tests. For allocation of a family dwelling from a State housing authority, average weekly income of the main family breadwinner during the previous six months (excluding overtime and child endowment) must not exceed 85 per cent of the Statistician's latest seasonally adjusted quarterly estimate of average weekly earnings. For a loan from Home Builders' Account funds, income of the main breadwinner must not exceed 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. In cases where the family includes more than two children an additional $2 per week is added to the income limit for each additional child. Sales of State housing authority dwellings are limited to a maximum of 30 per cent of family dwellings completed during the five years commencing 1 January 1974. Sales may be made only to purchasers meeting the means test at the time of sale, and there are restrictions on resale. The maximum interest rate is set at 5.75 per cent. Under recently agreed amendments to the Agreement, Victoria and Tasmania will be allowed to increase the limit on the sale of family dwellings to 50 per cent. In New South Wales and Tasmania, dwellings will be sold for cash at market or replacement value and the present embargo on the use of Home Builders' Account funds for the purchase of housing authority dwellings will be lifted. The 1973-1974 Agreement will expire on 30 June 1978. Arrangements for the provision of Commonwealth assistance to the States for welfare housing after June 1978 are being developed in consultation with the States. Details of the Housing Agreement and of the State by State allocation of the $390 million are presented in the document Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1977-78 published concurrently with the Budget Speech. The States Grants (Housing) Act 1971 authorises the provision of housing assistance to the States by way of basic grants of $2.75 million a year, payable for a period of 30 years in respect of the States' housing operations in each of the years 1971-72 and 1972-73; $5.5 million will again be paid in 1977-78. The payments are in lieu of an interest concession on funds used by the States for welfare housing in those years. Further details of these arrangements are presented in the document Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1977-78. HOME SAVINGS GRANTS Home Savings Grants are payable to eligible persons to assist with the purchase or construction of a first home contracted for on or after 1 January 1977, on the basis, of $1 for each $3 of savings held in an acceptable form. Savings from 1 January 1976 are eligible. Grants of up to $667 are payable from 1 January 1977 in respect of savings over at least one year. From1 January 1978, a maximum grant of $1333 will be payable in respect of savings over two years, but a grant of up to $667 will also be available in respect of savings over at least one year. The maximum grant will be increased on 1 January 1979 to $2000 and will be payable in respect of savings held over a three-year period. An amount of $20 million has been provided in the Budget for grants under this scheme in 1977-78. The Banks (Housing Loans) Act 1974 provided for a special appropriation of $150 million to be advanced fo savings banks and certain other banks for the purpose of making additional housing finance available to give a short-term stimulus to activity and employment in the home building industry. Balances outstanding at 30 June 1977 amounted to $85.9 million of which $10.7 million is expected to be repaid in 1977-78. The Defence Service Homes Corporation was established on 13 December 1976 with responsibility for the administration of the Defence Service Homes Scheme. It replaces the Australian Housing Corporation which was abolished on that date. The Corporation functions within the framework of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. During 1976-77, the Corporation was empowered to continue its operations under the financial arrangements that had applied to the Australian Housing Corporation. From1 July 1977 its capital programs will be financed through the Defence Service Homes Trust Account while its operating expenses are being provided for within the votes of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Capital advances of $22.0 million are being provided in 1977-78 for the Trust Account. An estimated $72.6 million, repressnting mainly repayments of principal by borrowers, will be retained in the Trust Account for relending, making a total of $94.6 million available for Defence Service Homes programs in 1977-78. An application fee of $75 for an initial application for a loan to acquire a home and $50 for an additional loan will be introduced during 1977-78. Separate waiting lists for loans will also be introduced for applicants with war service and for applicants without war service. These lists will be administered to give a measure of preference to applicants with war service and, within each list, to applicants with an assessed urgent housing need. Defence Service Homes estate development and construction activities are to be phased out. Expenditure in 1977-78 will be limited to existing firm commitments. Completed building blocks will be offered to existing applicants at market value and surplus land will be disposed of as circumstances permit. An amount of $15.2 million is being provided in 1977-78 for administrative expenses, including salaries and rent for the Corporation. This compares with $7.9 million provided as an administrative subsidy in 1976-77 under the previous financial arrangements. In that year, however, the Corporation also had available to it a surplus of $4.1 million carried forward from 1975-76 by the Australian Housing Corporation and other income including investment income of $4.5 million, making a total of $16.5 million. The figures include an estimated interest subsidy element in 1977-78 of $24.9 million. In 1976-77 an interest subsidy of S23.1 million was paid to the Corporation. The interest subsidy reflects the extent to which interest charged to borrowers under the Defence Service Homes Scheme falls short of the interest rate payable to the Commonwealth on the Corporation's capital. Repayments to Consolidated Revenue by the Corporation in 1977-78 are estimated at SI5.7 million, including an amount of $3.2 million in recoveries. The remaining $12.5 million comprises S6.5 million representing the net amount of excess payments accumulated by the Corporation from borrowers under Section 29 (2) of the Act for the period 1 December 1975 to 30 June 1977, and an estimated $6.0 million for excess payments in 1977-78. Included here are amounts of S5.8 million for caretaking, repairs and maintenance of rental dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, S1.0 million to complete the design of the Housing Allowance Voucher Experiment and to commence its implementation in Melbourne late in 1977-78, and S0.5 million to fund a Committee of Inquiry into the cost of housing in Australia. The Committee has been asked to report by 30 June 1978. Expenditure under this heading covers the construction of new houses and flats and advances to individuals for the construction of dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Of the $36.6 million allocated for dwellings to be built for sale or rental in 1977-78, $14.4 miflion is for the Australian Capital Territory ($22.3 million in 1976-77) and $22.2 million for the Northern Territory ($63.6 million in 1976-77). Of the latter amount, $17.2 million is for dwelling construction by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. The decrease in funds for the Australian Capital Territory reflects in part a slow-down in the rate of growth in the population of the National Capital while the reduction in the Northern Territory reflects the run-down in the program of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. Other Gross Advances for Housing include allocations from the Budget, re-cycled funds and estimated proceeds from private borrowings. These are estimated to decrease from $52.9 million in 1976-77 to $34.8 million in 1977-78 but this change is affected by a classification change. Whereas an amount of $21.2 million was advanced to the N.T. Housing Commission from the Budget last year there is no comparable figure in the estimates for 1977-78. Executive responsibility for the Commission was transferred to the N.T. Legislative Assembly on 1 January 1977, and for 1977-78 the amount to be advanced to the Commission will be determined by the Assembly from within the global allocation provided to that body (see Table 9E). An amount of $14.6 million will be available to the A.C.T. Commissioner for Housing for first mortgage lending in 1977-78 ($12.9 million in 1976-77). Of this amount, $6.5 million will be provided in the Budget (the same as in 1976-77) and a borrowing of $4.5 million is proposed to be made by the Commissioner from private sources. The balance of $3.6 million consists of funds recirculated through a Trust Account. This increased sum will help to meet increases in the size of individual loans following the raising of the loan limit from $15 000 to $20 000, effective from 1 July 1977. An amount of $20.3 million is estimated to be available for first mortgage lending by the N.T. Home Finance Trustee. Of this amount, $15.0 million will be provided from the Budget for the concessional loans to eligible Darwin residents to rebuild dwellings destroyed by Cyclone Tracy. Borrowing proceeds to the extent of $5.3 million are to be utilised for the N.T. Home Finance Trustee's non-concessional home financing activities. An allocation of $35.3 million has been provided for special assistance for Aboriginal housing in 1977-78. This allocation, which is $5.6 million below 1976-77 expenditure, reflects a thorough reassessment of the program, leading to increased cost-effectiveness. Estimated outlays include $10.4 million in grants to States and $24.8 million in grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations for the construction and purchase of homes for Aboriginal families. The 1977-78 provision for the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund of the Aboriginal Loans Commission is $5 million, compared with $10 million in 1976-77. Following a review of the objectives and priorities of the Aboriginal Hostels program, an amount of $5.3 million is to be paid to Aboriginal Hostels Limited for the provision of hostel accommodation in 1977-78; expenditure in 1976-77 was $3.7 million. The main items included here are rents received in respect of Government-owned dwellings in the Territories and payments from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. Receipts from rentals in the Northern Territory are estimated to increase from $3.1 million in 1976-77 to $6.0 million in 1977-78. The increase reflects additional rents being charged for dwellings restored to pre-cyclone condition and a proposed increase in the overall level of rentals to apply from September 1977. Revenue from housing rentals in the A.C.T. is estimated to increase from $15.6 million in 1976-77 to $21.0 million; this reflects the full year effect of the rent increase in 1976-77 and a proposed further increase in 1977-78. Receipts from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in 1976-77 included $4.5 million from its General Reserve and $0.2 million repayment of the initial advance made to the Corporation on its establishment in 1965. 6.

These include nnanciai assistance for growth centres and decentralisation, land commissions, urban rehabilitation and expenditure on the physical development of urban centres in the Commonwealth Territories. Initiatives in urban public transport are discussed under 'Transport and Communication' in the 'Economic Services' block. Growth Centres and Decentralisation Assistance An amount of S1S.1 million has been included in the Budget for growth centres and for decentralisation assistance. A further SI7.5 million is included for capitalised interest on advances in 1977-78 and earlier years for growth centres. The $15.1 million includes $0.8 million-recorde d as pan of the general administrative expenditure item -for the Commonwealth's one-third contribution to the estimated administrative expenses of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and for the costs associated with the proposed scaling down of the staff of the Corporation. Included in the balance of $14.3 million is $5.1 million for assistance to the States for Albury-Wodonga and $3 million for Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur. Most of the remaining $6.2 million is intended for general decentralisation assistance. Urban Rehabilitation In 1974-75 the Commonwealth Government acquired, at a cost of $17.5 million, 700 dwellings on 19 hectares of land at Glebe from the Anglican Church with a view towards rehabilitating the Estate and preserving accommodation for low income families. Expenditure on rehabilitation in 1976-77 amounted to $1.2 million and an amount of $0.8 million has been provided in the Budget for further rehabilitation in 1977-78; $0.7 million is provided for costs associated with the administration and maintenance of the Estate. An amount of $1.2 million is provided to meet the estimated cost in 1977-78 of further acquisition, planning and site development of land in the Woolloomooloo basin of Sydney. This continues the provision of financial assistance to New South Wales, which amounted to $5.8 million in 1975-76 and $3.0 million in 1976-77, under an agreement concluded with the State in 1974-75. The site is to be developed mainly for residential purposes. In addition to the provision of this financial assistance, the Commonwealth agreed to transfer to New South Wales, at no charge, land which was valued in excess of $11 million. Such transactions, by their nature, are not shown in ths Commonwealth's expenditure estimates. Urban Flood Mitigation The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to provide 40 per cent of the cost of flood mitigation works on Breakfast Creek and Enoggera Creek in Brisbane. An amount of $1.8 million is provided to allow completion of the project in 1977-78; this takes total Commonwealth contributions in respect of these works to over $5 million. Area Improvement Program The Area Improvement Program was established in 1973-74 with a view to helping to remedy deficiencies of public facilities in certain locations. Expenditure amounted to only $0.6 million in 1976-77 to discharge commitments and no funds will be made available in 1977-78; the purposes of the Program are now effectively provided for in new tax sharing arrangements with local government which provide substantially increased levels of untied general purpose assistance to local government. Land Commissions/Urban Land Councils An amount of $14.1 million is provided in the Budget for 1977-78 to meet remaining commitments to the States for land commissions/ urban land councils. A further $12.7 million is entailed in the form of capitalisation of interest payments on loans provided to the States in 1977-78 and previous years. The assistance provided for land commissions/urban land councils is for land acquisition and servicing of the land acquired (where these costs are not met from normal government subventions) and urban renewal and redevelopment. The main aims of the program have been to make land available for residential and associated uses at fair prices, and to facilitate the efficient planning and development of new urban areas. Following the review of the Commonwealth's involvement in urban land development programs in 1976-77, the Commonwealth has, with the co-operation of the States, established an independent national inquiry into housing costs to prepare a report on the means available to improve the efficiency and to lower the cost of the supply of housing, and the provision of infrastructure services within existing national resources. Other Urban Development and Amenities This heading covers a number of items associated mainly with the development of urban land and community facilities in the Commonwealth Territories. The major item included in the total of $41.0 million is $33.9 million for land and community development in the Australian Capital Territory. The reduction of $6.3 million from the level of expenditure in 1976-77 largely reflects the decreased level of land development in Canberra because of the slow-down in the city's rate of growth. Development of Aboriginal Community Amenities Expenditure in 1977-78 on the provision and improvement of facilities in Aboriginal Communities, including land purchase, water supply, sewerage and other services is estimated at $8.3 million, $0.6 million more than actual expenditure in 1976-77. The main provisions for 1977-78 comprise assistance to New South Wales to complete the capital program associated with the abatement of pollution at the Captains Flat mine dumps ($0,225 million), expenditure on air monitoring activity ($0,285 million) and grants to conservation bodies ($0.3 million). The Budget provides a net $20.2 million for this purpose in 1977-78 compared with expenditure of $83.1 million in 1976-77. The decrease reflects mainly the Commonwealth's decision to discontinue assistance to the States for sewerage works. An amount of $0.3 million will, however, be made available to the States to allow the completion of a number of studies relevant to the rationalisation of the provision of sewerage services. In the Territories $5.4 million is provided in 1977-78 for the reconstruction and augmentation of the Darwin water and sewerage service, and a further $14.8 million for sewerage and waste disposal in the Australian Capital Territory. Of this latter provision $10.3 million is allocated for the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre. This item includes the administrative expenditure of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development ($12.9 million), the Darwin Reconstruction Commission (S0.9 million) and the National Capital Development Commission ($8.2 million). It also includes $11.8 million for private consultant fees for investigation, design and supervision for the National Capital Development Commission. As indicated earlier the estimate for 1977-78 also includes $0.3 million in respect of the Commonwealth's one-third contribution to the estimated administrative expenses of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and S0.5 million for the Corporation to meet costs associated with the proposed reduction in the number of Corporation staff. The levelling off in this expenditure reflects reductions in staff numbers and administrative expenditures generally, consistent with the Commonwealth's policy of reducing its involvement in the area of urban and regional development. 7. CULTURE AND RECREATION The Commonwealth provides support for a wide range of cultural and recreational activities. Outlays in 1977-78 are estimated at S260.9 million, an increase of $3.5 million compared with 1976-77. +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million S million $ million $ million National Broadcasting and Television Services (net) 164.3 164.2 163.5 0 .6 Planning of Broadcasting and Television . 2.3 2.5 2.4 0 .1 Regulation of Broadcasting and Television 1.8 2.1 2.3 +0.2 Ethnic Broadcasting . . . . 0.3 0.6 1.9 + 1.4 Libraries 11.7 13.1 13.1 +0.1 Australian National Gallery and Collection 4.6 7.3 11.5 +4.2 Film Industry Development 2.9 3.7 6.2 + 2.5 Assistance to the Arts. . . . 23.9 23.7 23.8 +0.1 War Memorials 0.9 1.0 1.3 +0.3 Archives 5.2 5.1 5.8 + 0.7 Youth, Sport and Recreation . 11.4 9.7 6.7 3 .0 Other Cultural Organisations . 1.3 2.4 1.1 -1.3 Wildlife and National Parks. 3.3 3.1 3.5 +0.3 National Estate 3.9 1.3 26 + 1.3 Australian Heritage Commission 0.3 0.5 +0.2 Cultural and Recreational Activities in the Territories nec 15.1 17.8 14.9 -2.9 Less Recoveries 0.2 0.2 0.3 +0.1 National Broadcasting and Television Service The programs of the National Broadcasting and Television Service are presented by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) and broadcast through transmitters provided and operated by the Australian Telecommunications Commission (ATC). The net allocation of $163.5 million for 1977-78 provides for the continuation of the operational activity of the Service at about the existing level; it also provides $13.2 million for capital development, including a small amount for further expansion of the National Broadcasting and Television Service network in country areas. A significant component of these outlays relates to Radio Australia-S4. 9 million for program expenditure through the ABC and $3.8 million for transmission expenditure through ATC. An amount of $0.6 million is included for the commencement of rehabilitation of the Radio Australia stations at Shepparton (Victoria) and in the Northern Territory. Planning of Broadcasting and Television With the abolition of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in December 1976. the Postal and Telecommunications Department now carries out the planning and development of broadcasting and television services generally. Regulation of Broadcasting and Television The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which was set up in January 1977 following the abolition of the Broadcasting Control Board, is responsible for the regulation and control of the radio and television industry, including conduct of public inquiries in relation to the issue and renewal of licences for commercial, and public, radio and television stations. Ethnic Broadcasting The Government proposes to establish a new statutory body to carry out ethnic broadcasting and, at a later date, possibly other specialised broadcasting services which may be allocated to it. Until that body is established, the Postal and Telecommunications Department is continuing to operate the ethnic broadcasting stations in Sydney and Melbourne. An amount of $1.9 million is being provided for the ethnic broadcasting service in 1977-78, compared with expenditure of $0.6 million last year directly related to the formerly experimental stations. Libraries Funds under this heading provide for operational expenditure by the National Library of Australia and the Canberra Public Library Service. Total outlays are estimated to be $13.1 million in 1977-78, about the same as in 1976-77. Australian National Gallery and Collection The Australian National Gallery commenced operations as a separate statutory authority in. 1976-77. An amount of $11.5 million is provided for the Gallery in 1977-78, comprising $1.0 million for administration, $3.2 million for acquisition of further items for the National Collection, including works of Australian Art, and $7.3 million for construction expenditure on the National Gallery building. The expected completion date of the new Gallery is 1981. Film Industry Development The Australian Film Commission encourages the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian films by providing loans to film makers, and by various promotional activities. During 1976-77 the Commission's role was expanded to include assistance for creative development in film making, which was formerly the function of the Film, Radio and Television Board of the Australia Council. Assistance to the Arts The Commonwealth's program of assistance to the Arts is administered by the Australia Council, with the assistance of Boards responsible for theatre, music, literature, Aboriginal arts, crafts and visual arts. (In 1976-77 responsibility for the Film, Radio and Television Board was transferred to the Australian Film Commission.) The total allocation for the Council in 1977-78 is $23.7 million and consists of the following components: $ million Australian Opera 2.400 Australian Ballet Foundation 1.280 Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust Orchestras . . . . . . 2.030 Public Lending Right Scheme 0.800 General Support for the Arts 13.730 Administration . 3.500 23.740 The Council will also have available to it in 1977-78 $0.8 million from cash balances. War Memorials An amount of SI.3 million is provided for running costs and capital works of the Australian War Memorial in 1977-78, compared with Sl.O million in 1976-77. Archives The Government will continue to develop, preserve and maintain archival resources that are of national significance or of general public interest. The Budget provides S5.8 million for these purposes in 1977-78, including SI.6 million for the construction of new repositories at Collinswood (S.A.) and Mitchell Park (A.C.T.); comparable expenditure in 1976-77 was $5.1 million. Youth, Sport and Recreation Expenditure on these activities in 1977-78 is estimated at $6.7 million. An amount of S3.7 million has been provided to meet existing commitments towards construction costs of community amenities approved under the Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities Program. Grants under this program amounted to $6.9 million in 1976-77. An amount of $3.0 million, including $1.0 million for a new program of support for national sport and sporting bodies, has been provided for other youth, sport and recreation programs in 1977-78. The Government has also announced that a Sports Advisory Council is to be established to provide advice on sports development and assistance. Other Cultural Organisations In 1977-78 Commonwealth expenditure in relation to the Queen's Silver Jubilee year is estimated at $0.8 million, including $0.4 million for commemorative activities. Expenditure in 1976-77 amounted to $2.4 million and included a contribution of $2.0 million to the Queen's Silver Jubilee Appeal for Young Australians. Wildlife and National Parks The major items under this heading are grants to the States to acquire land for nature conservation purposes ($0.8 million), support for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ($0.4 million), and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service ($1.8 million). National Estate The Commonwealth provides assistance to State and local Government bodies, National Trusts and other bodies for the protection of the National Estate. An amount of $2.6 million is provided in 1977-78 to finance a program of assistance for the restoration, preservation and improvement of buildings and areas of special significance. Australian Heritage Commission The responsibilities of the Australian Heritage Commission include the development of procedures for the protection of the National Estate. The Commission is continuing to compile a National Register of the National Estate which will identify and categorise historic sites, buildings and areas of national historic importance that are worthy of restoration and preservation. The running costs of the Commission in 1977-78 are estimated at $0.5 million. Cultural and Recreation Activities in the Territories (nec) This item relates mainly to the maintenance of parks, gardens and sporting facilities in the A.C.T. 8. ECONOMIC SERVICES This heading brings together the various services and categories of assistance provided by the Commonwealth to industry and to the community generally. It embraces the provision of economic infrastructure, the regulation of private sector economic activity and more direct forms of Government participation in economic activity. A. TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION The Budget provides $844.2 million for transport and communication activities in 1977-78, $144.8 million less than in 1976-77. These outlays represent 3.2 per cent of estimated total outlays for 1977-78. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million % million $ million 3 million CommunicationAustralian Postal Commission (net) 3.0 3.0 O28.0 0 25.0 Australian Telecommunications Commission 392.0 215.0 65.0 -150.0 Overseas Telecommunications Commission 10.0 Cr+ 10.0 Administrative and Other. 2.8 1.1 1.4 + 0.3 Radio Frequency Management 5.0 5.3 5.6 + 0.3 Total Communication 402.9 208.4 44.0 -164.4 Air TransportAdvance to Qantas. . . . 49.4 2.4 2.4 Less Repayments . . . . 18 7 20.8 20.4 0.4 Net Advance. . . . 30.7 18.4 Cr 20.4 Cr 2.0 Advance to Australian National Airlines Commission 0.7 7.6 7.6 Less Repayments . . . . 6.1 5.6 2.5 3.0 Net Advance. . . . 5.4 Cr 2.0 2.5 Cr 4.5 Provision of Civil Aviation ServicesAdministrative and Operational 152.4 160.4 161.5 + 1.1 Buildings, Works and Equipment 24.8 15.1 20.2 + 5.0 Air Services Subsidy 0.8 0.7 0.4 0.3 Other 2.9 3.2 2.7 0.5 Less RecoveriesAir Navigation Charges. 53.5 61.6 72.5 + 11.2 Other 22.9 24.2 31.2 + 7.0 Total 104.5 93.6 80.7 12.9 Total Air Transport . 129.8 77.2 57.8 19.5 Road TransportRoad Grants 433.5 433.8 477.9 + 44.1 Road Construction and MaintenanceIn the Territories . . . . 32.1 29.8 49.9 + 20.0 Other 17.5 15.8 4.6 11.2 Public Transport Equipment in the Territories 9.3 5.7 5.8 + 0.1 Research and Investigations 2.2 1.7 0.4 1.3 Total Road Transport 494.6 486.9 538.6 + 51.7 + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million S million S million S million Rail TransportAustralian National Railways 93.7 74.5 88.8 + 14.2 Rail Projects in the StatesWestern Australia . . . . 0.1 0.1 South Australia . . . . 5.0 0.7 0.7 Less Repayments State Railways. 3.9 4.1 4.2 Total 1.0 3.3 Cr 4.2 Cr 0.8 Other Rail Transport 0.4 Total Rail Transport 95.1 71.2 84.6 + 13.4 Transport Planning and Research 8.8 9.6 11.9 + 2.3 Urban Public Transport 33.9 58.4 51.0 7.4 Shipping and HarboursAustralian Shipping Commission Advances 82.3 48.2 1.1 47.1 Less Repayments . . . . 1.0 39.8 6.5 -33.3 Net Advances. . . . 81.3 8.4 5.4 Cr 13.8 Drydocks 1.2 0.4 Cr 0.5 Shipping SubsidiesTasmania 5.5 20.5 25.0 + 4.5 Other 4.3 2.8 4.1 + 1.3 Less Repayments . . . . 0.5 0.4 0.4 Total Shipping and Harbours 91.7 31.3 22.8 8.5 PipelinesPipeline Authority Project. 66.8 39.0 33.8 5.3 Less Repayments . . . . 1.9 1.9 13.3 + 11.4 TotalP i p e l in e s . . . . 64.9 37.2 20.5 16.7 General Administrative and Other Expenditure 22.8 27.3 34.8 + 7.5 Less Other Recoveries . . . . 15.4 18.5 21.8 + 3.3 Australian Postal Commission and Australian Telecommunications Commission These two bodies respectively provide postal and telecommunications services in Australia. Each Commission is required to operate on a commercial basis with the financial objective of generating, by way of charges for services, such amounts as are necessary to meet all operating costs and at least half of its capital expenditure. During 1977-78 the Australian Postal Commission will use surplus funds accumulated from past operating surpluses to repay S28 million of its capital indebtedness to the Commonwealth and tofinancean expected loss on its operations. The Australian Telecommunications Commission proposes to raise up to S210 million in longer term borrowings from the domestic capital market in 1977-78 (compared with S200 million in 1976-77); drawings from the Budget in 1977-78 are estimated at S65 million, compared with S215 million in 1976-77. Overseas Telecommunications Commission This body, which is also required to operate on a commercial basis, provides telecommunications services between Australia and other countries. In 1976-77 the Commission repaid to the Commonwealth S10 million of its capital. Radio Frequency Management Administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act includes regulation of the operations of the many radio communications stations operating in Australia, including the recently approved category of ""Citizens Band"" stations. A net provision of $5.6 million is included for 1977-78. AI R TRANSPORT Advances to Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian National Airlines Commission Past advances were mainly in the form of proceeds of loans raised by the Commonwealth on behalf of the airlines to assist in the financing of aircraft purchases. No provision has been made for loans to the airlines in 1977-78. Amounts repaid by the airlines to the Commonwealth in respect of past loans-estimate d at $23.0 million in 1977-78-ar e in turn repaid to the lenders. Civ/7 Aviation Services The Department of Transport provides many services to the air transport industry, including the provision and operation of over 80 airports and a network of air navigational facilities. Those activities account for the major portion of administrative and operational expenditure and outlays on buildings, works and equipment. Expenditure on air transport activities in 1977-78 (estimated at $161.5 million) reflects the Government's current policy of expenditure restraint, and proposed reduction in staff numbers during the year. Steps are being taken to maintain efficiency in the provision of services and facilities to the industry to ensure that the existing high standards are preserved. Total estimated expenditure of $20.2 million on buildings, works and equipment includes nearly $4.2 million for land acquisitions, principally at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport ($1,975 million), Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport ($0.65 million), Brisbane Airport ($0.68 million) and Perth Airport ($0,345 million). Provision for buildings and works in 1977-78 is $5.5 million, including approximately $1.4 million for extensions to the southern apron at Kingsford-Smith Airport. An amount of $0.9 million is provided for final payment for three F28 aircraft delivered in 1976-77. For purchases of navigational aids and other technical equipment additional to the F28 purchases, there is provision in 1977-78 of $9.5 million, an increase of approximately $3 million over expenditure in 1976-77. Air Service Subsidies Following the study of essential air transport needs in the area served by Connair Pty Ltd, the Government proposes to continue subsidies to that company over the next three years although on a reducing basis; the level of assistance in 1977-78 is $0,425 million. Subsidies will also be payable, on a basis yet to be determined, to certain other operators of essential air services in remote areas of Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. Other Expenditure This item includes an amount of S0.6 million to enable continuation of the Interscan program and other aviation research in 1977-78. An amount of $1.75 million is included for maintenance and development of aerodromes under the aerodrome local ownership plan. Civil Aviation Services-Recoveries The Government has decided not to increase air navigation charges during 1977. Other recoveries are estimated to increase by S7.0 million to S31.2 million in 1977-78. Estimated revenue of SI 1.1 million from airport rentals reflects the Government's decision to charge full economic rentals at capital city airport terminals; SI.5 million is anticipated from charges to be introduced in 1977-78 for a wide range of regulatory services formerly provided by the Department of Transport at little or no cost to the user. Expenditures incurred on flight testing of RAAF navigational aid facilities are also to be recovered from the Department of Defence. Revenue from business concessions at airports is expected to increase in 1977-78, and receipts from car parking fees to decrease, following the transfer of certain departmental car parking activities at several airports to concessionaires. Estimated revenue from the sale in 1977-78 of surplus aircraft from the Department of Transport's fleet is SI million. ROAD TRANSPORT Road Grants The Budget provides a total of $477.9 million in grants to the States for roads in 1977-78. That amount comprises $475 million in respect of 1977-78 and some S2.9 million to be paid in respect of 1976-77 commitments. Altogether there will be an increase of S44.1 million over payments during 1976-77. As previously announced, the Government intends that the 1978-79 and 1979-80 grants will be at least equivalent in real terms to the 1977-78 level of grants of S475 million. Road Construction and Maintenance-Territories Funds for road construction and maintenance in the Territories are to be increased by $20.0 million to $49.9 million in 1977-78. Of that amount, $7.5 million has been allocated for the continued upgrading and maintenance of the Stuart and Barkly highways, $12.0 million for construction and maintenance of other roads in the Northern Territory, and $30.4 million for road construction and maintenance in the Australian Capital Territory. Construction of the Molonglo arterial is expected to require SI3 million of the latter allocation. Road Construction and Maintenance-Other Outlays on other road construction and maintenance include S5.2 million in assistance subsequent to the Tasman Bridge disaster, including restructuring of the Bridge to provide an additional traffic lane. Of this total an amount of S0.6 million is provided for the continuation of design and related investigations for the proposed second Derwent Bridge at Dowsings Point, Hobart. Repayments (by Queensland) of advances provided for the construction of beef cattle roads are estimated at $0.6 million. Road Research and Investigations The apparent reduction shown in the table for the provision for road research and investigations in 1977-78 compared with 1976-77 reflects a classification change. The Bureau of Roads, which was previously included under this heading, was amalgamated with the Transport Department's Bureau of Transport Economics in 1977 and the relevant outlays are now shown under 'Transport Planning and Research'. RAIL TRANSPORT Australian National Railways (ANR) The major provisions included are $55.0 million to meet operating losses expected in 1977-78 and $33.3 million for ANR's capital works program. Almost all of the provision for operating losses is in respect of the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railway systems for which the ANR has had financial responsibility since 1 July 1975. Major elements in the capital works program are the construction of a standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs and the rehabilitation of the Tasmanian railway system. Also included in the ANR item is an amount of S0.45 million to reimburse ANR for the loss incurred on continuing, at the direction of the Government, the operation of the passenger service in Tasmania known as the Tasman Limited. There is no 1977-78 provision for the Adelaide/Crystal Brook Rail Standardisation project. Rail Projects in the States State Railways repayments of past advances from the Commonwealth for rail projects (mainly standardisation) are estimated to amount to $4.2 million in 1977-78. Some rail projects in the States appear under the 'Urban Public Transport' heading. Transport Planning and Research The Commonwealth is providing $8.9 million in 1977-78 under proposed new arrangements for assistance to the States for approved land transport researoh projects. This includes $0.9 million to meet commitments entered into by the States in 1976-77. In addition, $3 million is provided to finance the Bureau of Transport Economics (formerly recorded as part of the general administrative outlays of the Department of Transport). The functions of the Bureau have been expanded following its absorption of the former Bureau of Roads, and now encompass detailed investigations of the economics and financing of road and other transport modes. Urban Public Transport The Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the States, under the terms of the Urban Public Transport Agreement, to meet two-thirds of the cost of approved urban public transport projects. Payments to the States under the terms of the Agreement to the end of 1976-77 totalled $137.3 million. Proposed expenditure in 1977-78 of S51.0 million includes an estimated $27.7 million to meet the Commonwealth's share of cost escalation on projects approved under the Agreement, and S5 million for new projects. Australian Shipping Commission An amount of Sl.l million is provided for advances to the Australian Shipping Commission (ANL) in 1977-78 to partially finance its capital program. In 1977-78, ANL is financing most of its capital program from internally generated funds, and from overseas borrowings (for major items of capital equipment). ANL's current program includes payments for the construction of seven bulk carriers (four 15 000 dwt, one 25 000 dwt, one 122 000 dwt and one 138 000 dwt), a roll-on roll-off vessel for the South East Asian trade and associated equipment and a container terminal at Botany Bay. ANL is expected to repay $6.5 million in 1977-78 in respect of earlier loans from the Budget. Shipping Subsidies-Tasmania An amount of S23 million is provided for Tasmanian freight equalisation in 1977-78; SI7 million for the northbound scheme and S6 million for the new southbound scheme which operates retrospectively from 1 July 1976. The schemes aim to make the door-to-door freight cost of eligible cargoes shipped between Tasmania and the mainland approximate the door-to-door costs of moving similar goods by road or rail over similar distances on the mainland. The provision for shipping subsidies to Tasmania also includes $2.0 million for the Australian Shipping Commission to subsidise the operation of the 'Empress of Australia' passenger service between Tasmania and the mainland. Shipping and Harbours-Other 'Other' outlays of $4.1 million in 1977-78 include $2.9 million for capital expenditure, mainly by the Department of Transport on navigational aids and facilities. The advance of $33.8 million to the Pipeline Authority provided in 1977-78 includes $5.5 million for the completion of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and S28.3 million towards meeting capital and interest commitments in respect of the Authority's borrowings. Repayments by the Authority are estimated to total $11.4 million in 1977-78. In addition, provision is made for a repayment of $1.9 million in 1977-78 in respect of advances made to South Australia for a natural gas pipeline. An amount of $34.8 million is provided in 1977-78 for the running expenses of the Department of Transport (other than expenses related to provision of air transport services and the functions of the Bureau of Transport Economics), of which S25.9 million represents wages and salaries. Light dues, which are charged on commercial shipping for the use of marine navigational aids provided by the Commonwealth, are the major source of recoveries under this heading. It is proposed to increase the charge from 35 cents to 41 cents per net registered ton per quarter from 1 October 1977. This increase is expected to yield additional revenue of $2.3 million in 1977-78, leading to full recovery of estimated costs in 1977-78. B. WATER SUPPLY AND ELECTRICITY Outlays on urban water supply and electricity projects are estimated to total $44.0 million in 1977-78, a decrease of $28.1 million compared with 1976-77. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease \ctual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million $ million $ million S million Urban Water Supply 20.0 35.7 25.3 10.4 Snowy Mountains Scheme 3.0 0.4 0.6 + 0.2 Gladstone Power Station 39.0 26.4 1.0 25.4 Electricity Supply in the Territories . 16.7 18.0 25.3 + 7.4 Less Repayments 8.0 8.4 8.2 0.1 Urban Water Supply The Commonwealth is continuing to provide nnanciai assistance to South Australia for water treatment works in Adelaide. The Budget includes an amount of $6.0 million for this purpose compared with $9.2 million in 1976-77. Also included here is an amount of $19.3 million for expenditure on water supply works in the Territories, including $16 million for expenditure on the Googong Dam and associated works. The latter project will increase water storage capacity in the Canberra/ Queanbeyan area to a level capable of sustaining a population of around 400 000. The Googong Dam is expected to be completed in 1978, at a total estimated cost of about S40 million. Snowy Mountains Scheme The diminishing level of outlays on the Snowy Mountains Scheme over recent years reflects the virtual completion of the Scheme. The proposed payment of $0.6 million to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority will enable the Authority to undertake certain capital works pending completion of the Government's investigation of ways in which the New South Wales and Victorian Governments might share in financing assets required for the operation and maintenance of the Scheme. Gladstone Power Station Commonwealth assistance is being provided to the Queensland Government, by way of loans, to help finance the construction of a thermal power station at Gladstone in central Queensland. Assistance from the Commonwealth for the project is, within specified limits, proportionate to the total cost of the power station in the ratio of 80 to 155. Payments of $39 million and $26.4 million were made in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and a final estimated payment of S1.0 million will be made in 1977-78. Electricity Supply in the Territories The increase of $7.4 million in estimated expenditure in 1977-78 largely reflects work being undertaken in Darwin, for which funds amounting to $18.8 million are provided in the Budget. That estimate includes provision for the rehabilitation of electricity reticulation, the servicing of sites for new housing and the continuing augmentation of the Stokes Hill Power Station. Repayments Repayments in 1977-78 are estimated at $8.2 million, consisting of repayments of $5.2 million by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, and of S3 million by the Tasmanian Government in respect of assistance previously provided for hydroelectric power development in that State. C. INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT The Commonwealth assists industry through a variety of measures, including direct financial assistance, taxation concessions, guaranteed home price arrangements, financial guarantees and the customs tariff. Net direct assistance from the Budget (i.e., after deducting amounts collected by way of industry levies and charges such as the wool tax and the livestock slaughter levy) is estimated at $243.0 million in 1977-78 compared with $206.5 million in 1976-77, an increase of 17.7 per cent. These outlays represent 0.9 per cent of total estimated outlays in 1977-78. Direct industry assistance takes the form of bounties and subsidies, reconstruction and adjustment schemes, contributions to research and promotion programs, price support and other payments to or for the benefit of industry. It includes also some outlays by Government departments and instrumentalities (e.g., Department of Overseas Trade, Department of Industry and Commerce, Department of Primary Industry and the Australian Tourist Commission) which provide many services either free of charge or for charges which do not recover fully the costs incurred. Apart from these direct outlays from the Budget, substantial additional assistance has been provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Government revenues, are as much a call on the Budget as direct outlays. The amount of revenue forgone in 1976-77 through the main taxation concessions for which data are available is estimated to have been S246 million. Further information relating to these taxation concessions is provided at the end of the commentary on this sub-function. Outlays under some other functional headings in this Statement also assist industry. Examples include the provision of airports and airways facilities for the aviation industry, assistance for the development of the film and television industry, some specific purpose payments to the States, expenditure to improve the defence capacity of industry, and part of the expenditure of the CSIRO. The following table shows net outlays on direct assistance to industry in the past two years, together with estimates for 1977-78.

It is estimated that a further S0.45 million will be provided in 1977-78. The Commonwealth extended the agreement authorised by the 1972 Act for one year, with amounts payable to the States in 1976-77 being limited in aggregate to $6 million. The actual amount paid to the States in 1976-77 was $5.8 million. The Commonwealth has announced that $4.2 million will be provided by way of interest-bearing loans to the States in 1977-78, for the maintenance of existing Commonwealth financed plantings. This allocation is to be the first under a new five year agreement being negotiated with the States. Wool Industry The Government has authorised the Australian Wool Corporation to continue to operate a minimum reserve price of 284 cents per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis for the 1977-78 wool selling season. The Corporation will continue to regulate the flow of wool onto the auction market to improve the balance between quantities of wool supplied and demanded and will exercise a 'pot-holing' function to reduce losses due to random movements in prices when the market is above the floor. During 1976-77 the Australian Wool Corporation repaid $145 million of earlier borrowings from the Commonwealth under the Wool Marketing (Loan) Act; and is expected to repay the balance of SI00 million in 1977-78. The wool tax (8 per cent on the gross returns from wool sold) is estimated to yield S95 million in 1977-78. This tax includes a special levy of 5 per cent on the gross returns from wool sold, to offset any losses which may arise from the operation of the reserve price scheme; it is estimated that the special levy will result in an amount of S59.5 milllion being collected and paid to the Corporation's Market Support Fund in 1977-78. For 1977-78 the Budget provides for the Commonwealth to contribute S31.4 million to wool promotion and research in 1977-78 being SI9.9 million for promotion and $11.5 million for research. The latter figure is made up of S6.9 million for payment to the Wool Research Trust Fund, S4.4 million for the CSIRO and S0.2 million for the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The payment of S4.4 million to the CSIRO represents a change from previous years in the financing of wool research and is not reflected in figures given in the table above (but is included in the estimates of expenditure through CSIRO in 'General and Scientific Research'). In addition to the Commonwealth's contribution, S32.1 million is expected to be contributed by the industry from proceeds of the Wool Tax, and $3.1 million, from reserves. Including the $4.4 million payment to CSIRO, total expenditure for wool promotion and research in 1977-78 is estimated at $66.6 million. Wheat Industry The sixth Wheat Industry Stabilisation Scheme commenced with the marketing of the 1974-75 crop and covers the seasons 1974-75 to 1978-79. The stabilisation arrangements provide for grower contributions to the Stabilisation Fund when export returns are relatively high and payments to growers from the Fund when export returns are relatively low. If grower contributions held in the Fund are insufficient to make required stabilisation payments, the Commonwealth, under certain conditions, contributes to the Fund to make up the shortfall. The Fund has an upper limit of $80 million and once this maximum is achieved any further grower contributions or interest earned by the Fund are refunded to the Wheat Board for distribution to growers who earlier contributed to the Fund. The prescribed maximum of $80 million was reached in July 1976 and refunds amounting to $41.1 million were made to growers in 1976-77. A further grower contribution of $30 million in respect of the 1976-77 crop season is expected to be paid into the Fund in 1977-78 and this amount, together with interest earned during the year, will be refunded to growers. No stabilisation contributions by the Commonwealth are required in 1977-78. The Government recently referred the question of wheat stabilisation arrangements to apply after the 1978-79 crop season to the Industries Assistance Commission for report by May 1978. Dairy Industry An amount of $1.4 million is provided in 1977-78 for estimated commitments under the now terminated Dairy Adjustment Program, through which assistance was made available to producers to 31 December 1976. This scheme was superseded by the establishment of the Rural Adjustment Scheme (see below) which, from 1 January 1977, provides expanded assistance to a broader range of producers. The Government introduced StageI of new marketing arrangements for dairy products on 1 July 1977. Under these arrangements an equalisation levy (equal to the difference between the domestic price and the assessed average export price) is imposed on the production of certain prescribed dairy products, and the proceeds are redistributed among manufacturers with the object of protecting the domestic price structure and ensuring that manufacturers receive an equalised return from total domestic and export sales. Levy collections and payments to manufacturers are estimated at $50.0 million in 1977-78. Pending introduction of the new marketing arrangements, the Government undertook to provide a measure of income stability by underwriting the equalisation value of skim milk powder in 1975-76, and butter, cheese, skim milk powder and casein in 1976-77 and 1977-78. The levels of support for skim milk powder and casein are conditional on State participation on a $1 State: $2 Commonwealth basis. Under 'Price Support' there is a provision of $6.5 million in 1977-78 for estimated Commonwealth liability for underwriting of cheese, skim milk powder and casein values up to 30 June 1977, and of butter values up to 31 December 1976. 'Repayments' include, in addition to the new levy, repayments from the States in respect of the Dairy Adjustment Program and its predecessor, the Marginal Dairy Farms Reconstruction Scheme. Fruit Industry Legislation has been enacted to extend the Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme to cover the three crop seasons 1977-78 to 1979-80. For the 1977-78 season, the maximum rate of assistance for 'at risk' exports to the United Kingdom and Europe will be maintained at S2 per box for apples and at 80 cents per box for pears, subject to an overall limit on Commonwealth contributions of S4.7 million. In addition, the Commonwealth has agreed to provide up to S0.5 million in supplementary assistance for apple exports on a dollar for dollar basis with participating States, with the precise nature and application of the assistance being determined in light of information available from the 1977-78 export season operations. Supplementary assistance arrangements for apple exports have been in operation since the 1974-75 crop season. The Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme was introduced in 1972 with an upper limit of S4.6 million, which was subsequently increased to $5.6 million, to provide assistance to growers for the removal of fruit trees deemed surplus to long-term market requirements. Applications for assistance under the scheme closed on 31 December 1976 and trees had to be removed by 30 June 1977. Payments prior to 30 June 1977 amounted to $4.7 million. The 1977-78 provision of $1.3 million is to meet outstanding claims including an unexpectedly large number of applications from growers in Western Australia and Tasmania, in response to which provision has been made to raise the former limit by $0.4 million. Poultry Industry Expenditure on stabilisation and research in the poultry industry is financed mostly from industry levies which flow back to the industry through State egg marketing authorities in accordance with the terms of the egg industry stabilisation scheme. A reduction in both receipts and expenditure for stabilisation purposes in 1977-78 reflects the impact of reduced hen quotas under State production control arrangements. Cattle, Sheep and Pig Meat Industry Outlays in 1977-78 for meat export inspection and animal health services undertaken by the Bureau of Animal Health are estimated at $31.1 million, less estimated revenue of $3.1 million from charges to exporters for meat export inspection services outside prescribed hours. Provision is made for a total expenditure of $19.6 million on the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. That amount includes $15.1 million for eradication operations, of which $8.4 million is estimated to be recovered from the industry, and S4.5 million in grants towards slaughter compensation payments making a total net payment of SI 1.2 million. Some $18.4 million of the total outlay of $19.6 million is expected to be paid to the States. The joint Commonwealth/State scheme to provide carry-on finance at concessional rates of interest to specialist beef producers was incorporated in the Rural Adjustment Scheme which came into operation on 1 January 1977. Rural Reconstruction/Adjustment The Rural Reconstruction Scheme, which operated from 1971, was terminated on 31 December 1976. A provision of S4.6 million has been made for 1977-78 to finance outstanding commitments for assistance to producers which were approved by the States prior to the termination date. From1 January 1977 a Rural Adjustment Scheme, established under the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act, came into operation. Under this scheme, which replaced the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, the Dairy Adjustment Program and the joint Commonwealth/State scheme of carry-on finance for specialist beef producers, financial assistance is made available to the States for purposes of farm debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation, carry-on finance and household support. Assistance for .debtreconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation is made available by the Commonwealth on an overall 85 per cent loan/15 per cent grant basis with the Commonwealth contributing a further amount to assist in defraying administrative expenses. For the household support component the Commonwealth finances all assistance and contributes towards administrative expenses, with the States repaying to the Commonwealth all principal and interest recouped by them. For carry-on finance, the States share equally with the Commonwealth both thefinancingof loans (and administrative costs) and all principal and interest payments received from producers. Taken together, outlays under the Rural Reconstruction Scheme and the Rural Adjustment Scheme are estimated at $51.5 million in 1977-78, an increase of $22.0 million on 1976-77 outlays. Fertilizer Bounties Legislation has been enacted to continue the phosphate fertilizer bounty for five years from 1 July 1977 at the rate of $12 per tonne. Eligibility for bounty was extended to include crushed or calcined phosphate rock and phosphate substances for use as stock feed supplements. Payments under the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act are estimated at $40 million in 1977-78. The Government has reviewed its earlier decision to reduce the subsidy rate on nitrogenous fertilizers and the Budget provides for the subsidy payable under the Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy Act 1966 to be continued at the rate of $60 per tonne from 1 January 1978. Subsidy payments in 1977-78 are estimated at $12 million. Inspection Services In addition to the export meat inspection services described above, the Commonwealth provides export inspection facilities in respect of grains, fruits and other exports requiring quality certification. The net costs of these services are estimated at $5.0 million in 1977-78. Agricultural Extension and Research The Budget provides $9.9 milUon in grants to the States for the development of their agricultural advisory services under arrangements dating from 1952-53. Under those arrangements, the Commonwealth proposes to spend a further $0.2 million directly on projects which are nominated by the States but which are of common interest to several States. The Government is reviewing the future of the grants beyond 30 June 1978. Irrigation and Other Pastoral Water Projects Expenditure under this heading comprises Commonwealth assistance to the States for rural water conservation and irrigation purposes and flood mitigation. The estimates provide for continuing assistance for the Dartmouth Dam on the Mitta Mitta River in Victoria ($6.5 million) and for the Namoi River Weirs in NSW ($1 million). Under a continuing program of water resources assessment, $6.7 million will be provided to the States in 1977-78 for the assessment of surface and underground water resources. Additional information on these projects is contained in the accompanying Budget Paper entitled Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1977-78. Flood Mitigation The Commonwealth has agreed to participate with the State and local authorities in a new flood mitigation program for certain New South Wales coastal rivers. A grant of $1.0 million will be provided to New South Wales for this purpose in 1977-78. Land Development Projects Soil Conservation Provision of $0.2 million has been made in 1977-78 as further interim assistance to the States pending consideration of a comprehensive study on soil conservation problems. Repayments Estimated repayments of S5.2 million in 1977-78 include $3.4 million in repayments by War Service Land Settlers. General Administrative and Other Expenditure Included under this heading are the administrative expenses of the Department of Primary Industry ($11.9 million) and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ($4.9 million). Also included is $0.25 million for the Commonwealth contribution to the Australian Plague Locust Commission. Increases in administrative expenditure mainly reflect salary increases, offset in part by reduction in staff numbers. Uranium-Exploration and Development In early 1976 the Government announced that uranium exploration by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was to be discontinued at the close of the 1976 field season. Expenditure on the Commission's uranium exploration program in 197677 was $1.1 million. Outlays in 1976-77 also included a Commonwealth loan of $1.8 million to Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd to help it overcome liquidity difficulties. Provision of $0.13 million is made in 1977-78 to maintain the Commission's beneficial interest in the Ngalia Basin uranium exploration joint venture. Bureau of Mineral Resources The provision of $12.5 million for expenditure by the Bureau in 1977-78 compares with expenditure in 1976-77 of $12.4 million. It is intended that the Bureau progressively restrict its activities in the States to those which could not reasonably be undertaken by State Government agencies. The activities of the Bureau will nevertheless continue to be a significant form of assistance to the mining industry through its work in gathering and disseminating geological and geophysical information relevant to the exploration and development by industry of the nation's mineral resources. Other Mining (Net) The main provision under this heading for 1977-78 is for 'act of grace' payments of $2.8 million to sand mining companies and certain first line contractors to those companies which were directly affected by the Government's decision to prohibit exports of mineral sands mined from certain areas of Fraser Island. Payments of $0.1 million were made for this purpose in 1976-77. Other provisions include $2.6 million for expenditure in relation to the Commonwealth's interest in the Cooper Basin Gas Fields in South Australia, $0.8 million for the Commonwealth's contribution towards administrative costs of the Joint Coal Board, $0.7 million for the operation of the Northern Territory Mines Branch, and $0.25 million for payment to the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories (AMDEL). Under the April 1977 agreement with the South Australian Government the Commonwealth is obliged to make the latter payment to AMDEL because Commonwealth work contracted to AMDEL in 1976-77 was less than the amount specified in the agreement. The Government proposes to establish a new industry-financed coal research program. To finance this increased research, there will be a levy of 5 cents a tonne on coal produced in Australia. It is estimated that $3.9 million will be raised from the levy in 1977-78; the balance of $3.4 million expected to be available after allowance for expenditure lags, and costs of collection and administration, will be spent on coal research. Divestment of Petroleum and Minerals Authority Investments Revenue of about S15.0 million is expected in 1977-78, compared with S3 million in 1976-77, from the divestment by the Commonwealth of assets acquired by the former Petroleum and Minerals Authority. Shipbuilding Assistance Assistance is payable in respect of the construction of vessels in Australia following a case-by-case examination by the Australian Shipbuilding Board. Assistance for new shipbuilding contracts is provided under the Ship Construction Bounty Act 1975 as a direct bounty to shipbuilders. The maximum level of assistance is currently 33 per cent; but the Government's shipbuilding policy provides for a phased reduction in the level of assistance to an eventual long-term rate of 25 per cent by December 1980. Outlays under this scheme in 1977-78 are estimated at S6.2 million and represent subsidies towards the construction of 19 ships. Prior to the enactment of the bounty legislation in June 1975 a shipbuilding subsidy was provided by the Commonwealth buying ships and then selling them to shipowners at a lower price. It is expected that construction of the final 4 ships to be subsidised under those arrangements will be completed in 1977-78, at a net cost to the Budget of $5.2 million. An amount of $1.2 million is provided for the administrative expenses of the Shipbuilding Board. Industrial Research and Development Grants The provision of $14 million includes final payments totalling $8 million to be made in 1977-78 under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act 1967. These final payments cover all outstanding general grants relating to the 1975-76 grant year. A new scheme, under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976, came into effect on 1 July 1976. Commencement grants totalling $4 million, intended to encourage the development by recipients of a basic capability in industrial research and development, will be paid in 1977-78 in respect of the 1976-77 grant year. A further $2 million is provided to meet a substantial portion of project grants expected to be approved in 1977-78, and residual payments of project grants approved in 1976-77. Agricultural Tractor Bounty The Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1977 provides for payment of a bounty on eligible tractors produced and sold after 1 January 1977. Bounty payments under this Act are indexed quarterly, and currently range from $549 to $3771 per tractor, depending on the power of the tractor, and subject to local content requirements. Payments under the Act in 1977-78 are estimated to be $5 million. Prior to 1 January 1977, bounties were provided on a somewhat different basis, under the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1966. Payments under both Acts in 1976-77 totalled $4.9 million. Machine Tools Bounty Operation of the Metal Working Machine Tools Bounty Act 1972 has been extended by proclamation until 30 June 1979 pending a review by the Industries Assistance Commission. Payments are based on a bounty rate of 33i per cent of factory cost subject to certain local content requirements and are expected to amount to $2.5 million in 1977-78. Book Bounty Payments under the Book Bounty Act 1969 are made in respect of eligible books manufactured in Australia at the rate of 33i per cent of the cost of production. The devaluation of the Australian dollar in November 1976 was followed by a surge in local book manufacturing which resulted in relatively high payments in 1976-77. An amount of $7 million has been provided for bounty payments in 1977-78. Other Bounty Payments The Bed Sheeting Bounty Act 1977 limits total bounty payments under the Act to $0.5 million per annum and that amount is provided in 1977-78. Payments under the Act will continue until decisions are taken on long-term assistance for the industry. Under the ADP Equipment Bounty Act 1977 bounty is to be payable for a period of seven years but the rate is to be gradually phased down over that period; $0.6 million is provided in 1977-78. Export Development Grants Grants administered by the Export Development Grants Board are provided to encourage firms to seek and develop overseas markets. Grants are payable on the basis of eligible export market development expenditure in respect of goods and services substantially of Australian origin. The Government has referred the question of financial incentives to exporters to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report, and is not now proceeding with legislation foreshadowed in 1976 to reduce benefits and expenditure under the scheme. As a means of limiting current expenditures, however, payments in 1977-78 on new claims under the scheme will be restricted, as in 1976-77, to $10 000 in the first instance, with the balance of larger grants being held over to the following year. Consideration will be given to payments in excess of $10 000 where imposition of the ceiling would result in severe financial difficulties. The 1977-78 Budget provision of $30 million covers eligible claims for grants outstanding at the end of 1976-77 (estimated at $18 million) and up to $12 million in respect of new commitments falling due in 1977-78. Other Assistance Other industry support expenditure provided for in 1977-78 includes assistance for the manufacture of electronic components ($0,144 million), grants for the Industrial Design Council of Australia ($0,385 million), a grant to Pritchard Steam Power Pty Ltd ($0,075 million) and final payments under the former structural adjustment assistance scheme ($0,097 million). General Administration This provision covers operating costs of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and of the Export Market Development Grants Board. A provision of $2.8 million is included for the Australian Tourist Commission, for the purpose of encouraging overseas visitors to travel to Australia. Provision of $0.2 million has been made also to finance the activities of the Canberra Tourist Bureau. Australian Industry Development Corporation The broad functions of the Australian Industry Development Corporation are to help finance the development and growth of Australian private enterprise in areas of activity concerned with, or incidental to, the manufacture, processing, treatment, transportation or distribution of goods, or the development or use of natural resources or of technology, and to secure Australian participation in the ownership and control of companies engaged in such activities. The Corporation's paid-up capital is now $62.5 million; no additional capital provision is expected to be required this year. The Corporation has no plans to request the Government to borrow funds on its behalf in 1977-78. Export and Trade Promotion Expenditure on export and trade promotion in 1977-78 is estimated at $17.3 million. The total includes expenditure on the Trade Commissioner Service ($12.9 million), matching grants to primary product marketing boards ($0.9 million) and trade publicity fairs, displays and trade promotion visits ($3.4 million). Export Finance and Insurance Corporation The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) provides export credit insurance and guarantee facilities, insurance cover for direct investment overseas against non-commercial risks, and, where necessary, export finance for medium and long-term credit sales of capital goods. During its first seventeen months of operation EFIC's export finance facility was funded with loans from the Budget. Since July 1976, the facility has been financed by the trading banks via loans to EFIC at commercial rates of interest. The Corporation on-lends these funds to foreign buyers at concessional interest rates. The difference between the commercial rates at which EFIC borrows and the rates at which it onlends is financed from the Budget by an interest rate subsidy payable to EFIC each year. A subsidy of almost $0.3 million was provided in 1976-77 and a provision of $1.5 million has been made for 1977-78 for this purpose. In 1976-77 a payment of some $0.3 million was also made in respect of a 'national interest' case. The 1976-77 'subsidy commitment authority', the mechanism to control commitments on the Budget in the years ahead arising from the Corporation entering into loan transactions with overseas buyers at subsidised interest rates, was set at $15 million. At 30 June, the Corporation had entered into loans in support of capital goods exports aggregating $77 million, requiring use of the subsidy commitment authority of about $9.18 million, payable over the term of the loans. In addition, tbe Corporation had advance commitments to enter into loans of $11 million, involving use of a further $1.75 million of subsidy commitment authority in 1977-78. The Government has decided to increase the cumulative subsidy commitment authority to $17.5 million. The increase of $2.5 million over 1976-77, together with the balance of the authority not committed at 30 June 1977, will enable EFIC to enter into loans aggregating about $50 million in the next 12 months, and to support tenders for capital goods exports considerably in excess of this amount, given that only a portion of tenders are likely to be successful. A considerable amount of assistance to industry has been provided in the past through special taxation concessions. Some of these concessions were withdrawn during 1972-73 while others were withdrawn or modified in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. On the other hand, a new concession was introduced in 1974-75-doubl e depreciation-applicabl e to new plant and equipment first used or installed ready for use by taxpayers in the manufacturing and primary industry sectors on or after 1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975. The double depreciation scheme was extended in both time and coverage in 1975 but when the income tax law was amended to provide a new investment allowance, provision was also made for the discontinuance of the double depreciation scheme for plant used or installed after 30 June 1976. The new investment allowance is applicable to new plant and equipment purchased, leased or constructed under a contract made on or after 1 January 1976. A 40 per cent rate will apply for the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978, and a 20 per cent rate for the period 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1983. Other provisions were enacted in 1976-77, which will affect revenue collections in 1977-78, relating to accelerated deductions for certain capital expenditure by mining enterprises, and to a deduction for a trading stock valuation adjustment. Such concessions result in a reduction of, or a delay in the receipt of, Commonwealth revenue (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients). They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. The amount of revenue forgone in 1976-77 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been about $246 million. Details are shown below. (Pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years are included under the heading 'Manufacturing Industry'.) Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely : A those allowing the deduction of larger amounts than are authorised under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which, until it was withdrawn, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1974, gave a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deductions from income for this expenditure); B those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and C those exempting certain classes of income, now confined to exemption of income from gold mining. The estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1976-77 under the main provisions in categories A and B are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly 'Industry Assistance'. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds and income equalisation deposits; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees' amenities. The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable incomes for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the average of their incomes for the current year and the preceding four years. One effect of the provisions, which is an intended effect, is to ensure that fluctuations in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but nonfluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions can result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. Under the new personal income tax system to apply from 1 February 1978, with no more than the standard tax rate of 32 per cent applying to taxable incomes up to $16 000 (the ceiling for the application of averaging), the unintended effects of averaging will not arise. The new arrangements are described in Statement No. 4.

The new general investment allowance which applies to plant purchased on or after 1 January 1976 is a deduction generally equal to 40 per cent of the cost of the new plant and applies to a wider range of plant (including leased plant). (b) The export market development rebate was withdrawn in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1974. (c) Special deductions (Section 75A) are allowed to taxpayers engaged in primary production in respect of certain classes of capital expenditure not subject to depreciation by which the amount of the expenditure is allowed in equal annual instalments over 10 years. (d) Development expenditures by general mining and petroleum mining companies are now deductible on a diminishing value basis by reference to a maximum life of mine or field of 5 years. Expenditure on facilities for the transport of minerals is deductible in equal instalments over either 10 years or 20 years, at the taxpayer's option to be exercised with the first claim for the deduction. However, some expenditure is deductible under provisions of earlier years which continue to apply to expenditure made in those earlier years. (e) Taxpayers were allowed to ciaim deductions for depreciation in respect of certain plant that was used in manufacturing or primary production at twice the rates of depreciation normally pro.irled. Eligible plant was that installed on or after I July 1974 and before 1 July 1975 of a kind that would have qualified for the 20 per cent investment allowance under Sections 62AA and 62AB if the investment allowance had not been terminated. Plant and equipment that continued to attract investment allowance by reason of its purchase under a contract signed before 22 August 1973 was not eligible for double depreciation. Double depreciation applied to a wider range of items of plant and equipment purchased and installed in the period I July 1975 to 30 June 1976. Normal depreciation applies in respect of plant first used or installed after 30 June 1976. ( / ) This estimate is based on the deductions allowable in the 1975-76 income year in respect of purchases and appropriations in that year (net of amounts included in the 1975-76 assessable income in respect of appropriations made in the previous year) less the depreciation that would have been allowable in that year on the relevant plant purchases or the plant in respect of which the appropriations were made. While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. D. LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT Outlays under this heading provide for various programs relating to immigration, occupation training schemes, the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes and the enforcement of industrial awards and agreements. Outlays are estimated at $258.3 million in 1977-78, an increase of $15.6 million over 1976-77. +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 .1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million $ million S million $ million Conciliation and Arbitration . 5.1 5.8 5.3 0.4 Industrial Relations Bureau 1.6 + 1.6 Payment to Stevedoring Industry 37.3 52.0 33.5 -18.5 Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave 3.4 5.0 5.9 + 0.9 Trade Union Training. . . . 3.0 6.3 2.9 3.3 Apprenticeship Training. 37.6 43.8 42.2 1.6 Employment Training Schemes 41.0 32.9 56.5 +23.6 General Administration . . . . 57.3 64.4 75.4 + 11.0 Less Other Recoveries . . . . 0.7 0.9 0.8 0.1 Immigration ProgramAssisted Migration . . . . 14.7 13.2 13.2 0.1 Administration 20.0 21.6 23.8 + 2.2 Less Recoveries 0.8 1.3 1.3 Conciliation and Arbitration Provision is made for expenditure of $5.3 million in 1977-78. The reduction of $0.4 million on 1976-77 expenditure reflects the effect of the replacement of the Industrial Court by the Federal Court ($0.9 million), partially offset by increases in costs of advertising elections of registered organisations and other administrative costs. Industrial Relations Bureau The Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in June 1977 to provide for the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau to facilitate the general supervision and observance of federal industrial law; $1.6 million has been provided for administrative and operational expenses of the Bureau in 1977-78. Payment to Stevedoring Industry Under existing legislation levies are collected from employers in the industry and passed on to the Stevedoring Industry Authority to pay attendance money and leave benefits to waterside workers, and to reimburse employers for pension and redundancy payments. The reduction of $18.5 million in the estimate for 1977-78 reflects proposed legislative changes. It is proposed that from 31 December 1977, when present legislation expires, responsibility be transferred to the stevedoring industry itself for some of the payments presently funded through the Stevedoring Industry Authority. A lesser scale of levies will consequently apply to meet the remaining payments which will continue to be funded through a new body to be called the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. Apprenticeship Training Commonwealth assistance for apprenticeship training is intended to promote apprenticeship opportunities, to improve the standard of training of apprentices in industry and to increase the future supply of skilled tradesmen. An extensive review of apprenticeship training during 1976-77, which involved the States, the National Training Council and major employer and employee organisations, resulted in the introduction of a new scheme-the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT)-to replace the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme (NAAS). employers to increase their apprentice intake by compensating them with tax-exempt rebates for the costs of releasing apprentices to attend (or to study for) basic trade courses provided by technical education institutions in any year of apprenticeship, or to attend full-time, off-the-job training courses in their first three years of apprenticeship. Rebates are set at Sll per day for apprentices attending stages 1 and 2 of a basic trade course, increasing to $15 per day for stages 3 and 4, if not completed in the first year. Full time off-the-job training rebates of S5.50 per day are payable to employers for a maximum of 260 working days. Both rebates are indexed annually to take account of movements in wages. Weekly living-away-from-home allowances, of $17.60 for first year apprentices, and $6.80 for persons in the second year of their apprenticeship, may also be provided. These allowances are not tax exempt. Provision has been made for the training of 40 000 apprentices under CRAFT in 1977-78, at an estimated cost of $22.3 million. Employers of apprentices taken on after 15 January 1977 are not eligible for assistance under NAAS. However, residual NAAS payments in 1977-78 are estimated to cost $14.8 million, a reduction of S24.7 million on expenditure in 1976-77. An amount of $7.3 million is provided for the award costs of apprentices, surplus to normal requirements, who are undergoing the full term of their training in Commonwealth and State Government establishments. Apprenticeship training supervisors subsidised in State Government employment are estimated to cost the Commonwealth $54 000 in 1977-78; this scheme is to be terminated in 1977-78. The Commonwealth has increased the number of places for apprentices in Commonwealth Departments under the Group Partial Training Scheme from 75 to 275 in 1977. Under this Scheme, apprentices sponsored by private employers are given full-time training in Commonwealth Government Departments for the whole qf the first year. The costs (including wages) of this training are met in full by the Commonwealth. At the end of the first year the apprentices commence work with their employers. The cost of the scheme in 1977-78 is estimated to be $1.3 million. Employment Training Schemes The National Employment and Training System (NEAT) provides full or part-time training allowances, living-away-from-home and book and equipment allowances, and assistance with the payment of fees and fares for trainees. Subsidies are available to employers who provide in-industry training or who release trainees for training during working hours. The 1977-78 provision for NEAT is $54.3 million compared with $31.6 million in 1976-77. This increase reflects an expected substantial increase in the numbers of trainees and the full-year cost of the new initiatives under NEAT which were introduced during 1976-77. One such initiative, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, which is estimated to cost $18 million in 1977-78, is aimed at providing employment and training for young people who have been unemployed for long periods by making available allowances to employers who provide them with on-the-job training for six months. As announced in the Budget Speech, eligibility under this latter scheme has been extended to cover persons aged up to 25 years; previously the scheme covered only persons aged between 15 and 19 years. Other programs aimed at improving the employment prospects of unemployed youth which were introduced during 1976-77 were the Pre-Apprenticeship Training Scheme and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. The Pre-Apprenticeship Training Scheme is intended to increase opportunities for trade training by the introduction or expansion of pre-apprenticeship courses and by accelerated apprentice training in selected trades. Allowances to trainees under the program are paid from funds provided for NEAT. Overall expenditure under this scheme in 1977-78 is estimated at S4.4 million; S3.2 million is for payments to the States to conduct the courses and SI.2 million is for payment of allowances to trainees. The Education Program for Unemployed Youth was established with the objective of improving the skills and motivation of young unemployed people, particularly those with low or inadequate educational qualifications. An amount of $1.5 million was provided for courses in educational institutions in the States of which $0.5 million was spent in 1976-77. The remaining $1.0 million is available for courses in 1977-78. Allowances to be paid to trainees for out of pocket expenses are estimated to cost $0.4 million in 1977-78. General Administration Expenditure on administration and other costs related to employment and industrial relations is estimated to increase by $11.0 million to $75.4 million in 1977-78. This rise reflects increases in wage, salary and other costs, and in staff numbers during 1976-77. The Government has decided not to set a specific immigration program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of applicants in the currently eligible categories. Eligibility will continue to be based on family reunion, refugee status and on the possession of specific skills in short supply in Australia. On the basis of present application rates, the number of migrant arrivals in the current year could be expected to be much the same as the 70 500 recorded in 1976-77. Assisted Migration Assisted passages will be available for some 16 000 people in 1977-78, about the same number as in 1976-77. Expenditure on assisted migration is estimated at $13.2 million in 1977-78, a marginal reduction on expenditure in 1976-77. The reduction reflects, in the main, the rationalisation of transitory accommodation provided for assisted migrants. The main components of the assisted migration program in 1977-78 are embarkation and passage costs ($6.4 million) and transitory accommodation ($6.3 million). Administration Administrative expenditure in 1977-78 of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is estimated at $23.8 million, an increase of $2.2 million on 1976-77. This mainly reflects increases in salary and other costs. Recoveries Contributions by assisted migrants towards passage costs are estimated to total $1.1 million in 1977-78, compared with SI.O million in 1976-77. E. OTHER ECONOMIC SERVICES This residual group covers economic services which are not readily categorised elsewhere. Outlays on these various services in each of the past two years, and estimates for 1977-78, are summarised in the following table. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million S million $ million Economic and Trade RegulationPatents, Trade Marks and Designs Offices 6.2 7.1 8.1 + 1.0 Industries Assistance Commission 7.9 8.4 8.8 +0.4 Trade Practices 3.0 3.5 3.5 +0.1 Prices Justification Tribunal 2.3 2.2 2.3 Consumer Protection . . . . 0.2 0.1 0.1 Other 2.0 1.6 1.1 -0.5 Less Recoveries 6.0 6.0 5.8 -0.2 Total 15.6 16.8 18.1 + 1.2 Specialised ActivitiesMeteorological Services 36.3 38.5 38.7 +0.2 National Mapping. . . . 6.9 7.2 7.6 +0.4 Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation 0.4 0.4 0 .4 Less Recoveries 12.9 13.0 13.3 +0.3 Total 30.6 33.1 33.0 0 .1 General Administrative and Other Expenditure (net) 37.5 40.7 48.9 +8.2 Economic and Trade Regulation The outlays under this heading relate very largely to the operations of the authorities listed. The amounts provided for 1977-78 allow for about the same staff levels, and similar levels of activity, as in 1976-77. Specialised Activities The Bureau of Meteorology's activities are to be held to the same levels as in 1976-77 pending completion of the examination of the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into the Bureau. Recoveries are estimated at SI 3.3 million in 1977-78 and consist of receipts of the Bureau from provision of its specialist services. General Administrative and Other Expenditures These outlays are for the operating costs of the Departments of Overseas Trade, Business and Consumer Affairs, National Resources, Productivity and the recently established Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. The amounts provided for 1977-78 reflect a small decrease in average staff numbers for these departments compared with 1976-77. 9. GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICES This broad functional heading covers a range of general public services and activities concerned with the organisation and operation of the Commonwealth Government, including legislative services, administrative services, the maintenance of law and order and foreign affairs and overseas aid. A. LEGISLATIVE SERVICES Estimates of outlays on legislative services in 1977-78 are shown in the following table; these outlays are estimated to increase by S8.4 million, or 13.2 per cent, in 1977-78. +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million $ million $ million Governor General's Office and other Official Establishments 1.5 1.9 2.2 +0.4 Parliamentary ExpenditureSalaries and Allowances of Members 8.4 9.2 10.4 + 1.2 Other 26.9 30.2 34.4 +4.2 Australian Capital TerritoryLegislative Assembly. . . . 0.3 0.3 0.3 Northern TerritoryLegislative Assembly. . . . 0.8 2.7 4.4 + 1.7 Australian Electoral Office 15.3 19.1 20.0 +0.9 Parliamentary Expenditure-Other Provision is made in 'Other' for salaries, administrative costs and capital works associated with the functioning of Parliament; costs relating to State and Electorate Offices of Senators and Members are also included here. Of the total increase of $4.2 million, $1.6 million relates to additional costs of salaries and allowances and $0.7 million relates to parliamentary printing costs. An amount of $0.6 million is included for minor capital works for Parliament House. Northern Territory-Legislative Assembly This item includes funds totalling $3.9 million for furniture, fittings, repairs, maintenance, buildings and works for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The increase reflects a substantial carry over of expenditure on work commenced in 1976-77. Australian Electoral Office This item reflects the administrative costs of maintaining electoral rolls and conducting Commonwealth elections and referenda. Outlays in 1976-77 reflected the May 1977 referenda and national song poll. The estimates for 1977-78 include provision for a half Senate election. Salaries for the Australian Electoral Office are estimated to increase by $1.1 million, reflecting increased staff numbers and the full year effects of wage and salary determinations made in 1976-77. B. LAW, ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY Commonwealth outlays on law, order and public safety are estimated to total SI36.4 million in 1977-78, an increase of SI0.7 million over 1976-77. Actual outlays in the two years to 1976-77, together with estimates for 1977-78, are shown in the following table. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million S million $ million Courts and Legal ServicesFederal Court 0.2 1.6 + 1.4 High Court 4.6 5.5 10.0 + 4.6 Commonwealth-State Law Courts 2.6 3.0 1.6 1.4 Courts and Registration Offices in the Territories 3.3 2.8 3.2 + 0.4 Bankruptcy Administration. 2.9 3.2 3.2 Crown Solicitor 6.7 7.5 7.9 + 0^4 Australian Law Reform Commission 0.4 0.5 0.7 + 0.2 Legal Aid. . . . . . 16.3 21.8 23.4 + 1.6 Family Law 2.6 5.9 10.3 + 4.4 Protection of Human Rights 0.2 0.3 0.4 + 0.2 Total 39.4 50.7 62.5 + 11.8 Police, Security and DetentionAustralian Security Intelligence Organi6.4 7.8 10.0 + 2.2 Police and Prison Services. 41.7 46.1 40.6 5.5 Other 1.5 1.5 1.5 Total 49.6 55.4 52.0 3.4 Attorney-General's DepartmentGeneral Administrative and Other Expenditure 10.3 10.4 12.8 + 2.5 Reporting Branch. . . . 2.6 3.2 3.5 + 0.3 Total 12.9 13.5 16.3 + 2.8 Public Safety and ProtectionRoad Safety 1.3 0.8 0.9 + 0.1 Other 3.9 6.4 4.9 1.5 Total 5.3 7.2 5.8 1.4 Building, Works and Equipment, nec 2.6 1.9 4.5 + 2.6 Less Recoveries 1.4 3.1 4.8 + 1.7 Federal Court As a result of the Government's decision to rationalise the structure of federal courts, a single Federal Court of Australia was created on 9 December 1976. The Federal Court of Australia has appeal functions and replaces the Federal Court of Bankruptcy and the Australian Industrial Court. The new arrangement recognises and enhances the position of the State Courts by giving those Courts powers in important fields of law not previously open to them. SI.6 million is provided for the estimated operating costs of the Court in 1977-78. High Court An amount of $8.5 million is being provided in 1977-78 toward construction of the new High Court building in the Australian Capital Territory. A further $1.5 million is provided to cover estimated running costs of the High Court in 1977-78. Commonwealth-State Law Courts This provision is for the Commonwealth's share of approximately 45 per cent of the construction costs of a court complex in Sydney being built jointly with the State of New South Wales. The complex is now scheduled for completion in 1977-78. Australian Law Reform Commission The Commission deals with the systematic development and reform of the law, including its modernisation and simplification, the elimination of defects, and the adoption of new or more effective methods for administration and the dispensation of justice. Legal Aid Legal Aid arrangements are currently under review. Legislation establishing a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission has been passed and the Ordinance establishing the Legal Aid Commission (ACT) was proclaimed on 11 July 1977. Both these Commissions are expected-to commence operations in 1977-78. Legislation to establish Legal Aid Commissions in Western Australia and South Australia has been passed by the respective States and discussions are proceeding between the Commonwealth Attorney General and other States with a view to establishing Commissions in those States. A Legal Aid Commission is also projected for the Northern Territory. Family Law The Family Law Act 1975 established the Family Court of Australia, the Family Law Council and the Institute of Family Studies. The bulk of expenditures under this item relate to the operations of the Family Court and payments to the State of Western Australia for the operation of its Family Court. The allocation of $10.3 million in 1977-78 provides for a significant increase in the size of the Family Court of Australia. Protection of Human Rights The Government proposes to establish a Human Rights Commission that will examine complaints of infringements of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The nature and function of the Commission are being determined in consultation with the States and it is planned that the Commission will be established as part of a Commonwealth-State Scheme for the maintenance of human rights. The Commission is expected to commence operations in 1977-78 and will incorporate the activities of the Commissioner for Community Relations. The cost of providing police and prison services in the Australian Capital Territory is estimated to be $11.9 million in 1977-78. Estimated expenditure for the Commonwealth Police Force is $28.7 million. Consequent on the transfer of administrative responsibilities to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1 July 1977, police and prison services in the Northern Territory ($10.7 million in 1976-77) are now funded from within the global allocation to the Assembly which is classified under the heading General Administration. The main components of the increase of S2.8 million are S1.0 million for salaries, $0.8 million for publications of Commonwealth Acts and Rules, SO.2 million for computer costs associated with the computerised. Legal Information Retrieval and Publication System, and S0.4 million for the first full year share of running expenses of the joint Commonwealth-State Law Courts building in Sydney. The Commonwealth is providing S0.8 million in 1977-78 for road safety promotion and research and a grant to the States of SO.IS million for promotion of road safety practices. C. FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND OVERSEAS AID This section covers most of the expenditures undertaken by the Commonwealth Government in relation to policies designed to promote relations with foreign countries and external territories and to assist in the economic and social development of developing countries. Total outlays on foreign affairs and overseas aid are estimated to increase by $54.7 million to $571.3 million in 1977-78. About three quarters of this expenditure relates to various overseas economic aid programs to assist developing countries, including Papua New Guinea. A detailed statement of Australia's aid programs is given in the accompanying Budget Paper entitled Australia's Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries 1977-78. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million $ million $ million S million Aid PaymentsBilateral AidPapua New Guinea 213.5 228.3 223.4 4.9 Projects 45.9 52.2 71.0 + 18.9 Training 12.4 13.9 16.6 + 2.7 Food Aid 32.4 24.7 26.6 + 1.9 Other 3.3 3.6 2.5 1.1 Total Bilateral Aid. 307.5 322.7 340.2 + 17.4 Multilateral AidUN Programs. . . . 9.5 9.7 16.5 + 6.8 Regional and Other Organisations 5.0 7.2 12.1 + 4.9 International Development Financial Institutions . . . . 26.8 40.4 57.0 + 16.6 Total Multilateral Aid 41.4 57.3 85.6 +28.3 Total Aid. . . . 348.9 380.0 425.8 +45.7 Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands 4.8 5.6 7.1 + 1.5 Membership of International Organisations and Other Non-Aid Expenditure . 15.5 18.1 20.2 + 2.1 General Administrative Expenditure 109.9 124.3 130.4 + 6.1 Less Recoveries and Repayments 9.7 11.3 12.1 + 0.8 AND OVERSEAS AID 469.4 516.6 571.3 +54.7 AID PAYMENTS An amount of $425.8 million is provided for expenditure on overseas aid in 1977-78, an increase of $45.7 million or 12.0 per cent over 1976-77. This increase is spread between bilateral aid programs ($17.4 million) and multilateral aid programs ($28.3 million). Taking into account 'Assistance Additional to Aid Payments' (see below) total assistance to developing countries in 1977-78 is estimated to amount to about $460 million. This figure does not, however, include significant amounts spent by the Commonwealth and State Governments on the education and training of several thousand students from developing countries who are attending various tertiary and other training institutions in Australia. The annual cost to the Australian taxpayer of providing assistance of this kind, not brought to account directly under the overseas aid program, is estimated at about $26 million. Australia also provides other indirect forms of economic aid through its contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations (e.g. United Nations Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation) that assist in the financing of aid projects in developing countries, and through the activities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). The Government, in the national interest, has assumed large contingent liabilities in relation to developing countries through its support of EFIC activities in export and investment insurance. Since February 1975 EFIC has also operated a facility tofinanceexports of capital goods, with concessional terms provided, if necessary, especially to developing countries. Papua New Guinea An amount of $223.4 million is provided for expenditure on aid to or on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government in 1977-78, $4.9 million less than in 1976-77. Under the terms of an aid agreement announced in March 1976 Australia is to provide to Papua New Guinea, in annual instalments, a minimum grant of $930 million as general budgetary assistance over the five years commencing 1976-77. In 1977-78 the amount to be paid in accordance with the terms of this commitment is $200 million, an increase of $10 million over 1976-77. Expenditure on the provision of assistance under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Training Scheme is estimated to increase by $0.5 million to $1.6 million in 1977-78. The decline in total expenditure on aid to Papua New Guinea in 1977-78 is due to a run-down in payments in respect of termination and retirement benefits payable to expatriate officers of former PNG Administrations and the Australian Staffing Assistance Group ($19.5 million) and to a tapering off in expenditure on upgrading civil aviation facilities at Port Moresby and Nadzab which are nearing completion ($1.6 million). Bilateral Projects The Development Assistance Fund, under which expenditures on bilateral projects have been funded in recent years, was abolished at the end of 1976-77 following the establishment of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Expenditure on bilateral projects will now be funded by normal appropriation procedures, as was the practice prior to establishment of the Development Assistance Fund. Expenditures on bilateral projects are estimated to increase substantially to $71.0 million in 1977-78, an increase of $18.9 million on 1976-77. This reflects a substantial increase in Australian aid commitments to South Pacific countries, an expanded aid commitment to Indonesia and increased aid for other member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The expenditures embrace a diversity of activities including projects, equipment and expert advice directed towards increasing agricultural productivity, providing general infrastructure and improvements in transport and communication facilities. These commitments reflect the Government's policy of concentrating its aid program in developing countries in Australia's immediate region. Training Expenditure on training programs (excluding training provided under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Training Scheme) is estimated at SI6.6 million in 1977-78, an increase of $2.7 million on 1976-77. The increase mainly reflects increased costs, rather than expanded levels of activity. Under the various programs (for example, the Colombo Plan and the Commonwealth Co-operation in Education Scheme) funds are provided for academic training, of nationals of developing countries, for short courses to meet special needs (especially in specialised technical areas), for on-the-job training opportunities, and for third country and in-country training awards. In addition, funds are provided for the Australian-Asian Universities Co-operation Scheme, whereby selected universities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore receive assistance from Australian universities in the form of equipment, provision of experts and fellowships for Asian academics to train in Australia. Food Aid Expenditure on food aid is estimated to increase by SI.9 million to S26.6 million in 1977-78. This expenditure allows for a substantial increase, in real terms, in Australia's food aid commitments. Given the substantial fall in the price of wheat, the major commodity supplied under the program, the real increase is not reflected in money outlays. Major new commitments in 1977-78 entail an increase in the total quantity of wheat (or wheat equivalent) Australia supplies under the provisions of the Food Aid Convention of the International Wheat Agreement, provision of funds to cover freight costs on food aid provided in connection with a newly created bilateral reserve for emergencies occurring in needy countries, and provision of non-grain foods (e.g. skim milk powder) to developing countries. Australian food aid to the World Food Program is included under the heading 'United Nations Programs'. Other Bilateral Support for voluntary aid organisations is estimated to increase from S0.6S million in 1976-77 to $1,625 million in 1977-78, reflecting the Government's increased support for the activities of voluntary aid organisations. Expenditure under this heading includes grants for the Overseas Service Bureau and thc Australian Council for Overseas Aid, and direct nnanciai support for small-scale development assistance projects carried out by voluntary aid organisations in developing countries. An amount of $0.7 million is included for expenditure on disaster relief. Under multilateral aid programs the Commonwealth provides support to a wide range of international organisations, including development finance institutions, United Nations agencies and various regional organisations. Expenditure in 1977-78 is estimated to increase by $28.3 million, or 49.4 per cent on last year. United Nations Programs Payments by Australia to aid agencies and organisations established under the aegis of the United Nations are expected to increase to $16.5 million in 1977-78. Significant increases are planned in respect of Australia's support for thc World Food Program, the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. There is an increase of $3.5 million in 1977-78 in the provision for estimated expenditure under the World Food Program. The increase is due partly to Australia's commitment to progressively increase to 20 per cent the proportion of food grain aid channelled through this Program, in addition to its biennial pledge of cash and commodities (other than wheat). Australia's contributions to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees include an amount of $1 million for the appeal on behalf of displaced persons from Indochina in Thailand and other Asian countries. Regional and Other International Programs Total assistance to regional and other international programs is expected to increase by $4.9 million to $12.1 million in 1977-78, in line with the Government's policy of supporting major regional and international aid organisations. Major regional organisations to receive increased support include the Association of South East Asian Nations, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and thc Pacific, the South Pacific Commission and the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. In addition, increased assistance is planned for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research and Regional Education and Training Projects. Provision is also made for an amount of $1 million in 1977-78 for South Pacific Regional Programs to enable aid to be provided through multilateral channels to regional or individual country projects in that region. International Development Finance Institutions Total payments by Australia to the Asian Development Bank, thc World Bank Group, thc International Monetary Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development are expected to increase from $40.4 million in 1976-77 to $57.0 million in 1977-78. These expected payments include calls on Australia in accordance with previously announced commitments to those institutions. There is also provision for payments in respect of Australia's subscription to thc second capital increase of thc Asian Development Bank (S3.1 million) and maintenance of value obligations in respect of Australia's contributions to the International Development Association and capital subscriptions to the Asian Development Bank (S9.0 million). An amount of $2.2 million is provided in respect of estimated payments in 1977-78 to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Legislation to authorize Australia's membership of this Fund and payment of a contribution of $8 million over a period of not less than three years was introduced in Parliament in May 1977. There is also provision for expected payments of S2.5 million to the International Monetary Fund's Oil Facility Interest Subsidy Account (which has been established to reduce the cost to certain developing countries of borrowings from the Fund's Oil Facility). Although Australia's Defence Co-operation program (S25.9 million in 1977-78) represents an extension of our own defence effort, it also supplements thc Government's overseas economic aid programs to the extent that it releases for development purposes resources that recipient Governments would otherwise have set aside for defence purposes. Australia's assistance in this respect is referred to in the section on Defence Co-operation under Defence. In addition, the administrative expenses of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, estimated at S8.3 million for 1977-78, are associated with Australia's aid effort. Cocos (KEELING), CHRISTMAS AND NORFOLK ISLANDS Included under this heading are the costs involved in administering these three small external territories. The increased amount provided for in 1977-78 reflects in part increasing expenditure on capital works committed in earlier years for both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. Expenditure under this item arises from Australia's membership of many global and regional organisations. Active participation in such organisations is an integral part of Australia's foreign policy and entails financial contributions to the administrative expenses and, in some cases, the functional activities of the organisations in question. Total expenditure under this item in 1977-78 is estimated to reach S20.2 million, an increase of $2.1 million over 1976-77. The major items include $4.7 million for the UniUd Nations Organisation, $1.4 million for the Food and Agriculture Organisation, $1.5 million for the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, $1.1 million for the International Labour Organisation, $2.1 million for the World Health Organisation, $1.3 million towards the cost of the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East and $1.2 million for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. There is also provision for an amount of $1.8 million towards the cost of implementation of Australia's independence gift to Papua New Guinea of a National Library. Included in this item are the administrative costs of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the Overseas Operations Branch of the Department of Administrative Services. Expenditure in 1977-78 is estimated to increase by $6.1 million, to $130.4 million. D. GENERAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NEC The Government provides funds for a variety of scientific, industrial and general research purposes but much of this is recorded under the appropriate functional headings (e.g., Health, Education, etc.). 'General and Scientific Research (not elsewhere classified)' covers the activities of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and a number of specific programs of research undertaken by several Government departments and instrumentalities, assistance for research activities funded through the Australian Research Grants Committee, support for academic institutions, and various fellowship schemes. Expenditure for 1977-78 is estimated at $196.0 million, an increase of $10.8 million on 1976-77. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million $ million $ million $ million Australian Atomic Energy Commission . 19.9 20.8 21.7 + 0.9 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation 123.7 133.1 145.1 + 12.0 Antarctic Division. . . . 6.0 6.5 8.7 + 2.1 Research Grants 6.8 12.2 11.1 1.1 Australian Institute of Marine Science 7.0 8.0 4.2 3.8 Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. 0.8 0.8 0.8 Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Other Research and Science nec 1.9 1.2 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.4 + o!i + 0.6 NEC 167.3 185.1 196.0 + 10.8 Australian Atomic Energy Commission The Commission's functions include research and investigation into matters associated with uranium and atomic energy, and the production and sale of radio-isotopes. (Outlays relating to uranium exploration and development are included under ""Industry Assistance and Development""). Expenditure by the Commission is estimated at $21.7 million for 1977-78, $0.9 million greater than in 1976-77. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Expenditure by CSIRO relates to activities in the fields of agricultural, biological, industrial and physical research, together with the provision of research services and facilities and support for research associations. The operations of the CSIRO are currently under review by an independent committee of inquiry. Pending the outcome of the enquiry the Organisation's activities are being maintained at around the same real levels as in 1976-77. The increase of $12.0 million in the provision for CSIRO in 1977-78 represents the net effect of an increase of $8.4 million in the cost of ongoing research programs, provision of an additional $4.4 million for wool research resulting from a reorganisation of methods of financing, and a decrease of $0.9 million in the building and works program. Antarctic Division The Antarctic Division administers, organises and provides logistic support for the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE). These expeditions operate from four stations in the Antarctic region and conduct scientific research programs in upper atmosphere physics, cosmic ray physics, glaciology, biology, medical science, geology and geophysics. For 1977-78, $8.7 million has been provided, an increase of $2.1 million on 1976-77. This increase includes provision for a design study for an Australian-owned Antarctic ship ($0.05 million) and initial development of a marine research program in the Antarctic ($0.03 million). Research Grants Assistance is provided through the Australian Research Grants Committee (ARGC), the Queen Elizabeth II Fellowship Scheme and the Queen's Fellowship Scheme for research projects by individuals in the humanities and social sciences, in the physical, chemical, biological and earth sciences, in engineering and applied sciences and in marine science. Grants by the ARGC make up the bulk of research assistance provided. The 1977-78 provisions total $11.1 million, a decrease of $1.1 million on expenditure in 1976-77. The 1976-77 figure, however, included $2.1 million in payments to Universities to reimburse them for costs incurred in interim support of ARGC programs in 1975-76. The provisions will permit ARGC programs to be maintained in 1977-78 at much the same real levels as in 1976-77. Australian Institute of Marine Science The Australian Institute of Marine Science was established in 1972 to conduct studies in marine science and to co-ordinate and develop marine science in Australia. Initially, the work of the Institute is being directed to studies of the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea and the coast and adjacent waters of North Queensland. The Institute is now occupying its recently completed permanent laboratory complex at Cape Ferguson, constructed at a total cost of $12.8 million. The overall provision for the Institute in 1977-78 is $4.2 million, which is $3.8 million less than was spent in 1976-77. The decrease reflects the completion of the permanent laboratory building, for which S5.9 million was provided in 1976-77, partly offset by estimated outlays of SI.2 million in 1977-78 for the construction of a 24 metre research vessel. Anglo-Australian Telescope Board This item provides for the Australian Government's contributions to the operational costs of the Anglo-Australian Telescope sited near Coonabarabran in N.S.W. The total cost of operations in 1977-78, which is to be shared equally with the UK. Government, is estimated at SI.7 million. Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established in 1964 to promote, encourage and assist studies and research in relation to the Aboriginal people. The work of the Institute includes the identification, recording and preservation of sites that are of special significance to Aboriginals, the collection of Aboriginal music, folklore and language, and research into the interaction between Aboriginals and Europeans. The provision for the Institute in 1977-78 is $2.0 million. Other Research and Science Expenditure under this heading covers support for a number of scientific and research activities. Among these is support for the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Science and Technology Council. Funds are provided for activities under the auspices of several agreements for scientific and technological co-operation with other countries. Funds for the support and development of major scientific facilities in Australia are also included under this heading. Examples include the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer ($0.09 million in 1977-78), the Balloon Launching Station ($0.22 million in 1977-78), and scientific installations operated under arrangements with US. agencies. Provision of $0.14 million has also been made for initial work that will lead to direct Australian participation in the LANDSAT program. An amount of $0.55 million is provided for further specific research in 1977-78 on the development of the Australian Microwave Landing System (InterScan). E. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES Included under this heading are general administrative services not allocated to specific functions, as well as some common services. These outlays are estimated to total S855.6 million in 1977-78, an increase of $131.1 million. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million S million 3 million 3 million Financial Affairs and Fiscal AdministrationCustoms and Excise Administration 51.6 56.2 60.1 + 3.9 Taxation Administration 129.2 150.3 158.0 + 7.8 Treasury, nec 31.2 17.3 24.3 + 7.0 Finance 5.2 21.5 24.7 + 3.2 Other 8.8 9.7 11.0 + 1.4 Total 225.9 255.0 278.2 + 23.2 Statistical Services. . . . 47.0 57.9 60.3 + 2.4 Allocation to NT Legislative Assembly 50.0 + 50.0 Other General Administration of the Territories 61.5 58.9 65.6 + 6.7 Other Administrative Services, nec . 41.2 50.7 54.4 + 3.7 Common ServicesConstruction Services (net) . 95.6 96.1 101.3 + 5.3 Commonwealth Offices 36.0 33.3 29.0 4.2 Government Printer. . . . 3.4 2.9 4.2 + 1.2 Property Management and Services 45.2 40.3 45.6 + 5.3 Government Purchasing 9.1 9.3 9.7 + 0.4 Rent 44.4 48.1 53.1 + 5.0 Publishing and Publicity 10.6 8.7 7.7 0.9 Storage and Transport Services 10.3 13.3 12.6 0.8 Other 0.5 0.9 2.3 + 1.3 Total 255.2 252.9 265.5 + 12.6 Net Superannuation Payments nec . 58.7 90.5 120.5 + 30.0 Less Recoveries nec . . . . 35.9 41.3 38.9 2.5 Funds to be provided in 1977-78 total S278.2 million, an increase of $23.2 million on 1976-77. The increases here mainly reflect rises in wages and salaries. Comparison of the 1977-78 estimates for Treasury nec and Finance with figures for earlier years are affected by classification changes arising from the creation of the Department of Finance in December 1976. This provision is essentially for expenditure involved in the operations of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. There is an estimated increase of S7.6 million in salary costs in 1977-78; this is largely offset by reductions in administrative costs associated with the 1976 population census. The provision is to cover expenditure on functions for which executive responsibility was transferred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 1 January 1977. This transfer of functions is the first stage of the devolution of powers leading to self-government for the Territory and its eventual statehood. The disbursement of this provision will be determined by Funds Allocation Ordinances of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. These Ordinances will, inter alia, allocate funds for the Northern Territory Housing Commission, Police, Primary Producers Board, and for other responsibilities previously classified under the relevant functional headings. This item includes outlays in the Australian Capital Territory (S28.8 million) and the Northern Territory ($36.8 million) on services which are of a general nature and cannot be readily classified to other functions (e.g. city works undertaken by the NCDC in Canberra, and general salaries and administrative expenses of the Departments of the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). Major items in this category include the administrative expenses of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Science and the Department of Administrative Services. Expenditures related to the running costs of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman are also included. The Tribunal, which came into operation on 1 July 1976, is empowered to hear appeals against certain classes of administrative decisions. Construction Services (Net) Outlays under this heading are mainly for the running costs of the Department of Construction, including salaries, administrative expenses and consultants' fees. The major factor responsible for the increase under this item is higher salary costs. Commonwealth Offices This heading covers funds provided for the construction and maintenance of Commonwealth Offices. The declining trend of these expenditures is expected to continue in 1977-78 in line with the continuing policy of restraint on public service staff numbers. Expenditures on new Commonwealth Offices in the ACT, which make up the bulk of this item, are estimated to decline by $3.4 million in 1977-78. Property Management and Services Provision is made here for the services necessary to manage Commonwealth office accommodation and the survey program. Major components of the estimate are salaries ($18.5 million), contract cleaning ($7.1 million) and office services (S9.4 million). Government Purchasing The main component of the estimate for 1977-78 is salaries (S9.1 million) for staff of the Department of Administrative Services engaged in purchasing activities. Rent This item reflects the rental costs for office and other accommodation leased for civil departments. The full year cost of leases taken up in 1976-77, increased rentals on existing leases, and proposed expenditure of $1.5 million on new leases in 1977-78, account for the increase of $5.0 million. Publishing and Publicity Expenditure under this item includes provisions for the operations of the Australian Government Publishing Service and publicity programs undertaken by the Australian Information Service (totalling $4.1 million) and support for Film Australia ($3.6 million). Storage and Transport Services Expenditure under this heading includes removal and storage costs associated with the transfer of Commonwealth civilian employees and the provision of bulk storage facilities for other than the Defence Department. NET SUPERANNUATION PAYMENTS The increase of $30 million estimated for 1977-78 provides for growth of about 3 per cent in the number of pensioners and reflects the full year cost of new pensions granted in 1976-77 and the cost of automatic updating of pensions in July 1977. This classification records various miscellaneous receipts, the main components being administrative charges for work undertaken by the Department of Construction for certain clients (e.g., Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, Reserve and Commonwealth Banks), revenue from the sale of Government publications, film sales and royalties, rent from Commonwealth property, survey fees levied by the Surveyor General, and numerous other minor charges. 10. NOT ALLOCATED TO FUNCTION Outlays not allocated to specific functions comprise payments to the States and local government authorities not elsewhere classified in this Statement, natural disaster relief, interest payments on the public debt, and an allowance of $90 million for increases in wages and salaries for Commonwealth Government employees and the defence forces. A. PAYMENTS TO OR FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT Outlays under this heading comprise general revenue funds for the States, State Government Loan Council programs, assistance related to State debt, certain forms of financial assistance for local government and outlays for natural disaster relief. Details of the payments are set out below; additional information on these and other payments to the States and local government authorities classified under various functional headings is contained in the Budget Paper entitled Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1977-78. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million $ million S million $ million General Revenue AssistanceTax Sharing Entitlements 3 072.8 3 695.6 4 336.1 +640.5 Less Refunds of Overpayments 19. + 19.6 Net Tax Sharing Entitlements 3 072.8 3 695.6 4316.5 + 620.9 Special Grants 38.8 27.0 24.8 2.2 Less Repayments . . . . 10.0 10.0 Total3 111.6 3712.6 4 331.3 + 618.7 State Government Loan Council ProgramsCapital Grants 430.3 452.0 477.9 + 25.9 Advances 860.7 904.0 955.9 + 51.9 Less Sinking Fund Receipts. 152.0 159.3 170.7 + 11.4 Total1 139.0 1 196.7 1 263.1 + 66.4 Assistance Related to State Debt 47.3 46.8 48.9 + 2.1 Assistance to Local GovernmentTax Sharing Entitlements 79.9 140.0 165.3 + 25.3 Natural Disaster PaymentsFire, Flood and Cyclones and Other Disasters 64.2 31.7 13.8 17.9 Less Repayments . . . . 6.1 4.6 4.3 0.3 Total 58.1 27.1 9.4 17.6 General revenue funds are utilised for purposes determined by the States. Financial assistance grants, which made up most of these funds up to and including 1975-76, were determined under a formula which took into account the percentage increases in State's populations and in average wages in the economy as a whole, and a further 'betterment' factor. Financial assistance grants were replaced by personal income tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and State Governments in 1976-77. Under 'Stage 1' of these arrangements, the States are entitled to 33.6 per cent of Commonwealth net personal income tax collections, excluding the revenue effects of any special surcharges or rebates applied by the Commonwealth. Overpayments in a year are deducted from payments in the following year. Under 'Stage 2', for which enabling legislation has been introduced into Parliament, each State will also be able, if it so chooses, to legislate to increase its revenue from personal income tax or to give, at cost to the State, a rebate on personal income tax to residents in the State. The 'StageV arrangements include a guarantee that the States' entitlements in any year will not be less than in the previous year and, in the four years 1976-77 to 1979-80, will not be less in a year than the amount which would have been yielded in that year by the financial assistance grants formula referred to above. In the context of the examination of the proposal that the income tax sharing arrangements be changed to relate the States' entitlements to the preceding year's net personal income tax collections, it has been agreed that the Budget provision for the States' tax sharing entitlements in 1977-78 should be the amount of $4336.1 million conditionally offered by the Prime Minister at the 1 July 1977 Premiers' Conference, rather than 33.6 per cent of estimated net personal income tax collections in 1977-78. Special grants are paid on the recommendations of the Grants Commission; each of thc four less populous States is free to apply for them but Queensland is at present thc only applicant State and payments of special grants in 1976-77 and 1977-78 relate solely to that State. Repayments under the general revenue assistance heading relate to special repayable and interest bearing advances made to New South Wales in 1971-72 and 1972-73. In total, net general revenue funds to be provided to the States in 1977-78 are estimated at S4331.3 million, an increase of $618.7 million, or 16.7 per cent, compared with 1976-77. At its July 1977 meeting the Loan Council approved a total State Government program of SI433.8 million for 1977-78. This represents an increase of 5.7 per cent over the 1976-77 program. Of the total program $955.9 million will take the form of borrowings and S477.9 million will be by way of capital grants provided by the Commonwealth. AssisTAr>XE RELATED TO STATE DEBT Under the Financial Agreement the Commonwealth pays $15.2 million each year to the States as a contribution towards interest payable on their debt and also contributes sinking fund payments. The sinking fund payments in 1977-78 are estimated to total S33.7 million. Under the tax sharing arrangements which commenced in 1976-77 the Commonwealth provides funds to the States for general purpose assistance to local government authorities. The amount to be provided in 1977-78 is SI65.3 million, which represents an increase of 18.1 per cent over the amount of $140.0 million paid to the States for local government in 1976-77. An amount of SI3.8 million is provided for expenditure on natural disaster relief in 1977-78. Of this amount SI 3.0 million is estimated to be required for payments to the States, primarily for outstanding payments in respect of cyclone, flood and storm damage. No allowance has been made in the estimates for payments in respect of natural disasters which may occur in 1977-78. B. PUBUC DEBT INTEREST This heading brings together interest payments made from the Budget sector to other sectors, including interest payments on Commonwealth securities, and under defence credit arrangements with other countries. Interest received by Government Trust Funds on Commonwealth Securities held as investments and cash balances is offset against gross-interest payments. Total public debt interest payments are estimated to increase by S315.7 million or 22.4 per cent and represent 6.5 per cent of total Budget outlays; in 1976-77 public debt interest payments represented 5.9 per cent of total outlays. + Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Decrease Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million S million $ million S million Gross Interest Paid on Australian Government Securities 1 087.6 1 517.8 1 808.6 +290.9 Loan Defence Act Interest 6.0 4.5 2.8 1.7 Other Interest Payments 1.5 2.9 6.3 + 3.4 Gross Interest Payments1 095.2 1 525.1 1 817.6 +292.5 Less Interest on Government Securities and Cash Balances held by the Australian Government on its own behalfLoan Consolidation and Investment Reserve 117.4 98.6 75.0 23.6 Other 10.1 14.9 15.3 + 0.4 Gross Interest Paid on Commonwealth Securities This item comprises interest on all Commonwealth securities on issue, except for interest on defence borrowings. The major securities issued by the Commonwealth include Bonds and Inscribed Stock, Australian Savings Bonds, and Treasury Notes. Over half the securities on issue are on behalf of the States. Reimbursement of interest payments by the States and Commonwealth Authorities are recorded as receipts under the heading Interest, Rent and Dividends. (See the relevant section in Budget Statement No. 4 for further details.) There has been a substantial increase in interest payments over recent years. High interest rates and large deficits financed as far as possible by borrowings from the public have contributed to this increase. Loan Defence Act Interest The decline in interest payments in 1977-78 on loans raised in the United States for defence equipment purchases reflects the declining level of that outstanding debt. Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve Interest is received by the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve on investments in Commonwealth securities which were issued mainly in Special Loans to assist State works programs. Because these receipts represent interest paid by the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth (through one of its Trust Accounts) the interest received by the Trust Account is offset against total interest paid. The estimated reduction in interest receipts of the Reserve reflects a lower level of investments held by the Reserve following cancellation of securities. Other Interest is also received on investments in Commonwealth securities and on cash balances, by other Commonwealth Trust Funds, including the National Debt Sinking Fund. These transactions are also offset. C. ALLOWANCE FOR WAGE AND SALARY INCREASES A bulk allowance of $90 million is included in the Budget estimates for 1977-78 to allow for prospective increases in rates of wages and salaries in the public service during the year. The calculation of this allowance is necessarily approximate. Total receipts in 1977-78 are estimated at S24 439 million, an increase of 14.3 per cent over 1976-77. This is after allowance for the net loss to revenue, estimated at $48 million, of the taxation measures announced in the Budget Speech and an estimated reduction of $1756 million in revenues in 1977-78 arising from major taxation measures introduced in 1976. THE MEASURES The following schedule lists the Budget taxation measures and shows the estimated effects on receipts in 1977-78 and in a full year. Minor measures outside the taxation field that will affect receipts are not shown. Full year changes are the estimated effects on receipts in respect of the 1977-78 nnanciai year had the measures applied from 1 July 1977.

(ft) The estimated cost to revenue of the new personal income tax system in 1978-79 is $973 million {see p. 129). Measures introduced in 1976 also imply substantial costs to revenue in 1977-78. The most important of these are: indexation of personal income tax, the latest round of which, from 1 July 1977, is estimated to cost $825 million in 1977-78; a further $140 million in revenue forgone from the 1976-77 adjustment arises in 1977-78; the trading stock valuation adjustment, estimated to cost $316 million in 1977-78; and the investment allowance, estimated to cost $475 million in 1977-78, compared with $100 million in 1976-77. The total of these effects on revenue in 1977-78 is $1756 million. The following comments are in elaboration of the Budget measures. A new personal income tax system will apply as from 1 February 1978. It will form the basis for: o PAYE instalment deductions from 1 February 1978; o notionally, assessment of tax on incomes derived after 1 February (the system used for assessment of total taxable income earned in 1977-78 will be a composite one obtained from the present system, with a weight of 7/12, and the new system, with a weight of 5/12); and o indexation to determine tax on 1978-79 incomes. The elements of the new system are as follows: Rate Scale The new simplified scale will have a zero rate on that part of taxable income up to $3750. A standard rate of 32 cents will apply to all parts of taxable income above $3750. Two levels of surcharge will, however, set the effective marginal rates at 46 cents on taxable income from $16 001 to $32 000, and at 60 cents on taxable income above $32 000. The present and proposed scales of tax rates are: Total Taxable Income Not less Not more than than Tax at General Rates on Total Taxable Incomes S S $ 1 2 506 Nil+ 20c for each SI 2 506 6 266 501.20 -r 27c for each $1 in excess of 2 506 6 266 12 532 1 516.40 + 35c for each SI in excess of 6 266 12 532 18 798 3 709.50 + 45c for each $1 in excess of 12 532 18 798 25 063 6 529.20 + 55c for each SI in excess of 18 798 25 063 31 329 9 974.95 + 60c for each SI in excess of 25 063 31 329 and over 13 734.55 + 65c for each SI in excess of 31 329 (a) Allowance of the S676 general rebate means that there is a zero effective rate up to income of $3 153. Total Taxable Income Not less Not more than than Tax on Total Taxable Incomes $ S $ 1 3 750 Nil3 750 16 000 Nil+ 32c for each SI in excess of 3 750 16 000 32 000 3 920 00 46c for each SI in excess of 16 000 32 000 and over 11 280.00 60c for each $1 in excess of 32 000 The minimum taxable income subject to tax, at present effectively $3154, will be $3751 under the new system. For a taxpayer with a wholly dependent spouse the spouse rebate of S555 will result in a minimum taxable income of $5485. Rebates The general concessional rebate (S676 at present) will be discontinued, and replaced by a zero rate step in the rate scale. Either method accomplishes the result of freeing an initial slice of income from tax. Rebates for dependants and the sole parent rebate remain at levels applying since 1 July 1977: S Dependent spouse, daughter-housekeeper 555 Housekeeper 555 Parent or parent-in-law 501 Invalid relative 251 Sole parent 388 Zone allowance rebates also remain at levels applying since 1 July 1977: Zone A: $216 plus 25 per cent of rebates for dependants (including notional rebates for dependent children and students); Zone B: $36 plus 4 per cent of rebates for dependants. Rebate Declarations Under the present system, if an employee does not lodge a declaration claiming the $676 general rebate, tax is deducted at the minimum rate of 35 cents in the dollar. An employee may have only one declaration in force at any one time and a person with two or more jobs would usually lodge a declaration with his or her main employer. It is proposed that equivalent declaration arrangements be continued under the new system. People who have 'second' jobs will, usually, have income from their main job in excess of $3750 a year. Any additional income from 'second job' earnings will thus generally attract PAYE deductions at or above the 32 per cent rate. Non-residents Concessional allowances have been granted only to resident taxpayers. With adoption of a zero-rate on the first slice of taxable income, non-residents too will be zero-rated on the first slice of their assessed Australian taxable income. Trusts The following basic rules for the taxation of trustees are proposed: o for accumulating trust income to which no beneficiary is presently entitled and that is assessed under section 99 to the trustee of a trust other than a deceased estate that is in course of administration (maximum 2 years), there will be no J tax if the income is $416 or less, there will be no zero-rating and, subject to shading-in provisions for income marginally in excess of S416, the standard rate and surcharges will apply. o for trust income of a trust other than a deceased estate, to which a child under 16 years of age at the end of the year of income is presently entitled and that is assessed under section 98, the same tax rules as above are to apply, but with a figure of $1040 instead of $416. o for other trust income to which a beneficiary who is under a legal disability is presently entitled that is assessed under section 98, and for income assessed under section 99 of a deceased estate that is in course of administration (maximum 2 years), the first $3750 of taxable income will be zero-rated with the standard rate and surcharges applying to the balance. Where a beneficiary is taxed on trust income that has also been taxed to the trustee under section 98, the tax paid by the trustee is credited against any tax charged to the beneficiary, but no refund is made. .Averaging for Primary Producers Under the present system, the tax payable by a primary producer is in part calculated by applying to the first $16 000 of taxable income a rate fixed by reference to 'average income' of the current and four previous years. The general rebate of $676 and other concessional rebates are allowed. Under the new system, with the role of the general rebate now to be performed by the zero rate on the scale, the tax under the averaging provisions applicable to taxable income between $3751 and $16 000 will be calculated at the standard rate of 32 per cent, and the first $3750 of taxable income will attract the zero rate.. Concessional rebates will again reduce the tax payable. Health Insurance Levy The present basis for determining the minimum taxable income subject to levy for health insurance levy purposes, by deducting unused entitlements to the general rebate against liability to levy, will no longer be applicable after absorption of the rebate into the rate scale. However, the present relationship between the income tax threshold and the health insurance levy threshold will be continued. The shading-in rate will be 34.5 per cent (equal to the levy rate of 2.5 per cent plus the standard rate of income tax of 32 per cent) with a levy threshold of S3479. Any unused concessional rebate (e.g. the rebate for a spouse) will, as at present, be allowable against the levy. For a taxpayer with a fully dependent spouse the minimum taxable income subject to levy will be $5087. Effects of the New System Some of the principal effects of the new simplified system are: o Taxpayers at all income levels will gain under the new system. Examples of the gains are: Tax liability at Tax liability at current rates of tax proposed rates of tax Reductions DependNo DependNo Taxable ent dependent dependDependent No income spouse ants spouse ants spouse dependants $ $ $ $ S $ percent S percent 4000 Nil 228.58 Nil 80.00 148.58 65.0 5000 Nil 498.58 Nil 400.00 98.58 19.8 6 000 213.58 768.58 165.00 720.00 48.58 22.7 48.58 6.3 7 000 542.30 1 097.30 485.00 1 040.00 57.30 10.6 57.30 5.2 8000 892.30 1 447.30 805.00 1 360.00 87.30 9.8 87.30 6.0 9 000 1 242.30 1 797.30 1 125.00 1 680.00 117.30 9.4 117.30 6.5 10 000 . 1 592.30 2 147.30 1 445.00 2000.00 147.30 9.3 147.30 6.9 11 000 . 1 942.30 2 497.30 1 765.00 2 320.00 177.30 9.1 177.30 7.1 12000 . 2 292.30 2 847.30 2085.00 2 640.00 207.30 9.0 207.30 7.3 13 000 . 2 689.10 3 244.10 2 405.00 2 960.00 284.10 10.6 284.10 8.8 14000 . 3 139.10 3 694.10 2 725.00 3 280.00 414.10 13.2 414.10 11.2 15000 . 3 589.10 4144.10 3 045.00 3 600.00 544.10 15.2 544.10 13.1 20 000 . 5 959.30 6 514.30 5 205.00 5 760.00 754.30 12.7 754.30 11.6 25 000 . 8 709.30 9 264.30 7 505.00 8 060.00 1 204.30 13.8 1 204.30 13.0 30 000 . 11 706.15 12 261.15 9 805.00 10 360.00 1901.15 16.2 1 901.15 15.5 o The flat standard marginal rate of 32 cents will apply, without surcharges, over the wide band of income from $3751 to $16 000. Nearly 90 per cent of taxpayers have taxable incomes falling within that band. The standard rate is well below the present marginal rate at the upper end of that band (45 cents) and almost 80 per cent of taxpayers having taxable incomes within that band will have their marginal rate of tax reduced. o The maximum marginal rate, on incomes above $32 000, is reduced from 65 to 60 c^nts, and the point at which the 60 cent rate commences to apply is increased from $25 064 to $32 001. The new system will be indexed as from 1 July 1978. The indexation factor to be applied to the rate scale in 1978-79 will be half that given by the annual indexation rules but the full adjustment will be applied to dependant rebates. The cost to revenue in 1978-79 of the new system on this basis is estimated to be $973 million. Arrangements for 1977-78 As noted earlier, the personal tax system to apply for 1977-78 will be a composite one based on the present system (with a weight of 7/12) and the new system (with a weight of 5/12). This means that, in practice, the effective rate scale to apply for 1977-78 after absorption of the general rebate will beTotal Taxable Income Not less Not more than than Tax on Total Taxable Income$ $ $ $ 1 3 402 Nil3 402 3 750 Nil+ 27.000c for each $1 in excess of 3 402 3 750 6 266 93.96000 + 29.085c for each $1 in excess of 3 750 6 266 12 532 825.73860 + 33.749c for each $1 in excess of 6 266 12 532 16 000 2 940.45094 + 39.579c for each $1 in excess of 12 532 16 000 18 798 4 313.05066 + 45.417c for each $1 in excess of 16 000 18 798 25 063 5 583.81832 + 51.247c for each $1 in excess of 18 798 25 063 31 329 8 794.44287 + 54.162c for each $1 in excess of 25 063 31 329 32 000 12 188.23379 + 57.077c for each $1 in excess of 31 329 32 000 12 571.22046 + 62.915c for each $1 in excess of 32 000 Particular features of 1977-78 arrangements are as follows: o The minimum taxable income subject to tax will be $3403 ($5336 for a taxpayer with a fully dependent spouse). PAYE deductions as from 1 February 1978 will be on the basis of the new system outlined earlier. e Provisional tax for 1977-78 levied on assessment on the basis of 1976-77 income will be calculated at 1976-77 tax rates. Where a taxpayer 'self-assesses' his or her 1977-78 provisional tax on the basis of estimated 1977-78 taxable income, 1977-78 rates of tax will be applied in the calculation of that provisional tax. e The tax on non-residents, on trustees assessed under section 98 or section 99 and on primary producers to whom the averaging provisions apply, will be basically 7/12 of the tax under the present system plus 5/12 of the tax under the new system. e The minimum taxable income subject to the health insurance levy will be $3114 ($4913 for a taxpayer with a fully dependent spouse), with the levy above $3113 being shaded-in at the rate of 29.5 per cent. Rebates for Concessional Expenditure Rebates will be allowed in 1977-78 for concessional expenditure in excess of $1590 at a rate of 32 per cent, i.e., a rate matching the new standard tax rate of 32 per cent. Under present law such expenditures in excess of $1690 attract a rebate (additional to the general rebate of $676) at the rate of 40 per cent. Lowering of the ceiling above which rebates are allowed for concessional expenditure from $1690 to $1590 brings those rebates (albeit at a reduced rate) within the reach of more taxpayers. The new ceiling of $1590 will not be subject to indexation adjustments. Incentives for the Arts At present, a person who donates a work of art or similar property to a public art gallery, museum or library may be eligible for an income tax deduction in respect of his gift only if he purchased the item within the 12-month period preceding the date of the gift. The amount allowable is restricted to the lesser of purchase price or market value at the time of making the gift. As from 1 January 1978, the 12-month test will be abandoned for a trial period of three years in respect of gifts of works of art and comparable material made to a public art gallery, museum or library. As well, the basis of determining the amount to be allowed as a deduction will be Changed. From1 January 1978, it will generally be market value or, where equity requires it in some particular circumstances, the cost to the donor. Changes to Company Income Tax The rate of tax on taxable income of companies is being increased by 3.5 percentage points. The general rate applicable to income year 1976-77 will therefore be 46 per cent in lieu of the previously applicable 42.5 per cent. The rate of tax payable by a friendly society dispensary will move from 37.5 per cent to 41 per cent. Correspondingly, a superannuation fund that does not comply with the '30/20' ratio of investment in public securities, will have the rate of tax on its 1977-78 investment income increased from 42.5 to 46 per cent. Foreign Film Distributors From 17 August 1977, film and video tape royalties paid overseas will bear tax of 10 per cent of the gross payment. This basis will replace the present provisions introduced in 1942 to overcome problems of determining the true profit element of film royalties derived from Australian sources through foreign-controlled film businesses. Under those provisions most such royalties are taxed as if their profit content were 10 per cent, giving an Australian tax yield of no more than 4.6 per cent of the gross royalties (at the rate of tax now applicable to 1976-77 incomes of companies). Coal Export Duty The rates of duty on coking coal will be reduced from S4.50 to $3.50 per tonne for coal subject to the higher rate, and from $1.50 to $1.00 per tonne for that subject to the lower rate. Excise Duty on Crude Oil The rate of duty has been increased from $2.00 to $3.00 per barrel on crude oil; LPG from currently producing fields will continue to attract duty at the rate of $2.00 per barrel. The duty will not be applied to condensate marketed separately from a crude oil stream or to LPG from fields yet to come into production. Duty on Petroleum Products The duty on refined petroleum products will be increased by 0.25 cents per litre. The new rates are shown in the consolidated rate table included later in this Statement.

After taking account of the measures described above, total taxation revenue in 1977-78 is estimated to increase by 13.7 per cent to $22 323 million. The main components are described below. Customs Duty-Imports The Customs authorities estimate that duty on imports will total $1315 million in 1977-78, an increase of $163 million or 14.1 per cent compared with 23.6 per cent in 1976-77. In 1976-77 the value of dutiable imports grew by 28.5 per cent, in part in consequence of the effect on import values of the devaluation of the Australian dollar in November 1976. Although dutiable imports are expected to grow very much less rapidly in 1977-78 than in 1976-77, the estimate assumes a partial offset through an anticipated increase in the ratio of duty to dutiable imports. Customs Duty-Coal Exports On the basis of existing rates of duty, revenue from the levy on coal exports is estimated at about $117 million in 1977-78. This further step in the phasing out of this duty is estimated to reduce collections in 1977-78 by $24 million to a total of $93 million. Excise Duty As outlined earlier, the duties on crude oil and petroleum products have been increased. After taking account of these changes, and of the effects of the crude oil pricing decisions (see below), collections of excise duty are estimated by the collecting authorities to be $2792 million in 1977-78, an increase of $307 million or 12 per cent on collections in 1976-77. Excluding the estimated effects on revenues of the changes in duties, collections are estimated to increase by 5 per cent. In 1976-77 collections increased by 6.6 per cent, reflecting in part the full year effect of rate increases introduced in 1975-76. The major components of the 1977-78 estimate, together with changes on 1976-77 figures, are as follows: 1977-78 1976-77 Estimate Increase$ million % million $ million per cent Beer 740 764 25 3 Potable spirits . . . . 71 76 5 7 Tobacco products 555 572 17 3 Petroleum products . 772 850 78 10 Crude oil and LPG . 340 521 181 53 Other8 9 1 12 Total. . . . 2 486 2 792 307 12 In estimating the revenue from petroleum products, allowance has been made for the likely effects on usage of overall increases in prices of petroleum products arising from the various policy measures announced in the Budget. Clearances for consumption of the two main components-moto r spirit and diesel fuel-ar e projected to increase at slower rates than in 1976-77 while aviation fuels, clearances of which declined in 1976-77, are expected to increase moderately. Rates of duty for the main items subject to excise are shown in the following table, which incorporates the changes announced in the Budget Speech. 16 August 1977 Potable spirits-pe r litre of alcoholBrandy 10.21 Gin 10.29 Whisky 10.21 Rum 10.29 Vodka and other liquors 10.25 Beer-pe r litre 0.394 Tobacco products-pe r kiloCigarettes 19.36 Cigars 16.56 Manufactured tobacco 9.8S Petroleum products-pe r litreAviation gasoline 0.04555 Motor spirit 0.05155 Aviation turbine fuel 0.0419 Diesel fuel 0.05155 Crude oil-pe r barrel 3.00 LPG from existing fields and separate condensate-pe r barrel 2.00 Sales Tax Sales tax revenue is estimated to increase by 13.0 per cent in 1977-78 to $1865 million; in 1976-77 sales tax receipts increased by 17.2 per cent. Sales tax revenue is dependent on the price and volume of taxable goods sold, and the 1977-78 revenue estimates are consistent with slower volume growth for the year as a whole and somewhat smaller price increases. Estimated collections by rate class are shown in the following table: 1977-78 Rate Class 1976-77 Estimate Increase$ million $ million $ million per cent 2i per cent 54 61 7 13 15 per cent 827 937 110 13 27i per cent 770 867 98 13 Total1 650 1 865 215 13 Income Tax-Individuals It is estimated that net collections of income tax from individuals in 1977-78 will increase by 16.6 per cent to $12 884 million. (a) Pay-as-you-earn Instalment Deductions For the purpose of calculating gross PAYE'instalment deductions average weekly earnings are assumed to increase by 10.5 per cent in 1977-78 and the average level of wage and salary earner employment for the year as a whole to increase by 0.75 per cent (both expressed in terms of male units). In 1976-77 average earnings are estimated to have increased by 13.0 per cent and employment to have remained unchanged. An amount of $327 million has been included in the estimate for collections of the health insurance levy in 1977-78 in respect of all individual taxpayers. New PAYE instalment schedules came into operation on 1 July 1977 incorporating the 10.9 per cent indexation adjustment to the personal income tax rate scale. The cost to revenue, in 1977-78, of this adjustment, for all individual taxpayers, is estimated to be $825 million. The overall cost of indexation to 1977-78 revenue is estimated at $965 million; an amount of $140 million in revenue forgone from the 1976-77 adjustment has not arisen until 1977-78. The 1977-78 estimate of $10 635 million in gross PAYE receipts represents an increase of 8.4 per cent over 1976-77 compared with an increase of 17.3 per cent in 1976-77. Adjusting for the loss to revenue of the new scales the 1977-78 increase would he 12.4 per cent. Collections in 1976-77 included for the first time the proceeds of the health insurance levy and were also boosted by the additional revenue arising from the abolition of child rebates. Adjusted for these factors, 1976-77 collections increased by 10.3 per cent. Refunds of tax in 1977-78 are estimated at $640 million, compared with $1282 million in 1976-77. The estimated further decline in refunds in 1977-78 is a result of the system of tax rebates (allowable in calculating instalment deductions) introduced in the 1975-76 Budget, which replaced most concessional deductions and which, together with the shape of the tax scales, reduces the extent of over-withholding through PAYE. (b) Other Individuals Collections on assessments of individuals are estimated to increase by 14.4 per cent to $2889 million. These tax payments are based on incomes received in 1976-77. Primary producers' incomes are estimated to have increased only slightly in 1976-77 while other business and property incomes grew more strongly. The estimated revenue in 1977-78 has taken into account the effects on other individuals' income tax assessed of the investment allowance ($150 million) and the trading stock valuation adjustment ($35 million). Income Tax-Companies Company tax collections are expected to increase by $174 million or 6.1 per cent to $2998 million in 1977-78 compared with an increase of $302 million or 12.0 per cent in 1976-77. Taxable company incomes in 1976-77 (subject to tax in 1977-78) have been significantly lowered by the measures introduced during 1976. In respect of company tax, the investment allowance is estimated to reduce 1977-78 revenue by $325 million. The cost to company tax revenue of the trading stock valuation adjustment in 1977-78 is estimated at $281 million. On the other hand the increase in the rate of company tax announced in this Budget is estimated to increase 1977-78 revenues by $203 million; but for that change, company income tax revenues would have fallen by about $30 million this year. Other Taxes, Fees and Fines The major items in other taxes, fees and fines are indicated in the following table: +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 $ million $ million S million $ million Broadcasting and TV station licence fees 4.2 7.2 10.5 + 3.3 Radio-communication licence fees 2.8 3.9 5.0 + 1.1 Unfunded employees retirement contributions 39.9 51.7 56.9 + 5.2 Stevedoring industry charge 39.7 51.9 33.5 -18.4 Mainland territories 21.7 24.2 37.2 + 13.0 Tax on liquid petroleum gas used in road vehicles 0.5 0.5 0.5 Other 10.2 12.9 15.5 + 2^6 AND FINES . . . . 119.1 152.2 159.0 + 6.8 Receipts from these sources are estimated to increase by a net $6.8 million in 1977-78 to S159.0 million. The largest increase is in respect of receipts from mainland territories. This category includes general rates ($14.0 million), drivers' licence and motor registration fees ($8.2 million) and liquor licence fees ($2.9 million). An amount of $6 million is included for proposed general revenue increases in the Northern Territory. The increase of $5.2 million in unfunded employees' retirement contributions results mainly from increased contributions to the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Fund. Radio-communications licence fees are to be increased for some classes of users from $20 a year to $25 a year from 1 October 1977. The new fees will increase revenue by $0.75 million in 1977-78 and $1 million in a full year. The fees payable by some licensees of commercial radio and television stations are also to be revised to yield an additional $3.3 million in revenue this nnanciai year. The decrease of $18.4 million shown in receipts from the stevedoring industry charge reflects new arrangements to be introduced during 1977-78 for this industry. Under the new arrangements responsibility for making some of the payments made previously by the Stevedoring Industry Authority (and subsequently recouped by a levy on the industry) will be transferred to the industry itself. As a consequence, a lower scale of levies is to apply in 1977-78. Included in the 'other' category are passport fees ($7.0 million), animal and plant quarantine charges ($4.0 million) and payments by the Health Insurance Commission in lieu of taxes ($1.0 million).

Total receipts from interest, rent and dividends are estimated at $1814 million, an increase of $186 million or 11.5 per cent compared with 1976-77. The projected increase in interest receipts reflects the large advances made in recent years to thc Slates for both specific and general purposes, and to bodies, principally semi-government authorities, operating outside the Budget. The largest absolute increases in 1977-78 are in interest due on advances to the States (S159.6 million) and to the Telecommunications Commission (S26.5 million). A further reduction in interest received from the Australian Wool Corporation is expected in 1977-78 as the Corporation reduces its outstanding debt to the Commonwealth. Net Receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions Details are shown in the following table: +Increase 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 -Decreas e Actual Actual Estimate on 1976-77 S million S million S million S million Commonwealth Banking Corporation 5.1 12.3 15.5 + 3.2 Reserve Bank 80.0 216.0 +136.0 Canberra Bus Service. . . -4.3 5.4 6.0 0.6 Other -5.0 2.1 2.5 + 4.5 This table covers receipts (other than taxation receipts) from public nnanciai enterprises and thc net operating revenues of certain activities carried on as business-type enterprises. Thc main component in the table is the payment to the Commonwealth from the profits of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Thc payment of S80 million to the Commonwealth in 1976-77 was the first such payment since 1972-73. During the intervening period net earnings of the Reserve Bank were used principally to reduce thc Bank's unfunded exchange valuation losses. The Budget provides for a payment of $216 million in 1977-78 made up of $126 million as thc Commonwealth's shiire of 1976-77 pronts and S90 million as an interim payment from thc Note Issue Department iri respect of expected 1977-78 pronts. (Further payments to thc Commonwealth are expected from 1977-78 profits in 1978-79 when profits are finally determined for thc year.) An amount of SI5.5 million is expected to be paid to the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation in 1977-78, equivalent to one-half of the published profits for 1976-77 of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The $4.5 million turnaround in the 'other' category largely reflects growth in consumption and more effective billing and collection arrangements for electricity charges in the Northern Territory.

Thc Commonwealth has entered agreements to enable certain companies with previously approved contracts for sales of uranium to acquire uranium from the Commonwealth's stockpile. These agreements will allow the companies to make deliveries of this uranium in accordance with the approved contracts. The agreements provide for amounts approximating the net proceeds from the sale of the uranium to be paid to the Commonwealth pending thc return of uranium to the Commonwealth. Receipts of this form in 1977-78 are estimated at about $34 million. Payments by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for uranium purchases are also recorded in this item. The increase of $6.7 million in the 'other' category mainly reflects expected receipts from the sale of land and buildings that have been deemed surplus to the Commonwealth's requirements. The overall deficit of $2740 million for 1976-77 was SI32 million higher than had been estimated at Budget time. Total outlays were SI97 million below thc original Budget estimate but there was a shortfall of $329 million in total receipts. Thc outcome is summarised in the following table: Budget Estimate Actual Difference $ million S million S million Per cent Outlays. 24 321 24124 -197 -0.8 Receipts. 21713 21 384 -329 -1.5 Deficit2 608 2 740 + 132 The main features of the aggregatefiguresare: ° for the second year in succession total outlays were held below the original Budget estimate; o this reflected the Government's continuing policy of expenditure restraint and operation of monitoring and approval procedures directed towards achieving savings in expenditures wherever possible; o the shortfall in receipts mainly reflected shortfalls in net PAYE and company taxation collections. o in turn, the shortfall in net PAYE collections principally reflected a substantially greater level of refunds than had been estimated; and o the actual deficit was closer to the Budget estimate than in any year since 1972-73. when the Budget aggregates were much smaller than they are now. Although outlays in total were held within the Budget estimate, there were substantial variations from the estimates for some individual components. Thc outcome for each major function is compared with the Budget estimate in the following table: Budget Estimate Actual Difference $ million S million -> S million Per cent Defence2 178 2182 + 4 + 0.2 Education 2 130 2 160 + 31 + 1.4 Health2 909 2 543 -366 -12.6 Social Security and Welfare6 262 6 431 + 169 + 2.7 Housing 568 549 19 3.4 Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment 256 251 6 2.2 Culture and Recreation . . . . 254 257 . + 3 + 1.2 Economic ServicesTransport and Communication 1 043 989 54 5.2 Water Supply and Electricity . 74 72 2 2.7 Industry Assistance and Development 130 206 + 76 + 57.1 Labour and Employment 224 243 + 19 + 8.5 Other 90 91 + 0.4 Total Economic Services. 1562 1601 + 39 + 2.5 General Public ServicesLegislative Services. . . . 54 63 + 10 + 18.1 Law, Order and Public Safety 134 126 8 6.2 Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid 532 517 15 2.8 General and Scientific Research nec 184 185 + 2 + 0.8 Administrative Services. . . . 732 725 7 1.0 Total General Public Services 1635 1615 19 1.2 Not Allocated to FunctionPayments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief 5127 5 123 4 0.1 Public Debt Interest. . . . 1 373 1 412 -;38 + 2.8 Allowance for Wage and Salary Increases(a) 90 90 Unallocated Administrative Savings(a) 220+ 22 (a) Bulk allowances which could not be allocated at thc time the estimates were prepared but which were allocated during the course of the year. The non-apportionment of these provisions at Budget time is therefore partly responsible for particular differences between estimates and outcomes. Comments on the main variations from the Budget estimates follow. Defence Defence outlays in 1976-77 were $4 million more than the Budget estimate. Manpower costs were $20 million more, reflecting the impact of salary and wage determinations during the year. Expenditure on reserve capacity maintenance was higher due to increases in operating costs of defence munitions factories, including wage and salary costs. These increases, together with an increase in the working capital advance to the Government Aircraft Factory for thc Nomad venture, were the main factors responsible for outlays associated with industrial capacity exceeding the Budget estimate by S5 million. Against these increases there were shortfalls in expenditure on equipment and stores (SI3 million), due principally to rephasing of payment schedules on major items, and on defence facilities (S10 million). Education Outlays on education exceeded the Budget estimate by $31 million. Student assistance payments were about $27 million greater than estimated and reflected the substantial increases in benefit rates, and the liberalisation of means tests, announced by the Government after the Budget was brought down and effective from the beginning of 1977. Health Actual outlays on health in 1976-77 were $366 million below the Budget estimate. The bulk of the shortfall was attributable to Medibank expenditures. Medibank medical benefits were $170 million less than estimated and hospital benefits and payments were $104 million less. There was of course no previous experience on which to base Budget estimates for these items last year. The shortfalls which eventuated reflected three main factors: fewer persons than expected opting for the basic levels of coverage offered by Medibank Standard; a lower than estimated rate of usage of medical and hospital services generally; and some over-estimation of projected increases in public hospital operating costs. The Commonwealth's contribution to the Hospital Benefits Re-insurance Trust Fund was $22 million less than the Budget estimate and the subsidy payable to registered health insurance organisations was $10 million less. These shortfalls reflected in part difficulties which some private health insurance organisations encountered in assessing their entitlements to payment and in submitting their claims before the end of 1976-77. Health Program Grants to eligible organisations were $6 million less than estimated. Following the restructuring of the health insurance arrangements from 1 October 1976 a number of recipient organisations became ineligible for further grants. Pharmaceutical services and benefits were $40 million less than estimated largely because the volume of scripts processed was lower than had been assumed at Budget time. Outlays on nursing home and domiciliary care benefits and payments were $5 million less than estimated, mainly reflecting a lower than anticipated level of claims for nursing home benefits. Other significant variations from the Budget estimates included over-expenditures on hospital services for ex-service personnel ($9 million) and health services in the Territories ($6 million) and shortfalls in respect of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories ($3 million) and general administrative expenditures ($10 million). The higher than estimated outlays on the first two items largely reflected salary and other cost increases, iin 1976-77 the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories deferred some capital expenditure and required less by way of reimbursement for research activities than had been expected. Lower than estimated costs for the Health Insurance Commission in relation to its Medibank (Public) function and savings achieved by the Department of Health were the main factors accounting for the shortfall in outlays on general administration in the health area. i Social Security and Welfare Outlays on social security and welfare exceeded the Budget estimate by $169 million. The major factor in this increase was the increase of $165 million in expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits-fro m $580 million to $745 million. The average number of benefit recipients in 1976-77 proved to be significantly higher than had been anticipated at Budget time. There were several other significant changes: payments of service pensions and family allowances were respectively $14 million, .and $7 million higher than estimated, while payments of supporting mothers' benefits were $7 million less than the Budget estimate. Delays in commencing projects resulted in under-expenditure of $6 million on estimated payments for children's services. Housing Outlays on housing were $19 million less than the Budget estimate with shortfalls of $22 million in respect of Defence Service Homes, mainly because of a lower than expected demand for loans and higher loan repayments, and $13 million in respect of Home Savings Grants, mainly reflecting lower than assumed application rates. Partly offsetting these shortfalls were increases in outlays on housing in the Territories ($7 million) and on housing for Aboriginals ($13 million). The latter increase mainly reflected the provision of additional funds after the Budget was brought down. Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment Total outlays for. the purposes encompassed under this heading were approximately $6 million less than the Budget estimate. An additional $11 million was provided for the growth centres of Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur after the Budget was brought down but this was more than offset by shortfalls in outlays on urban rehabilitation ($7 million), development of Aboriginal community amenities ($4 million), land development in the ACT ($3 million) and land commissions ($2 million). Culture and Recreation Outlays on cultural and recreational activities were $3 million more than the Budget estimate. Net outlays on the National Broadcasting and Television Service were $8 million more than estimated because of wage and other cost increases. Capital assistance for leisure facilities fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million; drawings, through the States, by project sponsors were not as high as expected. Expenditure on the construction of the National Gallery was $2 million less than estimated. Transport and Communication There was a shortfall of $54 million in outlays on transport and communication. The call on the Budget by Australian National Railways was $22 million less than had been estimated: this reflected lower than estimated losses on operations during the year and delays in the letting of long-term contracts for capital items. Advances to the Australian Shipping Commission were $15 million less than estimated, reflecting both an improved cash flow and the deferral of some capital items. During the year the Overseas Telecommunications Commission made a repayment of capital ($10 million) which was not provided for in the Budget. Delays in the completion of the MoombaSydney pipeline project reduced the Pipeline Authority's requirement from the Budget by $4 million. Industry Assistance and Development Outlays under this heading exceeded the Budget estimate by $76 million. Provision had been made in the estimates for the Australian Wool Corporation to repay $245 million previously borrowed from the Government but in the event repayments were $100 million less than estimated. Outlays on the mining industry were a net $11 million more than estimated. Proceeds from divestment of assets acquired by the former Petroleum and Minerals Authority were $7 million less than estimated, because divestment was on balance less rapid than expected; vfor the same reason investment in petroleum and minerals development (by way of expenditure in relation to those assets) amounted to $4 million more than had been estimated. Grants to the States for beef industry loans were $12 million less than estimated reflecting, in part, the transfer of carry-on finance to the new Rural Adjustment Scheme which came into operation on 1 January 1977. Spending on the eradication of cattle diseases was $4 million less than estimated. Other shortfalls occurred in respect of outlays for export development assistance ($10 million) and marginal dairy farm reconstruction ($7 million). Labour and Employment Total outlays for activities under this heading exceeded the Budget estimate by $19 million. The Government's decision after the Budget to continue existing arrangements for the stevedoring industry to 31 December 1977 resulted in payments to the stevedoring industry being $27 million greater than the Budget estimate; the Budget estimates were based on these arrangements terminating on 31 December 1976. Payments under the NEAT scheme were $8 million less than estimated. This largely reflected a change in the emphasis of the scheme towards more 'on-the-job' training and a delay in the numbers of trainees building up to the expected levels. Outlays on apprenticeship schemes were $2 million more than the estimate. The number of assisted passage migrants in 1976-77 was considerably less than the number underlying the Budget estimate with the result that expenditure under this scheme fell short of the Budget estimate by $6 million. General Public Services Total outlays for general public services were $19 million less than the Budget estimate. Outlays on law order and public safety were $8 million less and mainly reflected lower than estimated outlays on the Australian Family Court (SS million). Overseas aid payments were $19 million less than estimated-considerabl e underspending occurred on bilateral aid projects. Expenditure on legislative services was $10 million more than the Budget estimate; that estimate did not include provision for the Constitutional referendums held in May 1977.. Outlays on administrative services were $7 million less than the estimate. Net superannuation payments were $11 million higher than estimated but expenditures on many administrative and operational items were held below the original estimates. Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief Outlays in this category fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million. Payments to the States in respect of their personal income tax sharing entitlements were $21 million below the estimate, primarily because of downward revisions during the year of the estimate of personal income tax collections. Repayments of special advances made to New South Wales in 1971-72 and 1972-73 fell short of the Budget estimate by $10.5 million; these two loans were consolidated, and principal repayments rescheduled, after the Budget was brought down. Natural disaster payments exceeded the Budget provisions by $6 million mainly as a consequence of payments following severe bushfires in Victoria and floods and cyclones in Queensland during 1976-77. Public Debt Interest The higher than assumed level of subscriptions to Treasury Notes during 1976-77 was mainly responsible for the increase of $38 million in public debt interest over the Budget estimate. The differences between the Budget estimates and actual receipts in 1976-77 are set out in the table below; the accompanying notes comment briefly on the main variations.

Customs Duty-Coal Exports Revenue from coal export levies exceeded the Budget estimate by $9 million reflecting a higher volume of exports than estimated at Budget time. Excise Duty $340 million was collected from the levy on crude oil, $35 million more than the Budget estimate of $305 million. Even so, excise collections in total were $24 million less than the Budget estimate. This was because clearances of most other dutiable goods, in particular beer, were lower than had been estimated at Budget time. Sales Tax Revenue from sales tax was SSO million lower than estimated; this was due to a slower than anticipated increase in taxable sales, reflecting lower than expected increases in both price and volume of goods sold. Income Tax on Individuals-Pay-as-you-earn Net PAYE income tax collections of S8529 million were S246 million lower than the Budget estimate of $8775 million, and represented the largest absolute difference between Budget estimates and actual outcomes on the receipts side. Gross collections of PAYE instalment deductions were $64 million less than the Budget estimate. Average earnings grew a little more rapidly than assumed in the Budget estimate, while employment increased by less. Refunds of PAYE tax collections, which were $182 million more than estimated, relate to deductions from earnings in 1975-76, the first year in which the new income tax rebate arrangements operated. The estimate had not allowed sufficiently for the over-deduction of tax instalments for some taxpayers in the first half of 1975-76 (when the old tax instalment schedules applied), the effect of taxpayers not claiming dependants for PAYE purposes and the effect on refunds of unemployment and part-time employment. Collections of the Health Insurance Levy in respect of all individual taxpayers amounted to $177 million in 1976-77. Income Tax on Other Individuals Collections on assessment of income tax on individuals, at $2525 million, were very close to the Budget estimate of $2532 million. Income Tax-Companies Company income tax collections were $76 million less than the Budget estimate, reflecting a smaller than estimated increase in company incomes in 1975-76 on which tax was paid in 1976-77. Other Taxes, Fees and Fines Other taxes, fees and fines exceeded the Budget estimate by $33 million, mainly reflecting the Government's post-Budget decision to extend the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act beyond 31 December, which added $27 million to estimated receipts. Sale of Existing Assets Receipts under this heading were $6 million less than estimated, principally because of the shortfall in estimated receipts from the sale of A.C.T. leases. The manner in which the deficit in 1976-77 was financed is summarised in the following tables. The first of these tables is the usual presentation of Budget financing transactions, recast to indicate Domestic Borrowings (DB) and its composition. While this presentation is useful for purposes of describing aggregate financing transactions-and in particular the securities (financing instruments) involved in those transactions-it does not bring out the net changes in the holdings of government debt of the several sectors with which the Budget sector transacts. This further information is relevant to analysis of the monetary implications of deficit financing. Portfolio movements, reflecting both net proceeds (subscriptions to new issues less redemptions) and subsequent market transactions in government securities, are shown in the second table; the link between the tables is Domestic Borrowings. As defined here, DB is that portion of the Budget deficit financed by the issue of Commonwealth securities to domestic non-Budget sectors or by the use (running-down) of Commonwealth cash balances with the Reserve Bank.' ' Subject to minor qualifica1 tions, DB thus represents the increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth to domestic non-Budget sectors arising from its budget financing. > (2 Economic effects offinancingtransactions depend importantly on which of the nonBudget sectors hold the stock of government debt. Private sector holdings of Commonwealth debt constitute the bulk of the liquidity base of the economy. (See also footnote (b) to Table 2.). Private sector take-up reflects a large number of factors which impinge on domestic liquidity conditions including the size of DB, official interest rates, the balance of payments outcome and net Reserve Bank lending to the private sector.* ) Other things being equal, take-up of government securities by the non-bank 3 private sector provides an offset to the direct increase in banking sector liquidity and the volume of money that would otherwise have acccompanied an increase in the domestic liquidity base. The second table therefore distinguishes between banks and non-banks and, within each category, the major institutional groups for which it is useful, and possible with available data, to sub-categorise. Changes in debt by main forms of security are also shown. This too is relevant information for the analysis of the economic impact of Budget financing transactions, but a full exposition must go beyond the fairly direct effects reflected in Table 2. Other relevant factors include effects on the maturity structure of the stock of government debt in private portfolios, the level and structure of interest rates and associated expectations.' ' Quarterly data in the format of Table2 are presented in 4 Table 11 of Statement No. 2. (1) See footnote (c) to Table 2. (2) Issue of coin and certain transactions by entities within the Budget sector may affect Domestic Borrowings (as defined), but not the Budget sector's total indebtedness to the non-Budget sector; e.g., sales of securities to the non-Budget sector by such entities are reflected in Table1 as positive entries in 'other financing transactions' and as counterpart negative entries within items in the lower part of the table.

Net Overseas Borrowings In September a loan totalling $242 million was raised on the Euro-dollar bond market in Frankfurt. The proceeds of the loan were applied to the States Grants Housing Assistance program and the States Grants Capital Assistance program, two thirds of the proceeds going to the former and one third going to the latter. Another public loan of $196 million was raised in New York in November and the proceeds applied to advances to the States for capital works. Loan raisings on behalf of the Australian Shipping Commission amounted to $19 million and $2 million was drawn down on existing credits for Qantas. Repayments of previous drawings for Qantas amounted to $21 million and repayments on behalf of TAA totalled $6 million. Other securities to the value of $43 million were redeemed in the USA., UK., Germany and Canada. Repayments of $4 million were made on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Repayments of previous drawings arranged for defence equipment amounted to $28 million in 1976-77. Net Proceeds of Loan Raisings in Australia Australian Savings Bonds raised $736 million in 1976-77; redemptions amounted to $216 million resulting in net proceeds of $520 million. Redemptions of the superseded Special Bonds amounted to $153 million. Four Government public cash and conversion loans in July, October, February and May resulted in loan raisings of $1536 million. Total redemptions and repurchases amounted to $115 million. In the 1975-76 Budget, the Government introduced a scheme of Income Equalization Deposits for primary producers and announced that Drought Bonds were to be discontinued with holders being offered the option of transferring to the new scheme. An amount of $36 million, net of Drought Bonds, was received. States' Domestic loan raisings were $35 million, bringing net proceeds of loan raisings in 1976-77 (excluding Savings and Special Bonds but including Income Equalization Deposits) to $1494 million. Net Change in Treasury Notes on Issue Treasury Notes are the shortest term Government security issued to the public in Australia. As at 30 June 1977, Treasury Notes on issue amounted to $370 million, a decline of $87 million during 1976-77. Other Financing Transactions The major components of this category were net payments of $130 million by the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, representing the employer contributions to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme; $21 million in proceeds from coinage transactions; $25 million received from the Commonwealth Government Superannuation Fund in respect of the liability assumed by the Government for existing pensioners at 1 July 1976; offset by an amount of $38 million representing a reduction in the value of unpresented benefit cheques drawn against the Health Insurance Fund during the year. Residual Financing The Government ran down its cash balances by $27 million during 1976-77. Borrowings from the Reserve Bank during the year amounted to $450 million which was covered by the issue of Treasury Bills. $ million Treasury Notes Other(«) Total Banking SectorTrading Banks -207 92 -115 Savings Banks 12 -144 -132 Other Banking Institutions . . . 4 1 5 Non-Bank Private SectorAuthorized Short Term Money Market Dealers 41 155 114 Life Offices 196 196 Other Groups 33 746 779 Government Sector(b) -114 -114 Reserve Bank(c) 119 1408 1 527 p-preliminary .

For given Domestic Borrowings, increases in such holdings reduce private sector and Reserve Bank portfolios of net government debt. If changes in Government sector holdings are subtracted from Domestic Borrowings, this gives a concept termed Net Domestic Borrowing Requirement by the Reserve Bank, data for which are published quarterly in the Bank's Statistical Bulletin. Subject to a few minor qualifications, this shows the change in indebtedness of the Budget sector to the private sector and Reserve Bank. (c) Includes take-up of Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and other government securities, as well as the Commonwealth Government's use of cash balances. (Such cash balances are an asset of the Commonwealth so that their use increases the net indebtedness of the Budget sector). Table2 indicates that private sector holdings of Government securities increased by $837 million in 1976-77; Treasury Note holdings fell $207 million and other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds and Australian Savings Bonds/Special Bonds) rose by $1044 million. An account of the factors affecting this aggregate movement and the strong seasonal swings in holdings which occurred during the year is found in the Monetary Conditions section of Statement No. 2; Table 11 of that Statement provides relevant data. Banking Sector Aggregate banking sector holdings of government securities declined by $252 million in 1976-77 .comprising falls of $199 million in Treasury Notes and $53 million in other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds). Decreases in the aggregate portfolios of savings and trading banks were about equal but the main change in the books of trading banks occurred in their Treasury Note holdings, which were reduced by $207 million, while savings banks maintained their stock of Notes and ran down other securities by $144 million. Non-Bank Private Sector Private non-bank groups accounted for 48 per cent of Domestic Borrowings. Treasury Note holdings did not change appreciably for the year as a whole although, as can be seen from Table 11 of Statement No. 2, there were marked within-year movements; holdings of other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds and Australian Savings Bonds) were increased by $1,097 million. The bulk of thisriseoccurred in the portfolios of Other Groups which increased by $779 million, of which about half was on account of net subscriptions to Australian Savings Bonds (and Special Bonds). As Table 11 of Statement No. 2 shows, increases were recorded in the total holdings of this group in each quarter. Despite the strong seasonal liquidity downswing during which Other Groups ran down their Note holdings, they accumulated bonds very strongly in the second half of the financial year. Authorized dealers increased their holdings of government debt by $114 million over the year compared with $67 million during 1975-76. Holdings of Treasury Notes declined by $41 million for the year as a whole; dealers built up their portfolios of Notes in the seasonal upswing, especially in the December quarter, and subsequently ran them down. They increased bond holdings heavily in the final quarter ending the year with an accumulation of $155 million. The movement in holdings of Treasury Notes of Life Offices was negligible over the year as a whole. Their portfolio of other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds) rose by $196 million in 1976-77, with a heavy accumulation in the latter part of the year. Reserve Bank Reflecting both the size of the Budget deficit and movements in the portfolios of other sectors, net Reserve Bank holdings of government securities increased by $1527 million. This represented 68 per cent of Domestic Borrowings. This Statement presents details of Budget transactions since 1967-68 in both the national accounting and functional classifications. Traditional presentations of public sector data grew out of the requirement for maintaining Parliamentary control over the authorization of government spending. Information presented in a form suitable for this purpose (e.g. the Appropriation Acts) does not, however, readily lend itself to an assessment of either the economic impact, or the primary objectives and relative priorities of government financial activity. The national accounts classification summarises Budget transactions (outlays, receipts and financing) within a classification framework which is broadly consistent with conventions recommended in the United Nations System of National Accounts. The classification of Budget transactions by economic type clarifies the nature of the transactions between the public sector and the rest of the economy. It provides a consistent framework for the aggregation of Commonwealth, State and local government transactions into consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole and facilitates comparisons with other national accounts data. The functional classification categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. This facilitates decision-making on the nature, extent and relative priorities of Government activities. The functional classification follows the same conventions for the determination of Budget totals as the national accounts classification. Additional information on the two classification systems is given in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. A later section of this Statement refers briefly to the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, and to the total public sector (including State and local government). The following table shows increases in Commonwealth Government Budget outlays in each year since 1967-68, and those outlays expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). It can be seen that total outlays increased much more rapidly than GDP in 1974-75 and 1975-76 but less rapidly in 1976-77.

(p) preliminary (e) Budget estimate The estimated increase of 10.5 per cent in Budget outlays in 1977-78 is expected to imply some further reduction in the ratio of outlays to GDP in the current year. Functionally classified Budget data for the period 1967-68 to 1976-77 are presented in Tables1 and 3 at the end of this Statement; Table2 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by the major functional and sub-functional blocks over this period. Total Budget outlays have grown at an average annual rate of 17.3 per cent over the nine year period to 1976-77. Outlays on some functions, however, have grown much faster, and others much slower, as the table below shows: Increase 1967-68 to 1976-77 Average Proportion Annual of Total Rate of 1967-68 1976-77 Increase Increase% million S million $ million Per cent Per cent Defence 1,065 2,182 1,117 6.2 8.2 Education 172 2,160 1,988 11.1 36.7 Health 360 2,543 2,183 12.2 26.3 Social Security and Welfare 1,039 6,431 5,392 30.1 23.2 Housing(o) 159 549 390 2.2 18.3 Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment 17 251 234 1.3 47.0 Culture and Recreation . 70 257 187 1.0 18.0 Economic ServicesTransport and Communication . 554 989 435 2.4 10.8 Water Supply and Electricity 56 72 16 0.1 4.7 Industry Assistance anl Development 259 206 -53 -0.3 0.8 Labour an' Employment 69 243 174 1.0 13.4 Other Economic Services. 23 91 68 0.4 16.8 Total Economic Services 961 1601 640 3.6 8.7 General Public ServicesLegislative Services 12 63 51 0.3 21.5 Law, Order and Public Safety 18 126 108 0.6 26.5 Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid 160 517 357 2.0 15.2 General and Scientific Research nec 53 185 132 0.7 15.6 Administrative Services 182 725 543 3.0 18.2 Total General Public Services 425 1615 1190 6.6 17.4 Not Allocated to FunctionPayments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief(a) . . . . 1481 5 123 3 642 20.3 14.9 Public Debt Interest. 476 1412 936 5.2 11.2 (a) See Notes on Tables 1, 2 and 3. Comparisons of trends over the period covered in the tables are affected by a number of important factors, including the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, 'offsets' to grants to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefits schemes, changes in the arrangements for funding tertiary education, the introduction of Medibank and family allowances, the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth, and part-funding of the capital program of Australian Telecommunications Commission by borrowings on the domestic capital market. These and other factors must be borne in mind when comparing movements in different categories of expenditure. Average annual rates of increase, which indicate the trend in expenditures over a period, can of course mask significant changes within that period. The charts below show expenditure on major functional blocks as a proportion of total Budget outlays, in each of the past ten years. % OF TOTAL % OF TOTAL 10 5 AND WELFARE Ll 25 1Sr 10 1976197677 77 (a) Outlays on Housing, Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment, Culture and Recreation and Public Debt Interest.

The national accounts for the economy as a whole provide a systematic summary of the transactions that take place within the economy, especially those relating to the production and use of goods and services, and 'to transfers of income or capital between sectors of the economy. By outlining these relationships the national accounts enable analysis of the processes by which production and expenditure are linked. Table4 attached to this Statement shows Budget outlays since 1967-68 classified according to broad national accounts categories. On this basis transfers between different parts of the accounts of the Commonwealth Budget sector are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Budget sector and the rest of the economy, including other levels of government, and overseas. The national accounting presentation, by showing Budget sector transactions 'classified in a form which is broadly comparable with that presented for the economy as a whole in the Budget Paper National Income and Expenditure 1976-77, facilitates analysis of the impact of the Budget on the economy. The following table compares the average annual rates of growth of the main components of outlays with that for gross domestic product (GDP) in the period since 1967-68. 1967-68 TO 1976-77 Per cent Budget outlays: Net expenditure on goods and servicesCurrent 12.6 Capital 16.0 Transfer paymentsCash Benefits to Persons(«) 22.4 Grants to States and Local Government . 23.0 Other 10.1 Net advancesTo States 10 0 To Other Sectors 10.2 Total Budget Outlays 17.3 Gross Domestic Product 14.7 (a) Includes Unfunded Employee Retirement Benefits.

Details of Commonwealth Budget Sector receipts for the period since 1967-68 are presented in Table5 at the end of this Statement. Total Budget receipts have increased at an average annual rate of 16.1 per cent in the period since 1967-68 compared with a 14.7 per cent rate of growth in GDP over the same period. As the following table shows, after increasing very rapidly in 1973-74 and 1974-75 the rate of increase slowed somewhat in 1975-76 and 1976-77; As a Proportion of Budget Receipts Increase on a Year Earlier GDP $ million Per cent Per cent 1967-68 . 5 583 9.7 23.2 1968-69 . 6 228 11.6 23.0 1969-70 . 7 157 14.9 23.9 1970-71 . 8 093 13.1 24.6 1971-72 . 8 913 10.1 24.3 1972-73 . 9 481 6.4 22.6 1973-74 . 11936 25.9 23.5 1974-75 . 15 273 2 .0 25.4 1975-76 . 18 274 19.7 25.8 1976-77 . 21 384 1 .0 26.20>) 1977-78(e). 24 439 14.3 n.a.

By far the most important single category of receipts is income tax on individuals which increased from 39.0 per cent of total receipts in 1967-68 to 51.7 per cent in 1976-77. This increase stems largely from the effects of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in personal incomes, particularly wage and salary incomes. This growth occurred despite adjustments to the rate scale and other elements of the personal income tax system that were made in 1970-71, 1972-73, 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 with a view to reducing rates of tax for most taxpayers. As well as reflecting the introduction of personal income tax indexation the 1976-77 figures were also affected by the abolition of tax rebates for dependent children and students, which accompanied the introduction of family allowances, and the imposition of the Health Insurance levy. Movements in some other categories of receipts are also affected by certain special factors: 'Other General Taxation', for example, is affected by the transfer to the States in September 1971 of pay-roll tax and the decision to abolish broadcast listeners and television viewers licences from September 1974. The Commonwealth Government has incurred overall deficits on its budgetary transactions in each year since 1967-68 (see Table 1). Estimates of the domestic budget result are available only for the years since 1968-69. These estimates are shown in the following table, along with the overall Budget results for the same years; the latter are also expressed as a proportion of GDP: (+ Surplus, Deficit) Total as a Proportion of Domestic Total GDP $ million $ million Per cent 1968-69 . + 201 386 1.43 1969-70 . + 338 191 0.64 1970-71 . + 519 10 0.03 1971-72 . + 405 134 0.36 1972-73 215 709 1.69 1973-74 . + 211 293 0.58 1974-75 1 949 2 567 4.27 1975-76 2 905 -3 585 5.06 1976-77 -1995 2 741 3.37O0 1977-78(e) -1347 2 217 n.a. (p) preliminary (e) Budget estimates The main transactions undertaken to finance the deficits in the Budget over the period have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes and temporary borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Details of these financing transactions are shown in Table6 to this Statement. There is, of course, no single measure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. Although the Budget deficit (or surplus) is often taken as a shorthand or summary measure of Budget impact, its use for this purpose is subject to a number of important qualifications. The deficit measures the difference between outlays and receipts and cannot adequately reflect the differing economic impacts of the components of outlays and receipts. Budget outlays on final goods and services have a more direct impact on demand in the economy than do transfers and advances from the Budget to other sectors; the impact of these latter transactions depend on the spending propensities of the recipients and related timing lags. Similarly, on the receipts side, account must be taken of the varying impact on activity of different taxes and other receipts. Taxes on incomes, for example, influence private demand for goods and services through their effects on the level of disposable incomes; sales taxes on the other hand principally affect private demand through the prices of goods.. Consequently, the 'mix' of Budget revenues, as well as their total size, is a relevant consideration in any assessment of the Budget's overall impact on the economy. It is also important to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions; government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes and the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. The transactions by which the overall Budget deficit (or surplus) is financed are also of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally. An outline of the significance for monetary policy of Budget financing transactions is contained in the relevant section of Statement No. 5. THE BUDGET SECTOR AND OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT Transactions of the Commonwealth Budget greatly influence, both directly and indirectly through transfers to other levels of government and authorities, transactions between all levels of government and other sectors of the Australian economy. Mention is made in the following paragraphs of the relationship between the Budget sector and the total Commonwealth Government sector and between the latter sector and the total public sector. Table7 attached to this Statement sets out national accounts estimates of the main categories of receipts and outlays of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, for the period since 1967-68. This table is prepared by offsetting transfers between the Budget and non-Budget sectors of the Commonwealth Government and consolidating all other transactions, to form a statement of the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, with the other sectors of the economy (including other levels of government). Its preparation is described in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Australian Government Authorities, September 1974. The non-Budget sector may be broadly described as comprising the trading enterprises of the Commonwealth Government other thanfinancialenterprises such as the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Total Commonwealth Government sector outlays have grown at an average annual rate of 17.3 per cent in the period since 1967-68. The Budget component clearly dominates the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole. There are, however, some differences between the relative composition of transactions of the Budget sector and the Commonwealth Government sector. The main difference is that capital expenditure by the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole is significantly greater than for the Budget sector, because authorities outside the Budget finance their capital expenditure from funds provided from the Budget in the form of advances, from their own internally generated funds and particularly in recent years, from non-Budget sources. The following table shows the composition of transactions of the two sectors in 1976-77: Total Commonwealth Budget Government Sector Sector Per cent Per cent of total of total OutlaysNet expenditure on goods and servicesCurrent 19.3 18.6 Capital 2.1 6.3 21.4 24.8 71.7 69.5 Net Advances 6.9 5.6 Total Outlays. . . . 100.0 100.0 Receipts91.9 89.6 7.4 5.4 0.7 5.0 Total Receipts. . . . 100.0 100.0 A statement of the transactions of the total public sector with the other sectors of the economy, is formed by consolidating the transactions of the Commonwealth, State and local governments. Detailed information concerning transactions of the total public sector are given in Budget Paper No. 9, National Income and Expenditure 1976-77, prepared by the Australian Statistician. Although there are some differences in treatment between the Statistician's publication and the presentations adopted in this Statement for the total Commonwealth sector, the information published by the Statistician permits a comparison to be made of relative proportions of total government transactions undertaken by the Commonwealth and the State and local sectors. The charts below show, for recent years, public sector outlays and receipts as a proportion of GDP. The Commonwealth component (excluding Commonwealth grants and net advances to the States) and the State/local government components are also shown. 1971-72 TO 1976-77 (p) 1 STATE Er LOCAL I I % GDP 40 30 r 25 20 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77(p) (p) preliminary TO the extent practical, historical data have been adjusted to eliminate major breaks in series but some important changes affecting comparability cannot readily be removed. At the Premiers' Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth Government would cease to levy pay-roll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own pay-roll taxes as from the same date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73figuresfor outlays and receipts. The transfer arrangements had the effect' of reducing the growth of outlays and receipts below the rate that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional headings, while 'offsetting adjustments' to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account under the functional heading Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief. The assumption in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education by the Commonwealth Government contributed to an increase in outlays classified to Education but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. This means that the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown in the function Education, is somewhat overstated. A similar effect occurred in 1974-75, which was the first full year of the new tertiary education arrangements. Changes in the operation of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect the outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the relevant functions and receipts under the heading Other Taxes, Fees and Fines-Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of the new Commonwealth Superannuation scheme with effect from 1 July 1976 gives rise to similar effects. The Family Allowances scheme introduced in 1976-77 involved the abolition of taxation rebates for dependent children and students, offset by substantial increases in family allowances in place of child endowment. The effect of this measure was to sharply increase the level of outlays under the Social Security and Welfare function in 1976-77, and to increase receipts from personal income taxation, above what they would otherwise have been. To the extent possible, the definitions and concepts adopted for the historical series are the same as those used in Statement No. 3 (although Table3 provides less detail than do the tables in Statement No. 3). Major discontinuities are indicated where appropriate. The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations would be met by the States out of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show these amounts classified to 'Payments to the States, etc' instead of 'Housing'. However, for the purposes of the calculation of the trend rates of growth and the chart of proportions of total outlays, these amounts have been included in the function 'Housing'. Because of revisions in the classification of items to the various functional headings (see Appendix to the Budget Statements) the figures in Tables1 and 3 are not entirely comparable with those given in the Budget documents in previous years.

The purpose of the functional classification is to bring together outlays with like objectives or purposes. In this way the classification aims to present information on the nature of government activities, on the resources devoted to particular objectives and to facilitate assessments of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. Compared with the classification used in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the functional classification has the added advantage of being based on national accounting conventions. There is thus a consistent conceptual basis underlying both the economic classification and the functional classification. This removes a considerable source of confusion which existed in Budget documents prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used-the so-called 'conventional' classification and the national accounting classification. The conventions and principles used in the functional classification are essentially those set out in the publication A System of National Accounts, United Nations, New York 1968. That classification is a widely accepted international standard for the classification of public expenditure by function. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has concurrently adopted these conventions and principles in the documents it publishes on public authority finance. While the major functional headings adopted for Budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Statistician in his publications, it should be noted that the figures published by the Bureau for Commonwealth Government outlays cover both Budget outlays and outlays by Commonwealth Government authorities which operate outside the Budget sector. They therefore differ somewhat from the figures shown for the Budget sector in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the Budget sector is shown in the National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities which is published with the Budget documents. Two further differences should be noted. First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements 'net' of the relevant primary industry levies and charges; these outlays are shown on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, for the years prior to 1974-75, part of the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities operating in Papua New Guinea is classified by the Statistician as foreign aid. In the Budget Statements these outlays are shown under the same functional heading as similar outlays made within Australia. Supplementary information on the functional allocation of these outlays is available in the Bureau's publication Public Authority Finance-Federal Authorities. THE STRUCTURE OF THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION The major functional headings are shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. Brief descriptions of the contents of each function are given below. These descriptions are intended to convey the scope of the outlays included under each heading rather than to be a detailed listing of the contents of each category. Further detail on each function is provided in the body of Statement No. 3. Historical data for the period 1967-68 to 1976-77 are given in Statement No. 6. From an examination of the classification structure set out in the Budget Statements it will be evident that the functional classification is relatively aggregative in nature. On the whole it has not been possible, for example, to dissect the administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them over the particular sub-categories shown under each functional heading. Outlays under each functional heading in the classification have been grouped together into readily identifiable blocks. These blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; rather, they are meant as recognisable and meaningful groupings which lend themselves to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, the main outlay blocks are decidedly more purpose-oriented than was the case with the categories of expenditure identified under the conventional classification used prior to 1973-74. Given the need to produce a continuing and up-to-date record of actual monthly outlays and receipts which is consistent with the overall estimates embodied in the Budget Speech and documents, it has been necessary to work largely within existing central accounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than detailed costing documents. The figures presented, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented where necessary by a limited amount of sub-costing of substantial appropriation items which cover several functions. Functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it will not always be possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. The introduction of the functional classification, however, does not alter the structure of the appropriations or the summaries presented with the Appropriation Bills, such as the document Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure. Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for whioh government outlays are undertaken, it is important to note that such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions. Military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that an outlay be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example above, the primary function is considered to be defence; this is in line with United Nations recommendations. It is not possible, in any single classification system, to focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of expenditure is therefore provided in other documents; for example, details of wage and salary estimates are shown in the document Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure and a separate Budget Paper is provided on Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities. Other supplementary Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech this year deal with the Civil Works Program and Australia's Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries. THE IMPLICATIONS OF ADOPTING NATIONAL ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS The use of definitions of Budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places Budget data on a basis whioh, in the main, is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and can be related to that information. The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of Budget data are set out in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities, September 1974. Concurrent with the introduction of the functional classification in 1973-74, some changes were made to the previous national accounting definitions of outlays, receipts and the deficit, used in the Budget Statements. The more significant of these changes were: (a) net advances to the Australian Wheat Board are now treated as outlay items, rather than financing transactions. This brings the classification of these shortterm advances into line with that accorded to other advances from the budget; (b) purchases of land and existing buildings (including inter-departmental transfers for which a nnanciai adjustment is made) are now treated as outlays rather than offsets to the proceeds from the sale of these assets under a receipts heading. This change permits gross outlays on these assets to be shown under the appropriate functional headings. Other conceptual changes in line with the principles set out in the publication A System of National Accounts were also introduced. These changes relate mainly to the treatment of rents and business enterprise transactions and are indicated in the September 1974 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin. Overall, they do not have a very significant effect on the figures shown for total receipts and total outlays. The adoption of national accounting conventions implies that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech relate to the net transactions of the budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are: (a) the transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to Trust Accounts are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from Trust Accounts is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is made, however, for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where nnanciai adjustments for these transfers are recorded; (b) receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. As mentioned earlier, however, the various primary industry levies and charges which are collected by the Government and applied more or less directly for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, research and promotional activities are offset against the relevant outlays. Other recoveries and repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net outlay figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances to other authorities are offset against the corresponding advances under the same outlay heading. Bringing together the relevant outlays and recoveries or repayments makes it possible to see more readily the extent of financial resources which are directed through the Budget to a particular activity. Other taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like which are of a general revenue nature are treated as receipts items under the heading 'Other Taxes, Fees and Fines'; (c) the operating revenues, net of operating expenses, of activities which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown as receipts items. The current operations of enterprises are therefore reflected in the Budget Statements to the extent that they contribute to general Budget revenues; and (d) certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading 'Public Debt Interest', while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. From time to time, changes need to be made in the functional classification to reflect changes in the organisation and coverage of government activities. The more significant changes made this year are: (a) Children's Services Program. Under this program capital and recurrent assistance is provided to the States for child-care projects (including home care, vacation and after-school care projects) and for pre-schools. The Government has announced that in future increased emphasis will .be placed on the childcare aspect of the program. Some projects, under the program combine both, child-care and pre-school aspects and there is difficulty in obtaining consistent data, over several years, to allow a dissection of expenditure between the-childcare services (which, primarily, serve a Social Security and Welfare purpose) and pre-schools (which, primarily, serve an Education purpose). As a consequence outlays under this program have been reclassified in total from 'Education' to 'Social Security and Welfare'. The associated administrative costs now are included under the General Administration heading in the Social Security and Welfare function. (b) Northern Territory Administration, la the past, Commonwealth expenditures in the Northern Territory have been classified to the relevant functional blocks (health, education, etc.), rather than grouped together under a single Northern Territory heading. On1 January 1977 executive responsibility for some functions, previously administered by the Department of the Northern Territory, was transferred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Funds for these functions are being provided to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in the form of two block amounts, with responsibility for the allocation of these amounts among particular functions residing with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Outlays from the allocations to be provided to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1977-78 have not, therefore, been allocated across the functional headings in Statement No. 3; these amounts have been classified to a new sub-heading 'Allocation to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly' under function 9E 'General Public Services-Administrativ e Services'. Other expenditures by the Commonwealth in or for the Northern Territory, continue to be classified to the relevant function. This treatment of Northern Territory outlays will be revised as the the transition to self-government continues. As a consequence of changed administrative arrangements and problems of data availability, it has been necessary to make some changss in the composition or presentation of the various outlay blocks. Where appropriate these have been footnoted in the tables. Because the functional classification is derived largely from the appropriation accounting system, adjustments to the historical series are constrained by availability of suitable data in that system. In particular, the major changes to departmental administrative arrangements announced in December 1972, June 1974, June 1975, and December 1975, have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent series of outlay aggregates for the periods covered in the Budget Statements. Where possible, the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by sub-costing and regrouping appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies and produce an entirely comparable series. This should be borne in mind when examining the tables in Statement No. 3 and, more particularly, Statement No. 6. For these reasons, considerable care must be exercised when comparing functionally classified data in the 1977-78 Budget Statements with those in Budget Statements for earlier years. The following notes describe briefly the scope of the net outlays encompassed under each functional heading. 1. Defence Outlays on military defence, including outlays to keep the armed services in a state of readiness.
