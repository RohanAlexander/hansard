The overdraft referred to was of a similar nature, though for a larger amount. 7£37»647 (approximate). move That in the opinion of this House the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing Sydney to institute an action for damages from State to S'tate. I make no apology for submitting this motion, because it deals with matters of great importance not only to a large number of producers, but also to a great many workers in the different States, and'to a large body of consumers. It is important also because this Inter-State trade is of very considerable value and is likely to increase. According to the Commonwealth Year-Booh, the apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pineapples, and other fresh fruits which passed between the States durirg 1908, were of the value of ,£550,000. The Inter-State trade, in onions during the same period amounted to something like £114,000, and that in potatoes to £530,000. The article of produce most prominently before us in this regard at present is potatoes. During last session this matter was frequently discussed. Representatives of Tasmania, and of other States, addressed various questions cn this subject to Ministers, and speeches were frequently made by the honourable member for Darwin, myself and others, with the object of inducing the Commonwealth to intervene, and to prevent New South Wales and other States from excluding sound produce, fit for consumption, which had been shipped from Tasmania. We were told that it was a matter for the States themselves, and that there was no room for Federal intervention. Finally a difficulty arose between Victoria and New South Wales, and I pointed out to the 'Attorney-General of the day, that, on the facts disclosed, it would appear that New South Wales was acting unconstitutionally; that she was not only shutting out produce from other States on the ground that it was diseased, and that, therefore, its importation would be a violation of the Vegetation Diseases Act, but that her chief object seemed to be to preserve the local market to local growers, and that produce far inferior to that sought to be introduced from other States was being grown in New South .Wales and consumed in Sydney. lieve that. was the point taken, and the then Attorney General said that if the facts were as stated, New South Wales was acting in an point out, however, that, even if that were so, the Federation could not intervene; that the remedy was for the individual whose produce was rejected at the port of in the High Court against New South Wales. That was a check to further protests by the honourable member for Darwin and myself. VVe could do no more in the circumstances, but towards the close of the session, I brought up a proposal that the work of inspection snould be taken out of the hands of the State authorities and handed over to the Federal authority. It seems to me that the restriction in regard to the Inter-State trade in produce of various kinds warrants Federal intervention. There is at present no certainty to the grower that even sound, wholesome produce grown in Tasmania will be admitted into Victoria, New South Wales or other parts of the Commonwealth. That state of affairs ought not to continue. Surely a man in any of the States should be able to place on the markets of Australia sound produce raised by him. Unless that can be done no encouragement will be given the small farmer. There is, moreover, no guarantee at the present time that produce, however good, produced in one State will be received in another. New Soudi Wales and Queensland are now admitting producefrom Tasmania on terms that suit themselves. They can shut down on importations of potatoes and other produce from Tasmania whenever they please. Such a condition of uncertainty ought to be removed. At present, if a farmer in Tasmania wishes to introduce potatoes into Victoria, he has to prove not only that they are sound, but that they were grown at least half-a-mile from any infected area. In the case of Western Australia, he has to show that they were produced at least 50 miles from any infected area. It is estimated by those engaged in the trade that farmers on the north-west coast of Tasmania lost last year'£20,000 In respect of the Western Australian market alone. That market used to take something like 2,500 sacks of potatoes per week, and, very often, when the eastern market was over-supplied it relieved the tension, and enabled prices to be kept at something like a fair rate.",16,Financial Relations Commonwealth And States Trust Funds

47,Mr Page,The honourable member,18,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To
48,Mr Atkinson,"No one is askingone State and rejected by the inspector of another; and if the State to which it is sent is known to have a good local supply, those forwarding the stuff feel that it is rejected, not because it is unsound, but because there is a desire to exclude it from the markets of the State to which it has been consigned. There is nothing Federal in such a feeling as rhat, and some remedy ought to be applied; and for that reason I am asking the statesmen on the front benches to do the right thing. Section 92 of the Constitution provides for InterState Free Trade, but, as things are, I submit that we have not that Free. Trade which we all expected when we entered the Union. Then section 109 of the Constitution says that where a State law conflicts with the Federal law, the Federal law shall prevail ; and, taking these two sections together, I am of opinion that under the Constitution the Commonwealth has power to undertake the work of inspection, and to exercise sufficient control to see that the tralia and in New South Wales, potatoes produce that is passed is sound before it is permitted to go on the market for sale. Section 13 of the Quarantine Act of 1908, provides for proclamations on various matters by the Governor General; but that Act does not, I think, cover the groundit does not go far enough. However, the late Attorney-General, the honourable member for Angas, gave an opinion which I am sure will receive the greatest respect from all members of the House; and to that opinion I invite attention. It was given on a question arising out of some proclamation or regulations concerning a vine trouble in South Australia; and, though the main part of the opinion does not concern the question I am dealing with, it shows at the end, if I understand aright, that according to the learned gentleman, the Quarantine Act does not at present give us the power I desire in regard to inspection, but that, under the Constitution, we may take the power by simply amending the Act. That is the. procedure I suggest the Government should adopt. very large powers under the Quarantine Act, but they do not represent anything like all the powers we possess. much power under the Quarantine Act. power regarding the matter of which I am speaking as it should have, ancl, as I hope, soon will have. I clo not wish action to be taken without a consultation with the State authorities. Possibly after such consultation some amicable arrangement may be arrived at; but the matter is of such importance to producers and consumers alike, that, if the States will not meet us, this Parliament should take action in the interests of Australia. If this is done, we shall insure the security and stability of producers who grow good, sound, marketable stuff, in every way fit for human consumption. There would be no risk of the greater dissemination of disease, because Federal inspection will be as rigid and efficient as that of the States, and possibly many of those who are now acting as inspectors for the .States will be engaged to do the same work for the Commonwealth. WhatI propose will secure a more constant supply of good food for the poor. Last year several members complained that their constituents were suffering because of the high price of potatoes and other nutritious foods of that kind. Owing to the severity of the regulations in force in Western Auswere then at a very high figure in both Perth and Svdney. The poor of New South Wales had to buy from local growers potatoes inferior to the stocks imported from Tasmania which were being rejected by the inspectors. It is the poor who are least able to help themselves, and we therefore should give consideration to means for supplying them with cheap and good food. We should also regard the interests of those who work on the wharfs, and of the growers of produce and those whom they employ. The action I suggest would tend to remove the bad feeling engendered when the authorities of one State refuse to admit the produce of another. The State whose marketable commodities are rejected feels that it is being unfederally treated, and it should be our object to do all that is possible to ""strengthen the Federal feeling. WhatI propose will promote the harmonious relations of the States. tion. regard this as a very important motion, though the remarks of the mover make it appear that he thinks more of protecting the interests of the Tasmanian growers of too potatoes than of effecting the good of the community. He complains that Tasmanian potatoes imported into New South Wales have been condemned by the inspectors of the latter State, but he also said that if the inspection. of produce passing from State to State were undertaken by the Commonwealth, some of the present inspectors would, in all probability, be",18,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To

Now, if the present State inspectors are not efficient, surely they ought not to be. appointed to do Commonwealth work. I believe that the inspection of imported potaWales inspections were made for the purtoes has been very rigid in New South Wales, and that the potatoes refused admittance were rejected because found to be suffering from Irish blight. That justified their rejection. The honourable member for Wilmot contends that Irish blight is to be found in all the States. in them all, that furnishes a stronger reason taken with the desire of preventing the imwhy action should be taken by the local authorities to reject diseased importations. not prevent that. system one State can prevent another from dumping inferior produce into its markets. inember think it right that New South Wales should charge five or six times as much for the inspection as it actually costs? charges was not mentioned by the honourable member for Wilmot, to whose speech I am replying. member contended that the inspection of produce passing from State to State should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. I am surprised that a member of the party which is always charging the Labour party with being unificationists should ask us to take a'step towards unification. powers given to this Parliament by the Constitution shall be exercised. member is asking for the exercise of powers of which we have not yet availed ourselves. He wishes us to take from the States the right to exclude produce which their authorities declare to be unsound. That surely is an interference with the powers of the States, and a step towards unification. In my opinion, we have already enough to do. Let us put our house in order before we take over powers which we have not yet .exercised. At the time to which the honourable member referred, Irish blight was less prevalent in New South Wales than in any of the other States, but it was discovered that it had made its appearance in the Richmond district because the seed potatoes used there had been imported. That in itself was justification for the rigid inspection of all importations. The honourable member said that the New South pose of protecting tlie local market. the impression in the mind of the public. impression. Does the honourable member think that a Government would prohibit the importation of such things as potatoes to make the price dearer to consumers? The action taken in New South Wales was portation of diseased potatoes. If diseased potatoes were imported wholesale, and used for seed, Irish blight would spread throughout the States. propose would be as rigid as that which now exists. member has said that the Commonwealth would engage the services of the present inspectors. so. member told us that one consignment rejected in New South Wales was returned to Tasmania, rebagged there, and then sent back again to Sydney, where it was accepted. Are not those facts evidence that some inspector did not know his duty? When produce has been rejected, it should not be possible for it to be sent back again and passed. I cannot see what is to be gained by giving the control of this inspection to the Commonwealth, if the existing inspectors are to be used. Apparently the honourable member desires, not so much to benefit the public, as to extend the market for the producers in Tasmania. the honourable member's electorate? object to the honourable member looking after the interests of his constituents, but otlier honourable members must have regard to the interests of the public at large, and uphold a system which tends to prevent the spreading of disease. The honourable member seems to think that anything grown in Tasmania should be accepted by every other State, but I hold that the inspection of produce passing from State to State cannot be too rigid, because all steps must be taken to prevent the spread of, and, if possible, to eradicate, disease.

In the interests of those men it is necessary that we should take every precaution to prevent diseased potatoes being supplied to them for seed purposes. the House would be doing right at this juncture in carrying a motion of this kind. The question is a big one, and has received consideration at the hands of the State Premiers or Ministers of Agriculture. ferent systems. certain arrangements in regard to the matter and have tried to work amicably. I hope they will be able to formulate some system which will be acceptable to all concerned. Whilst there is perhaps something in the honourable member's contention that, with Commonwealth control, there would be no bickerings, I do not think the time is ripe for us to interfere. It is a matter for the States, which have their own systems of inspection. If the States consider it necessary fo prevent the importation of any article of produce that may be detrimental to their own people, they have the right to do so, and, so far as the people in the particular State which takes action are concerned, they are the sufferers. The people of New South Wales suffered considerably and paid considerably more for their produce during the time that the importation of potatoes from Victoria and Tasmania was barred. There was sufficient pressure brought to bear on the Minister of Agriculture for New South Wales by the public at that time to induce the Government to let the potatoes in, and, if they could possibly have admitted them, they would readily have done so, because of the high' price that the people had to pay. I can assure the honourable member for Wilmot that, so far as New South Wales is concerned, there is no foundation for his belief that the importations are shut out for the purpose of keeping the local marRet. New South Wales has a better Federal spirit than that, and the Government took action simply because they had to protect the growers and prevent disease from becoming rampant within their borders. I am against the motion at present, and, if necessary, shall vote against it. The honourable member for Wilmot has merely exercised his right as the representamere evasions of the principle of Intertive of one of the districts of Tasmania in bringing this very important question under the attention of the House, because we are all aware that last year the subject of Inter-State trade, particularly in the matter of potatoes, was frequently brought before the House by the members for Tasmania, who complained that Tasmanian Consequently I do not think producers and traders were not receiving fair play in some of the Australian markets. ment of which the honourable member was a member give them that fair play and justice which he says that they demanded? drawing attention to those complaints. I am not at present saying that the method proposed to be. adopted by the honourable member for Wilmot, as embodied in the motion, is the correct one, but any member has a right to bring under the attention of the House complaints of the kind, to see whether the Constitution provides a remedy, or whether there are other legal remedies which ought to be resorted to. Whilst, no doubt, Tasmanian growers have complained of the treatment they have received, the question is still open to argument as to whether they have not a proper legal remedy for the redress of their grievances in the Federal Courts. The honourable member suggests in the motion that the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce. I do not think, as a matter of constitutional law, that the Commonwealth at present can take over the right of inspection, because, by the Constitution, the right of inspection in Inter-State trade is reserved to the several States. At the same time, even under the Constitution, no State can defeat the principle of InterState Free Trade by fraudulently or improperly imposing inspection laws. I think if any State endeavours, under the pretended exercise of the inspection powers, to interfere with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade, a remedy exists at the present time without any amendment of the Constitution. During the controversy last year, I suggested to the honourable member for Darwin, when he brought the matter before the House, that the remedy of the State or the producers of Tasmania lay in challenging, in the Federal Courts, the inspection laws of Victoria or New South Wales, on the ground that they were excessive or unfair, and State Free Trade. That is quite clear under the Constitution of the United States, and equally clear under our own. In",20,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To

There are -numerous remedies open to us without making such a fundamental and organic alteration as is proposed in this motion. -As a representative of a little State, much concerned in the export of her products, I wish briefly to address myself to this important question. It was my intention to move in the matter as soon as I became possessed of certain knowledge, which I could not obtain without consulting the legal fraternity, and I was heartily glad when I learned that the honourable member for Wilmot proposed to take action. Tasmania is suffering considerably owing to the restrictions placed upon her produce by the other States of the Union. I wish at this stage to put the House right as to my competency to speak to a question of this kind. When I was addressing the House a few days ago the honourable member for Franklin was good enough to interject, "" What does the honourable member know of the land question?"" From that interjection it might be assumed that it was presumption on my part to deal with this matter. I wish, however, to tell the honourable member for Franklin and the Hobart Mercury that I was brought up on the land, and know the North Coast well. If the honourable member will accompany me to the farm carried on by my uncle at Burnie, he will find in that gentleman a farmer who is also an expert in diseases affecting potatoes. Mr Laird informed me, on the occasion of a visit that I recently paid to him, that he hoped in a very short time to be able to produce a blight-proof potato. He is now conducting experiments, and hopes to bring them to a successful issue. Honourable members wiil recognise, therefore, that I do know a little of the farming industry. honourable member has an uncle on a farm does not make him an expert. lowed the plough, during my school holidays, and engaged in planting potatoes in order to find the money necessary for the purchase of books to complete my education, I think it will be admitted that the honourable member's interjection is quite beside the mark. I make no apology for earning an honest living. Franklin ought to apologize. ought to do so. I should like to see how he would get on if he had to follow the plough. The people of Tasmania are of opinion that the products of that State are being excluded from other, States of the Union, not because they are diseased, but",21,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To

It would be impossible for local men to influence a Commonwealth officer, as they do influence a State officer. cessive restrictions placed upon them. I Only the other day a press representative was before a Tasmanian Court for having made, through the press, certain statements to the effect that the then Premier of Tasmania, Captain Evans, had visited the wharfs, and interfered with the inspection of fruit, against the will of the State inspector. Parochial influences are exercised in every State, and we wish to remove them. Tasmania entered into the Federation believing that there would be Free Trade between the States. Can it be said that InterState Free Trade exists when the farmers of one State are able, through the State Government, to bring influence to bear upon inspectors to secure the condemnation of certain products from another State? Such a condition of affairs is most unjust. The Commonwealth is better able to secure efficient inspection than the States are. The honourable member for Wilmot has made out a very good case, and I hope that his motion will receive the support that it deserves. I shall certainly vote for it. -This question is not new to the House, It arose in the first instance owing to tlie action taken by New South Wales in regard to produce exported from Queensland to that State. When the Reid-McLean Administration was in power a regulation was passed in New South Wales precluding from the port of Sydney all agricultural produce from Queensland. That regulation was framed because one or two cases of bubonic plague had occurred in Brisbane, and produce from Queensland, although it never went near Brisbane, or within the infected area, was absolutely excluded. A protest was made against this action, and on behalf of several bodies concerned I addressed a letter on the subject to the Minister of Trade and Customs. It was pointed out in the correspondence that if a State, under the guise of exercising its inspection laws, was really prohibiting far beyond the area necessary for its purposes the importation of produce from another State, it was enforcing to an unreasonable degree the police powers reserved to it, and acting contrary to the principles of the Constitution. afterwards the State authorities of New South Wales relaxed that rule, and regulations were made to try to meet the specific grievance that had to be faced. Recently we had the same trouble in regard to the export of fruit from Brisbane, bananas sent from Queensland to this State having exshould like to say, in passing, that we ought not too hurriedly to condemn the action of the States in this regard, because the industries of a State represent the livelihood of the people, and some of these insect pests, if allowed to spread, would destroy its primary interests. It therefore becomes absolutely necessary for a State to exercise, in the first instance, perhaps, with excessive zeal, its powers in this regard, in order that its industries may be protected from destruction. There is, however, no justification for the continuous use of the power in such a way as practically to exclude the produce of another State from its legitimate market. tines whole areas within its own boundaries. In Queensland, for instance, under the Tick Act, there is power to proclaim different parts of the State as prohibited areas. The honourable member for Brisbane will bear out my statement that one cannot move from place to place within those areas without taking what are certainly proper, but, at the same time, extraordinary, precautions. The question was again raised by the honourable member for Parramatta in connection with the export of fruit from New South Wales to Western Australia. On that occasion the complaint was not as to the actual inspection, but as to the excessive inspection fees charged. The State authorities of Western Australia were not displaying that broad Federal spirit that we should have expected had they been led by the right honourable member for Swan, and they imposed inspection charges that were about the same as the import duties passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. The matter was brought prominently before the House, and the honourable member for Franklin was among those who urged that action ought to be taken . The Common1 wealth Government immediately drew the attention of the Government of Western Australia to these excessive charges, and, although the fact may not have been expressly mentioned, we recognised that we had power under the Constitution Shortly to claim all fees that were paid, over and above the amount actually necessary to cover the cost of inspection.",23,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To

House of seventy-five members. the Quarantine Bill was before us there was a general consensus of opinion that the Commonwealth powers in regard to the quarantine, both of animals and goods, should be confined to oversea importations. We acted in accordance with tiiat expression of opinion. It was felt that we had a reserve power to intervene at any time, and that that power should, if necessary, be exercised. It was a moot question, however, as the honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out, as to the extent to which our power to regulate Inter-State Trade would enable us to interfere with the reserve police powers vested in the States; but the balance of opinion was that the Commonwealth had power to take the action I have mentioned, so far as Inter-State trade is concerned. That power is exercised freely, and with advantage, by the United States of America, and I believe that we enjoy it to an exactly similar extent. For the time being, however, if the States are willing, as they appear to be, judging by the result of the recent Conference in regard to diseases affecting potatoes, to bring their regulations into conformity, we should give them an opportunity to do so. If it should appear that they are not prepared to do so, and that they are going to exercise their powers to an unreasonable degree, the Commonwealth power should be brought into operation; but until such an intention on their part is shown, however, I do not think we should take action.

I , for one, agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs that the Federal Government should be very reluctant to interfere, in cases of this kind. We When should do all in our power to induce the States to carry out the inspection laws and the quarantining of goods in a manner not so harsh as in some cases in the past.

It will be remembered that certain States have not only shut out the produce of other States, but have, in many cases, quarantined areas within their own boundaries. I heard from the Minister of Agriculture of Victoria last week that in the electorate, I think, of the honourable member for Flinders, a whole area had been quarantined on account of disease having appeared on a little patch in one gully. that the farmer himself did not know the disease' was there, but he and his neighbours have all to suffer on that account. If the farmers of the north-west of Tasmania have undergone any hardship, they are not alone, though that, of course, is not much consolation; at any rate, they know that the laws of the various States are enacted for the purpose of endeavouring to free Australia from disease.

If any honourable member will bring under my notice exorbitant charges or unfair regulations, either I myself or any other Minister concerned will be glad to assist in having the Constitution interpreted as was intended, so as to make Inter-State commerce absolutely free. some steps to inquire into the particular subject of the motion? 1 am glad this matter has been brought before honourable members. On many occasions it has been discussed j and the Minister of Trade and Customs is quite correct in saying that at one time the Government of Western Australia imposed such charges on the introduction of fruit especially, as to amount to a prohibitive protective duty. I then considered it only right to bring the matter under the notice of the Federal Government of the day; and thereupon the Government of Western Australia were distinctly told that they must not levy charges beyond the actual cost of inspection. In New South Wales the question has arisen again ; and here I must say that I always speak of that State with the very greatest gratitude. AVe cannot forget that in the pre-Federation days good old New South Wales opened her ports to Tasmania, and traded with us when other and closer States shut out everything that we produced. To-day Sydney is unquestionably the best market Tasmania possesses. It may surprise honourable members to learn that Tasmania will this year ship to Sydney, including, of course, the transhipped Queensland trade, as many apples as are shipped to London, namely, half-a-million bushels. ""It will be seen, therefore, that, as I say, New South Wales is our best neighbour and our best market; but, at the same time, the Government of that State insist on a system which is distinctly unfair to the producers. manded that there should be one inspection at the port of export and another at the port of entry. The majority of honourable members, if not all, will, I think, agree that there should be left in the hands of any State the most full and complete power to prevent the importation of rotten or diseased produce from one State to another, with the inevitable loss and spread of desolation. But we contend that an inspection at the port of entry is all [16] that is necessary, and that New South Wales could best defend her produce and her industries by inspection at her own ports. The same applies to other States; but the position which the New South VVales Government have taken up is that, unless the produce sent from Tasmania is accompanied by an export certificate, it must be treated in a very much more severe way, thus making the cost exceedingly heavy. For months we have been endeavouring to get the Minister of Agriculture of New South Wales to regard this matter in the same light as it is regarded by the Governments of other States-to agree that the charges levied for the inspection shall be no more than the actual cost. As a matter of fact, New South Wales is charging fees which are enormously in excess of the cost of inspection, and is thereby making a profit; whereas the argument of the Minister of Agriculture is that the Department is being run at a loss, and cannot afford any reduction. Government there soon! to go into that question. It will be. of distinct advantage to the Governments who are dealing with this matter to know that the subject has received the attention of the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament. As to the constitutional aspect, I have here tlie paper which, at my request, was laid on the table of the House, containing the opinion of the late Attorney General, the honourable member for Angas, who has dealt with tlie subject at considerable length, and with the pains he bestows on all he undertakes. It may be interesting to read this paper, giving that honourable gentleman's deliberate opinion, in which he shows quite conclusively that the Federal Government has full power to deal with the matter, so long as the whole question is taken into consideration. That opinion is published in a Parliamentary paper available to honourable members, and I suggest that they For instance, it is degive it consideration I hope that the Governments of the States will take notice of this discussion, and recognise that if they continue to place restrictions on InterState trade which harass and embarrass the producers of any State, a higher authority may intervene to prevent this injustice. It is well known that it is practically impossible to obtain in Victoria, to-day a Queensland banana which can be termed eatable, because the State regulations for the prevention of the introduction",26,Produce Unconstitutional Manner He Went On To

The object of Federation was to secure the freest exchange of products between all parts of Australia, and if , by exorbitant charges and unfair regulations, Governments or officials place an embargo on Inter-State Free Trade, the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth will be invoked to give full play to the Federal spirit, which should never have been thwarted. adjourned.

The provisions of the Bill are so simple that honourable members will have no difficulty in expressing their opinions concerning them with brevity, and I hope that the second reading may be agreed to during the sitting.

The State of Western Australia is to receive also for the first year an Queensland, but also the conadditional £250,000, but in each subsequent year this special allocation is to be progressively diminished by £10,000. One-half of the amount of these special payments is to be debited to all the States, including AVestern Australia', in proportion to the number of their people, the Commonwealth paying the remaining half. There is a proviso to give effect to the agreement between the Governments of the States and our predecessors that those States which paid old-age pensions should contribute jointly with the other States to the deficit of the last financial year in the ratio of three to two. It is, therefore, provided that for the financial year ending 30th June, 1911, the following amounts shall be deducted from the payments to the States concerned:-Ne w South Wales, ^178,973 j Victoria, £143,092 ; Queensland, £63,788 ; South Australia, £30,529; AVestern Australia, £20,113; "" d Tasa mania, £13,505. These sums total £450,000, which is approximately what the amount of the deficit on the Commonwealth accounts for the financial year ending 30th June last will be. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Unde r what authority will these deductions be made? made in the exercise of the powers vested in this Parliament. What greatly influenced Ministers, and especially myself, in the adoption of this provision was the agreement between the representatives of the Governments of the States and the representatives of the last Commonwealth Government to do what we provide for. In conference, those representatives expressed their willingness to' do this, and made their intention plain in a document which they all signed. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Can we provide for these deductions without an amendment of the Constitution? powers us to legislate regarding the manner in which the Customs and Excise revenue shall be distributed after the ist January next.

It providesThe Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or applv to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of thc number of the people of the State. In my opinion, that covers the legal difficulty which the honourable member for Flinders has raised. Mr W. constitutional question that was raised. question does not arise. We propose that from the ist July of this year, for a period of ten years, the Commonwealth shall pay to the States 25s. fer cafita, and pay it annually. Mr W. H .

EDWARDS -It anticipates the. constitutional provision by six months. .than I look if I thought that we could pay less than three-quarters of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the States during the first six months of the current financial year. I am under no such hallucination. But, at the same time, it is, I presume, a right thing for this Parliament to pay that amount during the first half of the financial year, and then during the second half arrange the payments in such a way as to enable the net 25s. fer cafita to have been paid to the States during the whole of the financial year. Mr G. Bill says, and what the Government mean to do. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The provision was for monthly settlements, on the three-fourths basis, for the rest of the current calendar year. [ , 6 ] -2 is not on sound ground even in that matter. The High Court has held that it need not necessarily be an exact balance. It has never hinted that it would be wrong or unjust for the Federal Parliament to pay more than the monthly balance. That is all that we propose to do. We say that if the States insist upon their legal rights net Customs and Excise revenue during the first six months of the current financial year-it shall be paid to them. But I venture to say that it is not asking too much of them, and it would not be an exceptionally generous act on their part, if the State Governments came forward boldly in their Parliaments and said, "" The Commonwealth has taken over large obligations, including old-age pensions and defence, which are absolutely necessary, and has relieved us of that great load, and we are therefore prepared to allow the Federal Parliament to take all the amount above 25s. fer cafita during the whole of the financial year beginning on the ist July, doing nothing more than they pledged themselves to do, and endeavoured, on the platform, to induce the people to consent to. done by Act of Parliament. would have to go to their Parliaments; but there would be nothing wonderfully generous in their doing it. posal of the Government means that the States will get considerably less than 25s. fer cafita in the second half of the financial year. have been explaining that for the last ten minutes.

Commonwealth and State between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the several States. In the public interests of the people of Australia, to secure economy and efficiency in the raising and the spending of their revenues, and to permit their Governments to exercise unfettered control of their receipts and expenditure, it is imperative that the nnancial relations of the Federal and State Government-whic h under the Constitution were determined only in part, and for a term of years-shoul d be placed upon a sound and permanent basis. It is therefore agreed by the Ministers of State of the Commonwealth and the Ministers of the Component States in conference assembled to advise :1. That to f u l f il the intention of the Constitution, by providing for the consolidation and transfer of State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock, a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the auestion of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue moneys. 2. That in order to give freedom to the Commonwealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise, and to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall after the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, pay monthly to the States a sum calculated at the rate of One pound five shillings per annum per head of population according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, I think that language is similar to that contained in our Bill3. That in recognition of the heavy obligations incurred in the. payment of Old age Pensions, the Commonwealth may, during the current financial yearThat is, the financial year which closed on the 30th June lastwithhold from the moneys returnable to the States such sum (not exceeding Six hundred thousand pounds) as will provide for the actual shortage in the revenue at the end of the said year. If such shortage amounts to Six hundred thousand pounds the basis of contribution by the States shall be Three shillings per head of population in the Pension States (viz., New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland)The States that were paying old-age pensions prior to the Commonwealth taking reply to that is the over that burdenand Two shillings per head of population in the Non-pension States (viz., and Tasmania). If such shortage be ON COMMONWEALTH AND STATE less than Six hundred thousand duced proportionately per head of Finance -Agreement population as between the Pension and the Non-pension States. 4. That, in view of the large contribution to the Customs revenue fer cafita made by the State of Western .Australia, the Commonwealth shall (in addition to the payment provided for in paragraph No. 2) make lo such State special annual payments, commencing at Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the financial year One thousand nine hundred and ten and One thousand nine hundred and eleven, and diminishing at the rate of Ten thousand pounds per annum. The Commonwealth shall in each year deduct on a f er cafita basis from the moneys payable to the States of the Commonwealth an amount equal to one-half of the sum so payable to the State of Western Australia. 5.

That to meet the case where it is proved that Inter-State competition exists in industrial matters which is unfair, and the State tribunals have failed to grant relief, the Parliaments of the States should agree to vest the Commonwealth with the power to adjust the grievance complained of. 4.

That completes the official record of the but, on the contrary, regard it as very agreement entered into between the Prenecessary. miers of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth as presented to this Constitution. Parliament, and it shows clearly the position that was taken up. One advantage of the early introduction and passing of such that any Treasurer will, as a result, be a measure as this is that it will enable the unduly embarrassed. State Premiers to know practically what amount of revenue they will annually revision. ceive. Each State Treasurer will have only to learn from the statistics what is likely able to avoid the raising of technicalities to be the population within the borders of elsewhere. his State on 31st December of each year in order to be able to determine what his stand such a proposition by the Opposition, returns from the Commonwealth will be. but not by the Government. A simpler method could not well be devised. There is yet another advantage to be stated. The Constitution provided that five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs and Excise the Parliament of the Commonwealth should have power to determine the distribution of the surplus revenue. As I have pointed out before, this Parliament did pass a Surplus Revenue Bill, and, on the passing of this measure, that, shall I say disturbing, feature of the procedure under the Constitucaused a great deal of annoyance and trouble as between the States, will be entirely set aside. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The trouble in regard to Inter-State certificates. tem involves Inter-State certificates in relation to the transfer of goods between State and State.

That may be so; but if we assure tb the States this return for ten years, they cannot, in justice, complain of the Commonwealth seeking necessary revenue in other fields, whether in competition with them or not. At any rate, in dealing with the proposal before us, let us examine it from every point of view. To look ten years ahead, with all the fluctuations that may take place in the Tariff revenue, is very venturesome; but it is done with a' desire to give some stability and security our path to-day is smoothed, not of revenue to the States, and if this Bill be passed, I am sure it will be for the safety and to the credit and honour of all concerned. -Government deserve to be congratulated on having chosen this as their first measure for submission to Parliament. The sooner it is dealt with and disposed of, the sooner the feeling of security, which the Prime Minister desires, will spread throughout the Commonwealth. All of its citizens, as we have occasion to remind ourselves, control two Governments, two separate agencies, through which they carry out their desire's. They have complete control. Their fingers are on the stops of both organs, and it is for them to say through which they prefer to express their -will. that their representatives in each Parliament should, as far as possible, come into harmony. a clear and definite understanding in -order that those, who are the masters of both bodies, may judge each by its own actions, and the two together by their success in co-operating to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have acted wisely in making this their first measure, since it brings us into line on finance. I do not apprehend that its discussion need detain us at any greatlength, though it is a measure of such extreme moment that no consideration which we can devote to it, can be deemed undue. At the same time, we have to realize that the public have been informed-so far as it is possible for members of Parliament, the press and other agencies to inform them-of the nature of this particular financial issue which forms the base of the whole of the government of Australia-governmen t in the ' Commonwealth and government in the States alike. The Prime Minister has reminded us several times that this question, after having been exhaustively discussed, has been de : eided by the people of Australia. But he must not forget that the majority who registered their decision upon ita decision which is likely to affect our history for a longer time than any of us can foie see-was , aftet all, a majority of only 25,000 out of a vote of 1,300,000. These figures show how comparatively -closewas the division between the electorswho took different views of the Financial Agreement submitted to them. However, only by that decision, but by the fact that the proposition which the Government are submitting is fbr the term indicated, namely, ten years, precisely the proposition for which we have just been contending in the country. To that proposal there can be no possible objection urged by any honourable member on this side of _ the Chamber, since, I believe, every member of the Opposition, without exception, was pledged to the payment by the Commonwealth to the States of 25s. per head. VVe regarded that amount as a fair return to the States from the Customs and Excise revenue of Australia-as an equitable proportion enabling them to fulfil their share of what may be reasonably termed national duties. I propose to pass by the whole range of argument as to what Hence, above all, it is desirable those duties are, or as to the way iri which that sum was arrived at after exhaustive They should maintain discussion, simply because it is not possible for any of us to take exception tb the amount in question. It would be idle to question the period of ten years further than to say that, as that limitation postpones the further settlement of this. important I think, therefore, issue for a decade, we must necessarily -and we can safely-trus t the electors of that time, and their representatives', to arrive at the decision which will seem' to them in the light of their fuller knowledge most just to all the interests of the.

A proposition has been submitted by the Government",34,Quarantine

On what ground then ought exception to be taken to the motion for the second reading of this Bill? I doubt if there stitution. The people did not approve of be anything to which we must demur, save, perhaps, the form of the measure, and even that is capable of being discussed quite as effectively, probably more so, in Committee. Still this question having been broached by the Prime Minister, and followed up by him in replying to interjections, it may be as well lo put to him the view which is entertained by honourable members upon this side of the Chambera view which, so far as I have been able to gather, he has not quite appreciated. We quite recognise the strength of the case submitted by the honourable gentleman for some concessions in his favour. If we were concerned ""with the framing of some new contract or agreement, the i l lustration whicli he drew from the agreement proposed by the late Government might be apt, and his argument could be made reasonable. But we are not dealing with any such state of affairs. The Prime Minister was good enough to read the full text of that agreement. visable to do so."" we have endeavoured to point out to him by interjection-a n honourable arrangement, which was the result of a great deal of bargaining, arrived at after ' protracted and severe argument upon both sides. It represented an agreement to which the then representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Premiers were able to subscribe. It provided for the return to the States by the Commonwealth of 25s. per head for so long a period as the people should retain it in the Constitution, provided that they first placed it there. In consideration of that payment, the States agreed to find certain money with which to finance the Commonwealth over the difficulties into which we had knowingly plunged ourselves by introducing a system of old-age pensions in anticipation of the time when our revenue would enable us to pay them, and before the period, even though we retained our surplus revenue from year to year, when we should have command of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. tion we undertook obligations which left us sorely in need of money during this financial year. The States consented to assist us to meet the deficit which would inevitably occur in consideration of an agreement for the payment to them of 25s. per head being submitted to the people, and if approved by them, embodied in the Conthat agreement, which has consequently been set aside. Now the Prime Minister wishes, in a rather unusual fashion, to adhere to the concessions promised conditionally by the States-a t which they arrived for a certain consideration which to them seemed adequate. He offers them something which at the time of our Conference they refused to consider an adequate recognition of the financial sacrifices they were prepared to make. In other words, something which they then rejected is being thrust upon them by the Prime Minister, as if they were under an obligation to accept it now. The whole point at issue is, where is their obligation? The Prime Minister is entitled to ask anything he may think fair. He. believes his proposal is fair, and has advanced reasons why he thinks so. But unless he can convince the representatives of the States that it is fair, that is of no use. He has .no right to treat it from the stand-point of any relation to a past bargain, but only from that of its relation to a present bargain. His one argument was that more than one State Premier has said that some advantage would accrue to the States from limiting the arrangement to a ten years' period, which would not follow from the agreement they made with the late Government. If the agreement which we endorsed had been accepted by the people, it would have been possible at the next election for the country-if it had changed its mind in the interim-to reverse its verdict. It could alter the amount to be returned per capita by the Commonwealth, namely, 25s., or, indeed, alter any other portion of that agreement. But under the Bill which is now before us, the State Premiers will sit safe at all events until ten years have expired. Consequently, they gain something from a limitation of the agreement to a ten years' period which they would not have gained under the agreement made with the late Government. On the other hand, they would say that the agreement with us, in their opinion, possessed other and greater advantages which that he now proposes does not posOf our own volisess.

Were it not for the curious implication of the Prime Minister that the States are under some obligation to approve this proposal, I should not have detained the House by even a casual reference to the matter. He seems to think that, by giving effect to the policy which his party submitted to the people, and to which he is therefore committed, he is placing the States under an obligation. That being his case, he is sure to be met with the retort, "" You are merely carrying out what you have pledged yourself to do, while asking us to agree to something we refused to sanction because it was inimical to our interests. You wish to throw this provision into the form of a fresh contract, as if displaying great genefrom whom he asks it. rosity on your part, but really placing us in a worse position. You can dictate your own terms, as if ignoring your pledge to your constituents."" That is a view which appears not to have suggested itself to the honourable gentleman, and which, were I the Premier of a State, I should feel bound to submit. It also puzzles me, as a Federal representative, that the Government should have drafted the Bill in so curious a fashion as to suggest that it is attempting to alter that provision of the Constitution which requires the Commonwealth to return to the States, until the 31st December next, three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Of course, the Bill does not amend the Constitution; but its form, and the line of argument adopted by the Prime Minister, bring this comparatively side issue into such strong prominence that it is scarcely possible to pass it by without reference. the Constitution cannot be amended by an Act of this Parliament. clause could have been expressed in a form which would not have given rise to doubt or debate.

The Government, of course, are bound to comply with their constitutional obligations. They have no choice. But they propose to deduct, during the first six months of 1911, from the fer cafita contribution which is to be paid to the States, the amounts set forth in the schedule, without any warrant from them, and so as to take back, in effect, part of what they have been obliged to pay.

This Bill secures stability for the finances of the Commonwealth and the States for the next ten years; and I welcome warmly the assurance of the Prime Minister that, although it will be within the power of Parliament to amend the measure at any time, and in any particular, there is no intention to alter it for that period. He. has given a deliberate pledge, not only for this, but for future Parliaments, during the period for which the measure will operate.

I have always maintained that we ought not to take away from ourselves any powers which the Constitution has vested in us.

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we ought to give the assuranceand we do by passing this Bill give the assurance-to the States that we contemplate nothing within the horizon of practical politics, to use the language of the Leader of the Opposition, which will be likely to induce us to alter the terms of this measure. That is the strongest declaration of intention that we can make. But I decline to go further than that, and to consider that there can be anything in the nature of a pledge binding the conscience of any member of this House with regard to what may be the case should the ultimate necessities of the -Commonwealth require a change. I do not think the matter can be put higher than that. With regard to the Bill itself, I entirely coincide with what the Leader of the Opposition said as to the extraordinary nature of the form in which it is brought before the House. If we are asked to legislate-as we are asked to legislateas from : will be admitted is the effect of our legislation-wh y should we not, in express terms, legislate as from the ist January?

I do not think that the Prime Minister can rely upon that, and say that, because the State Governments were prepared to give Up a portion of what they considered to be their nnancial rights, or were prepared to abate to some extent what they considered to be their financial necessities, in order to obtain what they considered constitutional, security for the payment to them-that, , when they did not get that security, we are in a position to turn round and say, "" You. admitted that this sum was enough for' you.""

If the Prinie Minister had couched the Bill in the form it would naturally have taken, seeing that we are going to legislate as from the ist January next, see the remarkable result which would have followed. When we look at this measure I think it becomes apparent why this extraordinary method of drafting has been adopted.

Not only are we going to do that which will reduce the payment for the time during which we have power to legislate to an amount very much less than 25s. per head, but we are saying that, having diminished the payment to very much less than 25s. a year, we are now going to take from that reduced minimum a sum of £450,000 to make up for the deficiency which was created in last year's finances under the control of the Federal Parliament. subject to correction from the Treasurer and his officers, because I am only going to give thefigureswhich I have had an opportunity of taking out within the last few moments. which have been placed in my hands, that the total returns of revenue from Customs and Excise would give an average returnable to the States as their three-fourthsif the Braddon section continued in operation-of £8,803,000. pay at that rate for the rest of this half year.

And, mark, having reduced their minimum in the second I half of the year to the sum of £935,000, we proceed to take away £450,000 out of that to make up for the deficiency in the Commonwealth finances last year, leaving the total sum payable to them during the six months at £485,000. generous ! anything.

As regards the general position, I cordially agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it will be of immense advantage to the Commonwealth and to the States, too, that some reasonable permanent arrangement for a considerable period should be arrived at.

But I should have thought that it would have been better, not only to put the thing in plain, distinct language before the States, but if honourable members are going to further reduce the payment by such a considerable sum as £450,000, to adopt a scheme which would have spread the deduction over a greater time than the first six the Federal authority. months in which it will be in operation. I desire to refer to the probable attitude which the State Premiers will adopt when they see what is promised to them. The Prime Minister appears to think that they will be very naughty boys indeed if they do not think that they are getting something really good under this method of settlement. But I would remind him that when the arrangement was arrived at in tlie celebrated Conference there was nothing in the air about a note issue which would trespass on (he State funds to the extent of £80,000 a year. There was also nothing in the air about that which I suppose will become a concrete fact before very long. There was nothing said about the Federal Parliament intending to trench their sphere of direct taxation. very well. it was pretty well known when the Conference met. was not considered. I think that the position of things has totally changed; and we shall find that the Premiers 'are not at all satisfied with this method of settlement. I believe that when the public consider that the States are to lose a revenue of £80,000 a year by the issue of Commonwealth notes, and that a great portion of their power of direct taxation is also to be taken away, they will wonder where they are. Any ordinary man of business, placed in die position of the Premiers, would have the greatest difficulty in financing the States under the proposed conditions. No doubt we shall hear a great deal from those gentlemen. I shall be very much surprised if we do not. Without a Conference between the Prime Minister and the Premiers, I do not think it is possible that we can satisfactorily adjust matters. The State and the Federal spheres of influence concern the snme people. I hope to see ihe Premiers and the Prime Minister -cordially working together. Otherwise, I feel sure that we shall witness continualfluctuationson this question. I have already pointed out two matters which have come about since the Premiers' Conference was held. I feel satisfied that it will not be possible for the Premiers to carry on the financial undertakings of their States, which are most important to their people, unless tliere is harmonious co-operation between them and The criticisms which have been directed against the principle of the Bill have been very mild, and I hope that they will continue so. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, who has been supported by the last speaker, that the Bill will do some injustice to die States, and conflict with the principles laid down by their Premiers. And a great deal of attention, it is hoped, will be directed to the fact that its operation is not to commence in its entirety until the ist January, 1911, and that the State Premiers will be told that the Commonwealth proposes to give them 25s. a head, their own choice, less £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0. member that it was not their choice, but their necessity. an opportunity of knowing what was done. member has been told this over and over again.",39,Quarantine

235,Mr Deakin,"Yes; the honorablean opportunity of knowing what did take place in the secret Conference. My complaint in the last Parliament was that the Conference was held in secret, and that the members of the House were not taken into the confidence of the parties to the agreement, and really knew nothing of what had transpired. On that occasion, the minority did not forget-and all honour to Australia that they did not-that underlying the proposal was an attempt on the part of the Premiers to dominate the nation by taking, mately, sole control of the purse. What they wanted was not so much the 25s. per capita for to-day or to-morrow or next year, as to fix the provision in the Constitution in such a way that it would be an almost absolute impossibility ever lo remove it, because its inclusion would defy the people's will to remove it, seeing that a majority of the States, as well as a majority of.the people as a whole would be required. That: was the whole trouble. We know what the financial position of certain of the States is, and that it must remain so for a certain time. It would be only human nature for those States to refuse to go against their own financial interests for a considerable time to come, and to refuse therefore to allow the Constitution to be altered in order to hand back again to the Federal Parliament, as representing the whole people, the powers which the States desired to take away from it. At the Premiers' Conference, as the Commonwealth was faced with a probable deficit for the financial year of £1,200,000, through relieving the States of expenditure on old-age pensions, it was suggested by the States, in their generosity, that the Commonwealth Government should agree to give them 25s. per head, and embody that agreement in the Constitution, and that then they should allow the Commonwealth to deduct £600,000, or one-half the estimated deficit, from the payments to them for the financial year just closed. The deficit, fortunately, is not so large as was estimated by the right honourable member for Swan, but still there is a deficit, which has been caused through the Commonwealth relieving the States of. an expenditure of £900,000 per annum on old-age pensions. All that the States are now asked to do for the remainder of the current financial year is to put the Commonwealth in a solvent position by allowing a deduction of £450,000 to be made. I was glad to hear the true national note sounded this afternoon in the statement that, in sanctioning the Federal Constitution, the people never intended this Parliament to bargain with the States. They simply said, "" We have no experience, and nothing to guide us for the first ten years as to what our national and State necessities will be. Let the Federal Parliament return a certain proportion of the revenue to the States for ten years, and then, after that experience, the Federal Parliament, which we have created to deal with us in our ultinational capacity, can make what fresh arrangements it pleases, not by an agreement with the State Premiers, but as it thinks will be most beneficial to us in both our national and State capacities."" Our proposition now practically is to relieve the States of the obligation to pay £150,000 of the £600,000 which they last year agreed to pay, and to limit the period of the per capita payments to ten years. I am in favour of the principles of the Bill, and will support it, but I told my constituents, and they shared my feeling very strongly, that there should be no fixed period as to any arrangement for the return of money to the States. The matter should go from Parliament to Parliament by a simple Act, which can be altered if the people of the future demand it and the necessities of the case require it. Looking ahead to the national necessities and the immense amount of expenditure that must take place, I have very grave fears that; long before the ten years' period has elapsed, the people will see the necessity for their National Parliament controlling a much larger proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue than it can at present. As a Protectionist, I hope to see effective Protection established permanently in Australia, but in that case the Customs revenue must decline. If then our revenues are to decline and our necessities to increase year by year, I cannot look with favour upon the ten years' period. I recognise, however, as the honourable member for Flinders put it, that, no matter what period we insert in the Act, if the necessities of the case demand it in the future, the Act can be amended, because the needs of the people must be the first consideration with their representatives in the National Parliament. The honourable member for Fawkner and others spoke of the opinions of the Premiers. There are Premiers and Premiers. When Federation was initiated, I fondly hoped that the",40,Quarantine

Instead of trying to work in accord with it, they have done everything they possibly could to create discord and friction, and in every way to try to gain back for the States the powers which the people deliberately took away from them years ago. We read with pain day after day the statements made by some of the Premiers, and the honourable member .for Flinders should know that, even if the Prime Minister went out of his way to try to bring it about, he would find it impossible to get into harmonious working relations with some of them. In to-day's Herald, published in this city, there appears a statement by Mr Murray, the Premier of Victoria. It would be unfair to class him as bitterly hostile to the National power, but I have noted on several occasions that he too is trying to cling to those powers which he thinks'the States have been deprived of. .However, this is what he is reported to have said to-dayThe Premier( Mr Murray) referring to-day to the Financial Relations Bill just introduced that I know. into the House of Representatives, said that it embodied really the same proposals as the Financial Agreement, except that ""ten years"" was substituted for "" perpetuity."" The States would be noworse off for ten years than they would have been under the Financial Agreement, and as the Federal Government, with its majority in Parliament, was the master of the situation, what could the States do? The deduction of the ^450,000"", representing the Comlia would get as good terms from a Labour monwealth deficit last year, from what was coming to the States this nnancial year was in acMinistry as those offered by the previous cordance with his expectations. Had the FinanLiberal Government. One honourable memcial Agreement been adopted, the States would have had to pay the same amount out of last year's revenue. That is exactly corroborative of my statement. I admit that die crux of the position was the proposal to embody the Financial Agreement in the Constitution when it would have been immensely difficult, if not impossible, to take it out again. apart from that, if the State Premiers are honest, they will admit that they are in a better position financially to-day, and will' £ 9 8 6 , 0 0 0 . present nnancial year, than they would State'will-lose a very considerable sum.

We had the presentative should emphasize. Mr Chanter. complimait from the Leader of the Opposition that it was proper that this measure Unfortushould have been introduced as the first measure proposed by the present Government. I hope that it will be passed, and I hope that the State Premiers will recognise that this Parliament, representing the national feeling in Australia, has no desire to interfere unduly with the financial position of the States. At the same time, we believe that our first duty is to the people of Australia as a whole, and that it is necessary that we should retain sufficient of the revenue derived from the taxation of the people to meet national requirements. Prime Minister, when speaking on this measure, was good enough to try to relieve' my mind as to the disabilities which Western Australia might suffer under it, but I wish to say that the honourable gentleman did not touch the objection I have to the measure. My objection to it was revealed in the speech of the honourable member for Flinders. Western Australia has always contributed the largest per capita amount of Customs revenue, and under the measure before us, that State will stand to lose the largest per capita amount. but the honourable member does not mean cannot help wondering what is the position of those representatives of Labour who have come from Western Australia to this Parliament. During the last election campaign every one' of them assured the people of that State that Western Austraber went so far as to say tliat his principal objection to the proposals of the Liberal Government was that they were not nearly so good as a Labour Government would be prepared to give the State.

I think that the policy of the party which the Prime Minister leads so well was that expressed at the Brisbane Labour Conference. -So far as I could understand the terms of the somewhat ambiguous resolutions come to by that Conference, the policy was, not that the terms of the proposal should be embodied in the Constitution, because I do not think that was meant, but that there -should be a fixed payment apportioned fer cafita amongst the States, which it was estimated would come to about 25s. per head of the population. .the Western Australian allowance, 25s.

Financial Agreement was rejected ? The Financial Agreement has been rejected, and we have now before us the policy of the Labour party. of the terms of the Brisbane Conference proposals there was some difference of opinion amongst the members of the Conference. The State members interpreted its terms in one way and Federal members interpreted them in another. In any references I have made to the matter from the platform, I have always adopted the interpretation of the Federal members of that Conference, and I say now that it is rather unfair to the electors who sent the Labour party into power that there should be at the. very initiation of the financial policy of the party, a departure from what the -people legitimately thought would be the alternative to the rejection of the Financial Agreement. I leave it to honourable members opposite to justify the departure to their constituents. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. There is no reason, because the £600,000 was to be deducted, why we should make a deduction to the amount of the deficit.' It was part of the understanding, whether rightly come to or not. There might be a difference of opinion as to whether we should or should not have included any provision about the £600,000 to cover the period of six months, but it was part of the consideration that the six States, three of which had not established any system of old-age pensions at all, would contribute towards the £600,000. The six States agreed to contribute, but only three were relieved of the obligation to pay old-age pensions. The three smaller States did not have a local system of old age pensions in force, but they fell in with I think it was said that we the proposition in consideration of the fixity of the agreement. being paid in those States. only three of the States.

Some of the State Premiers make a statement quite contrary to that put forward by the honourable member. by this Premier, or that, in regard to the Conference? We can be guided only by the resolutions. One of the first principles of interpretation of an Act of Parliament is that a Court is to look not at what is said by members of Parliament but at what they resolve. is giving us the reasons why the State Premiers came to a conclusion in regard to the contribution of £600,000. resolution. is telling us what actuated the Premiers in coming to that conclusion. about motives. I am simply dealing with the terms.of the resolution, which has been published, and which forms part of the data upon which we. arrived at a decision last year. ference decided that, in consideration of three of the States being released from obligations incurred with respect to the paycontinual, though diminishing, loss as ment of old-age pensions, a reduction, amounting in the aggregate to £600,000, might be made from the amount returnable to them towards making good the estimated deficit for the year. That meant, of course, that if there were no deficit, that reduction should not be made; but we made an alteration by Act of Parliament, and made the provision absolute. The Prime Minister is not justified by any promise made under different conditions by three of the States, which were under no obligation, and had not been relieved of any, in relation to the payment of old-age pensions, in proposing now to make this deduction. It happens that the three smaller States were the vicarious sufferers under when there was an actual increase of the Commonwealth Tariff of 1002. I do not wish to repeat the arguments-althoug h I had them expressed in different figuresthat have been given by the honourable member for Flinders as regards the effect of this arrangement, but little Tasmania, which has received no relief so far as the payment of old-age pensions is concerned, by the Commonwealth's assumption of the responsibility with regard to the payment of those pensions, was the biggest vicarious sufferer under the Commonwealth Tariff of 1902. advantage by the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions? enjoying the Commonwealth system, but three of them have been relieved of their annual expenditure in relation to their State systems of old-age pensions. cognised their obligations in that respect. with the question of the bargain? wishes to give the States to which he refers special treatment, because they did not carry out their obligations to the people in respect of old-age pensions. reply to ithat interjection. The smaller States, which are not relieved of any obligation in respect of the payment of old age pensions, have been the biggest sufferers under the Customs Tariff Act of 1902. In the very first year of its operation, Tasmania lost £162,000 as compared with its revenue in 1900, from its own The State Premiers in ConTariff. I believe that if the record since then is followed up, it will be found that the figures relating to Tasmania show a against 'the position it might have assumed under its somewhat wide Tariff, wbich covered about 91 per cent, of its total imports. That is the position. As to Western Australia, we had to make certain provision for the extraordinary -per capita results there, and tiiat special provision expired about three years ago. is quite in error in suggesting that Tasmania's returns have been gradually going down. have been less since 1902-3.

263,Mr Glynn,"I know that her lossesof a uniform Tariff, Tasmania itself suffered considerably. in a greater ratio. with Queensland's compensations. South Australia is losing about. £20,000 a year by reason of the abolition of its special Tariff for the Northern Territory. Before the uniform Tariff came into operation South Australia had in force certain special rates of duties in respect of commodities, and particularly rice, in general consumption in the Northern Territory. Under that Tariff it would have been receiving about £30,600 per annum more than it has received under the uniform Tariff. At all events, when the Commonwealth Tariff was brought into force there was at once a drop of £20,000 a year in respect of the duties on those commodities. South Australia is also losing owing to the competition of the Pacific Cable Board with'the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, which used our transcontinental line far more than any other. thus losing something like £15,000 or £16,000 a year in connection with the telegraph rates. the honourable member has just referred debited to the Northern Territory? loss. By entering into small details I could °f £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 . show much larger figures, but in dealing with a Bill of this kind, I do not wish to go into details. I am referring to a few broad financial considerations. Queensland has been relieved of the burden of old-age pensions, and there can be no doubt that it did suffer a certain drop in its return per capita on the introduction of the uniform Tariff. If I am not mistaken, however, that has practically been cancelled. It was about £ 3 4s. Mi. GROOM -And it fell, roughly, to £ 3 3Svvhich has not altogether been recouped, but Treasurer, however, on the Supplementary Queensland has been fairly well supported financially by the Commonwealth Parliament. One of its chief policies was in relation to sugar. I find that in 1907-8 the Customs and Excise receipts from sugar amounted to £770,000, while the bounty paid to Queensland and New South Wales growers totalled £577,000, leaving a net revenue, chiefly brought about by compensation to the so-called vested interest in Kanakas of £193,000. That will be the measure of the loss suffered under this policy in normal years. I say in normal years because, when the crop fails, as it has done on one or two occasions, the amount received in revenue from the import duties must go up. On the whole, there is a sacrifice in connection with the Kanaka policy. I voted for the exclusion of the Kanakas, but not for compensation to vested interests. The policy does mean a loss of at least £500,000 a year, and it is a policy that ought never to have been initiated by Queensland. It will be found that I am justified in saying that the States which, on a ground which has disappeared, are now asked to contribute to the deficit are the States that have received the least consideration in connection with the finances. The Commonwealth is in a belter position now than when the Treasurer made his Estimate last year, seeing that there has been an increase of over £ 1 , oeo, 000 in the revenue of the Department of Trade and Customs and of the Post ancl Telegraph Department. Surely it The State from which I come is ought not to be beyond the financial ability of the Treasurer to find some means of meeting the deficit, because, if the Prime Minister's policy had been carried out last year, he must have had to face a bigger liability than that now before, him. in error; last year was started with a credit tion to pay old-age pensions, which ate up the credit balance. deficit of about £1,800,000, but we got £600,000 promised from the States. year, when they started, hacl credit for £700,000 in the Trust Funds.

I commend the Prime Minister for exercising control over his feelings in a very trying situation. I wish to point out that it is necessary to condition the proposed agreement with a twenty-five years' period, if the representatives of Western Australia are to fulfil their pledges to the electors. Such a condition is only unessential if their pledges in another respect and their necessities of another nature, compel them to play false to the people who have sent them here. If they stand firmly for a limitation of the agreement to twenty-five years, which I submit is in the best interests of Western Australia, and if the provision relating to that period goes by the board, the Prime Minister will be afforded a choice between exhibiting the "" courage "" to break his word and having the decency to keep it. I am now referring to his promise to the people of Australia, that if returned to power he would endeavour to secure legislative sanction to an arrangement which would give some sort of financial stability to the six States of the Commonwealth. How does this question 'affect Western Australia? If honourable members opposite will make a mental calculation they will find tliat the arrangement proposed in this Bill will give to Western Australia a sum of £, )°5°J00O in addition to the 25s. per 2 head. But under the scheme propounded by the late Government after consultation with tlie Premiers, that State would have received £3,030,000 in addition to the 25s. per capita. In other words, if the representatives of Western Australia go back upon their pledges that State will dress these remarks to the Western Australian representatives in order that they may see where their duty lies in considering a matter of such vast importance. I have no desire to canvass the arguments which have already been advanced in regard to the particular form in which the Government have thought it their duty to introduce this Bill. The honourable member for Bass stated, by interjection this afternoon, that the three States which had not paid old-age pensions ought to receivevery scant consideration from us in connection with this financial arrangement because they had failed to discharge their duty to the electors in that regard.

But I do not wish to be led away from my line of argument, and thus transgress the Standing Orders. As you know, sir, I am one of the most faithful observers of our Standing Orders, and I do not wish to give you cause to intervene for any breach of them. In my judgment the attitude which each honourable member ought to adopt towards this question is that neither of a Commonwealth, nor of a State Rights man. Both phrases are objectionable. We should all regard ourselves as trustees for the Australian people, a higher title than that of members of the Federal Parliament. masters. the Federal are the same as those who vote at the State elections, constituting one selfthe States. A land tax, whether proposed governing entity. The Constitution gives us vast financial powers, as it were in a trust deed. After this year we may make what financial arrangements we please. These powers are not to be abused. We must seek, not only the well-being of the particular authority of which we form a part, but that of the people as a whole. While we may disagree as to whether the Commonwealth or State agencies should control this or that public utility, we must not endeavour to enhance the importance of our .position by ;any action which will be detrimental to the well-being of the people whom we have been elected to represent. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (North Sydney) [7.57] -The introduction of the Bill at this early stage of the session reflects credit States allowed to avail themselves of all on the Government. Ministers are entitled to credit also for carrying out their electioneering promises, though, as I interjected when the Prime Minister was speaking, the provisions of the measure are a queer mixture of generosity and parsimony. The promises made by the Prime Minister and his friends are being kept in some respects and broken in others. political party now in power here promised that if it gained a majority at the elections, it would put the States in regard to finance in the position in which they would be put should their opponents be retained in office,with the exception that the annual payment of 25s. per capita would be provided for, not in the Constitution, but in an Act of Parliament. The Bill, however, does not do what would have been clone had the party with which I have the honour to co-operate obtained a majority. Had it retained power, the States would have received more than it is now proposed to give to them, and the Financial Agreement would have been embodied in the Constitution. Ministers are apparently desirous of lessening the friction between the Commonwealth and the States, but they might have acted generously on one or two points. As things have turned out, I am glad that the Financial Agreement is not to be embodied in the Constitution. Such kaleidoscopic changes in our fiscal system are proposed fhat it is impossible to form a fixed and definite opinion as to the financial relations that should exist between the Commonwealth and the States When I advocated the embodiment of the Financial. Agreement in the Constitution, I knew that the party of which I am a member did not intend to invade such fields of taxation as income tax and land tax, hitherto left to for the sake of revenue, or to effect social and agrarian reform, must be a heavy impost on the people, and a source of considerable profit to the Government. When the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States was being discussed in the last Parliament-of which I ; had not the honour to be a memberI thought, as I afterwards told the electors, that 25s. per capita was more than the States had a right to expect from the Commonwealtb. On that point, I differed from many of my party. I firmly believe that if the Commonwealth were to be restricted for revenue to the imposition of Customs and Excise duties, and the other means of which it has hitherto availed itself, and the other sources of taxation, 25s. per capita would be too much to give to them. Of course, the Constitution does not prohibit the Commonwealth from taxing the people in any .way thought necessary; yet those on this side of the chamber would not invade the fields of taxation which hitherto have been left to the States, and The which can be properly exploited by them in connection with measures of social and land reform.

I do not wish to have any misunderstanding about my feelings on the question of Australian Nationalism. I ara a Nationalist to the core of my heart. I wish to see this Commonwealth Parliament strong within the terms of the Constitution, and exercising every function that the Constitution intrusts to us exercising them to the fullest. But I do hold with that eminent Treasurer whom we had in charge of our finances in the early days of Federation, Sir George Turner, that we cannot proceed too carefully or too cautiously in regard to the necessities of the States. During the first years, when we are laying down, as it were, the foundathese constitutional provisions as a laytions of our future .National Government, we must show a consistent regard for those necessities. tion, and come to that point where we can cut off for ever the financial dependence of States on Commonwealth, and of Commonwealth upon the States, we shall no longer have to consider that point of view. But, during this period of transition, we cannot be too careful, cannot be too cautious, in considering the necessities of the States, upon which the prosperity of the Commonwealth must depend. I only wish to make one further reference to this B ill ; for I am aware that it is of no use to oppose it with any idea of stopping its passage, and probably with very little idea of getting its provisions amended. I should like to refer to clause 6. I am surprised to see it included in a Bill proposed by our friends on the other side, who have taken up such a strong national attitude upon this subject. with the Constitution. Mr G. B. EDWARDS 1 have had to differ from lawyers before, and I am going to differ from some of them now. I do not believe that the idea underlying this clause is in the Constitution. I have looked at the Constitution carefully, and it seems quite plain to me that the origin of clause 6 is in section 94 of the Constitution, which provides that after the expiration of five years from the imposition of uniform duties, the Parliament-that is, the Commonwealth Parliament-ma y make provision for the return to the States of any surplus revenue. The"" Braddon blot "" section which, strangely enough, precedes this, is section 87, which provides that the Commonwealth can only keep for its own use one-fourth of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, and must return three-fourths to the States.. If those two sections were transposed, and section 94 was made to come before section 87, one would see the continuity of reasoning which provided first for five years and afterwards for ten. A strong point in favour of the view that I take is that in section 94, upon which clause 6 of this Bill is based, it is said that the Commonwealth ""may"" make provision for the distribution of surplus revenue; but in section 87 the Braddon section it is said that the Commonwealth "" shall"" do so. I hesitate to discuss the bearing of man when I know that lawyers take opposite views of it, but it seems to me quite Having once fixed the posiplain that sooner or later we must have litigation in the High Court over the clause. It is preventing what I , and many others with me, ultimately hope to accomplish, and that is finality to the dependence of the States on the Commonwealth and vice versd. So long as this provision exists on our statute-book, the States will be perpetually interested in any surpluses which the Commonwealth can create, and the latter will be perpetually interestedin not creating any surpluses. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -No doubt, with a certain class of Treasurer it is desirable to have no surpluses. It is a bad thing from the taxpayers' point of view to have any surpluses. But in view of verymany National undertakings which cannot be undertaken except in years when we start with a surplus, I think it is a pity that tins clause is to find a place on the statute-book. I believe that if we could do without its enactment we should be very much better off, and, although I express the opinion with that hesitation which a layman should always exhibit when he is dealing with a question on which lawyers differ, it is clear to mv ordinary common sense reasoning that there must be some opportunity for differences of opinion as to the operation of section 94 of the Constitution. I wish that the Government had more fully considered the matter than they probably have done before they introduced the provision into the Bill, and so'saddled",48,Quarantine

Mr G. B. EDWARDS I would leave out the clause. legal right under the Constitution they would soon apply to the High Court to get it established. the Commonwealth Government admit their right, and so prevent any reasonable chance of the matter being solved by the High Court. clearly expressed in the Constitution that once we get to the end of the ten years' period, and settle the financial relations bewidi only one difference, and that is its tween the States and the Commonwealth, we need not go back to section 94, which simply provides for the distribution of the surplus between the period of five years after the institution of uniform duties and the period of ten years when it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to determine its future financial relations with the States. I applaud the Government, I repeat, for bringing in the measure early. I applaud their generosity in dealing with the matter in a way which, in the distant future, will be perfectly just to the States. But I do regret and deplore that they did not see their way clear to be equally generous with the other provisions, and leave the States no ground for serious complaint, which, I fear, they will have against this proposed solution of a great difficulty. that the terms of this measure and its introthe Commonwealth, but also the terminaduction by the Government as the first business for the House to deal with will be gratifying to a majority of the electors, who accepted the assurance of the opponents of the Financial Agreement that tlie people of Australia could safely leave the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth in the hands of this Parliament, believing that it would deal justly and fairly with the claims of the States. The first comment which I made when I read the Bill was that which has been made by the honourable member for Flinders, and it is in regard to the rather peculiar way in which it was prepared. I could see at once what the Treasurer's object was from the money point of view, but it occurred to me, as it did to the honourable member for Flinders, that it might have been just as well to state in plain language that the deduction should be made from the amount which is to be paid to the States during the first six months of next year. I think that I can see the reason why the Treasurer brought in the Bill in its present form. It was not for the purpose of hoodwinking the Treasurers and Premiers of the States, because any one who understands the subject knows at once what the Bill, as drafted, means, namely, what the honorI f the States have anj' able member for Flinders has pointed out. By submitting the measure in this particular form, the Treasurer is carrying out, as While this clause remains nearly as possible, so far as money is concerned, the exact terms of the Financial Agreement, which the Premiers of the States and the representatives of the CommonBut, to my mind, it is wealth made at the secret Conference in Melbourne. It is practically, as the Treasurer said, carrying out their agreement, non-embodiment in the Constitution, and a limitation to a particular period. Objection has been taken to the Treasurer's claim that he is practically carrying out the agreement. It has been pointed out that it was ?.n agreement as a whole, and that, if every clause is not carried out, it ceases to be an agreement. It has been pointed out that the clause for the embodiment of the agreement in the Constitution is absent from the present arrangement. Looking at the' matter from a reasonable point of view, if we are to remember the arguments which were put forward here in favour of the agreement, I cannot take that clause as a condition on which the Premiers placed muchstress. This, after all, is a matter dealing with the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth. The States proposed to concede not merely £600,000 to tion of the Braddon section, on the ist » July of this year. By that means they were going to lose about £1,200,000. This proposal will practically carry out that arrangement. The States were not to give that money to the Commonwealth in consideration of getting the agreement put in the Constitution. The agreement stated distinctly that the surrender of a sum not exceeding £600,000 was to be a recognition of the Commonwealth's obligations in regard to the payment of old-age pensions. That was the consideration, and it still exists. Inasmuch as those obligations have been incurred, the Treasurer has a perfect right to say that this Parliament should deduct from the amount which we propose to pay over to the States a portion of the deficiency up to that sum. The measure carries out, to all intents and purposes, the",50,Quarantine
301,Mr Fisher,If the matter were in,51,Quarantine
302,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [8.19],"I thinkagreement. Why was the provision for its embodiment in the Constitution placed before us? Why were we asked to supportthat proposal? We are told now that it was because of its being an agreement in perpetuity, and Mr Murray, Premier of Victoria, used that term in the interview which was read here this evening from the Herald, and which the honourable member for North Sydney has referred to. But that was not the reason. When the honourable member for Mernda, who led the opposition to the Financial Agreement here, proposed to limit its operation to ten years, it was objected that that would mean tying the hands of the Parliament. It was said that if the agreement were put in the Constitution without a definite period being specified, it could be altered by the electors in three years, if they thought fit so to the honourable member for Parramatta. I do; so that there was not a question of perpetuity. We were not then asked by the Government to vote for the agreement in order that it might be perpetual. They objected to our even voting for the agreement for ten years. The whole opposition to its acceptance was based upon what we called its perpetuity, which, we said, would be the effect of its embodiment in the Constitution. of it. Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that there was not such a big majority of votes cast against the Financial Agreement. To me it is a surprise that we got a majority at all, when we know how very few of the electors could understand this complicated question. s' jority was got. of New South Wales who said the electors did not really understand the question, and yet he was one of those who insisted upon the amendment of the Constitution which necessitated the people being consulted in the matter. If it was the complicated question that we said it was, why were they so eager to send it to the people? Our fear was that the people would not understand what was involved in the alteration of the Constitution, and the most sordid reasons were offered to the electors by the great journals that were backing up the agreement throughout Australia to induce them to vote for it. As regards my own district, the Conservative journal in this city pointed out that Gippsland was desperately in want of money for roads and railways, and that by voting for me the people of Gippsland would be voting for a man who would deprive them of the money that they would get under the agreement. That was put forward as a reason why they should vote to put the agreement in the Constitution. With that sort of argument being used everywhere, it is a wonder that so many people in outlying parts of the Commonwealth, to whom roads and access to their holdings mean everything, were able to rise above their immediate self-interests, and look at the question from a national point of view. member is a great Nationalist! were not a much greater Nationalist dian is would rather not see a period of ten years fixed, because I agree with the Prime Minister that by that means we are practically pledging ourselves to keep this arrangement perfect for that time. I also fully appreciate the view of the honourable member for Flinders, that exigencies may arise that may make it necessary for the Commonwealth, in the national interest, to amend the Act. But, short of some great and pressing difficulties arising, I take it that we will adhere, as far as possible, to the term of ten years when it is embodied in the ActI am, however, prepared to vote for the Bill with the ten years' period in it for this reason: When the matter was being debated in the House last year those of us who opposed the agreement were prepared to assent practically to anything rather than refer this complicated question to the decision of the electors, because we feared that the electors would not understand the issues involved in it, and that it might get into the Constitution. We knew perfectly well what a disastrous effect that would have on the welfare of Australia as a whole. Therefore, when we were told that the State Premiers wanted some sort of security, the honourable member for Mernda said, "" We will concede that it should be fixed in the Constitution for ten years,"" and on one occasion, in order to make a bigger bid, and get the matter settled then and there, an offer was made tp fix it for fifteen years, although many of us thought that dangerous. which the honourable member refers involved fifteen or sixteen years, because if went on a population basis.",51,Quarantine

In tiiose circumstances, many men might be tempted to say to the Premiers, "" You have fought your fight and done your worse; we have won the day, and now you will have to take the consequences of defeat."" But the Treasurer does not do that. He simply carried out what we contended should be done. That is gratifying to us, and it is gratifying to know that the contentions we put forward in this House, and on the platforms of the country, were accepted by the people who are now, as I stated in opening, realizing that our statement to them that they could trust the Federal Parliament to deal with the .States in a generous way was one that could be relied upon. agree that the. Prime Minister has done right in introducing this measure at this early stage. It is well to know that it will very shortly become an accomplished fact that Federal and State finance will be made entirely independent of eacli other. That is something for which we should all be ready to strive. I understood the Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, to say that it was with reluctance that he agreed to the term of ten years, and that he considered that he was proposing very generous treatment for the States. In view of the fact that the honourable gentleman's party swept the polls in the way they did, and that the Financial Agreement passed by this Parliament was rejected by the people-thoug h only by a small majority, 1 should like to remind the Prime Minister-in one sense the honourable gentleman may be regarded as acting generously. I think, however, that he might very well be asked to treat the States a little Parliament. more generously than he proposes to do. Instead of making the term of ten years begin from the ist of this month, he might make it begin from the ist January next, and from that time on, for ten years, pay to the States 25s. per head per annum by monthly payments, deducting the deficit of £450,000. honourable gentleman could very well afford to do that. It is a degree of generosity which might have been expected of him. because I read that on the 31st March of this year, in the Melbourne Town Hall, the honourable gentleman, referring. to his party, saidThey were in favour of a fair return on a -per cafita basis, and would guarantee a fair return for ten years.

However, 1 am able to read the report of his address which appeared in the Age. Perhaps honourable members opposite will be satisfied with thatThey were in favour of a fair return on a per cafita basis, and would guarantee a fair teturn for ten years, but they would not bind the future of Australia by putting a practically permanent bond into the Constitution.

The honourable senator may have thought so, but I do not think that the rest of us understood that. Senator Pearce wrote -to the West Australian in these termsI will stand by my original contentions. . . . That the Labour party is in favour of paying 25s. (per head to the States and the special grant to ""Western Australia, and, if the agreement is kept -out of the Constitution, is pledged to embodv -it in an Act of Parliament for a fixed term of, -say, twenty-five years. All the other Western Australian senators took up the same attitude. In the circumstances I think the Prime Minister, if he -reconsiders the matter will recognise that he might very well be asked to treat the States a little moregenerously than he proposes to do, and date the agreement from the ist January next. Under his proposal, the States will receive the proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Braddon section for the six months ending 31st December of this year. That will amount to a good deal more than 25s. per head of the population. But during the following six months, in order that they may not receive anore than 25s. per head, less the deficit, between the ist of the present month and the 30th June next, the Prime Minister proposes to ante-date the agreement to the ist July of this year. The figures work out something in this way : As their share of the Customs and Excise revenue under the provisions of the Braddon section, the -States will receive between, this and the -end of December, roughly, £2,500,000. After the Prime Minister has dealt with -them in the way he proposes they will re-ceive, for the following six months, about £600,000. I should like also to point out that the undertaking of the State Premiers, to give up £600,000 to the Commonwealth if the Financial Agreement was carried out in its entirety, was based on the assumption that there would be a shortage of revenue. At the same time, it was agreed that the States which were being relieved of the payment of old-age pensions, should contribute to that amount, at the rate of 3s. per head, and that the other States should make a contribution at the rate of only 2s. per head of their population. The Prime Minister ignores that understanding, and is going to place all the States upon an equal per capita basis, charging them a fraction over 2s. per head. One of the remarkable results of this procedure is that, although the Commonwealth is to retain only £450,000, instead of £600,000, Tasmania will have to contribute to that sum £5,991 more than she would have done under the original agreement by which £600,000 was to be retained by the Commonwealth. These are small matters that might readily be adjusted. They mean a good deal to Tasmania, and will mean a good deal to other States, which I believe will soon find themselves in the critical situation unfortunately occupied by that earthly .paradise across the strait.

The Statistician goes on to sayThis indicates the relative trend of trade. The larger the volume of Inter-State transfers the greater the chance of leakage in adjusting the debits and credits between States, and the greater the certainty of credit shortage to the importing State. If I can show that a certain amount has been lost to Tasmania, this Parliament, knowing that that State is fairly entitled to the money under the Constitution, will surely be prepared to give what is deemed reasonable and fair.

This is the time to deal with the matter, because the House has now an opportunity to say "" Yes"" or "" No"" to a request of the sort. I could not move when the Financial Agreement was before the House without interfering with the settlement of the main question; and I have taken the first opportunity to submit this motion. the first time by many that I have alluded to the matter; I have always endeavoured to keep the nnancial position of Tasmania not only, before this House, but before the people of that State. member be surprised to learn that Tasmania will contribute 3s. 9d. less than the next lowest contributing State? prised.

I shall quote some figures to show that Tasmania is not wasting her revenue, and to explain how we have got into our present position. The Prime Minister ought really to take into consideration the leakage, because he bases his position on the Customs figures, which take no account of the importations I have mentioned. The Govei'nment Statistician of Tasmania estimates the loss at £40,000 a year, which sum ought to have been credited to that State. posed in the Bill will involve New South VVales in a loss of £1,270,000 annually, and yet its representatives are not squealing. merits of the scheme which we are now considering that it abolishes the bookkeeping system.

My contention is that this revenue should have been returned to the States on a per cafita basis, which is the only truly Federal basis.

No doubt the Melbourne officials are of opinion that the Tasmanian loss of revenue is very small, but they have no means of gauging the leakage to which I have referred. I hope that attention will not be given to their statements in preference to those of the Tasmanian Statistician, who is as able as any in the Commonwealth. The per capita distribution of revenue w-as his idea, and his opinion regarding the importations of Tasmania is entitled to as much respect as is that of any other man in Australia. I hope the Prime Minister will come down from his high horse, and, instead of asserting that Tasmania is not entitled to consideration, because the Treasury figures show that her consumption is only so much per head of population, will look the facts in the face. It is clear that the Customs records do not take account of many importations for which the State should be credited. I listened with great attention to the. speecli of the honourable member for Wilmot, and tried to picture to myself what the effect on the debate would be were every honourable member to deem it necessary to attempt to show how unfairly his State is dealt with by the necessarily rough-andready per capita method of distribution of revenue which it is now proposed to adopt. We have all recognised for years that the substitution of a per capita distribution for that provided for under the bookkeeping system would necessarily involve many inequalities and inequities; and we have become reconciled to that necessity. South Wales to be reconciled to it, because she is getting .more than her share. -days of Federation I was very much struck by the fact that South Australia was making a profit of something like £140,000 a year out of her Postal administration, while the other States were losing money in the exercise of that function. out of her Post Office. then that, had all the States considered exactly what they would gain or lose in different directions by the proposed national partnership, there would have been no Federation. The honourable member [i7] for Wilmot contends that, because Tasmanians find it profitable to shop in Melbourne occasionally, and the value of their purchases is not recorded when taken back to Tasmania, the Prime Minister should make a special allowance to the State. WereI to deem it my duty to look with like microscopic exactitude into the dealings of the public of New South Wales, I could spend some time in showing that the proposed allocation of Customs and Excise revenue will involve that State in a sacrifice or £1,200,000 per annum. But I recognise that a decision would be impossible were each of us to endeavour to show with the nicest accuracy how his particular State will be affected. Tasmania, if compared with the other States, is a poor community, but the test of its financial position is not the aggregate smallness of its revenue or expenditure. That the people there spend less. money than do those of the. other States is not evidence of their poverty. I have heard it said that Tasmanians have to leave the country in order to die, so that it may be evidence that they are leading the simple life, and indulging in very few of the luxuries in which the people of the other States indulge. If that is so, instead of being objects of pity, they are entitled to philosophic admiration. This is one of the most important debates which we are likely to have in this Parliament, because it revolves on what I call the pivot of Federation. When Federation seemed on the eve of accomplishment, there appeared what the late Hon. James Service called the "" lion in the path."" All die details of the Constitution having been settled to the satisfaction of the leading men of Australia, an apparently insuperable obstacle to union was found in the fact that, while in one State Free Trade was rampant, in others Protection was rabid, and in others, again, only moderate. There was auoted in this Chamber recently the solution offered by that great statesman Sir Henry Parkes, in a passage which I recollect with interest. He said that New South Wales was prepared to trust the Federal Parliament to deal with the fiscal question. Had not that been so, we should not have had Federation. After the meetings of the Convention at Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, the question arose: What will the States do for revenue when they have parted with their right to levy Customs and Excise duties? It was only at the last moment, when failure seemed imminent, that Sir Edward Braddon",58,Quarantine

Then, honourable members will recollect, it was recognised as unwise to fix upon a -'efinite proposition of that sort for all .ime, and it was ultimately limited to ten years, trusting to the Federal Parliament to substitute some other method in the light had just as much right to take exception of the experience which the Australian people would gain in the intervening ten years, from the beginning of Federation. in the Constitution at the instance of the Premiers' Conference at Hobart. wise provision. Our view of the relations of the States to the Commonwealth in 1900 was very different from what it is to-day; and that is the reason which I gave for hesitating to confirm the proposal brought forward by the Fusion Government to make this a provision in perpetuity. I realized that during the next ten years we should have data before us which would probably alter our views of the relationship of the States to the Commonwealth, just as much as similar data has altered our views in the period 1901 to 1910. The debate seems to me to be all-important, because this question, being the pivot upon which the success of the Federation depended, we are now called upon, as representing the people of Australia, to substitute something for the Braddon section. It has been said by some peopleI think without sufficient study of the Constitution -that , as the Constitution provided that three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise should go to the States, we should, to some extent, adhere for all time to that provision. But anybody who knows the elements of the Constitution is aware that it was specially intended that this Parliament should reach the position in which we find ourselves to-day, of being called upon to decide what -is now a fair distribution of the Customs revenue in the light of the experience that we have gained in the meantime. A good deal, too, has beai said by honourable members as to whether or not what is proposed is a fair substitute for the agreement entered into between the Premiers and the late Federal Government. I have expressed my regret before, that we have had no report, and no precis of what took place at their Conference. I should like to say that, with every desire to look at this question from blot"" an arrangement the aspect of fairness towards the States, I do not recognise any obligation on the part of the Federal Government to abide by any agreement that was made with the Premiers of the States. That Conference was not the outcome of an appointment by this Parliament. It was a Ministerial Conference. Had it been entered into by the Labour Government, we should have to the conclusion at which it arrived as honourable members opposite have to take exception to it now as having been arrived at between the Fusion Government and the Premiers of the States. We must observe in this matter the well-known maxim of the Equity Courts, to be just before we are generous. A great many appeals have been made for the Commonwealth to be generous. But we are trustees. A trustee cannot be generous. He must be just. Although the axiom may seem a bit hard, he is under an obligation to do his duty. VVe, as representatives of the people of the Commonwealth, are under an obligation to do justice to them by substituting -for the Braddon section of the Constitution what we consider to be a just provision for the States out of the revenues collected by the Commonwealth. It is quite true that the Premiers of the States were prepared to accept a certain settlement. If we had the proceedings of the .Conference before us, we should know whether the object aimed at was a constitutional, or whether it was a political one. But we do not at present know what the object was. I am unable to forget that some of the men who took part in that Conference had expressed opinions quite contrary to the idea' of putting such an agreement into the Constitution, and they had deprecated the suggestion to make an arrangement for all time. When the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mernda was before the House last session, I was one of the seven or eight supporters of the Fusion Government who joined with him in moving for a limit to be imposed to the suggested permanent arrangement. well. that the right honourable member knows it.
