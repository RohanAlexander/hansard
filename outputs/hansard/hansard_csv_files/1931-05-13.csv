It will be gathered that the alteration would make no difference in the price of whisky whether bottled in the Commonwealth under customs supervision, or otherwise. I have accepted the verdict of the committee. If the Minister chooses to ignore it that is his own concern. Last night I endeavoured to demonstrate that this duty is merely a means of raising revenue for the Government, and that the principal factor to consider is how to raise the greatest amount possible. From the figures I quoted, it is obvious that the existing duty is far too high, and merely defeats the purpose for which it was imposed. From 1914 until the 30th June last, the consumption of whisky in Australia declined by about 50 per cent. At the latter date, the economic depression was not nearly so serious as it is at present, so that the decline in the consumption of whisky could not be wholly attributed to a shrunken public purse. I believe that it was due simply to the exorbitant nature of the duty. When, in 1925, the duty on whisky was raised from 30s. to 35s., there was a perceptible decrease both in the consumption of the spirit and in the amount of revenue raised from it. Two years after that increase in duty, the revenue raised had declined by £120,000 per annum. Since then there have been two additional increases in duty, one of 2s. a gallon just prior to the last general election, and a further increase of 8s. a gallon shortly after this Government assumed office. As a result of the additional impost, the revenue raised from this source has declined very appreciably, there being a drop of £1,113,512 in respect of this article. although the duty was increased by 10s. a gallon, the revenue received under the higher rate was less than when the rate was 35s. a gallon, while less was received in revenue when the duty was 35s. than when it was 30s. a gallon. It is necessary for the committee to appreciate that there is a point at which taxation becomes too burdensome, and defeats its own object. For that reason I have chosen the mean figure of 33s. a gallon, which I consider to be the peak figure for revenue producing purposes. It may interest the committee to know that in 1924-25 the amount received in revenue from duty on whisky was £1,520,000, while last year, notwithstanding the exceptionally high rate of duty, the revenue dropped to £1,113,000, a decrease of £407,000. member contend that the cost of whisky would be reduced if the duty were lowered ? tainly would make a difference. upon local conditions.

The assurance has been given by the largest importers of whisky in this country that a benefit will accrue to the consumers if the rate of duty is decreased as suggested. that they would not pass the reduction on to the consumer? immediate reduction of the price charged to hotel keepers, wine and spirit merchants, and others. Instead of the 12s. that I am asking for, they are willing to pass on a reduction of about 14s. That assurance can be accepted because the wholesalers have a reputation, and I am sure that they have no desire to mislead either the Minister or the country. The reduction that I am asking for would result in a definite decrease in the price to So that the consumer. Scotch whisky is recognized throughout the world as a standard article. In that respect it resembles Lea and Perrin's sauce, Guinness' stout, Avery's scales, or Australian fine wool. In the United States of America, an embargo is placed upon the importation of whisky; but Scotch whisky is sold in that country, and there is always a demand for it when it is obtainable. Between November, 1929, and March, 1931, no fewer than 606 men lost their employment in New South Wales alone in three callings directly connected with the liquor trade: workers in bond and bottling warehouses, bottle-making factories and case-making establishments.",20,Divisi On I

I may mention that they were supplied by the trade union to which the men who have been thrown out of employment belong. It is reported that 54 per cent, of the meu employed in all callings connected with the wholesale and retail liquor trade throughout Australia have lost their employment. A large number of men are engaged in the various avocations which supply materials such as bottles, capsules, timber cases and straw envelopes, and I have shown that in three callings directly connected with the liquor trade, the number of men employed has fallen in a few months by over 600 in one State alone. Prom the financial point of view it is most advisable to reduce the duty, and this, again, would enable some of the men who have been put out of work to be re-employed. The special duty of 5s. a gallon, which was originally imposed in 1925, was mainly intended to protect the interests of Australian distilleries. The case for the local whisky distilleries has been drawn up as follows:The Australian whisky industry, as repreenormous national 'debt, and naturally sented by the distilleries previously menwe must lose no opportunity to increase tioned, earnestly request the Government to our revenue. seriously consider a reduction of tlie present time whisky duty, maintaining the present margin of protection, and believes that by so doing the many commodities, including whisky, amount of revenue from this source would be with the unfortunate result that we increased by reason of ithe consequent addihave tional consumption.

Revenue duties are designed to return the largest possible amount of revenue to the Treasury; but a moral issue concerning the liquor trade should be decided, not in this Parliament, but in the State legislatures. industry is protected' under the tariff shows that the moral issue does not arise. The honourable member desires to foster an Australian industry. if they so desire, will drink whisky, and if it is unobtainable they will drink hooch, as the people do in the United States of America. The Gommonwealth must deal with the control of spirituous liquors from the point of view of revenue only, and it will materially assist the Treasury, and also alleviate unemployment, if the duty on whisky is reduced to 33s. a gallon.

82,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"revenue from that source have not materialized. By increasing the customs and excise duty on whisky, we have reduced the consumption, not only of the imported article, but also of the locallynianufactured article. The import trade and the local trade are so interwoven that if one is destroyed the other is destroyed as well. The increased duties on whisky have led, not only to reduced revenue from that source, but also to increased unemployment. The honourable member for Richmond has indicated his intention to move for a reduction in the excise on whisky so as to place the Australian manufacturer on a footing equal to that of the importer. That is a most reasonable suggestion, and I hope that the Minister will accept it. The honourable member has also pointed out that the number of employees engaged in connection with the bottling and distribution of imported whisky and other spirits, and bottle and case-making within the Commonwealth, has greatly declined. He said that over 600 employees had been dismissed, but he omitted to mention that that decline in employment took place over a period of four months only. That is a clear indication of the extent to which unemployment is likely to be increased because of these additional duties. vernment, when it increased excise duties, made special reference to the number of employees in the Australian distilleries. I have made inquiries, and I find that in October, 1929, the number of distillery hands was 140. Since then nine more hands have been employed. The office staff has been increased by one hand, and the number of incidental hands by fourteen. So that since 1929, there has been an increase of some 24 hands, and, at the same time, this country has suffered a loss of £1,000,000 in revenue from whisky duties. The Government's greatest argument in favour of the imposition of heavy duties on whisky was that it would give an impetus to the local trade; would absorb the unemployed, and increase the expenditure on the production of whisky within Australia. ' The Government's hopes in that direction have failed miserably. The heavy duties have led to a loss of revenue from that source, and although 24 additional hands have been employed in the Australian distilleries, at least 50 per cent, of the hands engaged in the various branches of the trade throughout Australia have been dismissed. The imports of whisky in 1928, which was a normal year, amounted to 946,832, or nearly 1,000,000 imperial gallons. In 1928, 946,832 gallons were imported, and 209,103 gallons of Australian whisky were produced. In 1930, the imports totalled 329,749 gallons, and the Australian production was 168,866 gallons. I admit that the depression may have accounted to some extent for the big decline that is shown; but I remind the committee that the latest figures I have given relate to 1930, before the f u l l effect of the depression was felt. The imports for 1930 showed a decrease of not less than 685,530 proof gallons and the clearances of Australian whisky a decrease of 19,935 gallons below the average for the four years 1925 to 1928 inclusive. These decreases more than offset the gain resulting from the higher duties, and the net result is an alarming loss of revenue. In 1929-30 the revenue collected from these duties amounted to £1,971,000. For the first nine months of 1930-31 the total collection was £683,000. member say whether the reduction in the The Goconsumption of whisky has been attended the by a corresponding increase in the consumption of other forms of alcohol? official figures relate only to reputable brands of whisky. Unfortunately, illicit distillation is increasing by leaps and bounds, and although the official statistics show a decline in the recorded imports and production there is not necessarily a decline in the total consumption. Illicit whisky is being used for blending. immoral effects of the high tariff. with the honourable member. Moreover these unduly high duties result in the eonsumption of inferior whisky which is detrimental to public health and productive of crime. It would be wiser to let people have wholesome spirits instead of driving them to ""fire-water"" that is productive of ill-health and crime. In 1928, the revenue obtained from imported whisky was £1,656,956, and in 1930 it had dropped to £741,935. In 1928 the excise duty on Australian whisky was",22,Divisi On I

Honourable members have been supplied with a circular letter issued by the Wine and Spirit Association of New South Wales. After reading this letter one might come to the conclusion that the present rate of duty is entirely responsible for the reduced revenue, and for the reduced volume of employment in the businesses of members of the association. Indeed, so much has been stated in the circular, but it entirely ignores the effect of the existing depression, not only on the consumption of whisky, but on the sale of all luxury items, as well as of the necessaries of life. It is a feature of this depression good thing that it should be made in the that, even in industries engaged in supplycountry where it is consumed. The dising the necessaries of life, employment has been reduced by as much as 30 per cent., while in industries engaged in the supply of luxuries the percentage decrease in employment has been much greater. tariff has not had the effect of increasing employment ? counteracted the effect of the tariff. The national income has fallen off to the extent of £140,000,000 a year, and the people have not so much money with which to buy goods, whether produced here or brought from overseas. It is not surprising, there-' fore, to learn that employment throughout the whisky importing industry has declined by 44.5 per cent. This percentage is calculated on the figures contained in the statement issued by the Wine and Spirit Association of New South Wales. I have no means of checking their accuracy, and have accepted them for the [C2] purpose of this calculation. I have to compliment the association on the way it has put up its case; it has certainly made the best of the arguments available to it. With regard to the contention that the increased duty has so reduced consumption as to dry up a lucrative source of revenue, I desire first of all to draw attention to the rates of duty at present collected on whisky in the United Kingdom. There the import duty on whisky in casks varies from 75s. 5d. to 77s. 5d. per proof gallon, as against 45s. in Australia. asked for by any section of the community ? surveying the national finances, has come to the conclusion that this duty is fair and reasonable, having in mind the need for increasing the revenue. On whisky imported into Great Britain in bottles, the import rate varies from 75s. 5d. to 78s. 5d. per proof gallon, as compared with 50s. in Australia. imported into Great Britain? ties take steps, by the imposition of high duties, to check the importation of whisky. If whisky is to-be drunk, it is surely a tillers in Australia employ Australian labour, and buy annually 750,000 bushels of Australian-grown barley, if the British authorities insist on the payment of such high duties on whisky, they must be satisfied that the duties have not reached the stage where the law of diminishing return operates. The standard of living in Great Britain is lower than in Australia. In 1928, the import duty on whisky imported into Canada was 41s, 8d. per proof gallon, while in South Africa it was 45s -the same as in Australia. The New Zealand duty in 1928 wa3 36s. I do not know what increases have been made during the last three years, but it is almost certain that the duty has been raised, because New Zealand has experienced the same difficulty in balancing its budget as we have. There is a great difference between the duties imposed in Great Britain and those operating in Australia. The Australian rate on imported whisky is 45s.,",24,Divisi On I

Applying this 10 per cent, increase to the 1929-30 clearances in bond of imported whisky, and reducing the rate by 12s. a gallon as suggested, the result would be a fall in revenue to the extent of £372,049. This is on imported whisky alone; other spirit items would need to have the rates of duty reduced, and a pro rata reduction of 7s. 6d-. a gallon would have to be made in the excise duty on Australian whisky in order to preserve the existing rate of protection.

But eo-nsuinption figures for -the present financent, in the consumption of whisky; but cial .year will not nearly approximate the figures for 1929-30. Therefore, the estimated loss in revenue of £599,660 needs 'reviewing in the light of the figures for the nine months ended 31st March. These figures show that -222,546 gallons of imported whisky were entered for consumption in the period, while 111,174 gallons of Australian whisky were."" so entered. On those figures, it is -estimated that for the present financial year, -the clearances -of imported whisky will amount to -278,055 -gallons, and of Australian whisky, to 138,967 gallons. Those -re'tui-ns show a diminution 'of 67 per cent, -in imported whisky, and -a diminution 'of 49 ,per cent, in Australian whisky, compared with -the figures for 1929-30. The 'reduction, taking the two totals together, -is 63 per cent. Assuming Mr Forde. that a similar contraction has occurred in the purchases of other spirits, it can be stated that, assessed on the 1931 figures, the loss of revenue which would result from a reduction of duty to the extent of 12s. per gallon on imported spirit, and a pro rata reduction of the excise duty, would amount to £377,785. ter mean by.a pro rata reduction? the importers said that as they were not asking for an advantage over the Australian whisky manufacturers, they favoured a pro rata reduction of excise duties.

I urge honourable members not to hand over to the big whisky importing firms an additional £370,000, for we cannot honestly do it at a time like this. listened with interest to the speech of the Minister while he was. dealing with figures; but I lost interest in his remarks when he resorted to his usual ranting about these extraordinary duties mating possible the employment of additional people in this country. ""When he deals with Customs subjects from this angle it is unsafe to follow him far. principal question which faces us is whether we are likely to obtain increased revenue from the proposed smaller duty or from the-existing higher one. Surely it will not be denied that it is desirable for us to make commodities available to the people at the lowest possible price. Erom many points of view, the figures quoted by the Minister are unreliable. The details he gave us in regard to the British import duties, for instance, have no significance, for Great Britain manufactures all her own whisky. It would have been of some use to us had the Minister given the British excise duties. I suggest that we cannot regard the departmental figures which he gave us as being very reliable, for they were not arrived at by any scientific method. I noticed from the Minister's figures that a progressive increase has been made in whisky duties since 1924-25, and that during that period there has been a consistent reduction in the amount of whisky consumed. This supports the contention that the lower the duty the higher the consumption of whisky. I do not think that the Minister was quite fair to honourable members when he quoted certain figures for the year 1928-29, for that was an abnormal year. For some reason which we do not quite understand, the importers of whisky brought in very ' large quantities of spirit towards the end of that year. They may have felt that an increase in duty was likely. The depression was just commencing towards the end of that year. It would have been fairer had the Minister relied upon the import figures for the years 1924-25 to 1927-28. The average annual collection for those years was £1,720,823 while for the year 1929-30, it was only £741,935. The fall in consumption for the last year quoted was due to the excessive duty. The high price of imported whisky, due' to the heavy duties, caused a feeling of resentment on the part of consumers and (Perth) [4.10] I many of them refused to buy other than Australian whisky. An examination of the customs revenue discloses that there is a reasonable limit to every duty. In 1929 the Bruce-Page Government raised the duty on whisky to 37s. a gallon. That was thought to be the maximum figure that could be imposed without defeating the object of the duty. Economic conThe ditions are now much more difficult than they were in 1929. The people have not the money that they then had, and, therefore, cannot afford to pay higher prices for commodities. The increase in the duty to 45s. is prohibitive, and altogether beyond the present spending capacity of the community. I believe that a reduction would produce an amount of revenue at least equal to that now received, and would, in addition, enable the public to obtain more for the money expended. The reference by the Minister to a decrease of l d . a nobbier was not quite fair. Last night the honourable gentleman admitted that 75 per cent, of whisky sales are represented by bottle trade, the remaining 25 per cent, being nobbier purchases. A. reduction of 12s. a gallon in the rate of duty would represent a saving of 2s. a bottle on the wholesale price of whisky, and an even greater amount on its retail price. That would bring about additional sales, and substantially increase the revenue. One reason why it is not advisable to exclude Scottish whisky from the country at this juncture is that it will be a few years before .Australia has a whisky of sufficiently high quality to satisfy the general public. The production of the Australian article is as yet comparatively small. We have only one well-known brand, and its standard is considerably below the standard of approved imported whiskies. If we prematurely fostered a demand for the local product we should",27,Import Duties On Whisky
110,Mr Naien,"quickly have to fall back on immature whisky, to the detriment of both the consumer and the trade. It has been pointed out that Scotch whisky manufacturers are now operating in Geelong, and there is no doubt that ultimately they will produce a spirit approaching the Scottish standard. However, that will not be for at least four or five years, and in the inMcGrath. I suggest that the only action terim we should be entirely dependent on "" Old Court,"" of which there are insufficient supplies of matured spirit. It takes a number of years for whisky to mature. First, it is necessary to have a large first-class capital stock upon which the blenders draw yearly and turn into palatable whisky, periodically replenishing the original stock. It will be some years before that will be possible in Australia. Undoubtedly, the Government has gone tariff mad. It has increased the price of goods, thinking it to be a grand idea to keep up prices. I point out that nothing can be gained by such methods. If the Government did something to cheapen the price of products the public would be able to buy more, and so create additional employment. I recommend that the Go-' vernment should follow the middle and moderate course. For that reason I support the amendment. this is the first item of importance which represents a substantial increase in duty, I should like to take the opportunity of protesting against the presence of the schedule in this chamber at such a juncture. In view of the desperate financial position of Australia to-day, it really does to do the right thing by the country it uot matter whether the duties on whisky are doubled or halved. ""While we are engaged in discussing the duties on whisky, of all things, the country is trembling on the -brink of a financial abyss. If the Government had any proper consciousness of its responsibility this ter and his colleagues. We might very debate would immediately cease, and Parliament would adjourn. Instead of being engaged in this contemptible pretense of tariff making we should be before the country, affording the electors an opportunity to declare for some financial policy that would save Australia from disaster. ""With calamity imminent, we are kept here, engaged in a tariff debate, day after day, with the prospect of being detained for the next two to three months, all because the Government and its supporters are resolved that in no circumstances will they face the electors. Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to connect his remarks with the item before the committee. . taken in reference to the tariff to-day should be the validation of the schedules, with the object of allowing us to go to the country at once. This Government reminds me of Phil May's drunken man, who protested that he would do anything in reason, but he would not go home. This Government will do anything in reason, but it will not go to the country. it has a majority? not make use of its majority and do something useful for the country? Why does the Government allow this drift to be perpetuated ? order.

This item illustrates the extraordinary tariff-making ideas of the Minisproperly ask ourselves for what purpose was this additional duty imposed; to increase protection to an Australian industry, or to produce additional revenue? Obviously the increase was intended to improve our revenues. I ask the Minister to inform the committee who requested that the duty should be raised from 37s. to 45s. a gallon; whence came the sudden need for the change? The whole thing is wrapped in mystery.

I say definitely that nobody asked for it. as to which Minister imposed the duty; it was put on by this Government. The increase is incomprehensible, and an excellent illustration of the utter recklessof revenue? ness of the spirit Avith which the Government enters into tariff-making. The Minister treats the committee with contempt by bringing down a substantial increase of this nature merely for protective purposes and not having the courtesy to explain why the addition was made. The whole proceeding is typical of half the tariff activities of this Government. A l and in 1930 they were abnormally low, ready the local distillers had a protection both because of the depression and to the extent of 10s. a gallon, which the Government increases in one jump to 18s. There appears to be no chance of the Government accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), and I do not propose to occupy much of the time of the committee in debating it. I dispute the Minister's contention that excessive duties do not revenue. I can show the Minister very definitely, from figures supplied to me by his own department, that even when the duty on whisky was raised to 30s. a gallon it resulted in a diminished consumption, which reduced the revenue from that source. Mr C. gentleman hold those views when he was Minister for Trade and Customs? all confident that there would be any improvement in the revenue when I sponsored the increase of 2s. a gallon in the rate of duty, but I was prepared to give it a trial. This additional increase of 8s. must result in a sacrifice of revenue. For the financial year 1925-26 the total customs £2,011,000. Towards the close of the financial year 1925-1926, the late Mr the necessary revenue by means of the Pratten, then Minister for Trade and Customs, increased the import duty from 30s. to 35s. a gallon. That was in a boom period. The total revenue from the customs and excise duties on whisky in that year amounted to £2,011,000; in 1926-1927 it was £2,010,000; in 19271928, £1,982,000, and in 1928-1929, £1,896,000. In the latter year there was a falling off of substantially £100,000, despite the extra duty of 5s. a gallon. To my mind, those figures prove conclusively that increases in duties bring about a reduction of customs revenue. depression responsible for that reduction figures relating to boom years; but, on glancing at the figures relating to the depression period, one finds that from 1925 to 1928 the average annual revenue from these duties was £1,720,000. In 1929, the imports were abnormally high, because of the inflation of stocks in 1929. In the two years 1929 and 1930, the revenue fell to an average of £1,360,000, which was a drop, compared with the average for the previous four years, of £360,000. That reduction was, undoubtedly, due in some measure to the depression; but it would have taken place inevitably because of the abnormally high reduce either consumption or duties imposed. In 1913, the import duty wasi 14s. a gallon, and in that year the quantity of whisky imported into Australia was 2,251,000 gallons. In 1924-1925, the duty had been increased gradually from 14s. to 17s., 20s., 25s., and 27s., a gallon; but by 1925, the imports had fallen from 2,251,000 gallons to 1,200,000 gallons, or roughly, by of the argument advanced by the Minister that the higher the duties the greater will be the amount of revenue obtained. If the only object of piling up duties were to increase the revenue, how would local industries be encouraged ? The case presented by the Minister would not bear investigation. and excise revenue was all the whisky required in Australia were manufactured here.

Members are kept here to deal with the tariff because the Government and its supporters will not take the courageous Step of going to the country. The reduction of the duty proposed by the honourable, member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) seems to me to be somewhat excessive. I think that the interests concerned would have been well advised if they had been content to ask for a drop to 37s. a gallon. I would not support even that duty unless it were to be accompanied by a similar reduction in the excise duty. My reason for supporting such a reduction is that I believe that it would cause a substantial increase in revenue, which is so sorely needed at the present time. It seem3 to me that the present duties were put on hurriedly, without due consideration as to their effect. There appears to be considerable doubt as to the rate of import duty on spirits, and also the rate of excise, which would produce the greatest revenue That is an interesting problem which the Minister would be wise to investigate. I should like him to postpone temporarily the consideration of these duties, and to appoint a committee consisting of an officer of the Treasury interested in revenue, an officer of the Trade and Customs Department experienced in excise matters, and a member of the Tariff Board, to see if they could reach agreement as to the duties calculated to produce the maximum amount of revenue. As I understand that the Government intends to insist on this item as it stands, I shall not further discuss the matter. would not vote for a reduction of this duty if I did not think that it would cause an increase in the revenue. It seems to me to be essential at the present time, in dealing with duties on luxuries, to obtain the largest possible amount of revenue. that the proposed reduction of the duty would cause a loss of revenue to the extent of £3f5,000 a year. support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) to reduce the duty to 33s. a gallon; but I believe that, owing to the very high duty imposed, the consumption of spirit is greatly reduced, and the customs revenue suffers accordingly. I understand that this year the customs -revenue generally will be about £11,000,000 less than was anticipated, and the excessive duties imposed under the tariff are, undoubtedly, responsible for a big decline in customs receipts. If ,an amendment is moved to the effect that the whisky duty be reduced to 35s. a gallon, which was the amount fixed prior to the change made by the present Government, I will support it. I have no desire to do anything that might embarrass the Government in its efforts to obtain the maximum amount of revenue, but I believe that a return to the old rate would benefit the community by increasing the revenue. have listened to the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde). and I understand that at one period of the negotiations with the importing firms he showed a disposition to reduce the present duty of 45s. a gallon. I may be wrong in that belief. lutely inaccurate. Minister's speech this afternoon, I thought that he was prepared to consider a reduction of the duty, but was unwilling to reduce it to the extent proposed under my amendment ister's assurance on that point. I have already stated that, by fixing the duty at 33s. a gallon, I thought that the greatest possible amount of revenue would be obtained; but, on further consideration, and after hearing the debate that has ensued, I am prepared to alter my amendment to make the duty 35s. a gallon, the rate determined by this Parliament in 1925.

All its capital and shareholders and all the employment it gives are overseas; certainly the firms associated with it are British, but we should not deliberately discriminate against Australians. The item does not involve any considerations of revenue, and despite the Minister's statement, bottling in bond does not ensure the purity of the spirit sold to the consumer. There is no guarantee that the spirit sold over the counter will be the original contents of the bottle. In any case it is not the function of the Commonwealth to guarantee the purity of the liquors sold on licensed premises; that is the responsibility of the States. Therefore, I hope that the committee will repeat its vote of yesterday, and disallow the extra duty, which benefits a huge whisky combine to the definite disadvantage of thousands of people in this country.

If the 5s. additional impost is not removed from whisky, a definite preference will be given to the whisky combine. By accepting the amendment the Minister would be paying regard to the interests of thousands of licensed victuallers, particularly those who are away from the principal seaports and have no conveniences for bottling in bond. The whisky combine have an advantage over all competitors. chants and hotel keepers in the country are not in the same advantageous position as the large importers who have bottling establishments at the ports of entry. In the past a publican could import bulk whisky, get it out of bond, and blend it on his own premises. But this duty will practically compel bottling in bond. To overcome this the cost to licensed victuallers to bottle in bond would be prohibitive. That is most unfair to the wine and spirit merchants and licensed victuallers. The duty will not assist Australian industry; it will merely benefit the big importers, and help the illicit distiller by practically eliminating the competition of reputable draught whisky. All honourable members who supported the amendment of the brandy item yesterday expressed themselves opposed to the principle of penalizing those who bottled out of bond, and they and also the Minister intended their remarks to apply to the item now before the committee.

Surely the first consideration of the Government should be the preservation of human life. Everybody knows that by means of chloroform is a very dangerous state to induce, and the slightest defect in the drag itself may cause a patient's death. In the ""whole of my experience I have never known any chloroform other than Duncan and Flockharts to be used for therapeutic purposes, even though cheaper chloroform was available. The higher duty, therefore, is not likely to result in an increased consumption of locally made chloroform, and if it does, the effect may be to cause a considerable loss of human life.

( B ) In bottle, per gallon, 19s.; inter. mediate, 19s.; general, 22s. In this case a higher duty is imposed on wine imported in bottles than on wine coming in in bulk. The Minister has been at considerable pains to justify the action of the Government in imposing a severe penalty upon those who import whisky in bulk, tlte alleged object being, among other things, to protect the interests of local bottlers. In item 13, however, the reverse policy is being followed. Tbe duty on bulk wine is 16s 6d. to 18s., while on bottled wine it is from 19s. to 22s. If it is desirable that the interest of the public be protected by having spirits bottled under customs supervision, why should not the same principle apply in respect to wine? has been imposed on bulk spirits in order to encourage the bottling of the spirits in Australia. anaesthesia on chloroform, will the Minister expedite the consideration of this item by the Tariff Board?

That would lead to the use of Australian bottles, cases, and other material. Many other countries have taken steps to encourage the bottling of wine within their own borders. South Africa, Canada, Germany, France, and the United States of America are notable instances -Australia manufactures about 99 per cent. of the wine which she consumes. This has been made possible by the protection granted under the provisions of the various tariff schedules since 1921. The increase of 4s. per gallon provided for in this item is intended to assist the revenue; and this particular provision is intended to encourage the employment of Australians.

Although yesterday he said that the consumers of spirit should not be left to the mercy of small importers of draught spirits, to-day he says that it is quite all ment should be moved to this item to right to leave them to the mercy of the importers of draught wine. The Minister's arguments are entirely contradictory. Yesterday he said that the Australians importing draught spirit were dishonest; to-day he says that the foreigners sending draught wine here are honest. He has cast a stigma upon the Australian people who desire to bottle spirit. He refused for one second to subscribe to the view that the people handling draught whisky and brandy in Australia were honest, though he now says that the people who send draught wine here from overseas are honest. wine is imported. the honourable member that he represents a district in which a good deal 'of wheat is grown. Apparently he is now supporting the Minister in imposing a revenue duty on the very small quantity of wine that we import, although that action must have the effect of antagonizing France and Italy, which are large purchasers of our wheat, wool, and other commodities. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his position and recommit the whisky and brandy items so that we may eliminate the special impost of 5s. per gallon on spirit not bottled in bond, and deal with it in the same way that he now proposes to deal with wine. for Trade and Customs) [5.35] I thought I had made it quite clear that as we were importing only about 1 per cent, of our wine, it was not worth our while making provision for the imposition of an extra duty of 5s. per gallon on wine bottled out of .bond; but if hon-. orable members opposite want such a duty to be imposed, and will move an amendment to that effect, X will give sympathetic consideration to it. It has long been the custom for other nations to encourage the bottling of wine and spirits in their own country, and the Government's policy has been designed to encourage the adoption of that policy in Australia. The Commonwealth tariff has for many years provided an extra duty in respect to spirit imported in bottles. I object to having words put into my mouth. I did not suggest that an amendprovide for the imposition of an additional duty of 5s. per gallon in respect of wine not bottled in bond. I protested against the adoption of a policy which has increased the revenue to a very small amount, but has resulted in the antagonizing of France and Italy. I asked the Minister to recommit the items which provided for the extra duty on whisky not bottled in bond, so that that spirit may be dealt with on the same basis, as that on which it is now proposed to deal with wine not bottled in bond. I object to the contradictory attitude adopted by the Minister in this regard. [5.40] -The Minister is getting himself into a worse position every time he speaks. He has just given us a demonstration of a double somersault. We desire that the principle which is being adopted in regard to wine shall also be adopted ih regard towhisky. When the Minister yesterday advocated the imposition of a special duty of 5s. per gallon on spirit not bottled in bond, he said, in justification of his action, that it was in the interests of the health of the Australian people, and that it would insure that they would receive an article of good quality, true*to label. Is it of no concern to the honourable gentleman that the people should also receive wine of good quality, true to label. Some of this wine may be manufactured in blacklabour countries.

The double somersault which the Minister has performed will not increase our confidence in his ability to administer this departmeut. hope that the item relating to whisky will be recommitted so that similar provisions may be made for the bottling of bulk whisky and brandy as for the bottling of bulk wine. Minister keeps on referring to the 1 per cent, of wine which we import. Surely he cannot have vermouth in mind, for we probably still import the bulk of our vermouth from Italy and France. Apparently vermouth may be adulterated to any extent, while whisky must be watched. wren should be good for the robin. the workers of Australia consume ? with the tariff for the benefit of any one class, but for the people as a whole. Take the case of sparkling wine. I do not suppose that our importations of this class of wine are heavy, but the Minister would not suggest that bulk importations are practicable. This wine must be admitted already bottled. It is deplorable that we should be asked to agree to a heavy increase in the duty on an insignificant line, such as vermouth, which comes from France and Italy, seeing that the duty must antagonize these countries which are large buyers of our wheat, wool, and other primary products. The imposition of this duty must be exceedingly injurious to the interest of the primary producers of Australia. The production of vermouth in Australia can have but little effect upon our revenue. The item substantiates all the criticism about this crazy tariff-made-in-a-hurry. There is no such a thing as a good, sound, tariff that can be made in a hurry. Any tariff originated in that fashion always overlooks the indirect consequences, and there has never been a tariff against which that charge could be levelled more truly than the present one. very easy for the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and his colleagues to criticize this item, and incidentally to ; Tanff. 1849 exploit a subject to which they have referred on many previous occasions. Much has been said about the trade relations between Australia and I Italy and France. I agree that those countries are good customers of ours; but I point out that although honourable gentlemen opposite were in office for between eight and ten years, they failed to provide any reciprocal trade agreement between Australia and those countries whereby real preference could be given to them. This item has my entire support. It has had the effect of bringing about the establishment of a vermouth factory iu my own electorate, at a cost of many thousands of pounds, 90 per cent, of the value of which will be expended in Australia. I submit that the item is in keepthe ing with the policy for which this Government stands. I am in favour of this duty on imported vermouth. Although the item has been introduced in a recent schedule, it has already brought about the good results to which I have referred. Substantial orders have been placed by Ginzano& Company for bottles, straw envelopes, cases, and other articles that will be required in their business, all of which will provide additional employment at a time when it is much needed. I should like to know how honourable members of the Country party stand with regard to this item. It is easy to indulge k in carping criticism; but how do the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), and the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) stand in this matter ? At the present time practically the whole of the vermouth consumed in Australia is made out of foreign imported wines. The firm of Cinzano& Company will use 20,000 gallons of Australian wine each year in the manufacture of vermouth. Seeing that the wine industry is to benefit substantially as a result of this new item, it will be interesting to know whether the honourable members to whom I have referred will support this duty, although they have subjected it to cheap sneers, or whether they will contest it.

I do not desire the consumers, of tobacco to. be subjected to excessive hardship because of the imposition of additional duties, the Government declared that the duties on tobacco would be almost entirely in favour of the Australian tobacco-growers. I believe that it was a feature of the Government's propaganda at the last election that there would be no increase, not only on the necessaries of life, but on tobacco and alcohol. Too frequently tobacco is classed as a luxury, as something that can be dispensed with by the average worker. Actually it is almost a necessity. It is nearly as indispensable to the smoker as are bread, tea,, or the clothes he wears, Rightly or wrongly, he will spend part of his weekly wage on it. Therefore, any definite increase in the cost, of tobacco, be it of the pipe, cigarette, or cigar variety, is to the appointment of the committee because be avoided, if possible. I am not at all convinced that all of the increases in the schedule are necessary, or. that the tobacco tha^ it was entirely unnecessary, and that industry in Australia required this additional -stimulus. I . have before me the Melbourne Herald of the 28rd January, 1930, which contains a summary, by Mr Harold Burston, of the annual report of the British ..Tobacco Company (AusMillion Profit from Tobacco"". Why then are we being subjected to this welter of additional duties, which must inevitably favour the tobacco trust f protested vigorously against the increased until this or some other Government is prepared to level working conditions between those who labour on Australian tobacco farms, and those who work in our tobacco factories, we cannot begin to do justice to the people on the land. Some yearn ago I went into the matter of the manufacture of Australian cigars. The Tobacco Workers. Union urged me to give them assistance in various ways, through the t.ariff. I discovered that when they were working full time those men were earning from £10 to £11 a week, whioh definitely increased the price of Australian cigars. It is not a question of whether we can compete with the overseas product, but whether we can produce an article that will be 'popular because of its moderate price. My idea of a tariff is not that it should give workers £10 to £11 a week at the expense, of the consumers. I am prepared to give these new duties a trial, but I consider it calamitous that while tobacco can be grown in Australia relatively easily and cheaply, its price should be made oppressive because of the wages paid to employees in the industry. The working man's tobacco, from Cap-, stan cigarettes up, now costs twice as much as it. did before the war. I wish to refer briefly to the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry, some seventeen months ago. It has been said that I opposed the committee's appointment in the interests of the great tobaoco oombine. That faptor did not enter into my opposition.

My object in rising is to submit a case presented to me by the Federated Tobacco Workers Union. I brought this matter forward during the general debate on the tariff, for the purpose of obtaining a reply from the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde), and from the honourable members who sat on the select committee that recently inquired into the tobacco industry. I believe that that committee made a thorough investigation, and took evidence from various organizations and interested parties. satisfactory answer can be given to the case that has been presented to me, or a means provided to meet the complaint of the union, I hope that the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bright and lemon leaf, the lasting period, nineJones) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) will furnish it, because they were members of the select 'committee and have had the opportunity to examine fully the whole of the ramifications of the tobacco industry.

I recognize that this matter cannot be dealt with easily by a member who has not had an opportunity of investigating the conditions in the industry in detail, and I intend, therefore, to submit the case for the union with a view to obtaining information. First of -all, I wish to make it quite clear that I am not speaking in the interests of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, because I recognize that that company has exploited the people right and left. to-^day. been made to its profit of £1,000,000, which is such as cannot be .explained. -amount represent .on the company's invested capita;!? information offhand. I propose to read extracts from a letter that I have received from the federal secretary of the Tobacco Workers Union. He statesThe import duty on American leaf has been increased from 3s. to 5s. 2d. per lb., resulting in increased prices to the smoking public and bringing about a huge swing over to the Australian manufactured tobaccoes, owing to cheaper prices and economic circumstances caused by unemployment and wage reductions now operating. If the import duty has caused the public to demand Australian leaf, there can b'e no complaint on that score. But the letter goes on to show that the supply of Australian leaf is limited, and, therefore, it is impossible to meet the demand of the If a Australian public for cheap tobacco. The letter continuesThis has resulted in a rapid exhaustion of the local product, of which, in 1928, large surpluses were held. In one big firm alone, tbe stocks held in 1928 were as follows:teen months; No. 1 dark leaf, 74 months; No. 2, 4(1 months; total in all grades, 49 months. Within two years this has now reached the exhaustion stage, and the above manufacturers have notified tiie wholesale distributing houses and tobacconists throughout the Commonwealth, tliat a system of rationing of stocks is now in operation until the 193.1 crop of Australian loaf is harvested. It has been the custom, over a number of years, for the purpose of maturing leaf, to hold the crop for at least twelve months, but present conditions in their owing to the shortage and the demand, they will be forced to immediately manufacture the leaf as it is received from the growers. The same position has been created at Dudgeon and Arnells, tobacco manufacturers, of Melbourne, who mainly rely on the Australian leaf; most of their brands being 100 per cent. Australian. This firm has notified the officers of 'the federation that, if no relief can be obtained in relation to partial l if t in g of the tariff duty on imported leaf, they will be forced to dismiss the whole of their employees at the end of June, owing to the fact that the smoking public w ill not, or cannot, pay the prices now operating.

The total amount of import duty, 5s. 2d., added to the excise on manufactured tobacco of 2s. 4d._, brings the amount to 7s. 6d. per lb. on tobacco manufactured from imported leaf. The prices to the smoking public are as follows:-No. 1 Australian aromatic, 7s. per Ib.j No. 2 dark, 5s. 2d. I have read sufficient of the letter to explain the case that I am presenting on behalf of the tobacco-workers. Although Australian-grown popular, the tobacco-growers are unable to meet the demand, and thus enable tobacco to be supplied to the people at a reasonable price. The union indicates that if , by some means, the importation of the American leaf could be regulated, to prevent the storage of large quantities of American leaf to the detriment of the Australian _ grower, work would be provided for those who are threatened with unemployment. I hope that the Minister will address the committee on this matter, so that honourable members may be assured that the course adopted by the Government will not cause more unemployment.

This particular case was not submitted to the select committee. I do not know whether the union thought that I would be hostile to it, or unsympathetic. The committee had a few brushes with representatives of the union, and the probability is that they thought that we might not be interested in their view of the industry. What has been said by the honourable member for West Sydney is probably correct. It is a fact that the heavy duty on imported leaf has caught the Australian manufacturers napping; but, to a great extent, that is their own fault. AlthoughI do not accuse them of misrepresentation, they led the members of the committee to believe that they were heavily loaded with stocks of Australian tobacco. In fact, the principal manufacturer-the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, whicli supplies about 90 per cent, of the Australian market-gav e the committee to understand that it had stocks on hand to last for six years. out that the bulk of that tobacco was unusable. all been used since. poses. that the company has used everything in its stores that looks like tobacco. told me that he had not expected to dispose of it, but that it had sold like hot cakes. mixture."" that, owing to the heavy demand for Australian tobacco, which is marketed at a lower rate than that made from the imported leaf, the Australian manufacturers have exhausted their stocks of locally-grown leaf sooner than was expected. Buti t is remarkable that, within a few months of the imposition of this duty, their six-years' stocks have vanished. The moment the company could not maintain its old rate of profit, it began to use its accumulated stocks of Australian leaf in the manufacture of its various products. I am not a connoisseur of Australian tobacco, but, from what I have seen of the alleged imported brands, I should say that they are fairly heavily impregnated with Australian-grown leaf. This shows that the local manufacturers have themselves to blame for the present position. They did not encourage the manufacture of locallygrown leaf until they were forced to do it. done everything to prevent the encouragement of the local industry. command of the situation for the last 30 years, and for the whole of that period they have adopted the policy of concentrating on the American market for their supplies of leaf. The members of the select committee found it very difficult to fathom the policy and the motives of the gentlemen representing the tobacco combine.

Owing to that difficulty, the committee could only conjecture what that policy had been for many years past. We did not desire to impute any sinister motive to the combine. One reason was that we had not at our disposal evidence of such a motive, and we desired to base our report upon facts., and not upon guess-work. We reached the conclusion that this combine, which came into existence in 1904, when it absorbed most of the small manufacturing companies in Australia, decided that the local production of tobacco leaf was insufficient to build up a local manufacturing market, the only available supplies in any quantity being in the United States of America.

The select committee was appointed in the first place by the Bruce Page Government, when the honourable member for Henty was Minister for Trade and Customs, and at that time he honourable member that this much-abused I of Australia have applied for copies, and written to myself or some other member of the committee for copies.

202,Mr Thompson,"I point out to theconclusively that there is an intense interest in the report, whereas many reports submitted to this Parliament are merely distributed to honourable members and quickly forgotten. Any honourable member who is sufficiently concerned in the industry to read the report of the committee must disagree with the statement of the honourable member for Henty that the report is practically valueless. able member who has made that statement, and I can only conclude that either he is wholly prejudiced against this industry, or he has not read the report. I have a deep suspicion that he has merely read the recommendations of the committee. I must admit that his statement to-night is much more rational than any of his previous statements on the subject of tobacco. I take that as a hopeful sign, and I trust that he may yet become an ardent supporter of the Australian tobacco industry. The select committee was appointed by the Bruce Page Government just prior to the federal election of 1929. That Government was defeated, and the committee automatically expired. When a new Parliament assembled the present Government promptly re-appointed the committee. I have no party feeling in this matter. Ever since I have been in Parliament I have been an active champion of the Australian tobacco industry, and I am prepared to give this Government every credit for what it has done to assist it. The attitude of the Minister has been friendly and helpful, and I am convinced that the definite policy of the Government is to establish the tobacco industry. word I have heard said for this Government. from my own personal experience. I was assured by the members of the Government that they intended to establish the tobacco-growing industry, provided that the report of the select committee was favorable. When the report came to hand, the Government promptly made an important alteration in the tariff schedule. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) contends that the present duty of 5s. 2d. per lb. on imported leaf is far too high. He can see no justification for it, and he seems to assume that that duty has been imposed as a result of the report of the select committee. I assure him that that is not so. The present duty is entirely the result of the shortage of government funds. The previous duty was 3s. 6d. per lb. The present Minister, when Acting-Minister for Trade and Customs, He is the only honor-endorsed, without any referenceto the select committee, an alteration of the excise on imported raw leaf and local raw leaf from 2s. 4d. to 4s. 4d. per lb., an increase of 2s. per lb. That increase, without any corresponding increase in import duty, aimed a death blow at the local industry. The Minister's action was totally at variance with the recommendation of the committee, and had it been persisted in, every tobacco-growing enterprise in Australia would have been compelled to close down. The increased excise was of no assistance to the local manufacturer. The members of the committee pointed out to the Minister the error of his policy. He conferred with the officers of his department, and it was then revealed that the main objective of the heavy increase in excise was to secure an additional revenue of £1,000,000. The members of the committee were all convinced that the import duties should be considerably increased, but they did not -suggest that these should be increased to 5s. 2d. That increase was suggested to the Minister by the officers of his department, who had calculated on the basis of importations, that that rate of duty was necessary to produce the revenue required by the Government. effect upon the industry? be the position. The Minister asked the members of the committee whether the increased duty would have a detrimental effect upon local consumption, and whether it would increase the price of imported manufactured tobacco to such an extent as to kill practically any desire for smoking on the part of the community. That view, of course, had been put to him by the manufacturers. We assured the Minister that, although the duty was perhaps high, and not absolutely necessary in view of the position of the industry, yet there was no alternartive if",41,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty

206,Mr Thompson,"That appeared totho Government wished to obtain a revenue of £1,000,000 from that source. We did ask him to reduce the excise by 2s. per lb., and he agreed to do so. The excise was consequently reduced to the old rate of 2s. 4d. per lb. on imported and Australian leaf, and the increase in the import duty from 8s. 6d. to 5s. 2d. per lb. was made effective. That, of course, gave an enormous protection to the Australian article. Nearly every one associated with the Australian tobaceo industry has always insisted that, provided that the whole of the excise was lifted from the Australian leaf only, it was not necessary to impose a heavy or prohibitive duty on the imported leaf. Various Ministers have gone into that question, and for some reason that has never been satisfactorily explained, they have taken the stand that for excise putposes it is impracticable to separate the local leaf from the imported leaf, and that there must be a flat rate of excise on both classes of leaf. It was contended that in the manufacture of tobacco the proportion of local leaf used with imported leaf could not be ascertained, and that, therefore, the lifting of the excise from Australian leaf only was altogether out of the question. In those circumstances the tobacco-growing"" interests of Australia were compelled to ask for a considerable increase in the import duties, and their request was eventually granted. I make that statement to show that the honourable member for Henty is wrong in assuming that this heavy import duty has been imposed as the result of the report of the select committee. The duty was imposed to protect the tobacco-growing interests, and to increase Commonwealth revenue. It will be generally agreed that tobacco is a luxury, although it is a neces1922 to 1927, the profits of the Britishsary luxury, and that the industry is able to carry a certain amount of taxation.' At present it is being taxed too heavily, not by the Government, but by tlie tobacco combine. If the tobacco manu^ facturers had any heart at all, if they were Australian in spirit and had a desire to make a friendly gesture to the workers of Australia, they would make some sacrifice in this time of depression. But their policy is to pass on every farthing of this increased duty to the unfortunate public, and maintain their pre-depression flat rate of profit. Although every other industry in Australia has suffered from the depression of the last few years, the great British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and Godfrey Phillips Company, a branch of the great British tobacco combine which has recently been established in Australia, appear to he determined at all costs to maintain their old prosperity rate of profit, and to have a definite coldblooded policy of passing on to the consumers every half penny they possibly can. Prom 1919 to 1921 the net annual profit of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company was just over £500,000. In the same period £628,000 a year was distributed in the form of bonus shares from subsidiary companies. This big combine has quite a lot of subsidiary companies. Mi-.

I read the report and found that the references it made to the company were most eulogistic. what the honourable member said that he could not have read the report of the select committee. The figures I am now quoting are taken from that report. From Australasian Tobacco Company amounted to £750,000 a year-in 1927, they were £786,000-and the amount distributed as bonus shares from the subsidiary companies was £2,250,000. TheD the company decided that these earnings were not sufficient and from 1928 to 1930, the profits exceeded £1,000,000 a year. They are now on a steady £1,000,000 a year. Every year the dividend paid has been maintained at from 10 to 12 per cent., excluding the profit derived from subsidiary companies.

211,Mr Thompson,"I gathered fromof this wealthy combine have been making out of the people of Australia, yet the combine now wants the import duties lifted for a period to enable it to import sufficient tobacco to meet the local demand which it says the local growers are unable to supply. It says that if its request is not granted it will be out of tobacco, and its employees will have to be dismissed. ""Why cannot it increase the consumption of imported tobacco for a period by dispensing with some of its profits? Why cannot it say that during the prevailing depression it will be satisfied with half its ordinary profit? It will not do so. Its desire is to maintain of over £1,000,000 a year, and it prefers to come to this Parliament complaining that it has been practically crucified by the high duties on tobacco. The position created by the duties is undoubtedly a difficult one. The select committee had no power to investigate the profits of the tobacco combine, but it is a matter that must be taken into consideration in connection with the application made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) on behalf of the Tobacco Workers Union. If the extra impost is left on for two or three years the Australian tobacco industry will become established, and by increasing the excise duty, the Government can recover the revenue it is losing on the import duties. This is really the first year in which the Australian industry has had a chance, and the position is made difficult for the Australian public because smokers are being made to pay through the nose for tobacco, mainly because of the greed of the big tobacco manufacturers. seems to be no way of overcoming that difficulty, but on the other hand, if any action is taken this year which tends to discourage the interests that are now going into the production of tobacco in Australia, we might just as well abandon the project of establishing tobacco-growing in Australia for all time. Despite adverse seasons we have this year increased the production of tobacco leaf by 44 per cent., and I believe that within four years the increased production will be as high as 144 per cent. Despite adverse seasons, if we maintain the policy of protection, in five years' time. I am sure that it will be unnecessary to import 1 lb. of tobacco, even for flavoring Mr Thompson. purposes, because we can even grow Turkish tobacco in Australia. In fact, we can grow every kind of tobacco, good, bad, or indifferent. The select committee proved, as the result of its investigations, that the allegations that Australian tobacco was unfit for smoking were absolutely unfounded. In any case, if the committee had not established this fact, the economic position would have done so, because the Australian people are now not able to pay the price demanded for imported tobaccoes-it is ridiculously high-and are being driven to smoke Australian tobacco, with no resultant in the dividend crease in the death rate so far as I have seen. The fact that the big combines are demanding more and more of the locally-produced tobacco, and say that they cannot get all they want to meet the demand, knocks the bottom out of their previous argument that the Australian public has no desire to smoke brands made from Australian leaf. I trust that honourable members will not be influenced by any statement to the effect that the duties imposed by the present Government are too high. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Mackay) -The honourable member's time has expired. As no other honourable member wishes to speak at this juncture, the honourable member may take the second period allowed to him under the Standing Orders. £8.25] I admit it is not fair to the Australian smoking public to have to pay too much for its tobacco or to be obliged There to smoke inferior brands. The price is too high, and I dare say that inferior brands are being smoked. The tobacco manufacturers are using everything they can lay their hands on to supply to the public. But we have to face the position that it will take at least two or three years for Australia so to increase its production as to make it largely independent of importations. If we are to falter in this policy for even a few months, we might as well abandon the attempt to establish the industry, and admit that the manufacturers are too strong for us. I do not suggest that there is any sinister motive behind the application of the manufacturers for a concession, but it is a matter that must be watched very",43,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty
212,Mr Thompson (New England),"closely. If the Government lifts the duties, or allows a certain quantity of imported tobacco to come in for a period At a lower rate of duty to meet a temporary shortage, the manufacturers may take advantage of it for their own ends. It is quite possible that they may dismiss many of their employees to make this Parliament panicky, and to create a feeling of revulsion against the local industry. I do not say that they would do this, and, as a matter of fact, it would not suit their financial interests to do so, but, in order to achieve a certain purpose, a tremendous combine can afford to lose a few thousand pounds by reducing its factory output for a few months. It could even afford to reduce its output for a year to reach a position that it would consider sound for itself. I do not say that the Auscigarettes shorter and narrower, and only tralian combine has that policy in mind. I am simply indicating that if the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) acts upon the stories told to him by the representatives of the combine, without a thorough investigation of the facts, he may easily play into the hands of this huge monopoly. It would be all right if the great manufacturers gave some evidence that they were really sympathetic with not only the growers, who are practically independent of them to-day, but also the smoking public. It appears to me that the smoker is being used by the manufacturers as the stick with which to beat the growers. A hostile feeling is being created by the high price of imported brands, and it is being broadcast that the high prices of imported brands are due to the fact that a few growers in Australia are being pampered. I have heard it said that, although many people aT6 anxious to see the Australian production increase, they resent being hurt, so far as their pockets are concerned, in order to bring about that desired result. There is no great desire on their part to make a sacrifice, and there should not be any need for a sacrifice in face of the tremendous profit the manufacturers are making. ThcBe manufacturers are the wealthiest profit-makers in Australia to-day. There would be no need for the smokers to be hurt if the British Australasian Tobacco Company and the Godfrey Phillips combine would only cease their policy of passing on the extra duties to the last farthing. They ought to say, "" We recognize that the country is in a bad way, and that the Government must have money. For many years past we have done very well out of the Australian public, and we will bear our share of the sacrifice and reduce our profits by half in order to give the workers of Australia inenty of tobacco."" I do not suggest that they should forgo all profits, but they could well afford to reduce them by 50 per cent, in a time like this, instead of trying to maintain a rate which was very high even before the depression set in. We would then feel sympathetic towards them, and any request for accommodation over a trying period would receive a much more favorable hearing. Instead, the combine takes one cigarette from each box, makes the half fills them, enormously increases the prices of best brands of tobacco, and maintains the prices of Australian brands too high. While the company takes f u l l toll of the public, it does not forgo 6d. of its profits. Apparently the honourable member for Warringah is sympathetic towards the combine. able member's criticism is unfair. He has made a lot of insinuations, but has not advanced one fact in support of them. member does not want facts in regard to this matter. While this monopoly is so greedy that it will not relinquish one penny of profit even in a time of depression, despite the fact that it has been on a wonderfully good wicket for 30 years, this Parliament should not go out of its way to be generous to it. employer in Australia. but the tobacco industry is a close preserve. There are about 5,000 members in the Tobacco Workers Union, and all are employed by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. They are part of the combine, and naturally) their sympathies are with it. The select committee experienced great difficulty in getting reliable evidence from members of the union, because cross-examination revealed that they were advocating the interests of the combine.

216,Mr Thompson,"That may be so,the union have interviewed many members, and have worried the Minister continuously. In my opinion, they are suspect, and although they claim to be advocating the interests of their members, we should inquire closely whether they are not really representing the manufacturers. If they prove their bona fides, their claims should be investigated thoroughly and sympathetically. I acknowledge that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has rendered good service; its products have been invariably of high quality, its organization is thorough, it has been a good employing agency, and has undoubtedly given Australia for many years tobacco as good as is to be found anywhere in the world; but, after making due allowance for those virtues, the fact remains that it has charged very highly for its services and products. It has done nothing for nothing, and since it obtained control of about 90 per cent, of th© Australian market it has steadily built up its profits from a paltry £250,000 ten or fifteen years ago, to approximately £1,000,000 annually. profits do not reveal all the money that the company is making, because it is interested in subsidiary enterprises, the .profits from which it keeps dark, as it is entitled to do. If the Government were not so much in need of revenue, the duty could be reduced by 8d. or 9d. without risking great injury to the Australian industry; but. I do not think such a reduction would be advisable, having regard to, the needs of the Treasury and the fact that the manufacturers are showing no, inclination to adjust their demands to, the less prosperous ejrcumstanees of the community, but on the. contrary are determined to squeeze the last penny of profit out of the consumers. ringah) [8.3:7] -If the Minister had given an intelligent' explanation of these duties, indicating whatproportion is protective and what imposed for revenue purposes, the committee would be better qualified to debate the item. All we knowis that very high duties have been imposed on every class, of tobacco. The Labour party's campaign director in New South Wales( Mr Theodore) said at Leiehhaudt during the last federal election campaign, that the Labour party would' never place an additional* burdenon the worker by increasing the customs duties on his tobacco. Yet the Government of which he is now a member is imposing the most grinding taxation upon tobacco and other necessaries of the working man. I would gladly vote against this item if I had the opportunity, but apparently the supporters of the Government are quite content to tax the workers' tobacco, and the Country party, which pretends to be in favour of lower duties, is adopting a similar attitude. I accept no responsibility for these unwarranted imposts. A long speech on the item before the committee would not effect any change in the attitude of the majority of honourable members, but I shall be glad to deal with this subject on the election platform at the earliest opportunity which the Government is prepared to afford. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) has delivered many speeches upon tobacco, but although I listened intently to his insidious attack The declared upon the tobacco combine I was unable to discern in it any concrete charge. No, but the honourable member's speech was full of insinuations and gross imputations to the effect that the combine is grinding profits out of the Australian people. combine is an outrageous profiteer. The honourable member has now stated iu plainer and more vulgar language what he was insinuating throughout his speech, which extended over half an hour. If there is justification for his statement that the combine controls the whole of the tobacco manufacture and output in Australia, and that its employees and the oonsumers are held in its relentless grasp, I am surprised that he should support excessive duties which will merely increase the company's capacity for evil . 1 able member for New England make those chargesi in the report of the select committee of which he was chairman?: Be should have done so, especially as he regards the report of such value that he calmlystated that theinvestigationcost",45,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty

The honourable member has an obsession regarding a few tobacco-growers in his electorate. not commensurate with its cost. report is not worth the amount it has cost, and provides another instance of the wasting of public money. If there are all the evils associated with the tobacco industry that the honourable member for New England suggests, this Parliament has no right to further increase duties, and give one company an opportunity to profiteer to the extent mentioned. As the honourable member for New England quoted the profits of the company, and did not give its capital, we are unable to determine whether those profits are reasonable or otherwise. According to recent stock exchange quotations, shares in the British-Australasian Tobacco Company are showing a return of only 5£ or 5^ per cent., and, therefore, the profits of the company are not exces-"" sive. Before an honourable member makes allegations, imputations, or reflections concerning an important and efficiently conducted industry, he should be sure of bis facts. He should not make any statement which he cannot substantiate. In Division IT"" Tobacco and manufactures thereof"", it is proposed, with the aid of the representatives of workers opposite, to increase the duty, which in 1928 was 5s. 7d., to 9s. 3d. Other grades are being increased from 5s. 4d. to 9s., and from 12s. to 16s., while the rate on cigars as compared with 1928 is to be increased from 12s. to 20s. When revenue is required, tobacco is a legitimate source from which to obtain it. We have not been told by the Minister bow much of the amount obtained from these duties is for revenue purposes, and the extent of their protective incidence. I leave it to the Government to justify its pared to accept the opinion of the tobaccoaction in placing upou the workers of this Having regard to the country these excessive duties, which have been imposed notwithstanding the statement of the Treasurer prior to the last general election that no such duties would be imposed. This schedule has been thrown upon the table, the whip has been cracked, and honourable members opposite will rally round the Government irrespective of the effect of such excessive duties upon those whom they are supposed to represent. As I consider that the duties are entirely unwarranted, I intend to oppose them. Mr J01TES (Indi) [8.53] -As a The value of the report is representative of an electorate in which The during the past few years more than one-half of the tobacco produced in Australia has been grown, I am pleased to support the duties imposed in this item. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the persistence which the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) has displayed in assisting the tobacco industry. He deserves great praise for all he has done to develop this important branch of primary production, and I am sure he is pleased to see that his efforts have not been in vain. I was also pleased to hear him give praise to this Government, though only a modicum, for assisting him in getting the appointment of a seject committee, after he had been unable to secure similar assistance from the Government which he supported for some years. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) strenuously opposed the appointment of the select committee, of which the honourable member for New England was the chairman, and it is on record that when the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) tried to talk out the motion the honourable member for New England moved the closure, which was carried, as also was the motion for the appointment of the select committee. When the report of the select committee was presented, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) said that it was not worth the paper on which it was printed, but the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), when complaining of the expense incurred in its production, said that there was a great demand for copies. It would be interesting to know which honourable member is right. I am pregrowers, to whom the report has been of",46,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty

I remind the honourable member for Warringah that aromatic tobacco can be purchased in Australia for 73. a lb., whereas the duty alone in the United Kingdom is Ss. lOd. We have recently seen in the press particulars of the profits derived by the oil companies from the stocks which they held when duties were increased. The select committee ascertained that the British Australasian Tobacco Company had huge stocks of Australian leaf on hand when additional import duties were imposed last year. extensive stocks of imported leaf, the profits which it made as a result of the increased duties must have been enormous. Little time was lost in passing ou the increased price to the consumer, so that, in consequence of the increased duties imposed by this Government, the combine probably had a good "" rake off."" I associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) concerning the manner in which the British Tobacco Company treats its employees. So far as I have been able to learn, there is no body of employees in Australia that receive better treatment than do the employees of that company. As a member of the select committee I had an opportunity to visit the company's works in Sydney, where hundreds of girls working only five days a week on piece-work were earning an average of £3 5s. a week. It was suggested by the representatives of the Federated Tobacco Workers Union of Australasia that, owing to the supply of Australian-grown leaf being unequal to the demand, a reduction in import duties should be made if only for a short time. As one present at that deputation, I pointed out to the Minister that if such a reduction of land? were made, if only for a month or two, it would be possible for the companies to import sufficient leaf to enable them to carry on for five or even ten years, and that when the Australian-grown leaf was produced in large quantities, and there was an opportunity of receiving a good price for it, the company could say that they could do without Australian leaf for five or ten years unless the growers were prepared to accept the prices offered for their leaf. Something similar was done in the case of timber. The importers, anticipating Mr Jones. an increase in the duty on oregon, brought shipload after shipload of this timber toAustralia, and although the duty has since been increased, they have been using the imported stocks ever since. Meanwhile the Australian mills are having a thin time. As a result of the increased duty on tobacco, the tobacco-growing industry has received a valuable stimulus. I haveobtained figures from the Customs Department showing that, at the SOth June, 1930, there were 352 registered tobacco growers in Victoria, and that from the If that company also had 1st July to the 8th December, the number increased by 62. Altogether there are 702 registered growers in Australia. I have not yet obtained figures regarding the increased acreage under tobacco, but when they come to hand I am sure that they will cause a revelation. The tobacco growing industry is booming in Australia to-day. In the Ovens River Valley a tobacco-grower, Mr W. Panlook, of Panlook's Ltd., last year devised a new system of curing leaf. He introduced a Australasian system by which hot air is kept circulating about the drying leaf, and the method has proved a great success. Last season he had 40 acres under tobacco, but this season he increased his acreage to 100. Another farm in the Wangaratta district, belonging to Messrs. Fisher and Sons, had 100 acres under tobacco. It is estimated that the crop will yield between £12,000 and £14,000 worth of tobacco. favour of increased protection? has given the necessary stimulus to the industry. Can the honourable member point to any crop raised in Tasmania which will return as much from 100 acres Electricity Commission has taken an interest in tobacco curing, and has fitted up two kilns with electric drying apparatus which takes the place of the old wood heating system. The first kiln produced leaf of a very even colour, and the second gave even better results. A third kiln is now being fitted up to operate the hot air drying process which I have already mentioned, and from that great results are anticipated. Another grower, Mr Eugene Kneebone, of Everton, has also invented",47,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty

228,Mr Bell,"No, I wish I could.",48,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty
229,Mr Jones,"Recently the Victorianan improved system of tobacco caring. It will be seen, therefore, that keen interest is being taken by growers in tobacco curing, and all are anxious to produce the-best results. I am hopeful that in a few years, instead of Australia importing 95 per cent, of the leaf consumed here and growing only 5 per cent., the figures will be reversed. I propose to quote from a statement recently made by a man who was continuously employed in the tobaceo industry for 60 years. He saysWith 00 years behind him in the service of tlie British-Australasian Tobacco Company, from which he has just retired, Cr. Thomas B. Drew, of Droop-street, Footscray, looks back over tlie long period, marks the progress of the industry iu Australia, and looking to its future, believes that in time the country w ill the profits which I have quoted do not become another America in tobacco production. Cr. Drew grew up with the tobacco industry. He has spent most of his 76 years in it . He recalls the days when cigarettes were rare and all men practically smoked black plug and oigurs, all made by hand. He has seen the cigarette oust the cigar and reduce pipesmokcrs. And he thinks that the demand for the cigarette will continue to grow. Discussing the growth of tobacco in Aii°tralia, he said to-day that in the early days tobaceo grown on the King River was better than most ol! the tobacco leaf which was grown at present, and was equal to the American leaf. Before the appointment of the tobacco investigation committee, allegations were frequently made that Australian-grown tobacco bore a eucalyptus taint. So far as the committee oould learn, those allegations did not originate with any one who had ever smoked Australian tobacco. In my opinion, they were inspired. Even Sir Otto Niemeyer, while he was in Australia, smoked nothing but Australian tobacco, and honourable members opposite, who are so ready to regard him as an authority on financial matters, might do well to follow his example in this. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) the other day quoted a letter which he had received from the secretary of the Tobacco Workers Union. . The letter stated that the price so the smoking public for No. 1 Australian aromatic tobacco was 7s. per lb., and something less for dark tobacco. I remind the honourable member that the lowest full rate duty charged on tobacco imported into Great Britain is 8s. lOd. per lb. If tlie Government is desirous of obtaining all the revenue it can, it might consider increasing the duty on tobacco, rather than lowering it. I have here figures showing the profits made by the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company during the last three years. Eor the year ended 31st October, rj28, the net profit was £916,506; for the following year, the' profit was £1,011,307, while for the year ending the 31st October, 1930, the profit was no less than £1,074,672. It will be seen, therefore, that last year the profit made by the company was the greatest it had ever achieved. worse year in Australia's history. include the company's interest in the undivided profits of subsidiary companies. This combine has had a long innings on a good wicket, and it is now time that the growers had a turn. The combine will not have things all its own way in the future, because it will have to meet the competition of the firm of Carreras Limited, which has recently begun operations in this country. A recent review of the profits made by this company statesThe company has become remarkable for these regular yearly capital distributions. They are piling up fortunes even for the smallest holders of the Carreras shares marketed less than a decade ago. For example, a man who bought 100 ordinary shares at about par in 1921 and has retained his interest until to-day, finds himself in possession of 586 £1 shares, which, at their present market price of £14 each, represent a capital value of about £8,204. That bears out my contention that the manufacturers have, in the past, been on a very good wicket. The British Imperial Tobacco Company also made record profits last year, netting no less than £10,000,000. A report, which appeared in the Melbourne Age of the 23rd January, 1931, statesYesterday's cable news shows that the Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland) Limited, has made a profit of £10,000,000 for the year ended 31st October, 1930, and has increased its dividend on the ordinary shares from 23 per cent, to 23J peT cent, despite the trade depression. The announcement caused a rise of £5,500,000 in the shares. In 1902 the company sold its export business to the British-American .Tobacco Company Limited, in which it holds a large interest,",48,Riley Le T The Honourable Duty
230,Mr Thompson,And that was the,49,Tobacco Companies Earnings
231,Mr Jones,"That is so. Moreover,Accounts of the British-American Company for the year to 30th September last are to hand by this week's mail from London. Net profit was £0,501,560, or £143,788 more than for 1928-29. Dividend on the ordinary shares again is 25 per cent., and takes £5,S95,1S0. Preference capital was increased in the year by an issue of £6,000,000, and dividend on preference shares requires £555,000. The sum brought in is £1,748,722, and £1,800,144 is carried forward. Some two years ago the British Board of Trade proposed to draw up legislation dispensing with the necessity of numbering shares, as large companies had said it was impossible to retain distinctive numbers, but after the Hatry disorder, the board said that the time was inopportune for such a change. Tlie directors of the British-American Tobacco Company have given notice of a meeting at which shareholders arc to be asked to convert the share capital into stock which w ill be transferable into multiples of £1, brokerage charges to remain unaltered. They state that distinctive numbering does not afford any protection to shareholders, and that the expense it entails is not justifiable. Profits shown do not include the proportion of the undivided revenue of the subsidiary and associated companies. SirH . Cunliffe-Owen, one of the directors of the British-American Tobacco Company, is on the board of the British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited, Melbourne. Before the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the Australian tobacco-growing industry, that industry was languishing, and it would have died had not something been done to resuscitate it. Nothing would have been done had the last Government continued in office. It is due to the persistence of the honourable member for New England( Mr there was something to be said for the Thompson) that action has been taken to place the industry once more on the map, and it is now progressing rapidly. The suggestion has been made that the import duty might be reduced for a short period. I warned the Minister, at a deputation which waited upon him, of the danger that would accompany such action. In support of what I then said, I now quote the following extract from an article headed, ""Farm board warns tobacco-growers against a higher output,"" which appeared in the New York World of the 13th February last:The opinion that an increase in 1931 proportionate to the increase in 1930 would be "" disastrous "" to tobacco-growers was expressed to-day by Vice-Chairman Stone, of the Farm Board at Washington. said, that the tobacco crop this year would be as large as last year. He placed the 1930 excess production in bright, fine-cured leaf at 60,000,000 lb. greater than produced in 1929. In addition to this excess, Stone added, there Mr Jones. had been an over-supply of burley tobacco grown during the last two years. These stocks increased to 40,000,000 lb. last year. Two days later the Evening News wrote in similar vein, and directed attention to the large surplus of tobacco in Greece and South Africa, incidentally referring to Australia's protective tariff. The lowering of this duty would enable shiploads of tobacco to be brought from those countries as well as from America. Department the power to regulate imports? Parliament does that. danger. Those countries -which have a surplus would be only too pleased to dump it in Australia, to the detriment of our industry. In America, negroes and negresses comprise practically the whole of the labour employed in tobacco-growing, and probably in Greece and South Africa also tobacco is grown by coloured labour. In Australia, however, the growers pay the workers decent wages. From whatever angle this duty is viewed, it does not impose a penalty on smokers, because the price of Australian tobacco is less than the amount of the duty that is paid on tobacco which enters the United Kingdom. ber for New England pointed out that case that I made out-that there is a shortage. shortage of Australian tobacco. A few years ago we were informed that Australian leaf was tainted with eucalyptus and turpentine, and that it possessed many other objectionable features. It has now been discovered that it possesses 'admirable qualities that previously were not suspected. With the manufacturers it is a matter purely of £ s. d. I am exceedingly gratified that the Government has granted this protection to the Australian industry. The growers have been inspired with hope, the acreage under tobacco is being increased, and the outstanding problem Indications are, Stone confronting the industry is how to prevent the diseases known as blue mould, which attacks the tobacco plant.

236,Mr Jones,"Admittedly , there is athere will be nothing to prevent the industry from flourishing. I trust that in a few years Australia will be growing sufficient tobacco to supply her own requirements. I wish to make my position clear, in view of the vote that I propose to give on this item. I was a member of the select committee that inquired into the tobacco growing industry in the Oommonwealth. I found myself in disagreement with the other members of that committee on the general tai-iif proposals. I was convinced that any additional impost levied on the importation of tobacco would have the effect of decreasing the consumption in Australia of the imported leaf, without any corresponding raising of the quality of the tobacco produced in Australia. I took the stand that such a policy would not result in an increased production of bright leaf, but that on the contrary it would encourage growers to continue producing leaf of a quality which is not wanted in Australia to-day. In view of the number of employees engaged in the secondary industry of tobacco manufacture, and the revenue which the Commonwealth Government receives from import and excise duties, too much stress cannot be laid upon that aspect of the subject. I propose to vote for these increased duties. Apparently that will place me in an anomalous position. I believe, however, that I can present my action in its right perspective. I took the stand that an increased duty was not warranted by the economic or the industrial position of this particular industry. Since that report was written, however, a very serious change has taken place in the economic position of this country. The Government is confronted with acute financial difficulties, and it has to raise additional revenues. It is entitled to look to luxury duties, particularly on such commodities as whisky, beer and tobacco, to provide those revenues. During the course of the debate this evening it has been stated that the tobacco industry in Australia does not need a duty. Broadly speaking, I agree with that contention; but on account of the existing conditions in Australia, the proposed duties can be justified. Some honourable members contend that the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company does not benefit under this proposal, while others claim that it does. I am not prepared to argue on either one side or the other. But the grower will benefit. The assertion that the select committee had done no good to the industry cannot, I believe, be supported by the facts. The report of that committee threw a very definite and lasting light on the operations of the industry in Australia. I think it can safely be claimed that the industry has definitely benefited as a result of its inquiries. The best evidence of that, I submit, is furnished by the increased activities in certain areas in both the northern and the southern ends of Australia. Those activities can be traced to the definite and precise work done by the committee, and to the publicity given, particularly to the scientific and research work that had been undertaken. The contention advanced by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), that the surplus stocks held at the time of the committee's investigation indicated that the best use was not being made of Australian tobacco, and his statement that those stocks had since been manufactured and were being smoked in Australia to-day, cannot be wholly substantiated. A large quantity of that inferior tobacco has been finding its way into other avenues of industry. I know that a good deal of it has come into the hands of agriculturists in the form of powdered and liquid disinfectant. There are a variety of products into which it has been manufactured. Another feature that appeared to agitate the mind of the honourable member for New England was that, being confronted with these new duties, the company had increased the price of its commodities instead of allowing the smoking community to share the benefit of them. I submit that that is an inevitable result of the operation of all excessive tariff imposts. The company is under no particular obligation to see that the smoker benefits from this process of increasing the tariff. That is an item of domestic policy upon which I am not prepared to cross swords with it. Nor can I agree with the view that the smoker has been crucified by the combine. If there has been any crucifixion, it has been carried out, not by the company, but by",50,Tobacco Companies Earnings
237,Mr Morgan (Darling Downs) [9.20].,"the tariff. It is a libel on the company to say that it is responsible; yet such criticism appears to be a pleasant pastime with honourable members who desire to criticize it. profits ? pursue that subject. It is not my function to inquire into the company's domestic affairs, and I shall not do so. I cannot admit that the company has not given anything for nothing. The implication is distinctly discreditable to the company. I shall show that the company has given something for nothing, and that it has definitely helped the tobacco industry of Australia. Sad the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) stopped to weigh his words, he would not have made that accusation. The report which he himself signed as chairman of the Select Committee on the tobacco growing industry contains the following paragraph:The British Australasian Tobacco Company has undoubtedly made systematic efforts to improve the cultivation of tobacco in Australia, having spent, in the last 25 years, the sum of £75,000 on experimental work, irrespective of the special contribution to the Commonwealth Tobacco Investigation. That extract from the report is, in itself, a sufficient rebuttal of the statement of the honourable member. But in addition to that, the company made a contribution of £10,000 annually for three years for the purpose of conducting scientific research work in connection with the industry. In these circumstances I join issue with the honourable member for New England on his statement that the company has not given anything for nothing. I have shown that it has made at least two handsome contributions towards the betterment of the industry. If further evidence were required that the company has exercised a beneficent influence on the industry, it is provided by the members of the labour unions associated with the industry. These employees have declared definitely that they are satisfied with the conditions existing in the industry to-day. If the British Australasian Tobacco Company is a monopoly, it is a thoroughly beneficent one. But I deny that the company has a monopoly of the industry to-day. Eveni f it were a monopoly previously, the monopoly no longer exists. To-day the company controlled by the Godfrey Phillips interests, and the company controlled by the Carreras interests, are definitely competing with the British Australasian Tobacco Company. Consequently, any monopoly that may have existed has disappeared. I shall vote for this item, not because I think that these duties are required for the advancement of the tobacco industry on either the producing or the manufacturing side, but because, in the present acute financial crisis of Australia, I think they are justified for revenue purposes. I do not justify the duties on any other ground. The serious financial position of the country to-day justifies me in reversing the attitude that I adopted at the time the select committee was making its investigations; consequently I propose to vote for this item. Health) [9.36] -The committee should consider this subject from the national viewpoint. Some exception has been taken to certain comments in the report of the Select Committee on the tobacco growing industry, but in my opinion that report is an excellent production. I compliment the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), upon having been responsible for the publication of such a concise statement of the results of the committee's investigations in various parts of Australia. Some protest has been made about the cost of the inquiry, but it should be remembered that the committee visited nearly all the States. It went as far north as Stanthorpe, in Queensland, and also visited various parts of South Australia. In my opinion the tobacco-growing industry offers unrivalled possibilities of development. back-yard industry. tobacco leaf has been grown in backyards, but we have large areas of suitable tobacco-growing land in various parts of Australia. Much land that is useless for grazing, or ordinary agricultural purposes, is well suited for tobacco-growing. This is particularly so in the Mareeba district of Queensland.

242,Mr Mcneill,"It is true thatdeclared that the best amber leaf produced in the southern hemisphere is grown at Mareeba. A man with very small capital can, in a few years, become independent by investing his money in tobacco-growing. The select committee found that a man could make a good living from five, six or seven acres of tobacco land. a net profit of £200 per acre. in any other agricultural industry in Australia. Eveni f a man made only £500 or £700 a year from his few acres he would do very well. In my opinion, a number of our unemployed could be settled on tobacco land to the advantage of the Commonwealth and the welfare of their families. Thirty years ago tobacco leaf was grown in certain parts of New South Wales, but the tobacco manufacturers would not buy it. They did not want to encourage the growing of Australian tobacco leaf. I remember that in 1910 and 1911 the Sydney Bulletin published some articles which scathingly criticized what was termed the tobacco combine, because of its shabby treatment of the Australian tobacco-growers. In the same article it was pointed out that the manufacturers were making excessive profits. Good tobacco leaf was being grown in the Tumut district at that time, but it wa3 left to rot on the ground, because the manufacturers would not buy it. As the result of the protection accorded to this industry Australian smokers are now able to enjoy Australian tobacco. I have smoked nothing else for the last twelve months. I have been buying my tobacco at 7s. 6d. per lb. If I bought the imported tobacco I should have to pay 12s: 6d. per lb. for it ; but even if both the local and the imported article were the same price I should prefer the Australian tobacco. cigarettes are also equal to the imported cigarettes. I cannot speak from personal knowledge about cigars. Our protective policy has enabled many men to make a comfortable living for themselves and their families by tobacco-growing, and I hope that before long many more men will be settled on land suitable for the cultivation of tobacco. This industry should become one of the most profitable in Australia. I hope that the Minister will make some comments upon the suggestions of the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), and the honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones), both of whom were members of the select committee which inquired into the tobacco growing industry. I trust that the Minister will deal particularly with the complaints that have been made by the members of the Tobacco Workers Union. Possibly the select committee could make an inquiry into these statements, and inform the Government whether they are justified or not. At any rate, the Government should give sympathetic consideration to the complaints that have been made, because if the statement of the union that hundreds will be thrown out of employment is correct it is a serious matter for this Government. It should be possible to overcome the difficulties to which reference has been made without in any way interfering with our tariff policy. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) referred to -the money that has been spent by the . British-Australasian Tobacco Company in connection with its experimental work in the cultivation of the Australian leaf. I am aware that considerable expenditure was incurred, but whether the money was wisely spent is open to question. £75,000 in experimental work. was not of much value at that period. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) suggested that the employees of this company are especially well treated. They are to the extent that they are rationed. Their share in the The Australian profits is, we are told, that they get less work than before. I hope that before the Government takes any further action in connection with these people, the Minister will order a thorough investigation to be made by the select committee.

The industry will not become firmly established unless it is adequately protected. The honourable member for Darling Downs has told us that he has not altered his opinion concerning the quality of Australian that in voting for these duties, except from the standpoint of revenue requirements. Apparently the honourable member would not be converted unless he could secure an Australian flavour. That appears to be his particular weakness, i believe that we shall possibly accomplish this in time. When the committee was taking evidence, the honourable member was given samples of Australian tobacco, of which he expressed the highest appreciation, saying that if he could always depend upon getting tobacco of that quality he would be perfectly satisfied. I believe it will be posinvestigating this problem. He also adsible, in. the course of a few years, to so develop the industry as to ensure the complete satisfaction of all Australian smokers with the Australian leaf. An excellent tobacco is being grown at Harvey's Range, near Townsville, as well as near Mareeba, and in certain parts of Victoria. No one can doubt the quality of the leaf that is being produced in those localities. Representatives of the British Australasian Tobacco Company, giving evidence before the committee, declared that the chief difficulty was to secure leaf of the right colour. Mr Swinson, of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, said that a neutral leaf was required. He admitted that it was being grown in some parts of the Commonwealth, but not in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. In view of the progress that is being made in the industry I am convinced that, ultimately, we shall be able to meet the requirements of the company. Mr Martens. ing centres. nesses admitted that they had been advised by experts that they were growing tobacco leaf on country which was not considered suitable for the purpose. If they 1 prefer to continue taking that risk, it surely is their affair. But it is a fact that each year they are producing a greater proportion of the class of leaf required. I am convinced that the right class of tobacco can be grown in Australia, but the industry will not be developed to its fullest extent unless adequate assistance tobacco, and is given to it by the Government through he would not be justified the tariff. Improvement in theflavourof the leaf can be secured at the stage of curing. In his evidence Mr Panlook, of Eurobin, pointed out that it was impossible to produce a good tobacco from aa tobacco with a Turkish inferior leaf, and the evidence of repra^ sentatives of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company showed that the growers had striven to observe the instructions of its tobacco experts. Blue mould is one of the chief obsta61es to successful cultivation in most parts of the Commonwealth. Dr. Dickson, Chief of the Division of Plant Industry, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, is closel/ vised the committee that tobacco-grower's were, following the advice given by experts with regard to the selection of tobacco plants and seed, and said he believed that ultimately they would overcome all the difficulties. Any loss in revenue from the decline in importations will be compensated for by the additional revenue from excise on the Australian-growu leaf. I feel sure, therefore, that honourable members will be doing the right thing by supporting these! duties. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) had something to say about the distribution by the honorable member for Indi( Mr Jones) of the report which, be suggested, was not worth the paper upon which it is printed.

Parliament acted wisely in appointing the Select Committee to make the investigation. The expense incurred has been amply justified. [Quorum formed.] I regret that the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is not in the chamber at the moment, because I wish to comment briefly upon his observations concerning the attitude of the Country party in not opposing these tobacco duties. The honourable member reminded us that, although we are the low tariff party in this House, we cheerfully support these high duties on tobacco. Speaking as one who claims to be an advocate of lower duties, I consider that, in view of the difficult state of finances, the Government is amply justified in extracting as much revenue as possible from alcohol and tobacco, which must be regarded as luxury commodities. That is one reason why I most cheerfully support these high duties on tobacco. The honourable member for Warringah, by way of interjection, also alluded to tobacco-growing as a backyard industry. a sporting interjection. Consequently I did not take it too seriously. 1 would, however, remind the House, that although tobacco-growing may be a small industry it is capable of great expansion, and I know of no reason why ultimately we should not produce sumcient tobacco leaf to meet the whole of our requirements. Our present imports total about £3,000,000. Eveni f we supplied the whole of our requirements the Government would not necessarily lose revenue, because any revenue lost through a reduction in the volume of imports, would be made up by excise duties on the locally-grown leaf. The industry, I believe, has a great future, and I , for one, support these duties if for no other reason than that the Government is justified in raising the maximum amount of revenue obtainable from such sources. honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr tobacco produced in any other country. Paterson) has struck the right note. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) made reference to the expenditure by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company in connection with this industry. In the Gunyan district, near Stanthorpe, Queensland, splendid results are being obtained by the growers. One of the witnesses before the committee quoted the following report which appeared in the Melbourne Age of the 10th January, 1930:Brisbane 9th January. Proceeds of sales of tobacco fro m an area about seven acres grown at Gunyan, near Stanthorpe, just finalized show a gross return of £1,031 Is. Sd. The leaf was flue cured and yielded 11,346 lb. It was sold at an average price of 2s. lOd. per lb., or £233 peT acre. member talks in that strain he will bring about an increase in the price of tobacco land. asked for the very land at Gunyan on which the tobacco company failed to grow tobacco successfully in 1915. case. growers in the same area were offered 4s. 6d. a lb. for their tobacco this year, and that on more than one farm. The conclusion to be drawn from those figures is that if the cost of production is the same at Texas as in other districts, that would yield a profit of £133 an acre. From every point of view, the appointment of that select committee was justified. Hadi t not been appointed, the final blow would have been given to the tobacco-growing industry in Australia. As a result of the committee's investigations, the industry has been placed on a sound footing, and in the near future it will be a very valuable asset to Australia. From his casual observations, it would appear that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) does not know or care whether this country grows its own tobacco or imports it. Leaf is produced at Mareeba and Texas in Queensland, at Tamworth, Manilla, and Tumut in New South Wales, and Pomonal, in",54,Tobacco Companies Earnings

While the honourable member for Indi( Mr Jones) was speaking the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) interjected to the effect that a contributing factor to the high price of tobacco was the payment of the "" h i g h "" Avage of £3 5s. a week to girl operatives in the tobacco factories. Members of the committee saw two girls working a machine that was turning out 1,000 cigarettes a minute, or sufficient in a week to make up 240,000 packets. The proportionate cost of the wages of those girls was l d . for every 150 packets, a negligible amount. pany ought to give away the cigarettes. the honourable member smokes or not, but he should know that the company does not give away cigarettes. further labour the subject. I am quite satisfied that, in the interests of Australia and of the tobacco-growers, these duties should be continued, and that, if that is done, the time is not far distant when our growers will produce, not only sufficient leaf for Australian requirements, but enough to provide an exportable Surplus. It is estimated that there is room in Australia for 15,000 growers. At present there are but 700. I am hopeful that, as a result of this tariff, the estimate of 15,000 growers will be realized at no distant date. for Trade and Customs) [10.5] I have listened with a great deal of interest to the very informative speeches that were delivered by members of the Select Committee on the Tobacco-growing Industry. In passing, I may say that that committee presented one of the most useful reports that has ever been submitted to a goI t is vernment. Bruce-Page Government appoint the committee that was presided over by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) ? vernment did appoint the committee. appointed on the vote of honourable members, against the advice tendered by the It did excellent work. When deputations from the tobacco trust and the unions concerned waited on me, I consulted members of the committee and found their advice very useful indeed. The beneficial duties on tobacco that have been imposed by this Government are largely attributable to the efforts of the committee. I was satisfied that its knowledge of the subject was sound, and, therefore, accepted its advice. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has, on several occasions, referred to the likelihood of employees in tobacco factories suffering as a result of the imposition of these duties. He has intimated that the demand on Australian tobacco has been so great that there will be a shortage of local leaf, so throwing operatives out of employI shall not ment. I assure the honourable member that his representations will be borne in mind, and that I shall have an investigation made into the possibility of any shortage of Australian leaf. It was suggested by the honourable member for New England that the matter might be referred to the select committee which, he believes, is still in existence. That committee was appointed for a specific purpose. It submitted its report, and is no longer in existence. The Standing Orders do not contain any provision which permits me to refer the matter to the committee. However, I assure the honourable member and his associates that they will be consulted before any decision is made by the Government to vary the duties on tobacco. members of that committee would not",55,Profitable Tobacco Crop Return Or £233 An Acbe

I am able to iuform the honourable member that practically all of the leaf grown last season is still in the sheds of the growers being cured, and maturing. Many of those growers have not yet been visited by the buyers, but within the next couple of months some tons of that leaf will be made available to the factories for processing purposes. It is possible that within the next six months there will be a shortage of Australian leaf. The representations of honourable members will be kept in mind, because I realize how serious it would be if the workers in the industry were thrown out of employment. For some years Australia has imported 20,000,000 lb. of tobacco leaf annually, while the local production has amounted to 1,000,000 lb. a year. Of the 20,000,000 lb. of tobacco leaf imported annually, about 14,000,000 lb. is for smoking tobacco, and 6,000,000 lb. for cigarettes. should Australian tobacco not be avail[63 1 able, the price of tobacco will increase. Even so, it would increase only in respect of one-fourteenth of the tobacco smoked. The tobacco factories would be able to get sufficient imported leaf by paying the duty, and the price of tobacco would still be no higher than the price of fourteenfifteenths of the tobacco now smoked in Australia. The Government will keep these matters in mind, because it does not want to do an injustice to any section of the workers. Before the duty was imposed, we were told that some hundreds of workers would be thrown out of employment by it. So far as I am aware, no great numbers of tobacco-workers have been put off by the tobacco factories, notwithstanding the depression. It is only natural that, under present conditions, there should be some slackness in the tobacco factories, as elsewhere. The honourable members for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) and Henty( Mr Gullett) have objected to the alleged high duties on I assure tobacco. I point out that the duty on unmanufactured tobacco entering England is 8s. lOd. per lb., as against 5s. 2d. per lb. on unmanufactured leaf entering Australia. In the case of manufactured tobacco, the English duty is 12s. lOd. per lb., as against about 9s. per lb. in Australia. The duty under this item has been increased by 3s. 8d. per lb. over the 1921-28 rates; chiefly for revenue purposes. The Government is faced with the necessity of raising approximately £1,000,000 in revenue from tobacco duties. In the past, duties were imposed in the best way to meet the requirements of the industry, and to inflict a minimum of hardship on the smokers of tobacco. Increases have been made in the duties on manufactured tobacco and cigarettes in order that the increases in the prices of raw material will not be detrimental to Australian manufacturers of tobacco and cigarettes. Prior to the 3rd December, 1930, an increase of Is. 6d. per lb. operated in respect of imported leaf, while an increase of 2s. per lb. operated under the excise tariff in the case of manufactured tobacco. This arrangement of duty did not sufficiently encourage the use of Australian leaf, so that an alteration was made by reverting to the rate of 2s. 4d. It has been said that, per lb. prescribed in the 1921-28 Excise Tariff, and making a further increase",56,Profitable Tobacco Crop Return Or £233 An Acbe

The members of the select committee waited on me and indicated that the duties which had been imposed, in order to raise revenue, would injure the Australian tobacco industry. vernment, therefore, decided to adopt their suggestions. No industry in Australia holds out better prospects than does the tobacco-growing industry. There is plenty of room for its development, seeing that only 1,000,000 lb., out of 21,000,000 lb. of tobacco smoked eaoh year in Australia, is grown in this country. thousands of square miles suitable for tobacco-growing. Experiments are now being carried out by officers who are paid out of the. National Tobacco Investigation. Eund. At Sarina, Miriam Vale, Rockhampton, and Mareeba, I saw samples of tobacco which were superior to anything I saw in southern Australia. With cheap land available, a suitable climate, and a good rainfall, there is'nothfashion so long will our economic and ing to prevent Queensland from becoming a prosperous tobacco-growing State. Each year approximately £2,000,000 goes out of Australia for tobacco leaf. Within ten years all that money should remain in this country, and provide employment for our own citizens. Tobacco-growing is an important labour-employing industry, seeing that for every five acres under cultivation at least one man must be employed. The development of the industry would provide a market for the products of other Australian factories. All honourable members who have the interests of Australia at heart should not hesitate to agree to this item. Item agreed to. Item 19: (Tobacco, unmanufactured, entered to be locally manufactured into tobacco or cigarettes.) ominous feature of this debate is that all the interested parties seem to be so well pleased. The growers are pleased, the tobacco companies are pleased are not pleased. no evidence of their dissatisfaction we are justified in assuming that they are pleased. The workers in the factories are pleased. There must be something wrong, from the point of view of the consumer, when there is so much rejoicing among the interested parties. The Minister seems to be sympathetic towards every The Goone excepting the unfortunate consumer of tobacco. I am pleased that the duties will benefit the growers of tobacco; but I am grieved that the Minister should show so little concern for the consumers. The cost of living in Australia is high, not so much because of big increases of duties on a few items, as because of hundreds of small increasesa farthing here, In Queensland there are and a penny there. The cost of production in Australia is so high that we cannot sell overseas anything that we make. I regret that in the framing of this tariff more consideration was not shown to the consumers. The Minister seems to have forgotten them. Indeed, his disregard of the claims of the workers on reduced wages is to be deplored. So long as duties are imposed in this happy-go-lucky financial difficulties continue. We are setting up another favoured industry. I sympathize with the Australian tobacco growers, but I point out that favoured classes are constantly being created by discriminative legislation, while 25 per cent, of the workers of Australia are out of employment, and suffering the direst distress. I suggest that here we have an illustration of cause and effect. A good deal is heard to-day of the need for equality of sacrifice, owing to the financial depression. I claim that there should be equality, also, with regard to the benefits conferred by our legislation. In many of our manufacturing industries, the employees receive probably the highest wages paid in the world, and they enjoy the shortest number of working hours under almost ideal factory conditions. But can any honourable member point to a single tobacco-grower who enjoys those conditions? So long as this Parliament remains indifferent to the effect of discriminative legislation, Australia will continue to have industrial difficulties. orable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has had representations made to him by the officials of the Federated Tobacco Workers Union.

I am anxious to overcome the difficulty due to the shortage of locally-grown leaf. profit made last year by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, if any reduction were made in the duty it should be conditional on the advantage being passed on to the consumers. [10.25} -Sinc e production of tobacco in Australia offers almost unlimited possibilities, the committee is now dealing with one of the most important items in the tariff. In the past, Australia has been importing tobacco leaf to the value of about £2,000,000 annually, and about £1,000,000 worth of manufactured tobacco. Some years ago, the late Government interested itself in the local industry, and, shortly before leaving office, it indicated that it intended to increase the import duty with a view to encouraging the production of tobacco in Australia. The.present Government has now gone far beyond the proposal of its predecessors, under which it was suggested that an increase in the import duty to the extent of 8d. a lb. would be sufficient. We now find that the Government has increased the duty on this item from 2s. 6d. to 5s. 2d. a lb., and on other tobacco items from 5s. 4d. to 8s. 6d. a lb., while, in the particular case under the immediate consideration of the committee the increase is from 2s. 6d. to 5s 2d. a lb., or 5s. 8d. on stemmed leaf. It has been proved conclusively that the Australian growers can now produce a leaf suitable for the requirements of the consumers, and second to none in quality. The work of the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry, the chairman of which was the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), emphasized the great possibilities of the industry, and did much to awaken public interest in it. The Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research, in its first annual report for the period, from the 13th of April, 1926, to the 30th June, 1927, set Out its objective in beginning its tobacco investigations as dictated by the late Government. The report statedThe council is co-operating with the Development aud Migration Commission and tlie British-Australasian Tobacco Companyi n a comprehensive investigation with a view of ascertaining whether tobaceo can be"" grown in Australia equal in quality to tliat now grown in ""North America. The investigation will cover the whole question of the improvement in quality, and the economic production of various types and grades of tobacco, and w ill include problems of the soil, plant growth, climatic conditions, and economies. Arrangements for proceeding with the work were made at the first meeting of the Standing Committee on Agriculture last May, and are now being carried into effect. By arrangement wit h the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, Dr. Gt. P. DnriiellSmith, Director of the Sydney Botanical Gardens, is now visiting the United States of America for the purpose of inquiring into the whole position of tobacco cultivation in that country, and of furnishing a report regarding the lines on which experimental work should be developed in Australia. A chemical examination of the difference between Australian' and Virginian leaf w i ll be carried out under the control of Professor J. Kenner, F.R.S., Department of Organic Chemistry, Sydney University. The terms, of the co-operative agreement under which the investigations are being conducted are as follows:The British-Australasian Tobacco Company has agreed to provide over the first period of three years the sum of £20,000 on condition that a sum of £10,000 is found by the Commonwealth and the State Governments for the period for carrying out tlie investigations. The Commonwealth has agreed to subscribe £5,000 and each of the five mainland States £1,000 each for the initial three years.

That body in its second annual report for the year ending 30th June, 1928, statedThe tobacco investigations are being continued under detailed in the previous report. The actual work is controlled by an executive committee, and is administered from the offices of the Development and Migration Commission: Mr C. M .

It aims at thorough practical testing of typical soils and climates. As a result of those investigations we know of the possibilities of developing, the tobacco growing industry in Northern Queensland. There is in the third annual report of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the year ending 30th June, 1929, further reference to the progress of the inquiry into this great industry.

That report clearly demonstrates the part that has in recent years, been played by the co-operative agreement Australian institutions in refuting that oft repeated statement that Australia can never grow a tobacco suitable for our requirements or worthy of our smoking. The investigations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research show that, in . various parts of Australia where experimental plots were instituted particularly at Mareeba, tobacco of a most useful type can be grown. The people of Mareeba are convinced that they can successfully undertake the growing of tobacco. The Queensland Government has made available certain lands for the experimental planting of tobacco and private interests are also taking a hand in that direction. When imposing duties on tobacco we must give consideration to the Research work on the blue the smoker. The tariff should be so do that employment will be provided in all the tobacco that we can We are at present importing if we develop this industry in Australia it in. the hope that at least some members preliminary results of such work of the community would become infarm at terested in it, and I know that in my own available pressed with the possibilities of this inCo-operative research work on the commerce, particularly that in the Maryhas already Mr W. Eadie, are co-operating with The aim of the the Agricultural Department and the of the tobacco local State members because they are convinced that tobacco of good quality can be grown in the district. The old idea that tobacco must be grown on the rich soils of Australia has been exploded. It has been found that many soils which are not our rich lands produce the best tobacco so long as there is a sufficient water supply, which is available in the districts to which I have referred. Those districts have, therefore, every opportunity to produce from their sandy soilssome hundreds of thousands of pounds of the millions worth of the tobacco we require in this country. Item agreed to. Items 20 and 21 agreed to. Item 22. By omitting the whole item and inserting in its stead the following item:"" 22. Cigarettes, including weight of cards and mouth-pieces contained in inside packages; Fine Cut Tobacco, suitable for the manufacture of cigarettes, per lb. British, 10s.; the world for that anomaly.' It is extraintermediate, 16s.; general, 10s."" Will the Minister agree to report progress on this item? have the whole of the tobacco duties put through to-night. ettes has been raised from 12s. 2d. British and 12s. Sd. general to a flat rate of 16s. right through. It is the first example in this schedule of the Government's abandonment of the preference to Great Britain, and, therefore, this is an item of considerable significance. I note it with the keenest regret. Without prejudicing any Australian industry, the Government might have preserved the slight preference of 6d. per lb. to the British cigarette manufacturer. It might not have been of any great benefit to the British manufacturer, but I cannot understand why this preference has been taken away. This action of the Government seems to be identical with some of its other little provocative actions against some of our great overseas markets. The preference to the British cigarette manufacturer has stood in our tariff for twenty years, and in this case it has been intentionally omitted. In some items a preference is retained that might just as well have been abandoned for all the good it is. The tariff wall has been raised so high against the British manufacturer that in reality the preference given to him has been destroyed. It is extraordinary that the Government should indulge in this wholesale destruction of the British preference in face of its strenuous endeavours at the,last imperial conference to secure, not only a retention of the preference which Great Britain extends towards Australian products, but also an extension of them.' The fight which the Australian delegation made first for an extension of ' the British preference to Australian products, and afterwards for a retention of the existing preferential duties, was quite a feature of the proceedings at that conference. I know that I shall be reminded of the great value of the Australian preference to Great Britain and of the relatively low value of Britain's preference to Australia, but there are the best reasons in / ordinary that representatives of a Labour Government should plead with Great Britain for a preference in ,the shape of duties on items which makeup the main foodstuffs of the British working man, particularly when the difference between the wages and general conditions of the British and Australian workers arc taken into consideration. through. cannot expect to get the whole schedule through at one sitting. This is an unprecedented tariff schedule, not only in regard to the range of the duties increased, but also because of the violence of those increases, and it cannot be agreed to without a reasonable amount of discussion. There has not been any suspicion of stonewalling on this side. We have simply taken the points as we have come to thettn. On pointe like British preference and the relation of primary to secondary industries naturally a good deal of time is occupied in the early stages of the tariff debate, but once we have made our protest on these points progress will be more rapid in the subsequent stages of the discussion.

284,Mr Gullett,"The Government and I am disgusted at this wilful attempt on its part to destroy one small grain of preference to the British manufacturers. It is, in fact, a hostile demonstration against those manufacturers. It is an attack on a system of preference which has been in force in Australia for more than twenty years, and hitherto has been subscribed to by every political party in charge of the tariff in this country. [10.48] -This item abolishes the preference granted to the British manufacturer of cigarettes. Whatever arrangements may be made with tobacco-growing countries, we should not place the manufacturers of the United States of America on the same footing as the manufacturers of cigarettes in the United Kingdom The United States of America takes practically Australia. Australia's trade relations with the United States of America are very unsatisfactory, and during the last ten years we have had .to send to that country no less a sum than £210,000,000 in gold to redress the adverse trade balance. Asi t refuses to offer trade reciprocity we should take advantage of this tariff, to turn the balance more in our favour. Particularly should we give preference to the United Kingdom, which is our best customer and buy3 half of our exports. our interest is paid. of our interest is paid to the United Kingdomi t is only because most of the money which Australia has borrowed for both Commonwealth . and State requirements, for the establishment of Canberra, the building of railways and roads, and general developmental works, which provided employment for our citizens, came from that country. While the United States of America refuses to buy Australian commodities other than a little wool and a few sausage casings, we should impose higher duties, if not an absolute embargo, material in the factory costs, and accordon the goods it sends to us. I shall support any proposal to give to friendly nations that buy our products preference over the United States of America, and to the United Kingdom preference over all other countries. Australia must for a time continue to import tobacco, principally cigarettes. British cigarettes are far superior to any other from abroad, and should not be on the same tariff basis as the products of other countries. What has been said by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) should convince the Minister that some preference should be given, to cigarettes from the United Kingdom, which is Australia's best customer. To test the feeling of the committee, I moveTliat the item be amended by adding the following:""And on and after 14th May, 1931Cigarettes, including weight of cards and mouth-pieces contained in inside packages; fino cut tobacco, suitable for the manuor any other country. facture of cigarettes; whether wholly or iu part of British labour and material, per lb., British, 14s.; intermediate, 15s.; no commodities from general, 16s."" Those duties will enable concessions to be made to France, Belgium or any other country, which later concludes a reciprocal trade agreement with the Commonwealth. I shall show later when we are dealing with cigars that the Government has not adequately exploited the opportunities for getting revenue from this source. for Trade and Customs) [10.56] Briefly the reasons for withdrawing the preference of 6d. a lb. to the United Kingdom were these:-Considerabl e difficulty was experienced in administering the preference provisions owing to the fact that the bulk of the raw materials for the manufacture of cigarettes is imported into the United Kingdom, and in a number of cases the precentage of labour and/or material in the factory or works cost of the finished cigarettes was not sufficient to enable them to qualify for preference. On several occasions cigarettes declared on invoices to be entitled to preference were found upon investigation in the United Kingdom to contain less than 75 per cent, of United Kingdom labour and/or ingly were not eligible for preference. The action of the Government in increasing the margin of protection has brought about immediate and beneficial results from an employment point of view.

I am satisfied that if the Government had a real will to foster trade with the United Kingdom proper safeguards could have been evolved. This is the only item on which British preference appears to have been completely abolished. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), and if the Minister will not accept it I hope that he will at least agree to some measure of British preference.

During the last twenty years this country has never been more dependent upon Great Britain than she is to-day, and it is regrettable to find that this Government is wilfully -withdrawing a small measure of preference, not only on this, but on many other items yet to be discussed. In matters of trade it is our duty to give some consideration to that country, which is always ready to protect not only Australia, but other portions of the Empire. If we wish to maintain the standards which we now enjoy we should be prepared to defend them, and if we cannot defend them we should at least extend preferential treatment to those who are doing so. I support the amendment. ringah) [11.3] I regard the explanation of the Minister( Mr Forde) concerning the withdrawal of the preference to Great Britain under this item as most unsatisfactory. He stated that as the manufacture contain 75 per cent, of not the honourable British material and workmanship the preference should be withdrawn. There is no reason why that absurd regulation under which preference is allowed only in respect of imports containing not less than 75 per cent, of British material and workmanship should remain operative. I question the accuracy of the decision of the Customs Department in this matter. It is true that much of the material from which cigarettes are manufactured, both in Australia and Great Britain, is obtained outside the Empire; but I submit that the workmanship and material involved must represent considerably more than 75 per cent, of the finished article. Our the continuance of British preferential duties. Moreover, we are looking to Great Britain to help us in other important directions. I ask the committee to recall the determined effort which the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) made before the Economic Conference in Great Britain to retain the British preferential duties on Australian products, and how Mr Phillip Snowden definitely stated that he was entirely opposed to the existing preferences because they inflicted severe hardship upon the working people of Great Britain. AIL that the Prime Minister achieved as a result of his presence at the Economic Committee was the retention of the existing preferences; but this 'Government is not meeting Great Britaini n the same spirit. It has withdrawn the preference in respect of this item and also many others, and I protest against its action, particularly at this most inopportune time.

295,Mr Archdale Parkhill (War,"best customer, is entitled to special consideration. By interjection, tbe honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) referred to the manner in which our wheat is received in Great Britain; but mat is a commodity upon which preference is not given to any nation. The honourable member, doubtless, had in mind the purchase of Russian wheat by Great Britain; but that wheat was bought by co-operative societies on behalf of the labouring classes in that country, who are receiving only one-half of the wages that are paid in this country. At that time Great Britain was also faced with a threat from the wheat combine in America to corner all wheat supplies and thus have an opportunity to charge the people of Great Britain, many of whom were on the verge of starvation, any price it liked. order. Is the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) in order in discussing wheat on this item? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Yates) -The honourable member for Warringah is dealing with the subject of preferential trade and, within certain limits, is entitled to discuss its applicaimmediately increased the tariff, making tion to wheat. subject of preferential trade is involved in this instance, but wheat is a commodity upon which preference is not given by Great Britain to any nation. I am in favour of maintaining the existing preferences to Great Britain, and of extending them wherever practicable. It is possible, perhaps, that in some instances the existing preferences are not scientifiactually granted a measure of preference cally framed, and may, with advantage, be varied. That, however, does not apply to the item under discussion. According to the Government's proposal a distinct preference will be granted to the United States of America at the expense of Great Britain. I am not prepared to agree to the extension of preference to the United States of America, and I shall vote for any amendment the object of which is to restore preference to Great Britain. support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). In come from Great Britain. order to overcome the objection raised by the Minister, I propose that the preferenthe preference she is enjoying? I trust tial duty to Great Britain shall apply where the goods are wholly or in part of British manufacture. The Minister said that it was difficult to maintain the preference rate because of the provision requiring that 75 per cent, of material or labour shall be British. If my suggestions were adopted this difficulty would be overcome, and we should be assisting a British industry which provides employment for many workers. I remind honourable members that only recently the Prime Minister and other Ministers were in Great Britain attending the Imperial and Economic Conferences, and, with great difficulty, persuaded the British Government to maintain the preferences to Australian goods granted when Mr Bruce was in England in 1926. Great Britain is our best customer. She takes 50 per cent, of our primary products, while the United States of America takes only as little as she can, and our trade balance with her is £40,000,000 on the wrong side of the ledger. Only recently she increased the duty on our butter, and, indeed, every time AustraUa has been able to establish a trade with her in any commodity, she has it impossible for us to continue. Empire trade can be developed only by means of an interchange of preference between the various parts of the Empire. The present action of the Government is a very ungrateful one, seeing that the British Government has extended preference to us on many items. Not only have we abolished the preference that Britain is enjoying upon this item, but we have to the United States of America, which has always ranked as a foreign country on our tariff schedule. In my opinion, British preference should be increased rather than reduced. The arguments of the Minister make it clear that there is no will on the part of the Government to grant preference to Great Britain; otherwise, the difficulties he has raised could easily have been overcome. of the cigarettes imported into Australia",63,Profitable Tobacco Crop Return Or £233 An Acbe

I have appealed to -the Prime Minister previously for assistance for these people, and he has said 'that it is a matter for the State Government to deal with. The State Government; granted Hood relief in this area last June, and it is precluded from doing anything further in that regard, because of the present financial position of the State. equivalent of the State ration. In I wrote to the Prime Minister on the subject, and he replied that he would refer it to Cabinet. I have since been informed tliat Cabinet gave the request sympathetic consideration, but could not grant any financial relief. There is a precedent for the granting of such relief. The Commonwealth voted £5,000 for the relief of flood sufferers in Tasmania. The people of Tasmania have not suffered from two floods within twelve months. My electorate is as large as Tasmania. The people for whom I appeal require fodder .and seed millet to enable them to carry on their operations. Eveni f the Government cannot grant £5,000 for this purpose, it can grant £1,000 to assist in some measure to relieve their sufferings. The Commonwealth Government also Government would at least assist in feedgranted £50,000 for the relief of those ing the destitute people. Thousands of who suffered from a Japanese disaster people in my electorate are on the verge some years ago. If that amount of money of starvation. could be sent out of Australia to a foreign country, it should not be beyond the resources of the Government to grant porters that they are against the policy some relief to our own Australian people of repudiation. In my opinion the Prime who, in many cases, are on the verge of Minister and the Treasurer are the last starvation. I wish to refer to the treatment meted to repudiation, for they and other Goout to the unemployed in Canberra. I vernment supporters have repudiated understand that the men are granted many election promises that they made. rations on entering and on leaving the It was promised, for instance, that the Federal Capital Territory; but they must coal mines would be reopened in a fortbe able to prove conclusively to the police night if Labour were returned to power. that they have been away a month before That promise has not been fulfilled. This they can obtain any further rations. is repudiation of the worse and cruellest There are a number of cubicles in this type. The Prime Minister likened the area very suitable for occupation by old sufferings of the people in my electorate men who cannot stand exposure to the to the sufferings of those who were the winter climate here. ' The New South victims of a blockade during war time, Wales Government is doing considerably which brought innocent women and more for unemployed than this Govern-children to starvation. By this he inment is doing, for it grants weekly rations tended to convey that if Labour were to people out of work, irrespective of returned to power the miners' sufferings ( whether they remain in one town or not. would cease. Sir. Jaines. The Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) has said that because this Government grants rations to the value of 9s. a week to single men, it is treating them better than the New South Wales Government treats the State unemployed, but the honourable gentleman forgets other factors in the case. Apparently he does not take into consideration the higher cost of living in Canberra which reduces the purchasing power of the 9s. to the Sydney alone 90,000 unemployed are in receipt of the dole, and in my own electorate 12,000 are receiving it. There are thus several times as many unemployed in my electorate as there are in Canberra and the Northern Territory. The unemployed people for whom I am pleading are Australian citizens, but they are forced to suffer almost every humiliation before they can obtain any assistance from the Government. It is idle for the Government to say that it is the responsibility of the State Governments to give succour to the unemployed here, or elsewhere for that matter, for in 1929 the Prime Minister declared in his policy speech that no one in this country wou.ld be allowed to go hungry. He indicated that his It is said by some Government sup' persons in the world who should object The right honourable gentleman has no justification whatever for holding uphis hands in holy horror against Mr Lang's policy, for it is quite apparent that he and others are more concerned about the wealthy bondholders in Australia and elsewhere, than they are about the people who are hungry, arid who to-day are being treated most callously by this Government. I wish to refer to a matter that I mention this afternoon at question time. I consider that the Prime Minister has been guilty of a form of treatment of a most 'petty nature to certain honourable members of this House. It is a recognized procedure that when correspondence is sent to the Government, or to the Prime Minister from a particular electorate the honourable member who represents that electorate in Parliament shall be given the opportunity to make representation in regard to it. said this morning that he was looking contemptible. His action certainly will into the matter. and I have a complete answer to the merely shows to what lengths he is prehonorable member's allegations. letters referred to me by the Prime like.

I am not going to the Prime Ministerhaving somematters attended to. In the particular cases to which I refer the questions involved related to invalid and old-age and soldier pensions. The answer which I received from the Prime Minister this morning was that he would make inquiries. His reply to me tliis afternoon; by letter stated that it was Usual to refer such correspondence either to therepresentative of the district in this House, or to one of the senators for the State. This is the point which I wish to make in order to bring into relief the pettiness of the Prime Minister: There are three Labour senators for the State of New South Wales. Instead of this correspondence being sent by the Prime Minister to either Senator Dunn or Senator Bae, it was sent to Senator Dooley. If honourable members cannot see the underlying motive, then all I can say is that they are blind to the attitude that has been taken up by not harm either the representapared to go to give vent to his spleen towards certain members of this House, for tial treatment being given ih this matter in a certain policy which we believe omitted to refer the matter to either oi them.

General) [11.52] -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has raised the case of. Mr Jacob Johnson for the consideration of the House. I should not like the honourable member to be under any misapprehension in the matter. The position is that the case of Mr and every other case where there was Jacob Johnson was considered by the Government, and the decision was conveyed to that gentleman. The fact that I haye been subjected to a great deal of personal abuse by the person in question, through the press, and by correspondence, has notprevented me from extending the usual courtesies to those who have written concerning certain matters arising out of the case. Those matters also will be considered in due course. further representations, and those of his friends, must take their place in line with other business of the country, which is, at least, of equal importance. I assure the honourable member for East Sydney that if he has any desire to ventilate any aspect of the case in this House he certainly ought not to restrain himself out of any sense of consideration !for me, or the -Government. The honourable member is -perfectly free to take whatever action he thinks proper in that regard whenever he wishes to do so. While I do not associate myself with the tone or the text of the remarks which the honourable member for Hunter( Mr directs that correspondence concerning James) made this evening with regard to the causes which have led the New South Wales Government into the position that it is impossible for the farmers of that State to. look to it for help, I support the honourable member absolutely .as to the seriousness of the position in -which farmers in his, and in part of my electorate, find themselves. Flood followed flood so closely that the crops of those unfortunate men vvere destroyed, and even when they made a further sowing of lucerne their, efforts were nullified. Unless some help is forthcoming they will not be able to re-establish themselves. I appeal to the Pz-ime Minister to exhaust every constitutional avenue in an effort to provide assistance to that deserving section of the community. ter) [11.55] -The honourable members for Hunter( Mr James) and Robertson ( Mr Gardner) have raised the matter of the flooded areas in their districts, The Government investigated the subject very sympathetically, but it was forced to the conclusion that if it provided relief in this undoubted distress, it would be intruding into an area that belongs unquestionably to the State concerned. It would soon become involved in all problems, State and Federal alike, and I do not know where that would end. It is not lack, of sympathy, but the question of where the apportionment of responsibility should rest, which must determine the action of the Government. If this request were Mr Johnson's acceded to, others would pour in from other sections of New South Wales, from thefloodedareas of Queensland, and from every other part of the Commonwealth where suffering and disability existed. It is not reasonable always to appeal to the Commonwealth when a difficulty arises in a State. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) raised a matter in connection with which he accused me of being petty and contemptible and of venting my spleen on him. I assure the honourable gentleman that there is not the slightest foundation for any of those charges. This morning he asked me a question as to the custom which any matter should go to the member for the district. Obviously, it is not possible for a Prime Minister to attend personally to all of his correspondence, and I have given definite instructions that the usual courtesy shall be extended to every honourable member irrespective of the",68,Mograth Inserted In The Customs Act While The Late
