I take a secoud point. A l though the House has no official cognizance of the legal 'proceedings against the honourable member for Dalley which are pending, it is common knowledge that such proceedings have been initiated, and the. position of the honourable member might be greatly prejudiced by. speeches made-here ou a motion of privilege. In respect of matters on which our own Standing Orders are silent, we are guided by the practice-of the House1 : of Commons, .and iu that chamber a matter -which is sub judice may not be debated. : It is possible that the charge against the honourable member for Dalley wdl go i'efore a jury; but, even if it is to be dealt with by a judge only, I submit that we should adhere to the practice of uot dealing in this House witb any inatter that is the subject of pending legal proceedings. for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) has not indicated the judicial proceedings' to which he referred.

23,Mr Speaker,"Before ruling on theoutlined the nature of his motion before he commenced 3iis speech, at the conclusion of which the motiou was submitted. The honourable member for Corangamite has asked for a ruling as to whether the matter referred to by the Leader of the Opposition is one of privilege. Our Standing Orders state that in all cases not provided for by them resort shall be had to the rules and practices of the House of Commons, and I find in May, tenth edition, at page 260, this passageA motion was brought forward based on charges brought by the Times newspaper. The motion was ruled not to be a motion of privilege because it was not a matter requiring immediate consideration, and because the charges did not touch the conduct of members in tlie House. I have also consulted the debates of the British House of Commons of the 22nd February, 1SS7, when Mr Speaker, i;he Right Honourable A . W. Peel, gave a decision which has a real bearing on the case before us at present. His words wereMy attention has been called only a short time"" ago to the article to which the honourable Baronet refers; but, however grave the charges and imputations made in that article may be, I do not think it is a case of privilege. this House to restrain privilege unlcr great limitations and conditions; and these restrictions and limitations bave been, in my opinion, very wisely imposed by the House upon itself. Tbe rule is that, when imputations are made, in order to raise a case of privilege the imputation must refer to the action of honourable members in the discharge of their duties in the actual transaction of the business of this House. After what I have heard from the Leader of the Opposition, and in view of the opinions which I have read, I rule tha; the motion is out of order on the ground that it is claimed, to be one r>f privilege. from the Chair that I was "" warned"" as almost equal to my being named. submit that there is nothing before die House, and that the honourable memlier for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) has not risen to a point of order. the honourable member for Corangamite desire to make? personal explanation. In a. serious and courteous manner I asked the Leader of the Opposition, who need not have replied to me unless he had wished to do so, if he did not think it would be necessary in his reference to the civil case to refer to past proceedings. That question was laughed at by the Opposition, and thereupon, Mr Speaker, you warned me. If I had been called to order, and had not obeyed your ruling, I should rightly have been warned. RutI understand that, under the practice of the House, if a member who is addressing the Chair chooses to reply to a courteous interjection IIP may do so. orable member to order because of his persistent interjections, and his disregard of my call. ber must hear the Speakeri n silence. He has been accorded all the latitude that is due to him, and if he disregards the order of the Chair he w ill again be warned, and further action w ill be taken if necessary.

It is within the knowledge of all honor130,570 able members that the New South Wales railway service is going back at the rate .. 108,750 of about £80,000 a week, that in Victoria last year there was a' deficit of over £1,200,000, and of that, £1,000,000 was due to the loss on the railways. The Commonwealth Government had a conference with the State Premiers, and au agreement was arrived at for the balancing of the various budgets. It was known to everybody that the only real chance of the States succeeding in balancing their budgets was by re-adjusting their railway expenditure. What however, did the Commonwealth Government do ? Applications were made by the railways commissioners pf a number of States for a variation of the",16,Commonwealth Expenditure
82,". . 1,023,G14 Mr Latham (Kooyong) [3.6]","1awards governing the railways, and immediately this Government appointed conciliation committees, obviously for the purpose of delay. These conciliation committees have been appointed in cases in which the Government did not desire the application to be heard, as I predicted would happen when the amending Arbitration Bill was before the House earlier this year. ""Whenever there is an application to the court, which the unions do not like, they approach the Minister for Industry, or the Attorney-General, and procure the appointment of conciliation committees. I think that four conciliation committees have been appointed merely for the purpose of delay in connection with the railways case. Then an application was made for the setting aside of awards. Previously, the Government had, in spite of warnings from this side of the House, included a new sub-section in section i>8 of the Arbitration Act, conferring on the court, and not on the conciliation committees, the power to set aside an award or any of the terms of an award. The Government then briefed counsel to argue that these words' did not mean what they obviously did mean, and counsel actually argued that the Arbitration Oourt had not the power to set aside an award in general terms, but that it could exercise that power only upon a certain limited number of grounds. The act already provides for the setting aside of an award upon certain grounds. The number of those grounds was reduced when the last bill was before the House, in spite of warnings from honourable members on this side. The Government insisted on conferring a general power ou the court . to set aside awards or any of the terms of awards. Then the Government briefed counsel to go before the court and argue that this section did not mean what it plainly did mean. The Government put every possible obstacle in the way of any re-adjustment of railway awards. We were told that arbitration was going to be simplified, that all legal difficulties would be to cease the tactics which merely aggraremoved; but there is now associated with, it an amount of legal barbed wire that has never existed before. This is well illustrated by what has occurred in the case of the Victorian railways, in connection with which there are actually, at one Mr Latham. and the same time, no fewer than seven tribunals dealing with matters affecting working conditions. There are, first of all, the four conciliation committees. Then there is the Arbitration Court, and above that the High Court. Finally, the award now having been set aside, the railways are working again under the Victorian Railways Classification Board. Thus the unfortunate railway department of Victoria must try to struggle on in an attempt to run a business enterprise, hampered as it is by the demands of seven separate arbitration tribunals operating more or less simultaneously. Such a situation has never existed before. It is almost pure lunacy to. impose this burden on the railways. Apart from the complexity and confusion necessarily involved in so mad a systemthat is the only word one can apply to it-the executive officers of the railways are unable to do their work properly. These things ought to be made known. It should be known that the Government is using every endeavour to hamper the re-adjustment which is necessary in the interest of the railway men themselves as well as that of the community. Everybody knows that unless re-adjustments are made there must be heavy retrenchment. Probably thousands of men will have to be dismissed. This Government, however, has no concern for the man out of work. It does not bother about the unemployed. The men out of a job have no representation in the Arbitration Court. They are not heard. So long as the Government maintains the existing rate of wages, whether that rate be reasonable or not earning them or not. the honourable member points out, any one is earning them, the Government appears to he content. I appeal to the Government to show some consideration for the Australians who are out of work, and vate the unemployment evil, and make still more serious the depression, distress and suffering at present prevailing in the community.

I have difficulty in believing him to be sincere in that reply, having regard to his earlier statements. These contrasted strongly with those of the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons), which had the ring of sincerity. The true intention of the honourable member for Fremantle was indicated by an answer which he gave to a question on the subject of the note issue. He remarked that the trouble in Australia generally had arisen because production had outstripped exchange, nnd, when asked what he would do, he said that he would restore the note issue to the per capita requirements of the community. That statement, like most of the honourable member's assertions, was vague. would like me to express my views in his language. English. The honourable member was referring to currency. I take it that he considers that further currency is required, and that he would issue more notes for that purpose; but we have more currency than is needed at the present time. The currency of this country is comprised of notes, silver and gold. Half the notes are not required, and are lying out of use in the banks. It is said, very unfairly, that the banks are deliberately holding them for the purpose of contracting credit; but, as a matter of fact, they are holding them for essential purposes. The Government has deprived them of their gold, and the law requires them to retain a certain proportion of cash against their liabilities, besides which they require cash ciated, and the debts which are now due to or notes for current use. The notes in themselves have no intrinsic value; ihey are. issued by the Government to enable ordinary transactions of commerce to be carried on in the most convenient manner. Notes are merely tokens of value for goods and services. The quantity of currency that is in use rises or falls automatically according to whether business is expanding or contracting. The figures giver., by the honourable member for Fremantle last night prove that. He showed that a couple of years ago, when business was active, there was a much larger quantity of notes in circulation than there is at the present time. The explanation is that two years ago, business was brisk, and the demand for currency was greater than it is now. The idea of currency control has been abandoned outside Australia, for the very good reason that it is impossible to control the amount of currency in use. There is no shortage of currency whatever at the present time. Any creditor of a bank is entitled to write his cheque and obtain notes, gold or silver to the total amount of his credit. Therefore, it would be futile to issue further notes when we have more than we require for use. The class of issue, of course, which the honourable member for Fremantle has in view, is one, not for currency, but for inflation. Notes designed for that purpose would have the effect in Australia, as they have had everywhere else, of reducing the purchasing power of the pound. We all know the experiences of European countries after the late war. In Germany, I try to use plain the experiment of inflation was carried to the extent of fraudulent bankruptcy. Her creditors came in and established a stable currency. I do not suggest the the honourable member for Fremantle would go to the extent of causing the fraudulent bankruptcy of Australia. I should not think that he would wish so to depreciate the value of Commonwealth bonds as to make them practically valueless; but he is to a large extent responsible for resolutions emanating from an important section of this Parliament, which, if given effect, would involve the issue by the Commonwealth Bank of new notes exceeding the amount of the present note issue. If our note issue were doubled our currency would be nearly correspondingly deprethe so-called bondholders would be reduced in value by about 10s. in the £1. I see the elements of great danger in the proposal of the honourable member, and I regret that his great ability should be devoted largely to advocacy of this very insidious form of repudiation. He spreads this propaganda in such au insidious way that the people may not realize its danger; but it amounts to note inflation, which",20,Financial Statement

91,Mr Nairn,The honourable member,21,Financial Statement
92,Mr Cubtin,The honourable member,21,Financial Statement
93,Mr Nairn,"implies repudiation, and the degree of the repudiation is measured only by the extent of the note inflation. The honourable member is fond of quoting Henry Ford. Again, last evening, he referred to this writer, and quoted his utterances of some years ago, when he was making automobiles at the rate of about 70 a day, and was naturally interested in keeping up wages, so that every wage earner in the United States of America would be able te> purchase one of his motor cars. Let me quote a recent utterance of Henry Ford in dealing with the Australian position. This statement was published in the Daily Neiva, which circulates in Fremantle, of the 27th September lastHenry Ford, in nn interview last month, classes the. Australian regulation of wages on the cost of living as only a way of putting into effect a kind of slavery. He says it ' is an utterly illogical method, for the standard by which you measure is made to depend on the thing measured-that is, the standard of living is determined by wages in the firstplace. To make it in truth the measure of the wage paid is simply to invent another vicious circle. In his own case, says Henry Ford, wo do not concern ourselves at all with tlie cost of living in fixing wages. I wish to make a few observations on the subject of interest. I will not stand for repudiation in any shape or form; but 1 realize that the time may come in Australia. I long in coming-when interest rates -will need to be considered in common with every other form of payment. I believe that this country can regain prosperity only when it gets buck to a financial condition somewhat comparable with pre-war conditions; or, at auy rate, approximating ihe financial standards of the countries with whicli it has to deal. It is plain that we cannot restore prosperity to the country by taxing ourselves, or by merely engaging in internal manufacture. shall always have to export our primary products, and we can only do so successfully when we can produce and sell on a basis which will give us a return comparable in value with that enjoyed by other countries. When Australia comes to her senses she will ,takc immediate steps to make effective in this country financial standards approximating those of other countries. In order to do this, reduction of income will undoubtedly have to be suffered by all classes in the community. Mr 'Nairn.. It is certain that wages, income from property and profits generally, will have to be reduced. I do not think that the holders of Government securities should be exempt from reduction of this kind. I foresee that it will not be long before costs in Australia will be much lower than they are now, and I hope that the day is not distant when twenty shillings will have as great a purchasing power here as thirty shillings now have. Nearly all our maturing loans will have to"" be converted at 6 per cent, or thereabout; but if there is a reduction in cost3 generally, that 6 per cent may he equivalent to S per cent, or 9 per cent, to-day. No oue, not even the holders of contracts, should be entitled to enjoy peculiar privileges at a time when the whole community is suffering. I do not believe that any considerable number of our citizens desire to be protected from fair and reasonable sacrifices at a time when the general community is making sacrifices. Deflation should bear evenly on all classes of tlie community, and, so long as it does so, it will not seriously adversely affect auy one, for there will be corresponding advantages. I do not believe that there should be any privileged class in the community. Bondholders should, not be privileged. When the time comes for us to re-consider interest rates we should do hope it will not be so in a fair and honest fashion. If we face the problem in that spirit there will be no grievous hardship inflicted upon any one. So long as the Government continues to pay 6 per cent. I cannot see that there will be any reduction in the general average of interest charges. member apply these remarks to overseas bondholders ? are in a different jiosition from that of We local bondholders. The purchasing capacity of overseas bondholders is not affected, by our condition. I reserve tj myself the right to deal with the interest problem fairly, honestly and equitably; but I shall at no time be a party to any repudiation. [Quorum formed.] I wish to deal briefly with the administration, of the Government.

94,Mr Maxwell,Would the honourable,22,Financial Statement
95,Mr Nairn,"Overseas bond-holdersoccupied the attention of Parliament, but have been devoid of any benefit to the community. have been taxation measures. The Government has seized the gold of the bankers and has applied exchange conditions to its own advantage when they should properly have been allowed to advantage our primary producers as was formerly the case. The exchange policy of the Government has undoubtedly deprived our primary producers of the enjoyment of the ful l value of their products. It is possible that the Government is entitled to claim some credit for having placed embargoes upon certain imports into Australia. But while the imposition of these embargoes has, to some extent, corrected our trade balances, it has resulted in. insolvency and ruin to hundreds of traders in imports which, in turn, has caused a great deal of unemployment. The advantages of the embargoes have, therefore, been offset to a large extent by under our vagrancy and consorting the disadvantages of them. We havo been called upon to consider tariff increases, sales taxation and the imposition of primary duties. All this additional direct and indirect taxation has had the effect of munity, without fear of, or favour to, any preventing onr people from enjoying the advantage of the fall in the world prices of commodities. The Govermnent has also introduced measures to tighten up our land tax administration. administration has been barren of any benefit to the community. I do not blame the individual members of the Government for this, because it is quite clear that they are not their owu masiters. Yesterday we saw. within the precincts of this House about a dozen goaders of Labour members who came to Canberra from the Sydney Trades Hall. lobbyists of the wheat merchants. were the political bosses of the Labour party. Air. NAIEN -Thes e men visited Canberra for the set purpose of directing the members of the Labour party to do certain things. In my opinion it is .inlarge section of people, who, because it tolerable that they should have beeu allowed to come here for such a purpose. In all the circumstauces I sympathize with the members of the Government. Undoubtedly they were obliged to do as they were told or to take the risk of losing All other major bills their political identity. One of these urgers of Labour members declared in the press that he considered that Labour members of Parliament were simply the advocates of the party executive. that? for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) docs not mind being put in that position. the Labour party and I abide by its decisions. of the Ministry do what they believe to be tlie best in the interests of the country when they are subject to the coercion of trade union officials? The position is humiliating in the extreme. In my opinion these men had an infernal cheek to come here, and the Ministry should have authority to deal with them laws. The Government was elected by the people, and it should be strong enough to do what, it believes to be best in the interest of the whole comparticular section. There is no doubt that, at present, Ministers are subject to duress by the Sydney Trades Hall. member is subjected to duress by the Employers Federation. totally independent of the Employers Federation. I am not beholden to it iu any shape or form. But the Minister has admitted that he* is bound to carry out the decisions of his party. I am sorry for the Minister, because of his humiliation, but I am. more sorry for this country. Unfair things are being done in connection with the effort to balance the budget. One section of the community is being singled out for grossly unfair taxation. Not one member supporting the Government has so far attempted to defend the increased taxation on incomes from property.

It is only right that he should face the sacrifices that are being borne by the great majority of the people at the present time. It is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the Government to protect that class of man from additional taxation. But the Labour party is 'taking this action knowing full well that the vote of the Public Service was largely responsible for putting it in office. It has lost the unattached and middle class vote, and it is now seizing its last desperate chance of being returned to the treasury bench by pandering to the two great sections of the community-the public servants und the trade unionists, in order to hold tlie reins of government.. Every other section of the community is suffering losses. The income tax return's must show that trade has fallen off considerably. Business men have had to dismiss their employees by the hundreds. The nominal return of unemployment is 20.5 per cent., but that does not take into account a large number of young people, who are not registered as unionists, and who have been looking for work for twelve months and more. Then again, the older class of worker who is out of a job has applied for an old-age pension. So that imeniployment to-day is much more than 20 per cent. This Government is doing nothing at all for the unemployed. It is absolutely insensible to the sufferings of thousands of our citizens who are almost on the bread line. It , of course, is not insensible to the influence of these two great classes, the public servants, and the unionists upon whom the Government is depending for its return to the treasury bench.

115,Able Member For Warringah ( Mr Arch,"We saw these men in the Senate watching the votes of Nationalist senators. At Owners Federation, came here and dictated to the Bruce-Page Government. It is well known, not only in this, but in every other country, that the interests represented by the honourable member for Warringah are the most exacting of the political supporters of the Nationalist party. They demand their pound of flesh, and get it every time. Honourable members opposite dare not vote against the interests of the Employers Federation, nor do they dare offend those interests. The protests and denials of honourable members opposite are simply humbug, and like so many bed-time stories for children. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) spoke about currency. He said that anybody who had money in the banks could write out a cheque, and, on presenting it, obtain notes, gold, or silver. member mentioned notes, silver and copper. He said that the currency of this country was notes, silver, and gold; but it is nothing of the sort. Notes are only the till money of a nation. The real currency is cheque pounds. That wa3 stated by Mulhall in 1SS7, and if the honourable member refuses to accept, my word perhaps he will accept the word of a man who is perhaps the most eminent statistician and economist in the world, certainly within the British empire. When Mulhall compiles a table of figures, the hallmark of fact is imprinted on it. In 1887, he said that the currency of Great .Britain was cheque pounds; that gold, silver, and bank notes did not comprise 3 per cent, of the cv..rrency of that country. Any economic movement of consequence is operated not by notes, copper, or silver, or gold when it was available, but . by cheque pounds. The honourable member for Perth said that a man with £10,000 in the bank could write out a cheque for that amount, and upon presenting it obtain £10,000 worth of notes. Of course, there could be one instance of that, but if a number of persons at one time attempted it, a stop would soon be put to it. To-day, our national currency is tihe Commonwealth note. Of course, silver and copper, as components of the pound, 'are used in a small way, and a certain quantity is circulated throughout the country; but the legal currency is the Commonwealth note. I draw a distinction between legal and illegal currency, between the counterfeit currency of the banker, and the legal currency of the nation. The bankers have a prerogative to issue currency, and, to-day, there is in this country a huge quantity of counterfeit currency issued by the banks. as a convenience only. how convenient that is for the banker. Does the honourable member subscribe to the statement that the banker can honour all his debts in legal currency, apart from gold? I did not mention gold. to the contrary. can go and get, notes. get some notes, hilt all the customers could not get all the notes to which they were en titled There is in circulation at the present time £46,000,000 worth of notes. Of these, 56 per ceut. are in the hands of the public, and 44 per cent, in the hands of the banks. The banks also owe their depositors £111,000,000 on current account, which may be demanded at any time-a t this moment-by cheque. Over and above that the banks have built a superstructure of credit amounting to £177,000,000. The depositors in the savings banks have placed in those institutious""no less than £2S0,000,000, all of which could be demanded immediately. Thus the public can demand from the banks this huge sum of money, and the banks have only £20,000,000 to £21,000,000 worth of currency with which to meet it. Yet the honourable member says that customers may walk into the bank, present cheques, and draw notes. All this leads up to the recent talk about inflation. Honourable members opposite are prepared to allow the banks to inflate the currency at their own sweet will. They will strain at the gnat of a necessary expansion of the note issue or the using of the Commonwealth Bank to",24,Financial Statement

124,Mr Lazzaeinl,"Any customer cancreate credit for a few millions, but will swallow the camel, hump and all, of credit and currency inflation by the private banks. Bankers in this and other countries inflate and deflate the currency as they please. Both here and elsewhere they are now engaged in the process of deflation, and that, economists are agreed, is the cause of the present depression. Not only has the note issue been reduced in this country, but bank credits have been reduced by over £100,000,000. Despite this, however, honourable members opposite will tell us that an expansion of the currency by a few million, pounds would constitute inflation. Do they consider that the currency is iuflated at the present time? Yet, if the banks choose, they can reduce the amount of currency by £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 more, and bank credits by £30,000,000, and then any suggestion to restore the currency and credit to the present condition would, no doubt, be condemned' as inflation. Financial authorities recognize that the present depression is a manufactured one. deliberately engineered for the purpose of bolstering up the national debt holdings of the financial institutions of the world. When honourable members opposite declare that they will have nothing to do with repudiation, nor vary the terms of the contract with the bond-holders, they lose sight of the fact that the alternative is repudiation of the right to live for tens of thousands of people, including women aud little children, finder the present system those who lent the Government £100 will receive in return as much as £50, £60 or £100 more than they invested. Yet honourable members opposite have the audacity to come here and, with their tongues in their cheeks, deplore the extent of unemployment at the present time. member repay the bond-holders the full a mount of their bonds? that presently; there will be nothing ambiguous about my proposal. This word "" inflation "" has been used to terrify the public,, but those who have used it do uot even know what it means. The formula I propose can be tested according to the tenets of any school of economists in the world, whether the most conservative as favoured by honourable members opposite, or the most radical, as followed by myself. Inflation of the currency is a process by which a government throws into circulation large amounts of currency, which it forces the nation to absorb without there being any addition to the volume of production. Governments can do this by keeping on printing notes for such purposes as paying public servants, pensions, & c ; but when a government uses an institution of its own, such as the Commonwealth Bank, to create credit to be used in the production of or consumption of wealth, it does not matter whether the currency be expanded by £1,000,000 or £100,000,000, no injury will be done to the community. For that statement.

Every effort made to bolster up the system which is visibly cracking before our eyes only puts us further into the mire. Much has been said about balancing the budget.

Why does lie not let us know what he would do? would be time wasted to explain my proposals to the honourable member. would still stick to his own opinion. He would still remain under the influence of the fetishes and hoodoos of the financial witch doctors. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) admitted yesterday that the position is becoming worse, but neither he nor any other member on the Opposition side has offered any constructive criticism. solution they offer is to take a few more pounds off the salaries of ' the public servants. Last night, when the Acting Treasurer announced a. new loan flotation in accordance with the old methods that some of us have criticized and resisted for years because they only put us deeper into the mire, we saw the unusual spectacle of the Leaders of the Opposition and the Country party rising to congratulate him on his policy. I require no greater proof of the unsoundness and stupidity of it. Both those honourable gentleman have attacked the Government for not honouring the promise supposed to have been given to Sir Otto Niemeyer at the Melbourne conference. During the recent election in New South Wales, Mr Bavin, throughout the State, denounced the Commonwealth Government for not having fulfilled its promise to balance the budget. He, too, had promised to balance the State budget, but when the Labour Government assumed office it found that the Nationalists had system. allowed the finances of the State to go to the bad to the extent of £15,000,000 in eight months. Not a word has been said blood? by honourable members opposite about Mr Bavin's repudiation and his failure to carry out his promise. The Nationalists have not the courage to try to meet the position, beyond proposing to cut a few pounds off the wage bill of the nation. Tie annual interest bill of Australia amounts to £37,000,000; defence costs £3,000,000, the Public Service, exclusive of the Postal Department, which pays its way, £3,000,000; pensions, £20,000,000, and various other commitments, £2,000,000; making a total of £65,000,000. On the present showing there will be a deficit of £5,000,000, and apparently honourable members opposite would, in some mysterious way, make that good by cutting something off a total wage bill of £3,000,000. Never do they suggest that the He interest bill should be reduced! Any oue who proposes that is called a repudiator. Interest is sacrosanct. Last night, whenever the honourable member for Premantle even hinted that a reduction of the interest payments might becomi; necessary, members of the Opposition became almost frantic in tlieir hostility. I repeat that no government could balance The only the budget, and every step tliat is taken towards that end merely makes the position worse. The capitalistic system of finance has broken down hopelessly. It has produced a huge burden of interests that cannot he borne, and through the constant application of machinery to production goods are being turned out twice as quickly as the world can consume them. The result is a huge army of unemployed in all countries. These two factors have got the world into the present mess, and the collapse of the capitalistic system is imminent. In less enlightened days, when phlebotomy was regarded as a cure-all, the quacks treated a patient weakened by fever by drawing a pint of blood from him. The world to-day is suffering from economic anaemia, aud some of the present day financial quacks are resorting to the old practice of drawing more blood from a body already impoverished.

Even the members of the Women's National League have sufficient brains to appreciate how stupid the honourable member can be. This young country still affords immense scope for development, and employment could be given, if not in immediate wealth production, at any rate in preparing the way for future production. I refer particularly to water conservation and developmental roads. We are told that these works cannot be carried out because we have no money. Those who preach that doctrine remind me of a man sitting by a stream and yet dying of thirst because he refuses to drink the water that flows at his feet.

If the nation cannot cash a bond, the bondholder cannot foreclose on the Government, and take a post office or a railway station in lieu of his money. The only security behind the bond is the wealth of this country, and the probability that the people will continue to work and produce more wealth. There is no security apart from the faith which people have iu their own country, but that is sufficient, whether the bond be for £1,000,000 or £2,000,000,000. If £20,000,000 were written on one side of the ledger, the spending of that money would create buoyancy and result in men being put to work. They would be relieved of the soul-de3troying dole, and given back their self-respect and self-reliance. Employment would enable them to purchase food and clothing. Out. of stagnation would come buoyancy, which would create a fund from which would be no interest to pay. Instead of it would be credited to the people's account for redemption of the £20,000,000.

If I am merely giving expression to foolish ideas, I challenge any member of the House to come into my electorate and try to make a fool of me on the public platform. I guarantee that the people in my electorate will quickly let any honourable member who tries to disprove the truth, of my statements know who :.s the fool. No honourable member opposite cart destroy my argument by applying to it the banking principles followed throughout the British Empire for the last 100 years in national debt creation and loan flotation. Nor can it be done by applying the test of any economic law laid down by the most conservative or the most radical economists in the world, or any mathematical test. Until honourable members opposite can show by those means that the principles that I advocate are unsound, they should have the courage to admit that they are well founded. Until they can show the people some way out of the present economic trouble, they should at least have the decency to treat with some degree of respect propositions which they dare not challenge. No matter under what name the government of the country may be known, the fact remains that we are bolstering up a financial and economic system that is as false as hell itself. By this wretched system the country is being pushed further into the mire of depression. In the midst of plenty, as I have said, when nature was never more bountiful than she is at the present time, men, women, and children cannot obtain food. We boast of our so-called civilization. If we can do no better than continue the present financial system, we ought to be honest with the people, and say to them, "" We can do nothing for you. Send somebody else into this Parliament."" should cease being political confidence men. If we continue to fool the people uncier a system that is breaking down under our very eyes, we shall cause even greater depression than is now being experienced. It is time for us to apply new doctrines, or admit to the electors that we have fallen down on the job, and that they should send others to this ch anther. The budget brought down by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) is described as an emergency one, and, judging by its contents, I should say that it will be only the first of several emergency budgets that will appear during the present year. It is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth that there should be a second budget brought down by the same government owing to the enormous disparity between the original estimates of expenditure aud revenue and the actual figures. The Acting Treasurer has said that the great need of this country is leadership. He remarkedTlie community generally is at present in a state of inertia, and is awaiting a lead from some responsible authority to. restore confidence. That lead should undoubtedly come from the highest representative body in tlie community, which is the Commonwealth Government. The Government recognizes this responsibility. The first need in present circumstances is thut tbe Government should taUe steps for the balancing of the budget. No truer words have been spoken than that the need is for real leadership; but I think that one might scan the revised budget for many hours without observing evidence of this leadership. We find in this budget no evidence whatever of leadership, but plenty of evidence of attempts by the Government to compromise with the extreme elements in this country, lustead of endeavouring to give effect to the undertakings made with the State Premiers at the conference in August last, with the object of balancing its budget and restoring credit, the Government has compromised in almost every detail with those who in the last few months have done so much damage to the credit of Australia. The speech delivered this afternoon by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) shows that these extremists are still We endeavouring to damage our credit by their hare-brained schemes for dealing with the present position. We are a naturally brave nation, but through the cowardice and folly of certain leaders have been put into a state of panic. This has occurred because certain political leaders have, in two successive elections induced the people to put selfish fears before national safety. As",28,Financial Statement

New York to a degree which could scarceh bave been regarded as possible even had we actually defaulted in our obligations. At present our 5 per cent, stocks are about 20 per cent, lower than similar stocks of New Zealand and South Africa, although our credit should be just as good. We have vast national resources and possibilities in this country, but our credit has been destroyed in the last few months by the outbursts of irresponsible extremists. It is necessary for us to find only £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 to enable us to meet our present obligations, but the world has practically been asked to regard us as in the position of defaulters. wealth of between £3,000,000,000 and £4,000,000,000 should be able to raise £30,000,000 odd by simple self-denial. But because some people in this country have refused to face the facts we are brought to our present sorry situation and extreme difficulties. The British Government and the Bank of England both offered to come to our assistance. were prepared to help us in our present extremity. England offered to send to Australia one of its leading experts to assist us to find a way out of our diffihas, in effect,' proclaimed to the whole culties. This gentleman came here as the guest of the Australian Government, and gave us his best assistance in offering suggestions to enable us to meet the situaneither more nor less than a declaration tion which faced us.

No self respecting citizen of Australia would have thought that such a thing could occur. If the Government was not not prepared to accept the advice of this gentleman, it could have said so. But, having accepted the assistance offered to us, it was surely deplorable in the extreme that our visitor should have been execrated and insulted as he has beeu during the' past few weeks, simply for political purposes. Ministers have been playing down to the Or. Earle Pane. crowd, and have done things of which they should never have been guilty. If the Government Avas too proud to accept the assistance offered it, it should have said so; out it should at the same time have taken steps to meet the situation which confronted it.

We could deny ourselves the enjoyment of some of these products which are at present consumed locally, and so leave more of them for A nation with export.

Our whole tariff policy with its embargoes and prohibitive duties is that in spite of the highest protective tariffs we are unable to produce in competition with other countries. By placing an embargo upon the importation of British galvanized iron, for instance, we have practically said that we cannot manufacture galvanized iron here in competition with Great Britain, even with the advantage of an extremely high duty, or bounty. The embargoes on the other imports are an admission of the' same kind. Our many proscriptive tariffs also declare our inferiority.

As a result of the inflation unemployment had become rampant throughout Australia, the figures mounting to 11 per cent, higher than ever before in our history. When, however, prices fell subsequently, though there was some readjustment of wages, the purchasing power of the wage-earner became much higher than in .the period of high prices. It will be seen, therefore, that within the last ten years we have had an object lesson iu currency inflation. When prices were high, the position of the worker was worse than when prices were low. I cannot understand honourable members opposite who advocate that we should jettison our past experience and conduct another experiment in this dangerous practice that must damage the workers first. Apparently, t-he only remedy that the Government has for our present difficulties is increased taxation. The Acting Treasurer has followed the policy laid clown in the budget which we dealt with earlier this year, and has proposed, still further increases in taxation. Not only arc the foodstuffs of the workers and the raw materials subjected to increased taxation, but property taxation is to be imposed to a degree which is almost confiscatory. This taxation must inevitably strangle industry. A tax of 5d. per lb. is to be imposed on tea iu containers of less than 25 lb., and 4d. per lb. on tea in bulk. Thus not even the necessaries of life of the poorer people in this community are to be exempt from additional imposts by this Government. A tax of 4d. per lb. is also to_ be imposed on raw rubber, and this at a time when our rubber manufacturing industries were not only supplying our own requirements, but were actually beginning to build up an export trade.

The proportion of increase on an income of £300 is about 900 per cent., and on an income of £600 about 300 per cent. When examining the incidence of the proposed taxation generally, we find that the proportionate percentage increase of taxation on a man receiving less than £1,000 a year will be about 150 per cent., and on a man receiviug £10,000 a year, about 50 per cent. That shows how ill thought-out have been the Government's proposals. The effect of these proposals will be to further reduce wages throughout the country. It is idle to say that wages have not been reduced during the regime of this Government. The unemployment percentage has practically doubled during the last twelve months, and a wide scheme of rationing has been operating which practically means that the worker's wage has been cut down to that extent. At the of industry to be same time some of the State Governments have levied an unemployment relief tax of 1 from 3d. to Is. in the £1 on the workers' wages so as to keep men in employment. The policy of the Government has had the effect of reducing wages and increasing unemployment. It is robbing men of their wages and their savings as well as their jobs. The statement of the Government that no reduction of wages or salaries is taking place is just so much camouflage. The Government is placing on the public servants a tax of 10 per cent., which is to be taken from their aula ties before they even, receive them. No one in this country would be so foolish as to be deceived by the Government's ostrich-like pretence that wages and action. According to the statement of the Acting Treasurer, our national income has declined by some £70,000,000 a year. Our standard of living has fallen while the cost of living has been maintained. At the present time we need capital in this country more than anything else. There has been a serious drop in the prices of our exportable commodities, and our borrowing overseas has been seriously curtailed. Therefore, we should' encourage the people to save money to increase the local capital available. ' With more capital we shall have more employment. More capital means high wages aud more work than men. Absence of capital brings about unemployment and low wages; there are more men than work, and wages come down. Under those circumstances, one would think that the Acting Treasurer would aim at reducing taxation iu such a fashion as to encourage saving in the community instead of destroying entirely, as he is d'oing, the opportunity to do that. presented by the Acting Treasurer has had little or no consideration. It has been hurriedly fixed together to prevent the party from splitting rather than to save the nation from crashing. The introduction of this revised budget is without precedent in the history of Australia. It has been presented to this House in conformity with the Melbourne agreement, which contains this paragraph:A Premiers' conference was accordingly convened and after full consideration of the whole position the following resolution relating to the budgets was unanimously pajscdThat the several governments represented at this conference declare their (ixed determination to balance their respechas practically admitted that the post tive budgets for the financial year, 1930-31. office revenue will, this year, be reduced and to maintain a similar balanced budget in future years. equilibrium such a basis as is consistent with ""he repayment or conversion in Australia of existing internal debt maturing in the next few years. any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure, immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the budgets shall balance. It is as well to consider the statement of the Acting Prime'Minister, made contemporaneously with the resolution passed at the conference. He stated, in effect, that the budget would be balanced by a reduction of expenditure of £4,000,000, and that no taxation would he imposed which would interfere with the efforts of the States to balance their budgets. Let us ascertain exactly how the Government has conformed to that resolution. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) said that it was only a pious hope. honourable member that resolution was not the considered opinion of responsible Ministers, but only a pious and stupid hope. It is.statements such as that which are damaging irretrievably our credit and prestige abroad. Everybody is prepared to admit that the Prime Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet are at any rate trying to balance the budget; and it is only because of the pressure exerted from other quarters that their endeavours to balanco the budget are being thwarted. The strikThe"" financial statement ing thing about the financial statement is that, instead of providing for a decrease of expenditure, it actually provides for an increase in expenditure of £800,000 in respect of certain items. The Acting Treasurer admits that he is faced with a deficit of from £8,000,000 to £15,000,000. Yeti t Is proposed to increase the expenditure by £800,000! Alongside that expenditure is shown certain estimated savings totalling £1,230,000. The principal item is £500,000, in respect of the post office. That is a business undertaking, and a reduction of expenditure in that direction is likely to lead to a reduction of revenue as well. That will leave us no better off. In fact, the Acting Treasurer This budget by £1,000,000. There is to be a reducwill be maintained ""on tion of government expenditure of £190,000 in connection with bounties. That will place a further tax upon the Further, if during primary producers, the small householders and the men developing the outback country, who will pay the same tax as now. They will have to bear the whole burden of the increased prices of essential commodities, instead of the community as a whole. Por the first time in our history a federal government has deliberately set out to retard the development and settlement of this country by its policy. There will be no real saving at all by bringing about these so-called savings in expenditure. Our estimates",31,Financial Statement

153,Dr. Eaele Page,"According to theof taxation have grievously failed. When high taxation was levied some three months ago, we on this side truly stated that it would defeat its own object; that it would strangle industry and drive many men into bankruptcy. The sales tax was said by the Government to be one of the simplest taxation measures in existence. Even the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) complained of its simplicity. He said that it was the most abominable tax introduced into this House. able member suggest in its place? simple that the newspapers have published daily ever since a serial story sioner explaining its operation. The estimate of revenue from this tax will fall short by some million pounds. It is nothing like so simple and effective as the Government at first indicated. It is, in fact, very vexatious. We find also that the customs aud excise revenue will be short of the estimate by some £9,000,000 on the year. In four months that revenue has fallen by some £3,000,000. Post office revenue is short by £1,000,000. Altogether there is about £11,000,000 of estimated revenue by way of taxation which will not eventuate this year; yet at the same time there is to be an increase in expenditure of £800,000. Looking at the governmental accounts, we find that during the year the overdraft of the Government has increased by £8,000,000. We have an unsecured overdraft with the Commonwealth Bank in Australia and London, and taking iuto consideration the obligations of the States, we must admit that the position is serious. Our national credit has been damaged and the value of Australian stocks has depreciated to the extent of 20 percent.,as cominto £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 before the pared with the corresponding price last year aud with New Zealand stocks. Even the honourable member for Premantle ( Mr Curtin) admitted last night that overseas people were scared of Australian stocks. The reason, of course, is that while certain members of the Government have been trying to create confidence, and while the Opposition, contrary to the methods pursued by Labour oppositions in the State Parliaments, has been doing everything possible to help, the responsible leaders of the Government have not had the courage to stand up to the repudiationists and inflationists of their own party and say: "" We will have nothing whatever to do with this evil and unclean thing."" Our credit has declined as a result of this weak-kneed attitude. Now, within five weeks of the maturity of loans totalling £27,000,000, no prospectus for their conversion has yet been issued. The leaders of the Government were fully informed regarding the position of meeting this loan. They had an opportunity of discussing it with financial authorities, and yet they abdicated the responsibility of leadership and came down here and asked for the uninformed opinion of caucus; of men who could not by the Taxation Commispossibly know anything about the situation. Now the leaders of the Government find it necessary to ignore that opinion. Last Thursday caucus favoured a compulsory loan. This week the Governmentmade a declaration that the ordinary steps would be taken for conversion, and that everything would be done to reassure public opinion, and that there would be no compulsory loan. While the Government is saying this, however, there is still"" a powerful section of its supporters who say that we must have a bit of inflation, too. Nothing could be more calculated to disturb public confidence. When we consider the budget itself, we find that instead of there being a decrease of expenditure everywhere, in at least three items there is an increase. Taxation returns have fallen short of the estimate, and the Government's first and most important duty, namely, that of balancing the budget, has not been fulfilled. It will be found that even upon the most optimistic: view the revised budget provides for au estimated deficit of £1,200,000, a deficit which may well grow end of the financial year. the right honourable member himself failed to balance? budgets balance, and in every one of my budgets I provided the f u l l amount for the sinking fund.

157,Dr. Earle Page,"I made fivesliould have been able to show a surplus over even the last two years. Over seven years the Treasurer himself says £14,000,000 in excess of statutory obligations was paid into sinking funds by me as Treasurer. As deficits were £4,900,000 in all, this shows a surplus of over £9,000,000 if I had adopted the methods of the present Government. important defect in this budget is that it does not balance; it does not carry out the terms of the Melbourne agreement. The second defect is that it fails to keep intact customs duty on no fewer than 550 the sinking fund payments provided for by law. This raid on the sinking fund is not likely to assist in restoring public confidence. Up to the present the Government has given us no explanation why this action has been taken. There never could have been a more inopportune time for such a step when we are trying to impress upon investors that we really do intend to pay our debts. .Further, tlie taxation contemplated in this budget is excessive in amount, and inequitable in incidence. It discourages saving by destroying the incentive t.o save. People who have skimped and saved for years in order to have something to support them in the evening of their lives will be forced on to the old-age pension .by the confiscatory nature of the tax on property. tax initiative on the part of manufacturers and business men by putting a duty on raw material. The Government has already done much to injure business interests by the imposition of 'ihe sales tax, framed in such a way that it is sure to be compounded by those who have to pass it on. It has also increased the primage duty from 2^ per cent, to 4 per cent., and this is likely to represent more like 14 per cent, or 24 per cent, by the time it is' paid by the ultimate consumer though the Government will only receive the 4 per cent. Government has taken off the bounty on such necessary items as wire fencing. Thus, while it urges r,he farmers to grow more wheat, to produce more for export, it has, by this and similar steps, increased his production coats. The farmer will now have to pay £2 12s. a ton more for his fencing wire than he did in the past. Other actions by the Government have resulted in removing the margin of profit from various undertakings, and thus preventing further development from accrued saviugs. The taxation of property under these proposals is such as to amount almost to confiscation. It will drive thousands of persons out of business, and will react even upon The most wage-earners who have put their savings into company shares, fixed deposits or savings bank deposits. The Government has increased the items, and on that policy the Government pinned its faith for relieving unemployment. The Acting Minister for Customs( Mr Forde) declared with every increase of duty that it would result in the absorption of 10,000 up to 50,000 more employees. His optimism is not even yet extinguished. Only a few weeks ago, when I was in the Murrumbidgee district, I listened to him speaking on behalf of the State Labour candidate, and he told the electors that the Labour -Government proposed to build them a rice factory which, would employ at least 2,000 persons. Unfortunately, the direct result of his optimism has been to throw thousands of persons out of work. Duties have been imposed in a gay and lighthearted fashion which have had the reI t is proposed also to sult of closing factories, forcing men into bankruptcy, and putting workers on the list of unemployed. He told us that these increases in the tariff would have the result of correcting our adverse trade balance. At the end of the first three months of the present financial year, our trade balance, if we exclude bullion, of whicli there has been an extraordinary export for the purpose of creating overseas credits, is adverse to the extent of between two and three million pounds. We are actually worse off than we were at the end of 1928-29, in which year there was a The favorable trade balance of £1,500,000. The decline in imports has been just as great in' respect, of those goods which are admitted duty free as in the case of goods upon which excessive duties were placed. In fact, the percentage decrease has been greater in the case of many free items. The reason, of course, is obvious. The greatest bar t.o the importation of goods into Australia is our comparative poverty, due to the decline of our national income. Our imports have fallen, roughly, by 40 per .cent, from every country in the world. Importations by other countries have also declined by 25 per cent, to 40 per .cent., and for the same reason as in our .own case, namely, diminution of purchasing power. These other countries have been able to reduce their imports without imposing excessive customs taxation, or bringing in panic legislation in the nature of embargoes. The Government's tariff policy has had the result of building up vested interests which it will take years to get rid of, and which will stand in the way of tariff reform while doing no good in our present position. Now the Labour party, recognizing that its tariff policy, to which it pinned its faith, has failed lamentably, says that the cure of our ills is to inflate the currency. It says that it will bring in a new banking policy, resulting in the issue of £20,000,000 worth more notes. It will make credits available to those who want them. Ten years ago we had an example of the result of such procedure. We found that inflation at that time sent prices up much faster than wages could follow them. The disparity between prices and wages caused more and more industrial unrest, and more and more unemployment. It was not until we began to bring down prices that there was any improvement in the position of the wage earners. Those who profess to speak for the workers, and at the same time advocate a policy of inflation which has already resulted in increasing prices faster than wages, the destruction of their savings, injuring all those on salaries or pensions, are not friends but enemies of the workers. It is always during a time of falling prices that the workers have been able to buy more with their wages. It is evident, therefore, that the time has come, seeing that the Government's tariff policy has completely failed, to do something to bring down the cost of living and of production. The old standard of living has virtually disappeared already because of the diminution of national income, though the cost of living, unfortunately, remains high. The cost Dr. Eavrlc Page. of living can be reduced only by a complete and scientific revision and reclassification of the tariff schedule. If that were done we should see within the next two or three, months a drop of a.t least 25 per cent, in price levels. Let us compare what has happened in Great Britain and Australia. There has been in Australia a drop of 11 per cent, in the index numbers upon which the basic wage is computed. An examination shows that that is almost entirely due to the drop that has taken place in the products of the primary producer. To illustrate the serious decline in those prices, I need refer only to butter and eggs,\the prices of which have dropped by 80 per cent, and ,50 per cent, respectively. Accordingly we find that the basic wage indices have decreased by 11 per cent. In Great Britain, however, while there has been a decline of 25 per cent, in the index number for cereals and meat, and of 27 per cent, in the case of other food products, the prices of textiles and other articles used in the home have dropped to the extent of no less than 45 per cent. In Australia those manufactured articles are as dear as they ever have been, despite the fact that the worker is receiving less on account of rationing and of different methods of taxation. History shows £hat a great primary producing country, if properly handled, can recover from a depression such as that through which we are «ow passing much more rapidly and effectively than can a manufacturing country. Oonsequently, we should give the primary producers, and producers generally, an opportunity to escape as quickly as possible from the difficulties that confront them. To that end, when the present amendment has been disposed of to bring down the cost of living and production, I propose to move that the following words be added to the motion:As an Instruction to the Government to revise immediately the tariff upon a scientific basis, so that the cost of living will be reduced, the cost of production lessened, itnd employment increased. The present Government has placed in the 4'0 per cent, and over class, no fewer than 550 tariff items. During the regime of the last Government the number was only 200. The items in the 00 per cent, class also run into hundreds, while items abound in the 80 per cent, and 90 per cent, class and some of the duties actually range up to 600 per cent, and 700 per cent. These duties have been imposed in such a way as to destroy the preference that was being given to Great Britain. I have previously outlined in this House extensive means whereby we can immediately reduce duties that are only camouflaged protective duties. If they were removed, the whole of our producers would be placed in a very much better position to help Australia through the present crisis by an immediate fall in the cost of liviug and of production. I refer to duties that are imposed on capital plant equipment, and machinery and machine products that are used in the manufacture of other goods. It has been shown already that in the year £30,000,000 worth of those goods in the capital plant equipment class were imported into this country, despite the existence of a wide range of duties, the reason being that they are not manufactured in Australia. Take, for example, electric motors, of which only a small number and range are made in Australia. The duty upon these motors has by this Government, with the result that the wives of the workers, as well as the manufacturers, are penalized to a degree that would not be contemplated by any sensible nation. Any person who has studied the question knows that, during the last 30 years, much of the improvement in working men's conditions in the cities has been obtained at the expense of additional drudgery for their wives because of the difference in cost between goods carried home and goods delivered. In the industrial suburbs to-day, the wives of workers employ Saturday morning in collecting the week's supplies of household necessaries from the greengrocer and other providers. Frequently, they are hampered by having to drag round with them two or three children. Thirty years ago tliose commodities were delivered; but the conditions of cartage and the other obligations of the shopkeeper have been made so onerous that to-day he offers a bonus to any who will relieve him from the necessity of keeping men to discharge those functions, and it is upon women that the burdeu has fallen. U""nder those conditions the Labour party especially should go out of its way to make certain that unnecessary drudgery is dispensed with. Yet, it has imposed a duty of £5 on a J horse-power motor, such as drives an electric washing machine. It is not now made in this country, and may not be made here for 20 or 30 years, because of the specialized nature of the work and the limited demand. tbe right honourable gentleman to indicate the connection between his remarks and the motion for the printing of the financial statement. with the question of taxation, and the manner in which the cost of living can before last something like be brought down. gentleman will not be in order in going into details. notice that I propose to move an amendment.

I have pointed out, also, that certain other items are in their incidence entirely revenue producing. imported to the extent of £30,000,000, the revenue derivable therefrom amounting to £10,600,000.

But I certainly will not permit a detailed, discussion of such questions. The honourable gentleman can see that if I were to permit what he has suggested there would be a departure from the fundamental issues raised by the financial .state of one particular motor rose from £54 to ment. The Chair must have unfettered discretion to determine this particular matter. certain items in the electrical trade, some of which are revenue-producing and others are non-revenue-producing. I have referred to i horse-power motors which are not manufactured in Australia. As a result of the duty that is imposed upon them and other component parts of that machine the price of washing machines in Australia is £60, compared with £20 in the United States of America, in which country they are to be found in the bulk of the workers' homes, whereas, in Australia, few can afford to purchase them on account of the stupid manner in which the tariff has been imposed. Surely there should be a reclassification of the tariff that would enable articles that are not produced in Australia or not produced commercially in Australia to be imported free of duty. Let me give another illustration from the bigger end of the industry. I find Goods of a certain type were that at the present time the railway commissioners are paying something like £4,300 for certain electrical equipment that they must import because it is not made in Australia, and which should cost them only £2,400. There are thousands of similar cases. What is the effect upon the cost of living and on prices generally? otherwise would be, or additional taxation must be imposed to make good the deficit on the railways. Pirst of all the money is taken out of the pockets of the people by the Federal Government by way of a duty. Then, too, the purchasing power of to understand, the community is lessened because of high freights. Therefore, I say that there is no more effective means of increasing production and of bringing down the cost of living than by a reduction of the tariff on such items. They do not protect any industry, but are imposed merely with the object of obtaining revenue. An unfortunate feature of our tariff is that many commodities, the manufacture of which in Australia is encouraged, are not made efficiently, but are highly priced, as a result of the duty that has to be paid on the imported article. During the last four or five months the price £80. As a result fewer of them will be sold. The profit on three will probably be as great as it was on five, but these",37,Financial Statement

199,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [8.38].,"fallen off most lamentably. The Acting Treasurer discussed the various phases of this happening in some detail. The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech, told us that he had foreseen all this last year, and had warned the Government that it was to be expected. I"" shall not say anything about that, because, even if it be true, it does must be faced by the people of Australia not help us much; I shall confine myself, at the outset, to an examination of the proposals of the Government. The Acting Treasurer proposes to balance his budget. No doubt that is a most desirable thing to do. He has told us that for the first quarter of the current financial year there is a deficit of £6,747,000, and if this be taken as .measuring the extent of the financial drift during the twelve months, obviously it would leave the Commonwealth with a deficit of some £25,000,000. The Acting Treasurer, however, taking an optimistic view, says that we are not to expect that things will continue as they have been going for the past three months, and budgets for a deficit of between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. He does not tell us what reasons he has for believing that things will get better. We see no break in the heavens whatever; nothing but a heavy blackness. There is not the slightest sign of the blue streak promising the coming of a better day. The thought that we all have in our minds is that things cannot get better unless something is done to make them better. Does the honourable gentleman suggest that what he is now proposing will make things better? That is a fair question to ask him. Does he suggest that this country, which is now in a position the like of which has never been known in its history, is going to be raised like Lazarus from the dead, by this rod of taxation which he proposes to lay savagely across' its back? circumstances in which the Commonwealth finds itself to-day. I have said that the Commonwealth deficit for this quarter amounts to £6,747,000. But the States are in no better case. The deficit of the State of' New South Wales for the three months amounts to £4,387,000. The Victorian deficit is £2,090,000, the Queensland deficit £866,000, the South Australian deficit £1,027,000, the Westorn Australian deficit £542,000, and the Tas manian deficit £263,000, making the deficit in the Commonwealth and State finances combined £15,995,000 for the first three months of the current financial year. At this rate a total deficit of approximately £63,000,000 for the year through their various governmental institutions. He would be, indeed, the prince of optimists who could believe, in the face of these facts, that things are to get better to the extent to which the honourable gentleman suggests. How are they to get better? Our present burden of taxation is crushing, and the honourable gentleman proposes to make this burden impossible to bear. Yet he tells us that he expects things will get better. I do not say that the circumstances do not justify the imposition of additional taxation. Justification may be claimed for any desperate remedy it is proposed to a PPty to a desperate disease, but the question to be asked in such a case is, what are the chances of the patient's recovery? That is what we must ask ourselves. The taxation which the people will be called upon to pay under the Government's proposals will make Australia the most highly taxed country in the world. Britain has hitherto enjoyed that doubtful honour. Taxation in Britain has been about £15 14s. per capita, while the present taxation of Australia amounts to £14 0s. l d . per capita. Buti f Commonwealth and State budgets are to balance this must be greatly increased. The people of New South Wales will have to pay in addition to their present taxes taxation little short of that proposed by the honourable member, because there will be a deficit in that State of some £16,000,000 for the year. If we consider the taxation per breadwinner we get some idea of Let us consider the what this really means. The taxation per breadwinner in that State is at present £34 6s. If taxation sufficiently high to balance the New South Wales budget were imposed, the taxation per breadwinner would be £60 6s.; and there would have to be a similar increase in every other State, and for the Commonwealth. On top of that, our citizens are asked by the Acting Treasurer to subscribe to a conversion loan for nearly £28,000,000, and to face a demand for £76,000,000 for cannot balance our budget while nearly loans maturing next year, at the same one-third of the wealth-producers are idle time meeting treasury-bills for large -unles s we can borrow money in order to amounts. Yet tbe honourable member tells do so, and the prospects of that are us that things may get better! How can remote. they get better? Certainly we cannot be taxed into prosperity. The"" honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) placed his finger on the ment proposals, standing by themselves, real problem upon the solution of which are as the twittering of sparrows. the restoration of prosperity depends.

These run into have gone, we should not now be in our tens of thousands at the present present position. It is of no use, however, time. houses in Sydney to-day are rationing figures only the other day which showed their employees. Approximately 30 of that the last Government had spent every 100 of the workers of Australia are £176,000,000 more during its seven years idle.

If we could provide employment for the people there would be no difficulty whatever in paying our debts or in balancing the budget. What is the trouble? In olden times, when the world was poor, aiid men were in difficulties, they could ascribe their misfortunes to a physical cause. They were able to say "" A. famine has overtaken us; the Lord has turned his face from, us."" But to-day men are stricken in the midst of abundance. Australia has never been so fertile, and has never before yielded so abundantly every form of wealth. Indeed, the world has never been so rich in real wealth as at this moment, yet never have men been so distressed. .Even during the war there was not so much disturbance and depression as now. There is sbme excuse for the prevailing conditions in England, where great * depression exists, and over 2,000,000 are unemployed. sell her manufactured goods in the markets of the world so that she may feed her people. 6,000,000 tons of wheat a. year, and grows only 1,000,000 tons that can be turned into flour. She must sell her goods to obtain that extra 5,000,000 tons, or literally Starve. Our circumstances are entirely different. This year we shall grow sufficient wheat, to feed 30,000,000 people. We have an abundance of food and of raw materials. One is amazed at the mountains of wealth of all kinds in the world-wool , wheat, sngar, cotton, jute-, rubber, and metals. Yet, threading their way through this abundance are great, armies of dejected unemployed men. Trade is depressed. The owners of wealth in one form are anxious to exchange it for some other forms of wealth, but cannot do so. Surely this is a scathing commentary upon the intelligence of mankind, a crushing condemnation of its incapacity to govern, and adapt itself to modern methods! Here, certainly, there is no famine, no pestilence has overtaken us. We are not writhing under the lash of war; on the contrary, there is perfect peace. Throughout the world millions are unemployed. In this country, which during the present years 'has''grown 'sufficient wheat to feed 30,000,000 people, 400,000 men are unemployed. I ask my friend the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons), where does he think that this is going to stop? What reason has he to believe that the 20 per cent, of unemployment amongst trade unionists will become 16 per cent, instead of 25 per cent., that the 25 per cent, will not become 30 per cent., the 30 per cent. 35 per cent., and the 35 per cent. 40 per cent.? When, and by what means, is he going to sprag this wheel? Surely not by balancing budgets. There must, be some other means, because Great Britain balances her budgets yet is powerless to find relief for her -unemployed. One Government follows another; it makes great protestations to the people; it declares that it will solve the riddle in this or that way, but fails to do so. There must be some reason why this problem baffles men, and why, in the midst of abundance, the world is full of poverty and wretchedness. The honourable gentleman has not yet disclosed the England has to policy of the Government in this matter. A statement of what he proposed to do would have thrown a flood of light on this She needs budget. What else does he intend to give us!. We asked for bread, and he has given us this stone. How is industry generally to find employment for the people? Employers are to be asked to pay taxation heavier than that of any other people in the world. Mi-.

200,Mr Hughes,"Quite so. They aresuch a state of affairs. It is unthinkable that, in a world that is full of wealth, unemployment should stalk like a shadow. Is wealth in itself such an accursed thing that it begets unemployment? Here are men who are willing to work; they ask only for the opportunity to work. No one denies their capacity. It is but yesterday that they were employed. Upon the shoulders of this Government not the faintest trace of responsibility rests for all that happened before it took office; but with the passage of each month its load of responsibility has grown heavier. It has now been in office for twelve months.. Has it a remedy for this problem that confronts the whole world, and that will have to be solved if the world is not to go down? We have not been given an inkling of what the remedy is. What is the Government waiting for? Perhaps it believes that in the womb of time son.ii; sovereign panacea is now being hatched. If there is any reason to believe that that is the case, we should share in the knowledge that gives the honourable gentlemen this comforting assurance. We are not aware of it. But what wo do know is that, at the very moment when Australia has reached the zenith of her possibilities with her present population in the primary industries, when she has never looked nor been in a better condition, we have an army of unemployed men very nearly, if not quite, equal to the army we sent to the world war. Surely this must have given the Govern merit much food for thought. We are told that it has been giving the most earnest thought to our financial circumstances. demand earnest, thought.

Wool prices have dropped 40 per cent., wheat prices perhaps even more. taken place at a time when our prayers daily were directed to heaven that they should rise to their zenith. If the price of wheat were 5s. a bushel, half of our troubles would disappear. The Government has been giving consideraMr Hughes. lion to our finances, but what thought has been given to the circumstances that underlie and are the cause of our financial troubles? We are not told, and nobody knows. Is there something incubating, something that is to be revealed to us nt a moment that, perhaps, will be dramatic in its setting? May I point out that while this fiddling is going on, Rome is burning. These men who are unemployed are not starving physically; but from patient law-abiding citizens they are being driven by the inexorable pressure of circumstances into becoming rebels. Does the Government think that unemployment can continue, growing daily, and that nothing will ha]>pen? What would ir matter if budgets were never balanced, so long as these men were employed? We could soon get men to balance budgets; they could be hired to do so. What WP want now are men who will tackle this problem-the greatest with which men have ever been confronted. What does the Government propose to do? That is the question. We have been given, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), some indication of the remedy that he has in mind for these distressful conditions. We are to reduce the cost of production, reduce wages, and lower the standard of living. I know very well that he, and those who support him, are most reluctant to admit that that is what is actually meant. Sir Otto Niemeyer, however, at least had the courage to express his opinions. He declared very frankly indeed that what was necessary was a Indeed, they rednction of the standard of living. The Acting Treathing of the sort.

If that docs uot bear out what I said, words have lost their meaning. A reduction of the cost of production involves reduction of wages and of the standard of living. That it means reduction of wages is easily proved. That it means a reduction of the standard of living is not so easily proved from the actual words of honourable members of the Opposition, but their patron saint, Sir Otto Niemeyer, has made that meaning perfectly clear. Those honourable members say that the remedy for this world-wide affliction is a reduction of the cost of production. It is difficult to conceive of anything more profoundly silly and at variance with the facts. Look round the world at some of the industries that have suffered most severely. Foremost amongst them are rubber and sugar. The price of rubber has fallen from 2s. l i d . per lb. in 1927 to 3fd., and the planters are in despair. They say, with what truth I do not know, that the cost of production is about 15d. per lb., yet the price has fallen from 8fd. to 3fd. in the last few months. It is now one-fourth of the cost of production, and as the industry is carried on entirely by coloured labour, a reduction in the cost of production is impossible. To-day cane sugar is quoted abroad at £6 per ton. It cannot be produced at that price in Cuba, Java or elsewhere. The same fate has overtaken this commodity as has overtaken white-grown wheat and wool in Australia, notwithstanding that the sugar industry is everywhere conducted by coloured labo.ur, except in this country, where the cost of production is very much higher. Cotton and jute are other examples. The former is almost entirely, and the latter entirely, produced by coloured labour. Both have suffered severe falls in prices, and the jute industry is in desperate straits. The wage of the Indian labourer is about od. greatest intensify in industries in which coloured labour is employed and a lower cost of production is impossible. I turn to the Opposition for a remedy for this state of affairs, because so far the Government has not offered one. The remedy proposed by the Opposition is the reduction of wages and the standard of living? Is this a real remedy? If it is we should adopt it. Australia is sliding further down the hill; financially and economically it is going from bad to worse, and some remedy must be found if we are to avoid disaster. The Acting Prime Minister stated a few days ago that whereas fifteen months ago unemployment was 14 per cent!, it had risen at the 30th September to 20.5. What it is to-day we do not know. At this season the primary industries are making their maximum demand for labour, and that will continue till the end of the harvest. If at this moment 400,000 persons are unemployed, what will be the number when the present demand has ceased? When the Acting Treasurer prophesied that things will improve, did he consider all the circumstances ? Had he forgotten that the demand for labour by. the primary industries is now at its maximum, and in a month or two will begin to ease; by the end of January it will have ceased, aud for two or three months until canecutting and. shearing commence, there will be little or no demand. AgainI come back to the only remedy that is offereda reduction of wages and the standard of living. This the people have deliberately rejected-in my opinion, rightly, because if we look around the world we see nations under every conceivable form of government, and in varying circumstances labouring under conditions analagous to those of Australia. We see abundant wealth on one hand, and unemployment and distress on the other. That anomaly exists hi countries where coloured labour is employed, in lands devoted primarily to agriculture, and iu highly industrialized countries like Great. Britain. exception is France, which has no unemployment, and has to import labour to make good the shortage. It appears 'to mo that those who suggest that the remedy for the ills from which we now suffer is a reduction of wages do not appreciate economic facts. We were adjured by the Leader of the Opposition to look at economic facts. Let us do so. One to which I have already directed attention is that the world generally was never so rich as it is to-day in all forms of real wealth. In proof of that 1 refer honourable members to a ""Memorandum on Production and Trade"" for the years :l!)23 to 1928-29, which has been compiled hy the economic section of the League of 'Nations and the London Times summary of which was reprinted in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 7th. OctoberThe memorandum reveals some remarkable increases in output that offer a ready explanation of the-fall in prices. The rate of increase of population was greatest in South America, aiid so, too, was the rate of growth in the output of raw material, and in international irade . . . World producton of foodstuffs and raw material increased at a very much higher rate than population. In 1928 it was estimated to have been 25 per eent. higher than before the war, and about 8 per cent, higher than in 102C . . . The memorandum offers a natural explanation of the fall in the prices of commodities, namely, an increased supply. In terms of real wealth the World is better off than it was during the war, and early post-war years, when prices were high, because commodities were scarce. Short-sighted producers were doubtless happier iu tlie period of scarcity and high prices. That the abnormal experience of the war caused them to lose their proper perspective is obvious from the many efforts-al l of which have proved to be in vain-to curtail production in order to check the f a l l in prices, gold delegation of the financial committee and, if possible, bring about a rise. I commend this to some of my friends who look out ou the world through the glasses of half a century ago, and have not adjusted their mental outlook to the world of to-day, who say that the remedy for our present evils is to reduce the 'cost if r . Hughes. of production in order that we may produce more goods at lower prices. We are informed by the highest authority, one entirely free from all suspicion of prejudice, that the world is suffering to-day, The one not from too little, but from too much wealth. Production has overtaken supply, and the remedy, so far from being that suggested by my friends here, that we should produce more goods, is to do one of two things-produc e less wealth, or increase consumption power. What these gentlemen who talk about reducing wages fail to understand is that neither labour nor capital creates wealth. Wealth is anything that has value, and the only thing that can give value is demand. If there is no demand there is no value, and naturally, if the demand for an article decreases, its value drops. It has been recognized by some of the greatest entrepreneurs in the world-by Henry Ford and others--that the most effective way of stimulating industry is to increase, not to lower, wages. One of the most stupid remedies proposed for the present depression is to decrease the demand for goods by diminishing the spending power of the people. What is the Government going to do about this matter? I am quite sure that it is giving it very careful consideration, but I am not certain that it will arrive at a conclusion in time to save this country. It must have occurred to the Ministry as at least curious that while there is so much wealth in the world there should be so much trade depression and unemployment. There is a superabundance of goods, yet trade is depressed and men unemployed because these goods cannot be exchanged. It is only natural that some people are convinced that the problem has some relation to the currency. I shall read for the benefit of honourable members an extract from the report of the of the League of Nations, of which I believe, but am not sure, Sir Otto Niemeyer was a member. I quote from the Economist of the 27 th September last. Beferring to the gold reserve in its relation to currency, this journal states: But the minimum reserves which are -required by law to-day are to a large extent the outcome, not of these considerations, but of past traditions, of convention, and habit, of the natural fear which each individual legislature has that a departure from general pracis inadequate for the amount of wealth tice may impair confidence i u the currency. The minimum is largely conventional, and a considerable economy could quite certainly be accomplished were the current accepted minima reduced. We believe this could be done without in any way weakening tbe general credit structure. I commend that statement because of the impeccable respectability of the authority which I quote--the League of Nations. I turn again to another authority, perhaps even more respectable than the League of Nations-the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. None will suspect it of any of those wild and mad ideas that float through tlie minds of ill-balanced persons. This chamber has been greatly disturbed because the cotton industry of Great Britain is in a sad way to-day. It has resorted to those remedies in which the Leader of the Opposition so devoutly believes; it has reduced wages, and has reduced the cost of production. Yet trade is still bad. The directors of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce think that it is ""unlikely that the statement w ill be questioned that the restoration of the gold standard and the bringing of the pound sterling to its pre-war level of gold value have created numerous difficulties of ' t h e gravest character in British industry."" They go on to sayIn the circumstances, the board earnestly inquests the Government to instruct the ""ATa-cMillan Committee to report at once as a matter of urgency on their findings. Further, the board urges the Government to take action on the monetary question without delay, and with the guiding principle that the well-being -Of British industry is of more vital importance to the people of the country than any financial -consideration. Those opinions, placed in juxtaposition to the conditions that surround, not -only the people of this country, but the people of almost every part of the world, must surely create even in the most conservative mind some doubt as to whether the world is well governed, and whether we are adopting methods that -are compatible with the well-being of 'civilization. The -diif ectore of the Manchester 'Chamber of Commerce say, in effect, that wealth .cannot be exchanged without currency; that in those countries that have adopted the gold standard the amount of currency now being produced. What the League of Nations finance committee says is that the amount of gold, regulating as it does the amount of paper currency, is itself inadequate; but it also says that our fixed reserves are the outcome of convention, and that these may be reduced without any weakening of the structure of credit. This, it says, would bring about an increase of credit-of facilities for the exchange of goods. That is to say, it would stimulate trade and provide employment. The Manchester Chamber of Commerce considers that the restoration of the gold standard to the pre-war level in England has had most disastrous effects on British industry; that while it may have done something for the financial interests of England, it has brought distress and unemployment and threatened ruin to the people. I leave the matter here in order that honourable members may turn it over in their minds. There remains one other thing to be said, and to this I invite honourable members to give serious consideration. They know well that the prices of our primary products have fallen sadly. The farmers of this country, after years of adversity and struggle, have at last been blessed with a bounteous harvest, and yet they now find themselves confronted with a f a l l in g wheat market. A t the very moment when Australia is producing a record crop of wheat, prices have dropped to bedrock; they are the lowest ever known in this country. As we sell a great deal of this wheat, nine-tenths of our wool, and a great deal of other products overseas, it is of the utmost importance that we should endeavour to dispose of them in such a way as to get the maximum benefit of the trade. A t the present time we do not. As is well known, the level of prices in England has fallen some 20 or 30 per cent., while the level in Australia has remained practically steady. [Extension of time granted.] In consequence of -these differing price levels our exporters are at a very serious disadvantage. The Temedy for this state of affairs to which I direct attention is obvious. I quote the following opinion in this connection by Professor Ronald Walker., Acting Dean of the Faculty University:It is plain that we must either have higher exchange rates, to measure the difference between English and Australian prices, or we must get our prices down. This latter is widely believed to be the better plan. But that as possible enjoy its advantages. is quite wrong. Later, the professor observedThe reasonable thing to do is to postpone in dealing with them. ""While I entirely our efforts to return to the gold standard agree that the budget of the Government until the worse of the depression is over, and should be balanced, I do not for a moment until the decline in world prices has been checked. In the meantime our exchange rate think that it can be balanced by the proin London should be raised until it measures posals which the Government has subthe difference between the purchasing power mitted to us. Unless .something else ii» of the English and the Australian pounds. done we shall be called together again Then, if English prices continue to fall, it should be possible to avoid deflation by raisat. a later date to deal with a situation ing the exchange rates so that they* again much worse even from the point of view measure the difference between the two price of the Government than that which levels. If English prices rise the exchange now' confronts us. rates should be lowered accordingly. The effect of this policy ought to be obvious. It would remove many of the disadvantages that now hamper our exporters of primary products. It would give Australian advantage on British and world markets. Assuming that the difference in Australian and British price levels is 30 per cent., then the exchange rate should be raised so that £100 in Australia would be worth £70 in Great Britain. If that wore done it would follow that if an Australian exporter sold goods worth £100 in Australia for £70 in London, he would get a return worth £100 in Australia. In effect, the producer would get £100 of value in Australia for goods worth £100 here, and for the produce he sold in Australia he would, of course, receive Australian price levels, which would be 30 per cent, higher than British price leveU. policy would obviously give the buyer in England a good reason for purchasing Australian butter. would not entirely remove our disabilities. It would not, of course, remove the consequences of a fall in world prices iu a particular commodity, but it would go a long way towards doing so. Above all else, it would enable us to maintain our standard, of living without regard to the world-wide conditions and financial storms that raged outside. The adoption Mr Hughes. of Economics, Sydney of this policy would most speedily relieve the present position in Australia.

It is high time that the Gdvernment gave the primary producers of this country, and all those who have to transact business overseas, the full benefit of the exchanges. As things are now primary producers are greatly handicapped. If the Acting Prime Minister has no means at his command of giving effect to this policy he should, without a moment's delay, ask for whatever power is necessary. At present we are not getting the full advantage of the exchanges. Steps should be immediately The adoption of this taken which will ensure us doing so.

I cordially thank the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) for his speech, with a great deal of which I heartily agree. I do not desire my remarks to-night to hurt the feelings of auy honourable member; but I want to apjieal to all sections of the House to coment on behalf of the Friendly Societies operate with the object of overcoming the crisis facing Australia, which to me is, in some ways, worse than the crisis which followed the declaration of the war. During the war years there was uo unemployment in Australia. As the right honourable member for North Sydney has said, this country is to-day abounding in riches. God has not forgotten us. He has been bountiful to us in the extreme. Yet 20 per cent, of our workers are out of employment, and men, women and children are without sufficient food or proper shelter. I am not content with what the Government has done to meet the situation, though I know that it has its feet tangled in a web of difficulties woven by the previous Govern-, ment. We cannot, however, go to the people and say that we have carried out our platform. I shall offer my criticisms of the policy He will be hit severely by the taxation of the Government in the first part of my speech. I regret to notice that nine more sales tax bills are to be placed before us. In my 41 years of experience of public life I have never before known it to be necessary to introduce 27 bills to give effect to one taxation proposal, and that one the most abominable of which I have any knowledge. The sales tax has caused more trouble to business people and the comm'unity generally than any other taxation principle that we have applied in Australia. I am told that even if traders arid 50 per cent, to the selling price of their goods, on the plea that it is to meet the sales tax, no steps can be taken to force them to disgorge. The sales tax was intended to be only 2-£ per cent., or 6d. in the f l ; but cases have been brought tinder my notice of as much as 10s. in the £1 having been added to the prices of goods on account of it. If the Government had put into effect 27 planks of the Labour platform instead of passing that number of sales tax bills, it would have done something to be prouct of; but it cannot be proud of having introduced the sales tax into Australia. It is deplorable that this tax should be imposed upon medicines dispensed in friendly societies' dispensaries and elsewhere. If the Government would withdraw the sales tax I should be the first to congratulate it. I wrote to the GovernDispensary, urging that it be exempted from the sales tax, and I must certainly thank the Government for the speed with which it replied. But what consolation did the contents of its letter give to the hundreds of individuals who make use of that huge dispensary in Carlton, one of the most thickly populated suburbs of Melbourne. [Quorum formed.] AVith regard to the Government's taxation proposals, I hope that some alteration will be made in respect of the exemption placed on incomes from property. I should like the tax to start on incomes of £5 a week. Many men who have saved money and bought a cottage or two to provide for their old age find it extremely difficult, particularly if they have families, to exist on the rentals. I know of one medical man who saved sufficient to provide himself with an income of £225. proposals. Even in London, he would find it difficult to live on his income. However, I trust that there will be some alteration made in respect of the exemption. Much has been said about the watering of stocks by companies, particularly non-liability companies, which, instead of contributing to a reserve fund, oftentimes water their stocks in order to hide from the public, and, perhaps, from the Taxation Department, the fact that they are making huge profits. I take this opportunity to thank the firm of Joseph Palmer and Sons, of Sydney, which, for upwards of fifteen or twenty years, has supplied me with its monthly list of stocks. Any honourable member who cares to compare these lists will have no difficulty in ascertaining the change that has taken place in the purchasing power of the community.

To-day there is no boundary ro the kingdom of gold. MrE . C. Dyason. a very good writer Melbourne, ments, a book called The Economic (Jomequences Value Henry Strakosch, and containing an account of the sterilization of gold. This writer and many others have shown clearly that the amassing of gold by the United States of America and, to a lesser extent, by France and Great Britain, has been of no benefit to either of those countries, or tlie world at large. T was glad to hear the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) place humanity above the claim of gold. It is contended that we only want gold, but I shall prove the fallacy of that contention. I shall show that the value of the stocks of SouthA f r i c a , a country which has been able to export annually from £30,000,000 to £40,000,000 worth of gold over a period of years, is less than that of the stocks of New Zealand. The Acting Treasurer's financial statement contains this paragraphThe Budget speech contained a statement showing the approximate London market quotations of Australian, New Zealand, and South African securities from the l o t h January, 1929, up to the 7th July, 1930. last-mentioned date 5 per cent, stocks of relatively approximate dates of maturity, compared as follow:1 -£ Australia New Zealand South Africa .1 have here an official publication which shows that the exports from South Africa were, except for the year 1920, always f a r more than the imports, and yet her bonds are quoted on the London market at-1 per cent, less than those of New Zealand. Gold to the value of £40,000,000 has been exported each year from SouthA f r i c a for very many years, mostly to the Motherland. I mention these things because I wish to impress it on honourable members that the fact of a country being able to export large quantities of gold d.oes not necessarily imply that its bonds w ill stand highest on the market. According to figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, there were in circulation in Australia in 1925, £55,000,000 worth of notes. Five years later, in this and a financial expert in year of grace, 1930, thu value of nutes has issued, with comin circulation is only £44,000,000. That represents a contraction of the currency of Changes in the by £11,000,000. The law requires that of Gold, written by Sir the reserve of gold to notes shall be 25 per cent, and on that basis there could be no objection to having in circulation double the present value of notes. The value of gold held in the Commonwealth is just under £20,000,000. On this backing we should be able to have in circulation approximately £80,000,000 worth of notes. We have a stronger gold reserve in Australia for our note issue than, is held by any other country in the world as f a r as I can' learn. It may be necessary to except the United States of America, but I am not sure even of that. What a difference it would make to our present situation if the f u l l amount of currency were in circulation! Of course, it should not be wasted as money was wasted by previous Ministries. Governments in the past were too extravagant. This extra credit should be used to find work for willin g hands, so that the country would have a chance of regaining prosperity. I know of no honourable member on either side of the House who A t the desires that we should repudiate our debts. It is not dishonourable, however, to come to an arrangement with our creditors regarding payment. I have «. d. myself had to go to my bankers and ask .. . . S8 1.8 0 . . 100 3 9 that some such arrangement be made, or . . 99 3 9 to ask a mortgagee to extend the term of his mortgage, .and I have not felt that there has been anything dishonourable in it. I should like the Government to send a circular letter to the large bondholders, such as the Australian Mutua l Provident Society and other big insurance companies and financial institutions, making a courteous request that they indicate how many of the bonds they hold they would be prepared to renew. We must, of course, honour our obligations, but, to use the word of Bryan, the American, "" H u m a n it y shall not be crucified on a cross of gold "". Let the Government say to those who hold the bonds, and especially to those outside Australia, that if they want, gold they will be paid in gold so long as it is possible for us to give it. to them. Then let us tell, them that we grow wheat, wool and meat; we produce silver, copper and lead. Let us ask them how much of those products they want in order to discharge their debt. There is in the world £10,000,000,000 worth of gold, which is, to all intents and purposes, controlled by seven men in America and by five in Europe. It is not right that humanity should be made to suffer, as we are suffering, because those who lent us money demand gold for their bonds. I do not want to suggest tliat we should do anything which is not right, or which is not honourable. I may mention in this connection, however, what was done six years ago in Victoria by the then Premier, Sir William McPherson. ce.nservative Premiers and Treasurers Victoria has had. but I pay him this tribute: He raised to the menioiy of his wife one of the most splendid monuments to be seen in any capital of Australiaa School of .Domestic Economy. A t the time of which I speak, Victorian bonds paying 3 per cent, interest fell due for payment. Their value on the market is £.60, and rliey are held mostly by large investors, who desired that they should be paid on the due date. However, they were not paid, but were deferred indefinitely. I must, in justice to Sir William McPherson, point out that there was some clause in the bonds which permitted the Government to refrain from paying on the due date if it was inconvenient to do so, and that was taken f u l l advantage of. I mention this merely because so much was said about a suggestion that the bonds, which the Commonwealth Government has to meet this year, should be extended for a furthe r twelve months. I have here the combined annual report vided, however, that Czecho-Slovakia, at its of the World War Foreign Debts Comoption, mission. the American Government, consisted of as hereinabove provided after 15th June, 1943, experts who conducted a minute tion into the financial affairs of every da te. country that owed America money after the war.

The American Government had borrowed! money by means of what were described as Liberty bonds, paying 5 per cent, for it , and this money was lent to B r it a in . When the final debt adjustments weremade, the rate of interest charged GreatB r it a in was 3 per cent, for ten years and 3-J per cent thereafter, and arrangements were made by which the whole debt would be paid off in 62 years. When Sir Otto Niemeyer was here I communicated with him through the press, and informed him that, in my opinion, Australia was justified in asking from England the same sort of treatment as England received from America. Sir He was one of the most Otto Niemeyer took a different view, but, as a courteous gentleman, he answered my letter. D u r in g the war England's request was "" Give us men to fight."" She, in her large heartedness, would have been w ill ing to take, at her own expense, every soldier Australia could send. Australia decided to pay everything herself, and she did. Much of the money which we now owe to England was advanced to finance our share of the war, and I consider that we should he treated as generously as she was treated by America. I , as the son of fin English mother, loving the country from which she came, believe that I am perfectly justified in making that request. The arrangement entered into between America and Czecho-Slovakia, was as f o llows :In order to provide for tlie payment of the indebtedness thus to be funded Czecho-Slovakia will issue to tbe United States at par bonds of Czecho-Slovakia in tbe aggregate principal amount of 185,071,023.07, dollars, dated 15th June, 1925, and maturing serially on the several dates and in the amounts fixed in the following schedule . . .

The treatment meted out to various countries by the U rated States of America is to be commended, and should be followed by other countries unless the troubles of the world become so great that they come to the conclusion that it is best to forgive all debts. A keen observer of humanity, a wide reader, and a great traveller, said to me on one occasion, "" Do you know my explanation of the reason why America would not forgive all her debts when such a course was first suggested "" ? .1 replied, "" I should like to know."" He said, "" In my opinion, if all the war debts of the world were forgiven by each of the nations it would be such a splendid example that it might be carried into private life, and the six years which is now the statutory period within which a debt may be sued for might be shortened to one year."" I give that for what it is worth; it struck me that there was something in it. Let me give a few examples of extrava* the Naval College from Jervis Bay. In gance. I believe that the best thing that Italy, similar cadets cost the country £50 could be done with Australia House, a year, while in France the amount is which has cost over £2,000,000, would less than that. be to sell it.

I will say this of the Government of which the honourable member for Warringah was a follower, that on no occasion while its leader was absent from Australia was Parliament called together or his deputy allowed to lead this House. Mr A&OHDAXX PARKHXLT, -There was no need. figures which show that the cost of training each cadet of the age of thirteen, fourteen or fifteen years at the Naval College totalled £30 a week. Each lad had on the average two and a half professors, teachers, &c, to look after him. He was the most costly naval trainee in the history of the world. In the Military College at Duntrooni t cost from £18 to £25 a week to teach each of those whose ages were from sixteen to nineteen years. There are 224 of these military cadets in the pay of the Commonwealth Government to-day, each of whom cost this country £5,000. Isi t any wonder that our schools, especially our secondary schools, have asked in vain for extensions and repairs?

212,Dr. Maloney,"That has nothing tothose who sit opposite, are perfectly convinced that we shall not get out of the slough of despond in which we now find ourselves by following old world methods of finance, with all their ruts and obstructions; that we must have something new, if necessary something strange. I anticipate that, even with good fortune, we shall have at least another year of misery. I fear that there w ill be two, and I should not be astonished if there were three. Let us see what these gentlemen say in reference to France, which has upset the calculations of every financial expert in the world. It is the only country where there is no unemployed. Its note issue was increased to the extent of millions of pounds. It has no misery in the sense that, we have it in Australia, and such as is to be found in the slums of the people in the big cities in England. These gentlemen say that a study of the economic factors in Francef r o m 1914 onwards is very interesting. They point out that the various phases of price level movements may be divided into six different periods, as follows:1. War. 1914-1919. a. World inflations. 1919-1920. :!. World deflation. 1920-1922. 4. Panic, 1.922-JuVy, 1926. 5. Confidence, July to December, 1926. (i. Stability of prico level and exchange, 1927 to date. They then go on to sayAnother fallacy is that a "" depreciated"" currency is injurious to a country, but the facts are just the opposite. While the currency of France was "" depreciating "" in terms of tlie currency of other countries during 1922-26, production was rising by leaps and hounds, viz., 1914, 100; 1922, 49; 1920, 122. In this fallacy the fault lies in using wrong words in economics, or, as E. J. Dulles says, ""The development of thought on the theory of the exchange is hampered by limited and ambiguous fallacy exploded by the experience of France is that "" bad money drives out good,"" meaning that the issuing of notes will cause gold to leave the country. But from 1927 to 1930, during the increase in the note issue, the gold holdings of the Bank of France increased from £40,000,000 to £340,000,000 (calculated at 124.21 francs to £1). I brought before caucus a suggestion that I have also placed before every honourable member of this House and every member of the Senate; it is that we should make use of our silver, and thus give assistance to our miners. know that the poor coal-miners cannot all be absorbed in their previous occupation. Au election of this Parliament took place shortly after the declaration of war. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company then stated that it would carry on at f u l l speed if it could manage to finance itself through the banks. I believe that it was Mr Baillieu who made the statement that he was very doubtful as to whether the banks would be able to finance the company. Knowing that nothing disturbs credit or brings trouble upon a community so much, as unemployment, I wrote to the Melbourne Age, on the 11th August, 1914, suggesting that the Commonwealth Government should take over all tlie minerals from the BrokenH ill mines at the English selling price before the outbreak of war. That attracted the attention of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, and Mr. Baillieu asked me if I would grant him an interview. I gladly did so. A f t e r two interviews he deputed me to wait upon Mr Andrew Fisher, who had become Prime Minister, and inform him that the whole of the BrokenH ill mines would accept 30 per cent, less than the pre-war selling price, which was 2s. an ounce. That brought silver down to Is. 4*d. per ounce. H a d Mr Fisher taken advantage .of the offer, £1,000,000 worth of Australian notes would have purchased £3,928,571 worth of silver coinage, less 5 per cent, for the cost of minting. RecentlyI wrote to the Commonwealth Ti-easury for certain information, and to my questions received the following replies from that splendid man of figures, MrH . J . Sheehan, Assistant Secretary1. In a view of standard spot silver being quoted on the London market ou the 1st inp h r as e o l o g y "" . . . Another stant at Is. 4d. per ounce, and as one ounce of silver mints into 5s. 6d. silver currency, what is the gross percentage of profits of minting silver at Is. 4d. per ounce? The answer is 312.5 per cent. 2. What amount of gross silver currency would be obtained by minting £1,000,000 worth of Australian silver at Is. 4d. per ounce paid for £1,000,000 of Australian notes? The answer is £4.125,000. A shilling contains only about 2Jd. worth of silver. If £1,000,000 worth of silver purchased with £1,000,000 worth of Australian notes would produce £4,125,000 Honourable members worth of silver currency, no undue inflation of the note issue would occur. Could there be a more simple method of helping the unemployed than the lending of money to the various State Governments at 2 per cent? If State Treasurers were given the option, they would infinitely prefer to borrow'from the Commonwealth £4,000,000 of silver currency at 2 per cent., rather than £1,000,000 worth of notes at 6 per cent., and I am certain that no worker would refuse to accept his wages in silver. If that policy were adopted silver-mining would boom, and employment would be found in the mines for the surplus miners from the gold-fields and coal-fields. Interest rates> also would be stabilized, for if the banks knew that any shire or municipality could borrow from the State for reproductive works silver currency at 2 per cent., the community would soon experience the benefit of lower rates of interest. Another suggestion I make is that Parliament should nationalize wheat, fixing the pi-ice at, say, 3s. per bushel, with the object of providing free bread over the counter to all citizens who need it. To-day the price of bread is twice as high as it should be. I commend to the attention of honourable members a very informative brochure entitled Bread., written by MrH . Langridge, a clear thinker and great worker. My friend, Senator Guthrie, has at considerable trouble prepared the following figures unci supplied them to me:Millen can buy wheat at Flour Is quoted at PolSrd }' « s u o t e d a t Bread at Is. per 1-pound loot. 48 bushels ot wheat at 3s.

The same quantity of wheat will yield 2,880 lb. of wholemeal flour which, with the addition of water and heat, will produce 4,032 lb. of bread. Yet the bakers charged per lb. more for wholemeal bread than for white bread. The machinery, including fine sieves, needed to produce white flour is very much more expensive than that used for gristing wholemeal flour, and, moreover, is more detrimental to the health of the mill-hands. If the miller buys his 48 bushels of wheat at 3s., the cost to him is £7 4s. Prom that he will produce and sell a ton of flour to the baker for £9 15s., and, in addition, will receive £2 10s. 7d. for the bran and pollard, or a total of £12 5s. 7d. The ton of white flour will produce 680 4-lb. loaves at 10d., representing £28 6s. Sd., or 1,008 4-lb loaves of wholemeal bread, which, at the same price per loaf would return £42. The bakers have been swindling the consumers by the extra charge of -Jd. per lb. for wholemeal bread. member connect these remarks with the financial statement? cheaper, unemployment will be relieved, and that is. one of the principal purposes of the amended budget. Knowing of the State bakery in F i j i , I wrote to the Governor for information about it, £ I. d. 0 3 0 and, in the course of his reply he stated 9 IS 0 that from 50 bushels of wheat, that is, 5 IS 0 3,000 lb. of flour, 4,200 lb. of bread is produced.
